WASHINGTON - The chief of the U.S. Selective Service System has proposed registering women for the military draft and requiring that young Americans regularly inform the government about whether they have training in niche specialties needed in the armed services.<br />
<br />
The proposal, which the agency's acting director Lewis Brodsky presented to senior Pentagon officials just before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, also seeks to extend the age of draft registration to 34, up from 25.<br />
 <br />

And look! he loves the french flag while riding on his french bus!<br />

Your illustrious President Bush decided to send troops to Iraq and because of this Iraqi POW's have been brutally beaten and assulted, humiliated, and murdered against the requirements established in the Geneva Convention agreements.<br />
<br />
This link should give you a good idea of those rules. (http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-discipline/pow-rules.htm) <br />
<br />
While he did not directly order the individuals in charge of this camp to committ these acts, he did create the circumstances which put them there and is responsible through that action.  I think you would agree that Adolph Hitler was responsible for the murder of a large number of Jewish people that were sent through his internment camps so consider that when you take this information into account.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As I said previously Bush's responsiblity lies in the fact that he created the circumstances that allowed this to occur.  Irregardless of whether Hitler ordered the Jews to die or not he is still responsible for their plight.  It's called a causal chain.  Look in to it.  <br />
<br />
For further information on why I'm right, here is a copy of the actual Third Genevea Convention ratification from 1949 taken from the UN's website:<br />

Once is a bad apple. 1000 times is a culture of abuse. And this isn't the only place it was done. but hey maybe you missed the part where there were 3 high-level reports of abuses in Iraq. And nothing was done until these pics came out. Be assured, heads will roll and I don't have any doubts that Rummy will be center stage on that. Good fucking riddance. He's a sorry prick and a shitty military mind. <br />
<br />
<br />
To quote Sy Hersh from last night on O'Reilly Report...<br />
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,118955,00.html<br />
<br />
First of all, it's going to get much worse. This kind of stuff was much more widespread. I can tell you just from the phone calls I've had in the last 24 hours, even more, there are other photos out there. There are many more photos even inside that unit. There are videotapes of stuff that you wouldn't want to mention on national television that was done. There was a lot of problems. <br />
<br />
There was a special women's section. There were young boys in there. There were things done to young boys that were videotaped. It's much worse. And the Maj. Gen. Taguba was very tough about it. He said this place was riddled with violent, awful actions against prisoners.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is the shit Rush Limbaugh calls &quot;blowing off a little steam&quot;. Don't matter though, it's over, and we've lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kerry, when he got back from Nam said &quot;How can you ask someone to be the last person to die for a mistake?&quot; So.. pro-bushies, how can you ask our troops to die for Bush's mistake?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, like I have been saying, go ahead and vote kerry in. Wait and see how badly he screws everything up. Then you'll be begging for Bush to come back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm a dumbass? Who is the one saying it's Bush's fault that a few soldiers are disgusting pieces of shit who abuse Iraq POW's? Sorry, but Bush, as well as you, me, and everyone else are not responsible for the actions of a sole person. It is them, that person who makes their own decisions. Not Bush, not you, not me, not Saddam, not anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
The people responsbile for the mistreatment of Iraq POW's need to be punished in the worse way possible. It sickens me that American Soldeirs would do such a thing to Iraq POW's.<br />
<br />
But realize, American POW's held by Iraqi troops are probably being treated the same way if not worse...yet I don't see you in a uproar about that. Suppose it's one of those double standard things huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bush gets blamed for the mistreatment of both parties' PoW's.  <br />
<br />
Bush is not directly responsible for the actions of american GI's in Iraq - it's called chain of command; he's responsible for the people responsible for the people responsible for the people responsible for the people responsible for... them.  You can't expect the president to be dealing with the bottom of the chain of command directly.  That's like saying it's the CEO of a textile factory's problem when a seamstress pricks her finger.  Also note that alot of the stories of abuse relate to british soldiers.  <br />
<br />
As for women in the draft - good.  I'm sick of all the double standards.  Women, blacks, other minorities, etc. all want to be equal to the stereotypical &quot;baseline&quot; white christian male where it benefits them, but keep their protections elsewhere.  You can't have it both ways - either your &quot;fragile&quot; and need to be protected, and thus aren't equal in the workplace etc. or your not and you can do the same service for your country that your husband can.  Pick one.  On that note, fuck affirmative action too.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, brael said it best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, before someone accuses me of being sexist/otherwise prejudice, I'm certainly not.  Many of the people I respect the most are female, my closest friend in this world included.  I feel strongly that all people should be equal.  What I don't agree with is the double standards that do/would basically make it disadvantageous to be a white male.</div></div><hr />

Racist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why is it then, that when a member of a minority group applys to college, and that college uses a &quot;point&quot; system to rate applicants (many do), they receive points for being a member of that minority group?  White males get no such treatment, why should someone else?  Affirmative action is bullshit.  <br />
<br />
And racism... it goes both ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Slein brings up a great point.<br />
<br />
I am a white male. One of my best friends in the world in black. We graduated in the same class, with the exact same GPA (4.0). We both scored above 1500 on our SAT's. We both pretty much did the same extra circular activities outside of school.<br />
<br />
Yet when it came time to start looking for scholorships for college, I got shafted. Didn't get a single scholorship despite my hard efforts to do so. However my friend, based solely because he was a black male got I believe 2 big scholorships, that pretty muched funded his first two years in college.<br />
<br />
So explain to me how there are not double standards again? Trust me, college's are so shit scared about not accepting enough minorities, that they'll accept all of them it seems. Where as people like me, white males get shafted.<br />
<br />
Oh well, it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">less than 50 years since blacks became people in the eyes of the law, and you want to call it even? Sorry mate, no dice. <br />
So explain to me how there are not double standards again? <br />
There are. Also, life isn't fair. Does your poor conservative pussy have sand in it? And people say liberals are whiney. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But as a white male it's a hell of a lot more fair to you than to the average black person. If you don't see that, that's how fucking privledged you are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slien, i know i didn't see you compare a system of abuse all over Iraq to a seemstress pricking her finger? cause boy would you be a dumbass. lollers<br />
<br />
And as for the chain of command BS, it DID go up the chain. All the way to Rummy. And if Bush didn't know, WTF does that say about him and his staff? Why didn't he get those reports? Why didn't rummy tell him? This all came out on 60 minutes 2 so go read what the producer said - this is happening all over iraq, and much worse, and the &quot;chain of command&quot; knew. They delayed their story for 3 weeks at the request of the military until the pic's started leaking out. <br />
<br />
If your employee is fucking up, you have to take responsibility to fix it, right? <br />
<br />
<br />
You know what REALLY fucked? That people like you guys who are SO anti-clinton for getting a hummer don't say dick about what bush does. Not a fucking peep. <br />

<br />
This is the reason Affirmative action was put into place, all things aren't equal. <br />
<br />
Also, when it comes to Affirmative action, that is basically the ONLY time it's a disadvantage to be a White Male. I doubt you would even understand what it's like to be judged because of your genetic background. Us minorities live in that world everyday. To say Racism/Ignorance isn't as frequent in America, even in the common workplace, would mean a hell of a lot of denial. <br />
<br />
Don't really care if your best friends are minorities, you'll never understand our point of view unless you live it.<br />
<br />
I write this understanding my opinion won't be accepted with open arms, considering the majority of these boards are white. <br />
<br />
Just something in me is compelled to speak up when the angry white man says he is being screwed by the minorities when 75% of the time, it's just an excuse and is blind to see his own fault. <br />
<br />
I am not saying that white men that were &quot;screwed&quot; because of Affirmative Action were making excuses, just saying a large majority of them needed to find an excuse to secure their ego and it's a pity they have to play the &quot;Affirmative Action Card&quot;. <br />
<br />
Affirmative Action is still needed imho because the &quot;playing ground&quot; is no where near level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The thought of what American troops do to Iraqi POW's sickens me. I'm sure it would be very hard not to do anything. Just think if you were in their situation, and one of your friends died from them. The thought of 9/11 alone could make you furious when dealing with them. (I know they weren't the cause, duh.) I can promise a lot of people on this board would do something, there are to many rationalizations that you would think of.<br />
<br />
I would say as a whole the American POW's have it worse, because the Iraqi's have no POW code. Although I'm sure there has been many occurances like this one, where the POW's have been mistreated, and it has been kept hush hush. Its horrible on both sides, and its only going to get worse. Bush needs to find the problem and fix it, fast. It needs to be something big, so it will stop others from trying such a thing (although i bet we will see it again).<br />
<br />
On the topic of racism. I think our country is starting to become pro-black anti-white. I felt it as a kid, there were actually times when I wished I was black. Its still racism when you put a specific race above another. Yea, the african americans had it terrible for the last couple of hundred years. But that wasn't me pushing the slave train, why should I be punished?<br />
I see the use for such things, I still know people that are racist, I even have some racist tendancies I'm sure. But nothing extreme. I think there needs to be something there, because of how people still are but I think it should be delt with differently. Its a hard thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">When a more qualified person is denied schooling or a job to a less qualified person simply because of ethnic background theres a problem.  The entire concept of AA needs to be re-evaluated to not have race as the deciding factor, I can understand the main point behind it, some people can be just as qualified, work just as hard or harder, etc... and be denied because they haven't had the opportunity to develop those skills due to a lack of schooling, scholarships, and other reasons but what AA is doing recently is just creating another racist problem this time against white people (males specifically, but it does affect females to).  If a business hires only black people it's considered fair, or only asians, or only mexicans, but if you hire only whites it's suddenly bad?  AA had a place during the civil rights movement to help transistion from a prejudiced era to a non prejudiced one but now all it does is help to enforce prejudice but in a different sense.  Now it just needs to go, as it furthers the problem it's meant to solve.</div></div><hr />

in fact your guys down there in Iraq are Soldiers , <br />
some of those prisoniers maybe civilist , you see the difference ?<br />

if not , why the prisoners get guarded from armateurs ?<br />
those guys prolly saw a real prisoner the first time in her young life.<br />

Ahhh, but what has Bush done other then not create any jobs    for the American people and drive this country into a massive, massive debt.  But he did catch Saddam so I must give credit where credit is due, although I think he is damn lucky he found him.  If Bush goes into Iraq and does not find Saddam or any  weapons of mass destruction (which he has not) that would not have looked too good, or gone over well with the American people.  So now his dumb ass is gonna be re-elected into office just based on the fact that he found Saddam. <br />
<br />
Bush lowering the...rich people's...taxes may have been his biggest mistake ever, of course the rich people didn't think that they love him, less money that they have to fork over to the government.  Kerry, if elected to office, will not raise the taxes for the average joe, he will simply raise the rich people's taxes to where they were before, at least to my understanding of it.  And that tax money would add up, big time, taking out a good portion of Bush's debt.<br />

<br />
I'm getting tired of everyone bitching about George W. Bush. No one wants to realize just how great of a President he really is, and I really do not feel like typing out why he is, but I will try to nut shell it. People bitch about the war, and cry, wah wah wah. Look, back in the 1981 maybe 1982 I think, Saddam signed a treaty with the United Nations stating that Iraq must account for all military spending, and must freely, and willing partake in random inspections to ensure no Weapons of Mass destruction are being built. This treaty was signed by Saddam himself. Now since the treaties instituion Saddam has been nothing but resisant to everything the treaty stated, including showing documents of his miltary budget, and spending, as well as inspections. This kept up until George Bush Sr. got into office and said &quot;Fuck this asshole, he's a threat and we will take him out&quot; and so we did. After that a revised treaty was made, and this time it stated pretty much the same things, and some new regulations for Saddam and Iraq to follow but it also stated that if Saddam fails to comply with the rules and regulations set forth, then the United States and it's allies have full authorty to invade Iraq and forceful make it's leaders comply to the rules and regulations set forth. Saddam signed this. Bush signed it. Congress approved it, and all was well.<br />
<br />
For the next six years Saddam was compliant. He resisted yes, but was more compliant this time around. But still, he was not fully complying as he should have been. About a year later, everything went Cold. Saddam went back to being the sadistic fuck that he is, and refused to let comply with the treaty he signed at all. This was the year 2000, as Clinton was leaving office. Clinton being the worthless fuck that he was decided he didn't want to do anything and let Al Gore handle it when he got into office. OOPS! Bush Jr. won the election, so now he has to deal with it. Bush basically learned of what Saddam was doing, and said okay lets plan this out. First lets neogotiate with him before we jump into another war, but lets also plan for a war, should he not comply. For over a year the U.S. tried to get Saddam to comply but all Saddam did was tell them to fuck off. So we threatened war, and now Saddam is willing to comply to a point. Yes, weapon inspectors were let into Iraq, but what you probably don't know is they weren't allowed access to a god damn thing. 85% of the locations the U.S. wanted them to inspect they were not allowed access to. So Bush basically gave Saddam a 2 month ultamatium. Either comply with the sanctions, rules and regulations that you yourself agreed to when you signed this treaty, or in compliance with this treaty we will opt to use force, and forcefully make you comply. Well Saddam decided to tell us to fuck off again, and so we went to war. That's basically it.<br />
<br />
Next common complaint about George Bush: The economy. Oh boo fucking whoo. If you assholes knew anything, you'd know the reason the econmy went bad for a year or so there was not his fault. When Ronald Regan...yes RONALD REGEN. was in office he set up a lot of things with the economy in order for it to boom. I'm not a economist so I have no idea what exactly he did. But basically it takes about 5-7 years for it to fully kick in. Low and behold 5 years later the economy BOOMED. And I mean it boomed big time, and you have NO ONE to thank but Regan for that. And thankfully after Regen Bush Sr. was voted into office because all the things that Regen had done in office, Bush Sr. kept it up. But no, everyone gave Clinton credit because they have no clue about anything. The Last 3 years Clinton was in office he raised a lot of fixed taxes, with the intention of slowing down our ecnomy. And Clinton succeded because the last year was in office, the economy really started to fall. When Bush got into office, he saw this, so he setup things pretty much the same way Regen did. Now granted the economy slipped a lot in 2001, and 2002, but look at our economy now. It's very strong, and in about 4 more years you just wait and see, our economy will boom yet again, and guess what? You'll have George Bush Jr. to thank for that. But if you vote Kerry into office, he'll just screw up everything Bush is trying to do for our country; for the economy.<br />
<br />
All in all, if I wanted to vote, I'd vote for Bush. Simple as that. He is a great president. Certainly better then that fucktard John Kerry. You people go ahead and vote the tree humping douche bag into office...see what happens. I gurantee here and now you'll be BEGGING for Bush to come back when Kerry fucks up everything.</div></div><hr />

Here are a few of the &quot;assloads&quot; of Bushims for you reading pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;But the true strength of America is found in the hearts and souls of people like Travis, people who are willing to love their neighbor, just like they would like to love themselves.&quot; —George W. Bush, Springfield, Mo., Feb. 9, 2004<br />
<br />
&quot;In my judgment, when the United States says there will be serious consequences, and if there isn't serious consequences, it creates adverse consequences.&quot; —George W. Bush, Meet the Press, Feb. 8, 2004<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no such thing necessarily in a dictatorial regime of iron-clad absolutely solid evidence. The evidence I had was the best possible evidence that he had a weapon.&quot; —George W. Bush, Meet the Press, Feb. 8, 2004<br />
<br />
&quot;The goals for this country are peace in the world. And the goals for this country are a compassionate American for every single citizen. That compassion is found in the hearts and souls of the American citizens.&quot; —George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Dec. 19, 2002<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the American people — I hope the American —  I don't think, let me — I hope the American people trust me.&quot; —George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Dec. 18, 2002<br />
<br />
&quot;There's only one person who hugs the mothers and the widows, the wives and the kids upon the death of their loved one. Others hug but having committed the troops, I've got an additional responsibility to hug and that's me and I know what it's like.&quot; —George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Dec. 11, 2002.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know something about being a government. And you've got a good one.&quot; —George W. Bush, campaigning for Gov. Mike Huckabee, Bentonville, Ark., Nov. 4, 2002<br />
<br />
&quot;Any time we've got any kind of inkling that somebody is thinking about doing something to an American and something to our homeland, you've just got to know we're moving on it, to protect the United Nations Constitution, and at the same time, we're protecting you.&quot; —George W. Bush, Aberdeen, S.D., Oct. 31, 2002<br />
<br />
&quot;I was proud the other day when both Republicans and Democrats stood with me in the Rose Garden to announce their support for a clear statement of purpose: you disarm, or we will.&quot; —George W. Bush, speaking about Saddam Hussein, Manchester, N.H., Oct. 5, 2002</div></div><hr />

North Korea cannot even feed a small part of their population.  I would think they are little threat to the world.  <br />
<br />
Don't under estimate the lengths a people will go to when they are hungry and have nukes.  Most of Asia thought the Mongols were a bunch of malnourished pussies too, but our boy Ghengis busted shit up good. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
On Affirmative action:<br />
<br />
1) No, it's not a level playing field.  I can understand why you're saying what you're saying Brael, but until the average black or hispanic kid has the opportunity to grow up in a neighborhood where he doesn't have to dodge bullets and where it's not 90% more likely that he'll develop a drug habit, the playing field is not leveled.  The sad fact is that it may never be leveled.  We've got hundreds of years of diminished opportunity for minorities in this country, while at the same time our culture is in such a decline that many young people think it's admirable to be on welfare and milk the system while slinging lead because of imagined slights.  If we took three times our military budget and pumped it into education SOLELY for the bottom 10% of the poorest inner city and rural schools, we'd still be dealing with this problem 100 years from now.  So no, you can't talk about &quot;equal ability&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity&quot; because it isn't equal.  <br />
<br />
2) The interests of ensuring fair and equal opportunities regardless of race, color and religion not withstanding, yes, culturally Affirmative Action perpetuates outmoded ideas of entitlement.  My family didnt' even enter this country until after the civil war, and were Irish and Italian dirt farmers and factory workers until a generation ago.  My grandfather was a coal miner working 16 hour days for 5 dollars worth of company scrip a week (for those of you not familiar with the concept, the coal company would pay their miners in their own coinage which was redeemable only in the company store for merchandise and change (returned in U.S. legal tender) so that the money stayed within the company.  In an area which was notibly backward, it made it very difficult for any of the miners to provide a better life for their family, or to get out of the mine).  It's arguable that neither I nor my family has ever had anything to do with the oppression of minorities in this country, and I for one am not willing to accept personal responsibility for the actions of others in the past.  I will never accept the idea of slavery reparations.  However, I do recognize that today, I have a wealth of opportunities provided me that are not available to others simply because of the color of my skin and the success of my parents, both of whom also had that opportunity.  I recognize that when my irish immigrant relatives stepped off the boat, while they may not have personally stepped on any minority's rights, they did reap the benefit of being &quot;filthy Irish&quot; and &quot;lazy Dego's&quot; instead of the &quot;sub-human animals&quot; that many African-Americans were thought to be at the time.  So yes, I have a responsibility to ensure that every human being in this country (and to a degree, on this planet) is treated with the same basic respect and recieves the same opportunity to work and make a better life for himself or herself.  And if that means that I may not get that cooshy job because the company has a quota to fill, I'll be disappointed, but it's only fair.<br />
<br />
On resonsibility of the President and Commander in Chief of the United States:<br />
<br />
1) If it's not enough that he's shown himself repeatedly to not only be a poor orator but also a self-serving piece of shit (as all politicians are certainly wont to be), he has repeatedly failed to uphold the ideals that I personally hold most dear as &quot;American Ideals&quot;.  The idea that we're a nation of individuals who's rights are supreme and un-shadowed by the influence of government.  The idea that we each have the right to live as we wish and choose as we wish, not bound by strictures of religion or moral extremism.  The idea that we each have the right to opportunity and that through hard work and commitment we can make our own lives (as well as the lives of those around us) better.  The idea that justice is blind and true, and that innocence is presumed until disproved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The idea that we will protect the rights of other nations (as well as ourselves) against the tyranny of evil men, yet will not impose our own brand of tyranny while doing so.  He's a shit, plain and simple, and though Kerry might not be much better, at least he'll likely be a shit who doesn't do anything horrible (at the cost of not doing anything good either).<br />
<br />
2) If you want to talk about responsibility and Affirmative action and the Rights of people inside and outside this country, you have to be willing to apply the same even hand to everyone, in every situation, everywhere.  You can't say that Bush isn't responsible TO THE PEOPLE of the U.S. for the attrocities committed by &quot;a handful of sick soldiers&quot; under his command (regardless of how far down the chain they are).  You can't say that each of us isn't responsible in some way for what's going on in Iraq right now, and what has gone on before the war.  You can't say that we're not (all of us, world wide) responsible for the polution, disease, famine and oppression plaguing this planet.  We're all responsible for what happens on this rock, and when we die, and we kill off every trace of life on earth with us, it will be because of all of us every bit as much as the one nervous fuck who leaned on the big red button.  Everyone, including the &quot;illustrious&quot; UN and their angry little brother the EU likes to talk about &quot;Rights&quot; without understanding responsibility.  Just because you have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness doesn't mean that you're entitled to any of that.  It requires sacrifice and labor to make such a complicated system work.  It requires the putting down of petty notions regarding who stepped on what person or country or international organization's toes and a rolling up of collective sleeves to make things better.  While Capitalism and Democracy can be great systems of social organization, they're worthless unless each participant has a sense of responsibility to the whole, in order to keep the system viable.<br />

<br />
<br />
The Federal Reserve was established I believe in the 1920's, because at the time Banks were pretty corrupt and had no overseeing committee, and the government had zero control over banks. Thus the Federal Reserve was created to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
I believe the committee is made up of seven people, in which in this case Greenspan in this the chairman of.<br />
<br />
Basically they oversee everything that has to do with banks.  Interest rates, Loan rates, funding rates, pretty much everything. All the money in federal reserve, well that's their responsability.<br />

Bush is a terrible president. It is his business to know what is going on. He hired his cabinet to inform him and it is his job to make sure he is getting information from them. His actions (or lack of action or interest) have killed over 700 troops, sent our economy down the toilet and made the US and the world more vulernable to future terrorist attacks.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me tell you all a story. My best friend in this world is a big time Democrat, as oppose to me being a big time Repulician. We have spent countless hours debating politics, the world, the economy, the presidentcy, congress, you name it it's been debated heavily. <br />
<br />
I can recall a hell of a lot of times I have made my friend say &quot;You know what you're right...I was wrong.&quot; And I call recall a hell of a lot of times I had said to him &quot;Yo uknow what you're right, and I was totally wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
But there is the beauty of it. When two people come together and intelligently debate it's a great thing. Your opinion may not change, but your horizen on the opposing view will broaden, and you'll learn more about the opposing view.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bring all this up because my best friend is just one person. Him alone has made me learned more about the views a lot of you here share with him. But the thing is, all of you people here combined who have argued with me, don't even come close to how good of a debater my friend is. What I am trying to say is, my friend is basically more intelligent then all of you here put together.<br />
<br />
And finally, I'm done debating politics with you people. I think I finally learned just how stupid arguing over the internet really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Francosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Well, this explains in full detail the extent of the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspans influence on the economy:<br />
<br />
http://www.federalreserve.gov/pf/pf.htm<br />
<br />
Here is a dumbed down version if you don't feel like reading through hundreds of pages:<br />
<br />
http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/SpecialFed/AffectsEconomy.htm<br />
<br />
Basically the Federal Reserve sets the amount at which banks are charged for holding onto money.  The bank then makes the change to the rates they have on loans which changes the prices for consumers.  By making subtle changes to interest rates on the fiduciary level it will make prices go up or down which will in turn change supply and demand which can have drastic effects on the economy.<br />
<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Phoenix Connection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">&quot;Federal Reserve is controled by the government.<br />
<br />
Congress has many times told the federal reserve &quot;We want to do this this and this, so you need to do this this and this&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know what you are trying to say, but again you are wrong. Federal Reserve is controlled by the government. They are not their own indivudal branch that has no higher ranking power.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That was what I said. That is what I meant.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you are strong in your opinion, then I can easily counter it by saying the following:<br />
<br />
Well if the Federal Reserve is indeed the sole entity responsabily for the ecnoomy of the United States, then isn't it THEIR fault our ecnomy isn't as strong as it once was? I mean if it is their sole responsibilty of the U.S. ecnomy, how is it Bush's fault again?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not my opinion, but rather a question to ask you people if you actually think the federal reserve is not controlled by the government.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And that is basically what I was trying to say wasn't fran?</div></div><hr />

I bring all this up because my best friend is just one person. Him alone has made me learned more about the views a lot of you here share with him. But the thing is, all of you people here combined who have argued with me, don't even come close to how good of a debater my friend is. What I am trying to say is, my friend is basically more intelligent then all of you here put together.<br />
  <br />
<br />
I'm not busting on you, Phoenix, but you might want to sit back and listen to your friend more often.  If he's more intelligent than I and everyone else here combined, then you've got a hell of a long way to go before you can even begin to grasp the intricacies of some of the arguments presented in this thread.  But yes, I think it IS probably a good idea that you stop arguing on the internet. :)<br />
<br />
Now, before you get all defensive and cry foul because I poked a bit of fun at your grammar and spelling, re-read the threads with which you were arguing.  Note the tone, the way that they read.  You'll see that they're clear and concise, where as your responses are often not.  How you speak, how you write and how you answer accusations and arguments under fire often influence others' opinions of not only your intelligence but also the validity of your points.  If you're not able to argue calmly and rationally while maintaining your passion for the subject, you shouldn't be arguing. ;)</div></div><hr />

IF government DID control the FED's actions, it would be kinda stupid to ever have them[fed] raise interest rates, wouldn't it? <br />
<br />
Imaginary quote:<br />
<br />
Bush Sr.&quot;Hey, I don't want to get re-elected this year. Get Greenspan on the phone and tell him to raise interest rates.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Clinton.&quot;Hey, I would like to be re-elected this year. Get Greenspan on the phone and tell him to lower interest rates.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Majority Republican House. &quot;Fuck Clinton, tell Greenspan to to pick up interest rates.&quot;<br />

Now, you have to be extremely narrow-minded to not see the implications if the government DID control the FED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is my question for all of you:<br />
<br />
Lets say Kerry gets elected and becomes President. He gets into office, and just screws everything up, and makes everything worse then they were when Bush was in office. Will you be in as big of an uproar as you are now in regards to Bush?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now some of you will twist that around and say &quot;If he does a great job, WILL you shut up?&quot; If Kerry is elected (that's a big if) and if he actually does a good job (that's a even bigger if) then I will be the first one to come here and say &quot;kerry is doing a great job&quot;.<br />

That ends that.</div></div><hr />

You see, suggesting I kill myself will not solve the problem. That is the true warcry of an idiot. Instead of suggesting &quot;You know what you've proven nothing other then you are incapible of holding an intelligent thought in your head. My suggestion is that you leave this message board before you'll go crazy&quot; you immediately went to the suggestion of suicide.<br />
<br />
I will not &quot;Shut the fuck up&quot;, you want to know why. Like the rest of you I can voice my opinion, and my thoughts as loudly and proudly as I want, and there really isn't a thing you all can do about it. Insult me, call me names, tell me to kill myself all you want, but the fact is I'm not leaving.<br />
<br />
This is how we solve the problem: act like adults. We step back, and take a deep breath, and realize all of us are acting like a 5 year old child who had their candy taken away by another kid. Perhaps we all need to rethink our current stances. I think we can all get along, and coexsist without incident if we all just remember, our opinions, views, and ideals maybe differant, but there is one common bond we all share that brought all of us here, and that is our passion for EverQuest.<br />

By name calling I signified insulting someone based on their name (in this case, mine being Phoenix connection)  <br />
<br />
<br />
So name calling only counts when you use someones name in your insult?  You remind me of that kid who plays rock-paper-scissors and when his scissors are smashed by the rock he says something to the effect of &quot;Well, my scissors are made out of something that can't be smashed by a rock...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just admit that you are an ubertard who doesn't think before he speaks and go on with your life.  Away from here maybe because you are just making things worse for yourself by sticking around.  If you want to stay however, please feel welcome to do so.  Seeing your ass torn to pieces so regularly is very, very amusing...</div></div><hr />

Being surrounded by troglodytes constantly makes you slowly sink down to their pathetic level.</div></div><hr />

Will you ever STFU? Do yourself a favor, please, and walk away from this board like you suggested you might. Well basically, you asked the community if they wanted you gone...hmm.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you don't really come off as being as intelligent as you think you are. You don't think before you write anything out. You contradict yourself to your own demise. You whine about everybody picking on you, yet you keep up the stupidity. <br />
You probably should have left this board after your&quot;I'm so glad I finally came to this forum...&quot; (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21200)  gay-ass thread. <br />

Originally posted by Phoenix Connection I am a white male. One of my best friends in the world in black. We graduated in the same class, with the exact same GPA (4.0). We both scored above 1500 on our SAT's. We both pretty much did the same extra circular activities outside of school.<br />
<br />
Yet when it came time to start looking for scholorships for college, I got shafted. Didn't get a single scholorship despite my hard efforts to do so. However my friend, based solely because he was a black male got I believe 2 big scholorships, that pretty muched funded his first two years in college.<br />

Uhm, I don't think Affirmative Action fucked you over. You must have talked...<br />
Peace out.</div></div><hr />
