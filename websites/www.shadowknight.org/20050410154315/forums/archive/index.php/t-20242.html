<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya folks,<br />
<br />
I'm currently playing a shadowknight, lvl 37. Now I was thinking about making a second character on another account, so I can duo. <br />
My question is, what would be the best (or close to the best ;) ) partner for my sk. I read a lot of post of people grouping with shamans. Is that the prefered option?<br />
<br />
Thankful for any advice you can guys and girls can give. :) Thanks a lot in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lots of classes will work but the shammie is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman is one of the better because they can Slow, Heal you and still do DPS while getting mana back with Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies guys. :) Appreciate the help.<br />

<br />
No, they can't heal, but they can pacify, CC, and best of all, I always have kei now.  Slows are almost as good, and haste is better.  Shaman's buffs and heals go a long way though.<br />
<br />
Druid and cleric are next because of their great healing ability, but without slow, they lose a lot of efectiveness at 60+.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys will be your new best friend.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KereithisFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just recently got a second account and ended up with a young Shaman twink.  Been spending some time in the Warrens and about to head to CC, after that I should be able to group up with him and start going at it...<br />
<br />
I was wondering about the hotkeys that are used with a shaman- both for him and my SK main- anything would be helpful as I don't really have many macros even on my main...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman all the way to 65 and beyond.  SK/Shaman arguably the best 2-box combo there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My best hotkey is tash.  It's set up to stand, assist and cast.<br />
<br />
looks like this:<br />
/stand<br />
/assist Ramgar<br />
/pause 5<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
The /pause has to be 5, on /pause 4 I would tash myself 1 out of 5 times.<br />
<br />
You could do a similar key with Malo, or slow.<br />
<br />
Another useful macro is a double cast:<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 7<br />
/pause 10, /cast 8<br />
<br />
Note that /pause # needs to come first in a line for it to work.  Also keep in mind longer casting times, and spell recovery.</div></div><hr />
