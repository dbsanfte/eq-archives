<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nekrosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone can see human shadowknights being a messanger or death and destruction spreading fear and misery in the hearts of the frail and innocent?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask this is that many who make SKs see themselves as dark elves because of the race being pretty much born evil and seem to be the first race to be SKs.  Others see themselves as trolls or ogres who are big strong evil races who would rather crush something rather than ask it questions.  <br />
<br />
I. however, keep seeing human as shadowknights for a simple reason.  I have read some D&amp;D and fantasy novels and there is one person who sticks out as THE shadowknight, Lord Soth.  If anyone who doesnt know about him they should take time and read a couple books with him in it.  <br />
<br />
Maybe that's just me.  Wondering if anyone else out there can see humans being truly unholy harbingers of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wormbane Soulbanisher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is my main. 57 Sk, human. Lord Soth from the Dragonlance series is also pretty bad. But he's an UNDEAD now so I don't think that counts. And he was a good pally or sumtin before his fall.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gothmohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Better shadowknight examples would be Elric or even Darth Vader, Soth was just a paladin who messed up and got made into a ghost.<br />
<br />
Frickin' Paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baraxul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gothmohg, love the name, I have a warrior named Stamm ;)<br />
<br />
But anyway, I picked a human shadowknight because, well, humans seem a lot more knightly to me.  Dark elves and Erudites seemed to be the sly, intelligent ones, slippery and elusively employing the blade as well as their magic.  Iksar seemed to be harsh, callous fleshrippers, basking in the glory of pain and fear because they simply knew no other way.  Trolls and especially Ogres were more like thugs than soldiers, but the human... ah the human.  Perhaps it goes back to the D&amp;D days, when if I wanted to be a paladin I'd have to play a human (certain DMs would allow evil clerics/paladins and most rulebooks had evil counterparts to the holy spells, ie cause light wounds, putrify food/water, and Turn Holy), but there's something about the human that calls out to me.  Maybe that's because I can relate to them better :p<br />
<br />
Also, Qeynos rocks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since this idea is a purely role-play aspect of EQ, you can in fact create ANY reason that you want for being an SK. <br />
<br />
Someone could argue why a DE would &quot;make a better SK&quot; than a human, but I bet you could find just as many folks who could argue the point the other way around.<br />
<br />
The important thing is: what feels 'right' to YOU? Do YOU feel more &quot;shadowknightly&quot; being a human, or DE? It's really a matter of personal choice.<br />
<br />
Elric and surprisingly enough Vader both represent good ideas of 'variants' of a shadowknight. You can see most of the EQ SK qualities in both them. (Personally, I think the Elric series is one of the best-written fantasy series of all-time).  But, both of these villain-heroes are much different from each other... just like humans and DE's in EQ.  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rotwind Deathwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The role-play aspect of EQ is great, Humans own  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Reasons:<br />
1) I didn't have the foresight to see that iksar not being able to wear plate didnt matter after kunark<br />
<br />
2) Everyone, their mother, and their dog is a DE<br />
a. Large Races Piss me off<br />
b. Erudites worship CT, disliked more than bertoxx most of the time, and their starting spot is like the edge of the world (I started fresh! no porters or twinkage)<br />
c. nomes werent available<br />
<br />
3) Bertoxxulous owns you (they can worship innoruuk obviously, but who wants to be a wanna-be dark elf and live in FREEPORT of all god-forsaken places)<br />
<br />
4) Qeynos &gt; Your town<br />
<br />
5) Faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faeeldora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The story of my Human SK is, well linked to my first Character in EQ. a Human Cleric of Erollisi!<br />
<br />
I picked Inny cause I wanted to explore the city of Neriak and well it seemed the easiest way, but my Cleric grew up in Freeport and being good I thought hmm an evil twin and thus was born Faeeldora Skywatcher! The evil twin <br />
:cool: <br />
<br />
Though I found faction to be a great big PLUS! I spent a few hours showing Gnolls of Blackburrow the glory of Innoruuk and well not the Druids don't mind me so much!<br />
<br />
Faeeldora's motto:<br />
<br />
Hates all, tolerated by many!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From my travels, the best RP'ers I have ever met in the game were almost all human (mostly all the people I met in Qeynos and abroad in the old world).<br />
People who like to roleplay often choose human (I have met some very good troll/ogre RPers too).<br />
<br />
I love being this cute, innocent blond girl SK tearing up my enemies, and people wonder &quot;Wow, how did SHE fall from grace?&quot;<br />
I also have an necro and a cleric that worship Bertoxx too.  I think bertoxx clerics are some of the rarest class/deity combos in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wanna know the best thing about being a human SK?<br />
Flayed Skin Armor.<br />
Yeah you heard me right. <br />
Nothin turns a head like a purple human with a skelly fear kiting monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Feast your eyes upon this, Moongarm!  Raawwrrr!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In Warcraft 3, Arthas looks nearly as cool as an Iksar SK in the cinematic where he goes to kill his father.  He is a SK-ey character.  Skull Kneepads, serrated sword with fog coming off of it, black leather gloves, spiked leggings, etc.<br />
<br />
I almost started a Human SK when I saw that.  So I think a great reason to be a Human SK is like others have said, roleplaying.<br />
<br />
*Note I made up for not starting a Human SK by joining a D&amp;D campaign and starting a Human Pally to turn into a Black Guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thats awesome Cerena!!!<br />
<br />
ahhh the memories of young moon slaughtering the ritualist in CT in my purple armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is the way I have looked at it:<br />
<br />
From a roleplay aspect anyway:<br />
<br />
DE make good shadowknights, they are the children of Innoruuk and are born into the darkness.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Ogres are evil by nature. They are big and strong and evil, though they may not fit the &quot;knight&quot; aspect like others would, they got the &quot;shadow&quot; part down.<br />
<br />
Humans and Erudites CHOOSE to be evil. Their races can (and mostly are) good classes, but these few decide for themselves to be evil, they don't start that way.<br />
<br />
That's what I like about my human. I wasn't evil because mommy and daddy were, it was MY decision to turn to the side of hatred.<br />
<br />
Even if I do look like a paladin..<br />
<br />
(it's another added bonus, sentient axe makes for some good times with crusty armor :)<br />
<br />
Jobober says, &quot;Where is my master? Oh, there you are, you holy crusader! /snicker&quot;<br />
<br />
Keffka says, &quot;Quiet you!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Argein Sicksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I chose the human cause I love to be a rebel :P Bloodsabres rebel against the dumb and blind rulership of Antonius, I loved the idea I'd do a part to turn the $($/§§ Karanas into a rotting hell of corpses, anyway just the name Anontius Bayle somehow always pissed me off :P<br />

Oh and I love diseases :P<br />
