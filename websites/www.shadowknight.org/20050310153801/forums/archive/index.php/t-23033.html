<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atraleto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've killed Olidan twice now and he hasn't dropped the Stormborn Phylatercy either time. I was wondering if this was a rare drop or if I'm bugged somehow. <br />
<br />
I have halied Ritald in Dulaks and he gave me the qeust but I killed Varns prepatch before I hailed Ritald was thinkin I may be bugged because of that. Any thoughts or help would be appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I killed Olidan postpatch and it dropped the Pylactery.<br />
<br />
Doesn't look bugged, sorry for you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rezrril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I killed Olidan last night, dragged 2 groups out to PoS and he was fairly easy, only thing i didnt like is the only thing he did drop was my piece, doesnt carry any loot for those people who came out to help me. No suprises, the hardest part about this was clearing the trash mobs around him and finding out they proc FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No need to clear the house; just split him from the others. Splits don't get any easier than that one there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rezrril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, something else i noticed....<br />
when Olidan was pulled, the other giants added, but when one of the other giants were pulled, olidan didnt add.... could be a glitch, didnt spend time to test it out, i just wanted to get my piece and get out of there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">killed him yesterday ..no loot at all =/<br />
<br />
anyone know respawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sinzarrett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killed him twice as well.  He dropped nothing.   :mad:   Wtf is up with this.   This happened on Zeb server.  Does the SK have to pull him himself or what.  Iv been having someone else pull him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nope, the sk doesn't have to pull. Just a string of bad luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Westa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Killed Olidan three times.  First two times there was nothing on him.  Got my drop on the third try.  Spwan time seems to be around an hour to hour and a half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same here.. killed Olidan 3 times... first two times he dropped nothing.. third time got my Stormborn Phylactery.<br />
<br />
It's random and it's the only loot on his loot table... so it's a 50/50 shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Killed Olidan 1/9/04.  He didnt drop it.<br />
<br />
Only hit for 900.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Djehuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I took him down with the help of my guild today (think we had 12-14). Top hit was 1600 and he went down pretty fast. He dropped it WOOT!</div></div><hr />
