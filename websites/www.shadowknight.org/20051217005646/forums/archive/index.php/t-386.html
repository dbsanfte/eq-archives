This pisses me off so much you cant imagine.  Blame SONY because your son is a fucked up psycho loser.  I hope that not only does this woman lose the lawsuit, but I hope it costs her so much she has to eat dirt and grass for the rest of her pathetic life.</div></div><hr />

basically the guy was very disturbed and played a lot of eq<br />
doesn't show any causal link so the action is extremely dubious<br />
it really does sound to me like either this woman or her lawyer's are chancing their arms on a big settlement from a big corporation<br />
i'd have thought that anti-WWF suit a while back was a relevant precedent, it got thrown out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Not surprised that it would happen. I heard sometimes about other RL problems like divorce, suicide, quit jobs, etc all cuz of EQ itself. That's pretty sad to see those type of people who have little control over their will to control their way of life in RL. It is true for drug users, potato couch, workaholic, etc. There are so many form of addicts in this world and its nothing that we can do about it. Cigerattes had warning labels attached to the packages but it didn't achieve to prevent people from smoking. Only thing that FINALLY reduced the use of cigerettes is cuz of large scale bans like building ban, can't smoke during work, etc. It promotes inconvience to smoke then people started to quit on that. Warning label had nothing to do with it. I dunno if adding warning label to EQ would help anything BUT to help Sony to prevent any further suits alone.</div></div><hr />

But hell this is america, home of the frivolous (sp?) lawsuit! *sigh* people who sue over stupid shit like this, or cause their coffee didn't come with a warning that dumping it in their lap would hurt, or any of the hundreds of other similar cases should all be rounded up and beaten soundly about the head if ya ask me</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be like suing a former employer for firing him, or a girlfriend that dumped him for being the impetus in his action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay first of all, I guess this is a good age check for alot of us gamers out here.  I am not sure how many people remember but when D&amp;D or later AD&amp;D came out their were alot of people who would do foolish if not pure retarted things that got themselves killed.  I still remember, one care of someone in their late teens, earily 20's who finished playing D&amp;D, took some ACID, and then saw a dragon flying after him.  We have to remember that parents look for a &quot;reason&quot; for why their child is doing what they want them to do.  The same thing happened with Heavy Metal, and certain bands.  &quot;Oh well my son listened to Ozzy, and in the song he was told to shoot himself.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I have always had a great hatered for people who would blame a game or music of the death of a person.  The said so person who killed themselves already had deeper problems going on.  The lawyers would just use an excuse of a major company to sue to get some money.  I am sorry for the death of a person in this world, but at 21 years old, this person should of had a bit of a better grib on reality.  I myself am 26 and hell I am on the game at 12+ hours plus a day at times on a raid or just in a group of friends doing exp.  But I know that it is only a game, and that I still have real life responsibilities that need to be taken care of, like a job, and a personal life outside the game.<br />
<br />
As for that other part, about the person who was up playing the game for 36 hours straight, did it ever dawn on someone that pershaps he was useing drugs to stay awake for that long.  Oh I don't know Coke or perhaps Crack to keep his mind awake so he could just keep playing the game for such a long period of time.  And if this person was duing coke or crack, then by good chance he was either doing Shrooms or perhaps some Acid, which was causing him to freak out, seeing some sort of EQ MOB chasing after him.<br />
<br />
Okay this was a bit more drawn out then it should have been, I just have very strong feelings about this issue.  If a persons life is not going well, and they decide to end their life, please go for the real reason of why they did it, and not try to blame a corperation for the person's mistakes.  The blame most likey lies in the friends and family of the person for not trying hard enough to help the person out in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Have a great day all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordraeth</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">parents hate the fact they their kid is messed up and it might possibly be their own fault. So, they point the finger. Just like they do with music and everything else.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's very sad that a kid walked into a school and shot a bunch of other kids. Though personally, I think it is the parents who are at fault. Not music, not tv, not movies, not violent games.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm sorry this guy killed himself. But it definately wasn't the fault of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anarcia</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm - was it EQ's fault or the fault of his mother for not noticing that he was playing EQ for 36 hours STRAIGHT.<br />
<br />
I think if someone listened to  Shirley Temple's Good Ship Lollipop for 36 hours straight they would go looney too.  I know, sue GOD for allowing humans to go 36 hours without sleep.  Sue COCA COLA for putting the caffeine in their soda which allowed him to stay awake past normal parameters.  Sue the electric company for supplying power to their house which allowed him to play for 36 hours straight.  But make sure that the mother does not get some psychologic testing to see if she knows crap about raising a kid.  That would make too much sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pheargore</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are right online I think.<br />
<br />
If a child does not see consitent boundries growing up, their ability to control urges  that reach over common boundries of moral law is never fully developed.  <br />
For instance, a lot of parents see their teen behaving irradically, anti-socially, or what not and say, &quot;Oh they just going through a phase, Teenagers, *sigh*&quot; When they should be up in there face everyday. Being a parent isn't a popularity contest with your child, it is the equivilent to rearing a wild lion as a lion yourself, Bite, Nip, Roar at them so they don't end up stupid and dead. <br />
<br />
This will cause the counter effect of them getting motivated to get their arse out of the house and into the work place as well. No motivation like running from a strict, but loving parent. Give them 2-3 years away from home and they'll be your best friend because of your strong parenting skills.<br />
<br />
IMHO<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatly, the Register's poor journalism shines once again.<br />
<br />
The original article here (http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp)  states that the mother had found a note with some names written on it, and they looked like PC names.  So she wanted to get some information from SOE in hopes of finding out something that lead to her sons death.  SOE of course said no, so she hired an attorney to try and force them to tell her what she wants to know.  All of this, if you were in her shoes, would be something that you do.<br />
<br />
The article then states it's the lawyer that wants Sony to put a warning label on the game, with visions of sugarplums dancing in his head. <br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, journalism today is nothing more then what soundbite you can clip ffor your headline, so you can sell more ad time.</div></div><hr />

Female reported AWOL skipping out on her deployment to play EQ . She has been spotted online using her handle by undercover agents but her whereabouts are unknown at this time. OSI is now investigating to see if they can find out what connection she is using and where its comming from thus finding out where she is hiding and spending all her &quot;time&quot;. Was reported that she was a good worker and always punctual, and that the military plans on taking strict actions against Sony and the individuals behind it for corruption their mission....... more to follow....<br />

Its losers like this that ruin the reputation of the game, and make mothers believe there child has an addiction.  Its guys like this that say Ozzie Ozbourne worships satan, and believe D&amp;D is a tool of the devil.  Its guys like this that help people belive they arent responsible for their actions, and in turn blame other people when they screw up their lives.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same could be said of Lexus, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Friends, Survivor Marqueses, Hersheys, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Phillip Morris, Diablo, Tolstoy, Anne Rice, Voltaire, Steven King, and DC or Marvel Comics.<br />
<br />
The idea is to create a product the public will use over and over and over again.  Why else do you think Hot Dogs come in packs of ten and buns in packs of eight?  Why is there triple fudge brownie cakes, and Burger King Whoppers?<br />
<br />
Did anyone sue Cabbage Patch™, or Tickle Me Elmo™ or Hula Hoop™ for creating a MUST HAVE craze?  Was Chubby Checker sued for causing back problems due to his dance hit THE TWIST?<br />
<br />
If only this kid had found something healthy to look at like PORN...LOL  But his mother probably blocked all the porn sites so he HAD to play EQ to keep his hands busy.  HA!</div></div><hr />

Oh no!  I enjoy a form of entertainment too much!  Wait, it's entertainment.. it's supposed to be entertaining!  The mother's just looking for an outlet to her guilt of feeling that she failed her son as a mother, and I can't really blame her.  Still, not much will come of this no doubt after the hype wears off the initial story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camal</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone seen those commercials where the kids are all saying how...,&quot; When I went out at night you asked who with, and where ,adn when to be home.&quot;...,&quot; &quot;You went through my room and took away my privacy.&quot; You asked about how things were at school. you got in my face about smoking and drugs.................................................Thanks Mom and Dad.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best commercial ever aired.  I think the people who support this commercial......the mom of the deceased probably being one of them need to practice what they preach. Now this is just my opinion not a fact. I just think the mom says she was this way, and reports so far show she was trying to get her son into a group home and get him psycological help and such....but still this commercial rings through. Whether he being an adult or not, His mom should of been asking these questions and getting involved in his life if she was &quot;trying&quot; so hard to get him in a group home.  This is where I am happy Verant/ Sony has the money to hire lawyers to Tear her apart and make HER UNDERSTAND!!!! You apparently weren't trying to hard if you didn't take charge and say hey,,,,,,you can't live on your own. There is a problem and I know it. YOU WILL LIVE IN THIS GROUP HOME OR I'LL PROVE IN COURT THAT YOU CAN&quot;T SURVIVE ON YOUR OWN. If he had all these other problems and paying EQ for 12 hours, how did this kid make any money to live on his own.  his mother was probably paying for his addiction, knew it, and to be a good mother kept paying for his lifestyle knowing it was bad.  <br />
<br />
It's called tough love, some people need it, and you knew he needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I *think*  from reading a difrent version of the article she is suing for the information that Sony has on the Chr. Guild, Logs, Friends list, even posibly RL information on those he knew in game.<br />
<br />
I do not think she is sueing for 50 million $ cause her kid killed him self. I see her as needing closure and wanting to know if anything pushed him over the edge. Game wife leaving him, guild break up ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frotty</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of this said, addiction is still addiction and there should be a warning put on the game because it is addict-ive, as proven by this kid and many many many others. Most reviews I've seen even mention things like &quot;If you never want to see so and so again, give this to them as a present.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course when you get as many people that play EQ doing anything else (collecting Magic Cards, AD&amp;D, Ozzy Ozzbourne's evil music *snx*, comic books, porn, spam, usenet, warez, cars, religion, books, television, politics, travel, crime...) you're going to find a few people get lost in the world of it and avoid other &quot;important&quot; things.<br />
<br />
The key point to the lawsuit will be that this isn't just an isolated incident and is not innocent or bizarre, either. When I read it I thought &quot;gee, I'm surprised it didn't happen earlier...&quot;<br />
<br />
You see, government needs economically healthy people to govern. If it senses there is to be an epidemic of people retreating to their bedrooms to rid of all spending except for the $9 or so a month needed to play this game, it is mos' def' a problem.<br />
<br />
The point about the mom's &quot;care&quot; is moot. This guy was 21. She had no control. To say the game caused him to kill himself is hamfisted and I guarantee that that is not to be the tact of the lawsuit. . . I think the proper thrust of their suit will be to say that he was already vulnerable and fell into EQ and couldn't get back out. <br />
<br />
Sure, maybe he &quot;didn't want to&quot; get back out, and it was &quot;his choice&quot; to stay. That isn't provable. <br />
<br />
It's easy to get in a huff over these articles, because they're obviously from outsiders (people who use their REAL names to write stuff) and they make a lot of sweeping generalizations as in &quot;you either go insane, quit, or die...&quot; umm, lady, didn't your son go insane, quit, then die? Didn't he do all three?<br />
<br />
Anyway, we feel like playing sometimes, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we curse that we have to work, sometimes we don't.<br />
<br />
There are lots of outside reasons why other forms of abuse are bad... alcoholism leads to abusiveness, drug use funds criminals... but the difference with this addiction is that it doesn't have physical and immediate ramifications with others. Sure, socially you can become a putz... but if you choose this game over your family, friends, job, etc. oh well.<br />
<br />
Come to me with the story of the person who lost everything and started stealing and killing for EQ, then I'll believe we've got a problem. . . too bad the gub'ment will think there's a prob waaay before then.<br />
<br />
Oh, how they'll be laughing about this when our brains are plugged into the computer and in a multi-dimensional commerce space for all of our existance.</div></div><hr />

Maybe im heartless but I would assume that there would have to be some type of char traits on this kid that would shout &quot;THEREPY&quot;. I am surprised the courts dont turn the tables on her for neglect and allowing her son to be so consumed by something that is not real. Jeez....<br />

here's another article on that same story (http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp) .<br />
<br />
&quot;We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly large so that they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning labels on,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to get them to act responsibly. They know this is an addictive game.&quot;<br />
<br />
this says to me that they are suing for a lot of money.  it seems to me that the rest of this gibberish they have spouted is just an attempt to get people to support their drive to get a bunch of money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
definitely have to agree with you... with someone as many problems as I have read on him, seems to me he was looking for a place to vent and to be someone he was happy with instead of himseslf... its sad really.<br />
<br />
my 2cp:<br />
My sympathies go out to the boy's family... too bad they are looking to make a quick buck on his death and not looking at themselves for the answers to his and their problems... I just hope Sony doesn't get bent over like a couple of dwarfs in some seedy bar in Ogguk... no telling with the way so many companies are getting ramrodded though with bogus claims of responsibility and things of that nature... someone definitely needs to smack the mom around and bring her into reality... to me her blaming EQ for her sons death is just the same as the boy that thought the NPCs were chasing him... neither of them knowing the difference between reality and fantasy.</div></div><hr />

The Mom looks like a sloth, and as a result of her deficiencies in mothering the boy, is most likely lashing out at Sony to try and justify her own faliure.<br />

You see, he played a shadowknight, hit 60th, and he just went on his first raid!  He remembers reading in the EQ manual that Shadowknights are (&quot;Warriors with some Necromancer skills to help them kill more efficiently..&quot;) then he gets to the raid and discovers his TRUE role as a Shadowknight..<br />

hehe I wasnt prone to boredom until after I started playing eq<br />
<br />
<br />
But on a serious note...Its important for everyone to ask themselves whether or not they can or cannot quit eq if they should need to...I think alot of people couldnt honestly say they could, so maybe a label isnt such a bad idea....However compairing eq to powdered and crack cocaine is absurd beyond stupidity, that guy needs a good twinked out SK IMO</div></div><hr />

After I steped away from it for a while, I strugled to remember why I ever played so much in the first place. But after basicly forcing myself to play for a few days.. I jumped right back in the saddle. <br />
<br />
Honestly, these days I think I spend more time on message boards than actualy playing the game. It just dosent hold the same value to me anymore. <br />
<br />
My RL fiance( interestingly enough, I met her on eq) and I were talking the other day, and she was saying that her mom called her up all freaked out saying she needed to stop playing EQ before she ended up dead. I guess she had saw the story on CNN or something. This led to a reasonably long discussion over this between her and I. <br />
<br />
Alot of people who play eq, to be honest, i think most is a better term... Have used eq at one time or another to forget about the troubles of their RL. This is no different than anything else really. Drinking, drug use, whatever.. but those either have warning lables, or are already illegal. <br />
<br />
I'm &quot;on the fence&quot; with the issue of EQ and a warning label. I really don't think video games need any kind of addictivness warning on them, because it should be everyones assumption that when you buy a product, that companies goal is to get you hooked into it. But I honestly believe EQ may be an exception to this rule. <br />
<br />
The game is commonly used as an escape from reality for very, very long periods of time. The most telling thing involved with it, is the fact that alot of times, people who play constantley, if they are forced to not play for a while, will be extremly upset at first, but then wonder why they ever did it so much in the first place. Just like drinking, smoking, etc.<br />
<br />
I think it's up to every adult to monitor themselves. I also believe its up  to every parent to monitor the childs activites if they are either (a) young, or a teenager. or (b) Older, but have emotional problems. Just because your child is 18 dosent mean you stop caring, and stop being a responsible parent. If your child has problems, no matter if they are 14 or 40, you as a parent should be commited to helping them deal with them. <br />
<br />
I honestly don't think a warning label would be nessecary of more parents took a more active intrest in their childs life, but with people being the way they are these days.. I don't think a warning label to &quot;remind&quot; parents of their responsibilities is that bad of an idea. <br />

Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

Game companies would gleefully volunteer to put warning labels on their games as a form of advertisement..<br />
<br />
Warning : Highly addictive game!  You'll wanna spend hours and hours playing it!  You may even want to quit your job over it!<br />

(what a great advertisement!  Espically if the surgeon general provides an offical warning..)</div></div><hr />
