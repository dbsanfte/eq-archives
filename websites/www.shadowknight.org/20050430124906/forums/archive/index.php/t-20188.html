<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">KK first off...i know the general answer is that if you want exp...group...<br />
<br />
but here is my situation...<br />
<br />
im a 65 sk...20 aas...casual player...raid with guild 3 nights a week...maybe 5 -6 hours of exp grouping each week beyond that...working on elemental flags...but not there yet...but id love to move my aas along a bit faster...<br />
<br />
family man so evenings beyond that are off limits...<br />
<br />
but i do have a flexible work enivornmnet...so i could leave eq up all day...and when i had a few min...kill something...then get back to work...and come back to eq in 5 10 30 min etc.<br />
<br />
so...ive searched forums....and not found what i was looking for...<br />
<br />
best solo exp...probably aggro kiting in hoha or tactics....but if each kill takes 10 min or so...thats too long while at work...<br />
<br />
besides...if im leaving it up all day at work..im likely to be unbuffed...no kei 9 virtue etc. as they will have worn off...<br />
<br />
fear kiting would be better....but limits level with 55 cap...<br />
<br />
have read suggestions for fear kiting in pod or pon...and those might work....<br />
<br />
but was also thinking about old world stuff....just as an example...<br />
<br />
alliewasuar in OOT...lvl 50 mob...can kill it in 2 min or so...unbuffed...no sweat...get a bit of aaexp...but not a lot...but since it is the highest level mob in zone...everythign else will leave me alone...and pet can guard and kill anythign stupid enough to attack between solo kills...<br />
<br />
of course...pain to get to OOT...and sometimes AW does not spawn but PH does and roams over island....and would be better exp for something closer to fear level cap...<br />
<br />
so...single, static spawn lvl 53-55..in an otherwise green zone...near a pok book...would be ideal...hehe<br />
<br />
again im looking for easy...not most exp....maybe 1% aa per kill if im lucky...if i got half an aa a day....while at work 8 to 10 hours a day...id be really happy...cuase thats another aa or 2 a week to move me along...<br />
<br />
so ...any ideas for me? <br />
<br />
-Ephyr<br />
65 SK, TP server<br />

and i have no magelo...told ya i was casual...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khementari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was fooling around in the deep a few weeks ago and found I could easily solo the mobs there for 1% AA. It is pretty safe for long afk's and these days that zone is a ghost town. It's easy to get to and just a hop away from PoK if you need some buffs. I haven't solo'd in veksar in a while but you may want to give that a shot too.<br />
<br />
Khem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velks lol?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kenshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">velks, AR, some stuff in ME, maybe some stuff in GE (might be a lil close for you thou). HoH does take around 9-10 min to solo, but only need PoH to do it... not sure without aa horse hehe always used it. maybe PoJ to, ony was ever there once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try LoY.  In Nadox or Torgiran Mines since they are reguarly empty.<br />
<br />
Just make sure the zone is empty, or don't sit by the zone out.  Should be easy to find a spot like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kralthan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another option for you might be fungus grove.  The exp isnt great, but there's pretty much no risk and possibly might get some loot too.<br />
<br />
Go over to where the caller quests are done, and see if the place is empty.  it is 95% of the time.  Make a pet, park it somewhere in that big empty cavern or the tunnel leading into it.  You'll need to have good faction with the red guys for this btw.  Now go back out, straight through the camp and up the hill.  There's some of the bandits up there.  easy to snare Fd split them, pull one back in the cave with your pet, and fear kite it.  Exp is about 1 AA% every kill or 2 kills, and it doesnt take too long to kill them.  Also might drop a shardel bandit ring for ya.  if that happens, run along the zonewall back to the bank, drop it in your shared bank slot, and go get another one.<br />
<br />
Edit - might be even faster to pet pull these, and elminate the time you take to split them, may have to try it next time I'm bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll second the deep.<br />
<br />
With a pet, I can snare pull the Thought Horrors, turn on attack and afk while I beat it down.<br />
<br />
Slow xp (about 1-2% per kill), but easy if you are afk off and on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cooker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plane of Justice. Just go past the 1st newbie square area and kill Gaelors of Justice. 1% aa per kill and they are pretty easy. Nothing should be KoS. PoJ is the safest and most convienent zone I can think of. Pet can sometimes agro a rat so I probably wouldn't make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well ya could do the 2 guards at entrance of HOH and pet kite em.  If thats allowed on your server.

There are a few mobs in Shar Vahl, no faction and worth 1 blue AA per kill.  Can easily be done without buffs, your pet and BoD.<br />
<br />
If you got questions send me a tell in game, on the Innoruuk server.</div></div><hr />

Not close to a book or anything but usually empty and safe kills. aggro kiting or tanking them is easy, most mobs are light blue - blue.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;If thats allowed on your server.&quot;<br />

just curious what you mean by that is pet kiting not allowed on certain servers :)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>behemothe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">for fear kiting and decent xp you are right with PoD and PoN.<br />
<br />
PoD you can sit at tsetse flies camp and fear kite between that rock and water. Can pull rats if ya want, doesn't need to be flies.<br />
<br />
PoN if you can get werewolf camp that is where you will get nice gems drops plus xp.  Safe fear kite area near trees.</div></div><hr />

1st four are easily doable then fd/invis and rest for repop<br />
1% per kill and can go thru all 4 easily</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just sit on the ledge next to where the mob that drops SCHW.  Takes maybe 10 min to clear all LB-B cons on that level.  You can single pull 'em with a debuff and just go crazy.  Takes 10 min for the level to repop giving you time to get some work done ;)</div></div><hr />

Since they dont actually &quot;Phaze&quot; you anymore, they are extremely gimp to fight. Should be able to Straight out tank them, and gain about 1% xp per kill with practically 0 downtime.<br />
<br />
The place is usually dead as well<br />

They gave you FD and HS for a reason, if it starts kicking your ass FD and wait for aggro to clear.<br />

Take the time to find the spots, they are worth more to you later on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks to those of you who contributed your ideas to my question...<br />
<br />
I have tried a few places...and have settled on POJ at this point...<br />
<br />
been doing the gaolers down on the second level....<br />
<br />
fully buffed after raid...i can do all 4 without a break then med/regen while working... after raid buffs wear off...2 or 3 depending then sit and regen/med<br />
<br />
best things about this spot...everythign is completely non aggro unless you currently have aggro...so i can sit and med with absolutely no worry about some idiot training me in what i think is a safe spot...also close to pot/pok so easy to get to after raids....and park myself so im gtg when i have a chance at work...also close for bank/merchants/buffs...<br />
<br />
worst part....cant use pet...cuase rats will aggro pet then you...and fear doesnt work on gaolers....even though they lvl 53 ( i think)...but if no pet...no real adds to worry about if you do them in rght order...<br />
<br />
also exp is ok....2ish ticks of aa per kill...with occassional diamonds and other loot...<br />
<br />
all in all not bad...and convenient and easy...which is what i wanted....<br />
<br />
now about to 35 aas.....<br />
<br />
thanks for the help folks...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Might try the basement mobs in PoJ( enforcers and punishers), drop pretty good loot and you can use your pet.  I can pretty much solo them nonstop with self buffs only but i also have FT15 and 230 AA's.  I would give it a try though the mobs arent very tough and you can kill them faster then the gaolers cause you can actually use your pet.  And theres more mobs to kill.<br />

Consider this BS. Maybe at 60, at 65 the most you get is 1% AA from the mobs i was able to duo there (Sk/CLr). I killed all of the doable ones, ruined may faction totally and havent found one worth the time.<br />

I tried to reach him as well ingame (found him neve online) and via PM but got no answer. Don't waste your time.</div></div><hr />

Wrong.  3% each, no faction hits, nothing assists them.  One of them is snarable, the other is not.  They have a decent ammount of hp, but they do not hit hard at all.  It's perfect for what he wants to do.<br />

If I remember to, i'll get you the names/locations later.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Assazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I found a nice safe spot in AC while solo farming the shard. The room that leads to the Jail area is a safe from wanders, and although you have to break the 2 guards in front of the gate, once this is done i was able to kill about 4 before the guards repoped. Repop time is 25 mins on the nose. I was getting 3%AA per kill, and was never in any danger so i could go afk for long periods of time. I sure do not have alot of hps/ac compared to most of you guys either.=P  4413hps/1378ac 41 AAs Ya might give it a look-see. <br />
<br />
PS. <br />
 Only took me 3 kills to get shard too!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Another spot in AC is the room up the stairs to the left (head right from zone in). It's full of undead mobs and I used to solo there right when AA's were introduced. It was good xp back then, haven't been there in a long time so can't say how it compares now. There are a few traps, but once you know them you are fine. Also bring a gate potion, if you hit the lava, it can be hard to get out.</div></div><hr />

Another good spot is The Hole.  There are several spots with no pathing/no aggro, and there are a few with PHs for the Ancient construct (drops Tome of Miragul for Oracle Robe/Tunic quest, worth about 30-40k these days).</div></div><hr />

Elder Animist Dumul is one of them, the other isn't listed on alla, so you'll have to wait till I can drag myself back to SV to see what his name is.<br />
<br />
btw, snare Dumul at 20% or he'll run and warp through the wall, no idea where he goes after that, but youve blown the spawn for awhile if he warps.</div></div><hr />
