<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been curious about this for a while now, since they messed w/ sk epic proc and it no longer will affect PC's in duels/pvp. Also the spells like vampiric curse and bond of death are not allowed to be used on PC's, nor the torrent spells, only used 1 or 2 of them an said not allowed on PC's so i assume all torrents not allowed to be used. Why bleeding not?!? whats the big deal if i throw a lifetap dot on a PC? or are the programmers just not too earger to get it working. Like i said, just curious if there is a reasoning to this at all, tnx in advance, have good day<br />

I can only assume it's because of shit like necros /dueling rangers, manatapping them, and using the extra mana to feed clerics during raids.<br />
<br />
Wish they'd just limit the spells that cause problems and leave the rest alone.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely nothing with a recourse works when you /d, or jump in an arena on a blue server.</div></div><hr />

But on a blue server, once you enter /duel mode you cannot cast spells on anyone not in /duel with you. So tapping the person you are dueling for mana and giving it to a cleric in your raid is not possible. Hell, you can't even get a port out of a zone if you are in /duel mode. Come to think of it, I don't even think a cleric outside of your duel could heal you. It sucks to PvP on a blue server, half our shit don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wah.  shut up.  go to a pvp server if you wanna pvp.  bluebie combat = gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye... there used to be no restrictions on who you could cast on, or who could cast on you while you were in /duel mode though.  I'm not sure which change came first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried a pvp server, i dont understand how you guys can do it, i made my pvp charector 2 years ago an is only lvl 27 atm an comp went down while back an his corpse rotted away, o well, but man that pvp is impossble, anytime everywhere i went i was killed for fun, this is sullon zek i tried. I give big props to anyone who is high lvl on sullon zek</div></div><hr />

i still picture a necro in a cleric group mindwracking a ranger.</div></div><hr />

Back when you could heal mobs too...</div></div><hr />

Rewind to early luclin and you see that picture quite clearly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back when mana was an issue.  You could have a group of 4 clerics, and 2 necros for your CH chain.<br />
<br />
Necros duel and chain Mind Wrack each other, the effect is not visible, but you would recieve the effect.  The reciever of  getting tapped would negate the mana loss by also recieving the  recourse effect. Basically endless mana for the party. <br />
<br />
That is why recourse effects do not work in a duel. I think they did this about a year after the release of Velious, but before PoP. you can try and find it in Casters realm, they have a list of all patch notes by date.<br />
<br />
In a blue duel, you can be affected by spells outside of the duel, such as buffs, but thier effects will not be visible untill you either exit the zone, or camp and relog in.  Thier effects will also not visibly affect you untill you do the same.  I learned this when PoSky still had no rent keys, and we had to use corpse summon to get people to bypass islands to get up to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">close lorddaeth..<br />
<br />
mindwrack actually does -not- remove mana from the target despite all indications to the contrary. so the necros basically have infinite mana to do it (if it worked) even though they more or less do anyway :P it's a battle to go oom on a maxft/mc3 sos raid buffed necro<br />
<br />
the obvious workaround is just drag along any mob with mana, keep it slowed/mezzed, then put a nec in cleric groups and mw away..pre bard pulse nerf it'd be like infinite mana basically..<br />
<br />
the stupid part is recourse never stacked so it wasn't really that big of a deal, 75 mana a tick vs 150 from a twitch which most necros can keep up pretty much any fight from 70 mana a tick self buffed, plus p9/sd/bard song, the occasional mod rod. it was basically a &quot;fuck you necros&quot; - though less and less encounters require twitching as people get better gear / mana pools / focuses etc<br />
<br />
recourse spells don't work because they are obviously overpowered. i mean my -250 lifetap on the necro doesn't land on people, god forbid we be allowed to try our elite -200 check lifetap over times. recourse spells are obviously the problem with pvp / duels..yep..definitely<br />
