<br />
Ok, first off I have not played EQ since Beta Phase 3 lol. Yes, it HAS been a while huh... Last time I played, half of the world wasn't even textured.... <br />
<br />
Well, I picked up the trilogy and I plan to start tonight or tomorrow. Already I know I want to be a SK. <br />
<br />
My question is where should one put my points? I haven't quite decided on a race yet. Perhaps Gnome or DE... Who knows.<br />
<br />
Can anyone guide me as to where points should be placed?<br />
<br />
I haven't even taken a look at servers yet.... just know I want to choose one close to me (EST).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
<br />
Sel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soulstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't be a gnome.  Everyone hates gnome SK's, even the gnome SK's themselves.<br />
<br />
Statwise, every 65 SK who didn't put all his points into stamina wishes he did.  The only race who shouldn't put all points in stamina is ogre.  Ogres should get agi up to 75 and put the rest in dex/int</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogre&gt;all<br />
<br />
When your an ogre, put 5 into agi and dex and 10 into int.  You won't regret it.  Ogres have enough stamina already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont take a gnome....<br />
<br />
for others, take the one you think looks coolest and make sure agi &gt;= 75 and sta way up. Int is nice too but you got gear for that :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow lets turn this into another repetitive anti gnome thread......do I sense peck envy?<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though pick a gnome just to annoy all these jaded inferior races that you will se spouting anti gnome propaganda. If you go gnome max out stamina. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>satyur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dont make a gnome...they shouldnt be sk's anyway.  Orgre is greater than all, honestly, and if i had made my char after the luclin new graphics were relesed i would prolly be an ogre.  ( I hated the ass scratching, and they looking like crap).  That being said I love my Dark elf.  I mistakingly put my start up points into str, but have managed to get my sta fairly high for a DE.  Gear makes a huge differance.  If you make a dark elf, put it all into stamina.  If you make an ogre you can put some points into int and agi, but HP are greater than.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scobax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Basically just make sure your Agi and Dex are at least 75 and then dump every thing into Sta.  Escentially you want at least 100 in STA (with or without gear) so then when your fatigue (sp) is low you do not loose stat attributes.   I didn't know this with my Ranger (Wood Elf) and his base sta is like 80 with an agi of 110 /em slaps himself.  I made an Iksar SK and if I remember right I put it all into Sta or Sta/Str to help with encumberence at low level.<br />
<br />
As far as starting Races are concerned, Pick the one you think looks the coolest, all SK races are pretty good, some arguablly better than others but for the most part Gear will fix many of the differences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wouldn't go so far as to say every 65 sk wishes he put all his pts into STA.  If you end up doing high end raiding INT is much harder to max than STA.  But as a general rule STA is pretty safe bet to be usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All joking aside choose whatever you feel best with. I play all shorts in EQ because i love to roleplay them and feel comfortable doing so.<br />
<br />
As said above gear makes up any differences in races eventually so its not that major of a factor as far as stat placement go's its really not a huge deal either but im sure the many people on this board will stear you in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

Agree  100%<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Then again level 65 is a far distance for some of us who don't play all the time.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomer Shadowknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What is up with all you gnome haters out there? It's obvious that the gnome is the best SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gnome punting aside, in terms of basic stats and abilities, I really think if I was going to make another shadowknight, I would have made an ogre. I also started a DE because I started out with pre-Luclin models and hated the look of the female ogres (being a female RL I play all female toons -- can't get into the guys, sorry) and wanted something evil yet stylist. But in terms of just raw power and effectiveness, I believe the ogre would be the strongest SK in the game.<br />
<br />
Hate to say it -- much as I love being a DE -- but it's true.<br />
<br />
...Zera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think it's funny that people make a 1 line gnome joke, followed by 4 lines of real information, then people say that it is just another anti-gnome thread.<br />
<br />
So where's my meaningful information? Uh..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Gnome Sta starts at 75, ogre's start at 127<br />
<br />
If a gnome puts all his points (20) into sta and the ogre puts his points somewhere else, the gnome will still be 30 points behind the ogre. 30 points of stamina is a lot of stamina.  <br />
<br />
Peck envy? Lol no, just trying to keep him from making a mistake. And before anyone says it, get a KEI and the lower INT wont make any difference at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally think Ogre makes a good race for SK starting out, since they have such high melee stats and you'll be meleeing till 9. I'd put 10 Int, 5 Agi, 5 Dex, or maybe 15 int and 5 dex. Humans arnt bad either, as they have a good balanced stat line. Maybe 10 sta, 10 int for humans. Bertoxx SKs have better newbie quests, although Freeport (where Innoruuk SKs start) is somewhat more welcome to SKs.<br />
<br />
As for gnomes: I dont hate gnomes, I just hate a lot of people who play gnomes. They give their SKs stupid names, role-play them like pansies, and think of themselves as cute and cuddly. We are Shadow Knights, we arnt supposed to be cute! And please, pick a serious name. <br />
<br />
Mr. Polite Jollypants of the Happy Little Hug Factory - if thats really you're name and guild, then you are a disgrace to all shadow knights. Its people like that who ruin EQ for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Going 100% by abilties and such I would pick gnome.  They can get the best self-haste with their tinkered armor, they are about on par with dark elves for stats (dark elves have higher int, gnomes have better physical stats), and the only real difference other than that is that gnomes have better faction (which really doesn't matter) and dark elves have ultravision.  Plus you won't get made fun of as much when being a Dark Elf.  I also think gnomes have a much better newbie zone, but with planes of power that really doesn't matter any more either...  *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aegon Targaryen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In order to pick the right race _FOR YOU_, you must decide what you priorities are.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo alot, consider the merits of the Troll or Iksar. Regen is super useful for reducing your downtime. If you play Troll, dump your points in Int, if you're a Iksar, dump your points in Sta.<br />
<br />
If you want to look super-cool, and have plenty of mana to get you out of tight spots, play a Dark Elf or an Erudite. For points, Stamina is the way to go.<br />
<br />
If you want to be the biggest, strongest, toughest tank you can get, play an Ogre. Get your agility to 75, dump the rest into Int.<br />
<br />
If you can't make up your mind, don't care about being unable to see in the dark until 22, and want to avoid faction problems, play a human.<br />
<br />
If you like being insulted, mocked and otherwise generally abused, play a gnome. I don't know what kind of shadowknights they make, but I do know they receive no end of crap.<br />
<br />
So much for common knowledge, let me expound upon my personal experience, after playing 4 races of shadowknights (Def, Hum, Trl, Iks).<br />
<br />
Humans: Don't. The ONLY bright side about being human is that the guards generally won't molest you, and you'll get marginally better prices for your loot from vendors. Being night blind is an annoyance that is only partly offset by monkeying with your gamma, and humans have the lowest carrying capacity of any shadowknight. Why is this? Because your walking speed is based on your agility, not your strength. This means you don't actually start moving slower due to being encumbered until your agility drops below 75. So a Dark elf who puts all his points in stamina can carry 100 stone of equipment before being slowed down, whereas a human who does the same can only carry 85. If you're not twinking, the situation gets worse, because the dark elf can wear lighter gear. This obviously stops being an issue once you grow out of your banded/bronze.<br />
<br />
Dark Elves: You look really cool. So do the 200 or so other Dark Elves out there, but that's okay, you still look cool. Early on, you can actually lug about a lot of gear, see above. Later on, your mana pool can come in handy once or twice, but as many folks will tell you, mana regen is not dependent on the size of your mana pool. Does this mean having a reserve isn't good? No, but it does mean that most of the time your larger pool just means you'll be sitting for longer periods of time. Use this time to look in the mirror more often. After all, you look really cool.<br />
<br />
Iksar: When I played my Iksar, you were shackled to Cabilis. No one else would buy from you, and this wound up being a big problem, because, if you're like me at all, you want to play with your friends, who are not all playing Iksar. With Luclin, Velious and PoP, this is a non-issue. When I played my Iksar, you couldn't wear plate. While this is still partly true, you can get stuff for your Iksar that both looks and acts just as good as plate. Regen, AC bonus, even foraging are great add-ons, and make Iksar one of my favorite races.<br />
<br />
Troll: Trolls have some pretty big drawbacks, but some pretty big advantages to go with them. Bad fire resist is defintely the worst, make sure you remember this when picking your hunting grounds. Almost as bad is your horrid faction. Most merchants won't have anything to do with you, and you can forget about running to the guards for help. Oh and being large can be a pain indoors, especially now that Neriak, with its ridiculous number of choke points, is your home city. Now, if you can cope with these drawbacks, the advantages are huge. Regen is a great bonus, especially if you like soloing, but even in ordinary group fights, being able to bandage, tap and regen quickly lets your clerics save mana for your other, smaller group-mates. Slam is another winner, vastly increasing your effectiveness using 2 handed weapons. Fear kiting with a good 2 hander and slam is very, very effective. Finally, don't forget that trolls start with extra agility, which means you can carry more before being slowed due to encumbrance. This allows a troll to carry almost as much gear as an Ogre before dropping speed.<br />
<br />
One last note: Many players will tell you that stats don't matter. At 60th level with raid buffs on, this is certainly true, but for most of your career, you can't rely on having everything maxxed to 255. Having more strength WILL make you do more damage. Having more stamina WILL give you more HPs. Having more intelligence WILL give you more mana, and make the accumulation of many skills faster. I personally think this makes trolls and ogres the best choice when picking your race, since their stats total up to so much more than their smaller brethren.</div></div><hr />
