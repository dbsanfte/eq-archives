<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fezzika</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to do the break in and do some killing in Hate with 10-12 people?  By possible I mean relatively safe, not &quot;yeah, possible....and a pig could possibly fly out of my butt&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
Same question goes for Fear.  Obviously I don't think you could get to the Amy knights with that force, but I dunno, I'm not a Fear expert. :)<br />
<br />
What kind of force would it take to get to the drakes?<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were all 60, Very skilled. Lots of AA each and they have done it.<br />
<br />
I wish so much i could have been there. IT was a blast listen to them in GC, so imagine in the action. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, I've been in Hate before with that many people...tho all were 55-60 and worked well together. <br />
<br />
I've never personally broken Fear with 12 or less, but while FDed during breakin wipes have seen a couple teams smaller than that break the plane and rescue us. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakeera</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate and Fear can be broken quite easily with two groups, levels 54 and up.  Any character lower than 54 will increase your chances of failure due to increased aggro radius.   Fear is a bit tougher to break than Hate, especially if you get bad luck and zone into a Fear with a see-invisible mob close by.  Otherwise, both planes are manageable by two solid groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regularly break PoF west wall with one group then have the rest of the guild zone in to PBAE our way to Cazic. Fastest way to get in really. Our guildleader regularly solo's PoF with his necro and takes in 1 group to EXP PoF with his monk. But as for the normal PoF break, I usually lead a single group West Wall break team in to clear the portal for the rest of the guild to join in.<br />
<br />
As for PoH, I've exp'd there with one group. I've killed Maestro with 10 people. I wouldn't say it's hard, at least not once you know the place. It's not about AA points. It's about level and skill, mainly. Knowing where to stand in PoH can be just as important as where to pull from and when. Well, as well as pathing crap. Hell, you can pull Maestro single to zone in once you've cleared the roamers, with a little help from your local Harmony caster...it's all in knowing what to do and how, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, definetely yes. It's doable, maybe you'll have to be slow and carefull but heh. Be sure to get an evac per group if you want to guarantee you a safe trip. Without, just be more carefull ;)<br />
<br />
That's a lot more fun than doing this with 40ppl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exp in fear's not bad, killing the DT golems with 12's kinda interesting though :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real fun comes when you do golems with 12.<br />
<br />
Ya haven't lived till you've done it with 13, only 1 being a cleric. Fright, Dread, Terror, and everything else except for Draco + CT (draco dead, didn't do CT), including Temple.<br />
<br />
That is a sight to behold, to say the least...really the only way these planes are fun anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course the real trick is getting to drake isle in PoA with only 12...I've done it with 15, I'm sure it could be done with 12 (well, I should say, we WOULD have got to drake isle but the bee key spawn crap got fux0red and no sirran spawned (thx other guild in zone))...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done Hate, fear, and growth all with 1 group before. it's relly not that hard. <br />
<br />
Honestly.. I found that exping in PoG generaly goes better than full scale raids do. It's not even about your gear. It's all about #1 56+ is a MUST. and being patient and smart as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have personally gone from Hate entrance to west wall north wall whatever the standard camp is with a 60 shaman, 60 monk, and me as a 55 monk with no problems at all, Hate is VERY doable with one solid group especially if you have a good puller.  Fear breaks can be a bit tougher because there tends to be more roamers but still doable with a good chanter and a bit of knowledge</div></div><hr />
