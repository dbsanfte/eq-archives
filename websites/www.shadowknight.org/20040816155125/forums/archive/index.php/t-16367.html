<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the DE Realm of Heroes quest? The guy in Neriak says I need a coin...  Got nothing under search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The coins are given out during some GM events as I understand it.  Then you take the coin to your respective home city and turn it in for your reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is correct sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What a crock of shit. If they aren't going to have any GM events anymore, they shouldn't have the NPC's still up and roaming about for the quest. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed Kizzesta, but they do seem to like pleasing the .5-1% population more than the greater sometime, not always though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmmm, I was PLing a friend of mine in DL with meh 56 Cleric, and saw a NEWB lvl 36 Dwarf Cleric with newbie armor on named Chickenbut the Aleslurper, Is it just me, Or has EQ bit the dust, Fer gud? Or lemme guess, He BOUGHT the name off of IGE =P?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Newbie armor isn't bad stuff, a lot of nontwinked new people wear that stuff into their 30's, maybe 40's if they can't get better. As for EQ biting it..I guess it was starting to bite it when I started playing a little after SoL came out (like 2 weeks), but that's my jaded opnion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol, True True...I played Reiny back then, Quit when I got her to 50, Then just like a year ago restarted, And made Ziggy =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes newbie armor isnt bad, But how in the heck does a 36 Cleric with no guild get the coin? It is just assinine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaryl LVeldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its a case of being in the right place at the right time.  He must have stumbled upon the event and been the first one to aid the guide and/or participate in the event.<br />
<br />
In darkness,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">True, But how the heck does he know whats goin on? I mean...He prolly never heard of a GM event before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't remember seeing the Troll NPC in Neriak after the relocation.<br />
<br />
Shows how much they are used, if they are at all anymore.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you make the connection between the title and the coin, turn in of the coin resulted in an item. <br />
<br />
Title just means he has a GM buddy, isn't even a guarantee he did a GM event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ranaz Asmogian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was on my main, wandering through Greater Faydark and who do I meet.. I sh*t you not. Fironia Vrie (I know I am spelling it wrong). She had many lower level people with her ( I was level 60 at the time) and she mentioned that whe was going to commune with Tunare and the Unicorn in Lesser Faydark. Being a Roleplayer at heart, I offered my assistance. Some of the more evil races started to role play themselves and we got into many verbal taunts with each other (was all in good fun). <br />
<br />
After meeting the unicorn she asked us all to return to see her father back in the city. We all walked there (so far no fighting no nothing I justy wanted to see what was going on) and he gave a big speech and brought me forward (with about 5 others) and gave us each a coin. Got a Thexian hoop when I turned it in to my guy. Other got items in line with their level/class.<br />
<br />
just my experience.</div></div><hr />
