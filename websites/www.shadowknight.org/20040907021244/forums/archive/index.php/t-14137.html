<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I had heard that the extra 50 or so stamina an ogre has over a gnome makes a large difference in an Sk's tanking ablility end game.  So on magelo I made a naked lvl 65 Gnome Sk with 95 base stamina, then I made a lvl 65 Ogre Sk with 147 stamina, the difference in Hp was less than 400, Now I don't think that would make a large difference end game unless I'm wrong.  So is magelos's formula messed up... or is people's judgements just inaccurate?<br />
<br />
Or.. could someone explain to me why Ogres make such better tanks than gnomes?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is exactly what i posted 3 posts down in response to someone else that thought &quot;Ogres were better tanks than Gnomes.&quot;  Since it's convient here, i'll quote it :)  Magelo is right:<br />
<br />
<br />
At level 65 with ND3 and PE AAs...I get 6 hps per STA point. An Ogre starts at 150 STA...an Erud at 75 STA...lets assume no points put into STA on creation:<br />
<br />
150 - 75 STA = 75 STA difference between the two.<br />
<br />
75 STA * 6hps/STA = 450hp difference at lvl 65 with those AAs AT THAT STAMINA (assuming neither has gotten any +STA items on their journey to lvl 65.)<br />
<br />
Tier 1 PoP mobs do 300 to 500 hits (in general) a hit. At level 30 I remember escaping trains by running to the zone-- escaping with 1 or 2 hps sometimes...lemme assure you, I haven't had a close call like that since then. Now it's: One bub of health and FD don't go off, you're dead.<br />
<br />
Sure, more HPs = GOD, I know...but, if any class has max STA...it's at the same HPs as a max STA Ogre. Hell, I don't have access to good gear at frickin' all...never do camps and such, and my STA isn't TOO bad. <br />
<br />
I've NEVER been turned from groups being a non-Ogre...matter of fact, at the time I play sometimes....everyone JUMPS on me when I put up LFG....I seem to be the only SK lfg at 3 or 4am  You'll NEVER find people excluding someone because they are a &quot;Human.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the end, Damage output or damage absorption doesn't differ between any race...it's all in the stats....and stat difference between starting stats for each race makes little difference in the high end. Remember you also have to factor in AAs and gear. If a Gnome SK has gear &gt; Ogre SK...then the Gnome is a better tank. If a gnome has better tanking AAs than the Ogre, the gnome is a better tank. <br />
<br />
Race means little...btw: view my sig for my race, I really do know<br />
<br />
Race means little especially in the high end game....all things factored in, it all depends on gear, not race.....as alot of ppl say: a HUMAN Warrior is credited as being the FIRST person to breach 10k HPs.</div></div><hr />
