<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weenie McMeenie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just a quick question and excuse me if this has been posted a billion times. tried search but being a bit of a board noob i didnt find anything.<br />
<br />
The way I play my sk is that i use spells alot, I dont have mana problems very often but I'm adding in considerable damage via my spells.<br />
<br />
I've been using a wmbs as main 2h weapon for its mellee damage but was wondering if, considering how much I cast spells, I should try for a higher delay weapon.  Am I mising lots of mellee damage by casting spells using wmbs as its quite fast? should I get a bigger hitter?<br />
<br />
just interested in your thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always felt that the ideal Knight weapon was around 40 in delay. That way we use our Innate ability to cast spells while the melee timer is ticking down to it's fullest ability. <br />
<br />
It's all about ups and downs, pretty much all the higher end PoP weapons are so fast that you end up loosing some dps one way or the other. Just how much though, I am not sure of :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im using the Greatstaff of the four winds (Dly 31)and lose about 1/3 of my Dps if i cant cast (like in the Eastern part of BoT)<br />
<br />
Dps about 110 with  Spells<br />
Dps about   80 w/o  Spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think anyone has ever parsed the real loss in dps while casting a lot.  Depends on a lot of factors.<br />
<br />
If you use a 2H with delay &gt; 32, all your spears and scythes should not make you lose melee dps.<br />
<br />
Using BoH and ToI, you will lose some damage, but still will come out ahead.<br />
<br />
Summary, although melee dps is lost, you can cast as much as you can and still come out ahead.</div></div><hr />
