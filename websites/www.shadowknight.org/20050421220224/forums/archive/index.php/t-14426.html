<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello to everyone... i have been reading these boards for some time now and i must say they are a vast amount of knowledge.<br />
<br />
But today i wanted to inquire about the greenish metal shard.<br />
<br />
i know that it drops in chardok and from what i have read..an apprentice herbalist drops the shard.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone knew the drop rate on the shard or if the apprentice herb spawned a lot or hardly at all.<br />
<br />
Also, what is the best way to pull the area that they pop at?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to solo pull the mobs around there?<br />
<br />
and can this be done with a single grp 55+?<br />
<br />
And help would be greatful...All i have left till i get my greenmist is this shard and the mirror from miss D. in HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A single group can easily to this, 55+.  Take a chanter for a crowd control, even though it's not really needed.  You can single pull with a little fd-shuffle without too much danger, but a couple adds will screw you up.  Take the chanter as the camp has the potential of being quite long, and eventually people start making mistakes.<br />
<br />
Single pulling and soloing... well, I've only SEEN it done one way, but that doesn't mean there aren't others.  65 Cleric on my server pharms Chardok by having non-Kos faction.  Aggro's his target and runs them up to the zone-in.  If he get's adds, he roots the target, zones, runs back down and rinse-repeats.  Takes quite a lot of work, but it's soloable and profitable with epic MQ's, I suppose.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's reasonable to say you could solo him or his PH's down there, unless you were 65 with a butt-load of AA's.  I'm 64 with 2 lvls of Unholy Touch, and I don't think I'd try it even if I had non-Kos faction.  Just too many potential adds.<br />
<br />
Spawn rate?  Well, he himself seems to spawn about once every couple hours of steady killing.  I've spent maybe 3 days total down at the camp (also only need Shard for my greenmist, but I'm not taking it too seriously), and I've killed him maybe 10-12 times.  I've also had my cleric friend kill him a number of times, only to be told him didn't drop it.<br />
<br />
There's supposedly a way to tell if he has the shard by what weapons he has equipped, but I haven't really been able to get a straight answer on that, so I'm beginning to think it's bunk.  Pretty sure if he's got a scythe equipped, then he doesn't have it.  But nothing equipped or a dagger equipped could mean he does.  <br />
<br />
The mobs down there are low 50's, cast a lot, and take a lot of killing.  However, it's doable for a 55+ group.<br />
<br />
Take a look at a map, you'll see as you come down from zone in there's a castle entrance with some guards.  To the side is a tunnel set up on the wall.  Clear the guards in the castle, and the first couple going up to zone out, and make sure everyone is Levitating.  Climb up the stalagmites in front of the castle and run over and into the tunnel.  Follow the map, fighting your way down this tunnel.  It'll lead you to the Herby Hut with only a few turns, but pay attention the first couple times you do it.  Wrong turn can put you in unhappy places of Chardok.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is find a necro w/o his epic and the two of you pool some friends.  Both your Greenmist item and his Mansi Herb for his epic drop in that area.  Take your necro and his friends along with yours and hit the spot.  Last time I went I had about four or five of my lvl 60-65 buds and hooked up with a necro and his four or five 60-65 friends as we were zoning in.  12 of us formed a raid and just smacked the hell outta the area without any trouble at all and joking around a lot.  Made some new friends outta that, and got the necro his herb.<br />

Pity the damn Apprentice didn't gimmie my Shard though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I finally ended up buying mine, but before that, I had gone on quite a few Necro Epic raids.  The Aprentice Herbalist isn't exactly a common spawn, so you'll have a bit of a camp.  In all the times I've been down that far, I've only seen him twice, and he didn't drop the shard either time.  Note though, that Chardok isn't widely hunted anymore except for epic pieces, so it may take quite some time to actually get a group together to go do it, especially if you're in a smaller guild or all of your necro's have their epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Em, I thought it was an Alchemist Acolyte that dropped the shard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're right, Kentsin.  Herbalist Apprentice is the one there are tons of, they just never drop anything but those scythes.  From the walkthroughs/checklist, Alchemist Acolyte is the one that drops the shard, he supposedly spawns by the water (as opposed to inside the shack) and is a rarer spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yer right.  Re-read my post, and I meant to say Acolyte and substituted Apprentice.  Sowwy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sugarlump_Plumpbutt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best thing to do is kill all the mobs down there anyway. I have seen shard drop several times as a warrior but not as an SK--thinking these things can tell when an SK is in the zone or something! :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, GL and good hunting!<br />
<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />
