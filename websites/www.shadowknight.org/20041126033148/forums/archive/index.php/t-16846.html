<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malphesian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I am new to this site.  I have read some of your posts, but not all.  I have waited until I hit 65 to start AA's and frankly have no clue as to how to use them (when) I get them.  Some of the stuff I read was using screen commands and talking about hot keys?  This is new to me.  Where do you read about using AA's and such or can any one give me a class?<br />
<br />
Also, I think it would be nice to know what spells you feel you use most at this level.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

By the way I thought it would be cool to see how an uber SK would look: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No aa's?  at all?  Is that possible?<br />
<br />
first 3 points go directly to run speed 3, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.<br />
<br />
Second 3 points are a choice between regen and metabolism.  pick whatever<br />
<br />
Next 12 points are, um...er..bah, use your aa's to upgrade whatever you feel you suck at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malphesian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't get on that often to play so I ws trying to get my level up firts to make me stronger and be able to go on upper level raids with my guild. But in that process I turned off my aa points, and the thing is when I read some of the discussions here they said things that made think.<br />
<br />
I guess I knew that all aa points where not pasive, but I never really knew how to use the non-passive ones?  SO this is another reason I asked for help. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply by the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only got one aa (Run1) prior to being 65. Best place to look is in the specific subject forums on the site. Also best place for specific questions, since the Arena tends to attract more show-off flaming and not simple info. This is actually meant to be the Class Balance forum, but don't sweat it the &quot;Suggestions&quot; title is a bit misleading.<br />
<br />
Get Run3 obviously, most people get Regen3 after that, don't see much reason why you wouldn't. I stuck a point in ToL1 and two points to get SCF1 for the eyecandy of crit heals and crit nukes. Just think about what you do most, for most folk that means tanking, so go after the hitpoint aa's and defensive aa's if that's you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ToL1 is more than just eye candy. 656hp heal at 61 from one lifetap cast when the cleric dies helps. Or if you have a pre-CH druid healing you. Sure, it happens like 2% of the time... but hey, it's saved my as twice in the week since I got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you get an activatable aa, the box to activate it appears in the aa selection screen when you select the skill.  Just drag it down to hotkeys to use.  To use the skill in a macro, check out the /doability list in the skills/spells forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malphesian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks, also is there a place that details what each aa does for the character and how to use them?  Like the improved harm touch or weither run 3 also speeds up your mount?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In general, as a SK, I'd say get to 51, do run3, then proceed directly to 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malphesian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the help so far, but since I have more questions and this is not the proper forum, I have started a new thread in the tactics section called &quot;do aa point stack&quot;  Please go to it and help on the progress of information.<br />

Thanks,<br />
