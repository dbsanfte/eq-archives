<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I have yet to see a spectral parchment drop or see Pact of Hate for sell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If anyone gets an extra copy on the Zeb server that you're just going to sell, could you let me know?  I'd be happy to buy it from you (at a reasonable price).<br />
<br />
There are a lot of other spells i need to get a hold of but that one I seem to miss the most.  I was never able to get a hold of deathly temptation either so when KEI goes i'm SOL fighting for agro (esp against shamans).<br />
<br />
A chance to buy it from you would be greatly appreciated, thanks.<br />

<br />
it's not just for agro :P  It's also for my DD spells and sometimes i use snare for damage as well.  Not to mention when solo'ing or when I have to use a lifetap spell to save my ass so the cleric's complete heal can go off ... not to mention keeping enough for FD.  Sometimes festering darkness has to be used for it's snare abilities and not agro.  <br />
<br />
It must be nice to be in such uber groups that all you have to do is hold agro and nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantyanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use mental corruption but prior to that i was having some trouble keeping my mana regen up enough to hold agro though i think at that time i was using cd+terrors for a gro and the terror were what was draining my mana...<br />
<br />
I use terrors as well at times.  I have to use that to pull at times to get agro when the mob may have to be mezzed.  It sucks mana.  Mental corruption doesn't keep up with me actually using my spells.  Mental corruption would work great if just casting CD but not the other higher level mana intensive spells. <br />
<br />
Ironic hate spells would suck so much mana.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I am pulling mobs i KNOW will be mezzed right away and not be tanked, I use Fear. Otherwise CD works just fine esp when the mobs run very fast and your hoping they dont catch you  :) <br />
<br />
Overall arrows are my favorite pull tool however as the range factor just cant be beat.<br />
<br />
Unless your using Festering, I cant see where your mana is going. In a normal tanking situation I use 2Xcd, 2Xfear, AoH, AoP on every mob (depending on lifespan of course) and never ever have mana issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Is this even without KEI?  just your own mana pool with perhaps mental corruption?<br />
<br />
i don't use fear unless i actually want to fear ... I don't know enough about which mobs resists and such and would rather not see it fleeing in the other way.  Especially in LDONs.  This is because I don't feel i have enough knowledge to properly use it yet.<br />
<br />
I also use DDs during some fights depending on if i need them or not.  Chain pulling that doesn't allow me to sit down and when I have no kei also hurts my mana pool. Lifetaps and Z bites uses a lot.  <br />
<br />
I also wasn't talking about just tanking.  Though when using full range of my spells solo'ing, i can oom with kei.  Once i sit down i fill up quickly, but i have to sit down for it.</div></div><hr />

You grouping with a lot of sub 60's that might cause your LDON mobs to be under 55?</div></div><hr />

the bazaar, your servers auction channel, or any of your server boards are a better place for buying/selling stuff than here.<br />
<br />
and for playing SK, some tips:<br />
<br />
use clinging darkness for agro with affliction haste 1. there's no faster more mana efficient way to gain hate, and it does snare the mobs enough so they  walk from 20-10% and stop moving at 10% hp. if you use festering or terrors for agro you'll either run out of mana or have the mobs ponging to others. with clinging you can cast and recast all day long without running oom.<br />
<br />
use mental corruption/mental horror. with high dex it provides you enough mana to maintain agro, zevfeer's, and aura of pain.<br />
<br />
fear will only fear mobs that are below level 55 (not much you will be fighting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My mana pools sucks, and always has sucked.<br />
<br />
If you are running out of mana, and you are MT, cut back on the dps spells.  The extra dps you can squeeze out by using our spears and dots eats a lot of mana, and as MT you should be worrying about holding aggro first, and dps second.<br />
<br />
Using just CD for aggro, and mental corruption for mana (no kei), you should be able to hold aggro indefinately, while still putting out some decent dps (you are using your pet, right?).  If you have a shammy in the group, then your dex should be well buffed, and mental corruption should be proccing fairly consistantly.<br />
<br />
If I am the only snarer in a group hunting mobs than run, I can maintain mana for a long while if I cut back on other spells.  I can Fester and spam CD for aggro without mana buffs for a pretty long time (long enough for a LDoN, at least).<br />
<br />
In a decent exp/LDoN group, there should be little to no reason to lifetap if your healers are even remotely competant.  Zevfeer's mana drain is negligible, as it is roughly 100 mana every minute (less if you have focus effects).  Spears aren't worth it unless you have mana to spare, which is clearly not the case.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are burning too much mana.  Pact of Hate is nice, but it probably isn't going to solve your mana issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One other thought. <br />
<br />
Have you tried checking in the bazaar to see if people are willing to MQ spectral parchments?  It's not guaranteed you'll get Pact of Hate, but its better than no chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Occasionally.  Plus i'm not that familar with the rules of db/lb mobs.  How many levels below you will a mob con db?  Fear works on some mobs that con dark blue to me in velks.  Or did at 62/63.<br />

<br />
I knew it was a long shot posting here, but there is a shot thus I did.  It was just a try.<br />
<br />
My dex isn't where it should be (i know) but i've been concetrating on other stats (ac/hp) instead.  This is also for situations where I solo and when i'm in a very long small raids with guidlies when there are no chanters (and sometimes no shammies) around so i can't renew buffs.<br />
<br />
As far as CD snaring mobs, it's resisted more than FD so I tend to us FD when I actually want to snare for a while.  <br />
<br />
I do know fear doesn't work pass mobs 55, but again, I want to be sure the mob isn't 55 when I use fear on it.  I haven't gotten into the habit of using it for agro, though it'd be great in valor.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the info.  I use mental corruption when no mana buff is available but it only supports small mana use spells.  I sometimes use spear spell for a fast casting instant agro grabber when the mob is on it's way to a caster.  I've had incomptent healers but even some of the good ones lag at times.  Esp in valor when the mob is resisting slows or the slower is lagging on the slows.  Lifetap has saved my life a few times in valor.  <br />
<br />
I don't use the pet lots of times.  I never use it when pulling and i rarely use it when there is a mezzer for adds because the pet tends to sick the add and i just end up killing the pet anyway (plus it sucks lots of mana).  It's been easier to go without the pet then it has been to keep doing my job well and make sure my pet isn't doing something bad.  A poorly controled pet is one of the most annoying things.  (Yes, it is my job to control it and I admit i don't do it as well as I should so i don't use it when i think it can get the group killed.)   I use it solo'ing of course.   I rarely ever summon it in LDONs and i usually send it to the graveyard by me or a mob when i do.<br />
<br />
And i'll see about the MQing spectral parchments.  I have friends who don't need them looking out for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lifetaps and Z bites uses a lot.  QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Lifetaps aren't mana friendly. Unless you can increase your taps with AAs and focus, then it'll always be more mana friendly to let the healer heal you. MC + ZB should equal themselves out. Even with crappy dex, you should get 1 proc every 45 seconds or so with MC. That would replace the mana lost, give everyone else in the group 100 mana, and do 250 dmg to the mob, all costing you nothing.<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness with nothing but MC to keep you afloat should have more than enough mana regen to keep aggro. Even a resist is great aggro for you. Like others said, spears aren't worth using unless mana permits. 600 dmg every minute won't make or break any encounter your group would have.<br />
<br />
[quote]I don't use the pet lots of times. I never use it when pulling and i rarely use it when there is a mezzer for adds because the pet tends to sick the add<br />
<br />
You do know that pets cannot attack a mezzed mob. If the mob they fight gets mezzed, they immediately stop fighting it. Your pet is free damage. If you position the pet behind the mob (which is easy to do if you tell it to guard the entrance to your camp, and run past him everytime you pull a mob), then it should survive quite well. A whole LDoN even. The only thing that makes it a pain in the ass is when pulling and you get hit, it runs to your aid.. well until you get Pet Hold. If it dies, big deal. Better your pet die than you. It takes an extra iota of thought, but it helps a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A poorly controled pet is one of the most annoying things<br />
<br />
Yes, it is. Which is why you should launch little Jabober every chance you get and learn how to let him do what he needs to do. Your pet will not, can not, and never ever will break a mez. It's no longer possible. He will also whine at you telling you that he can't wake it up. <br />
<br />
In fact learning to use him before you get /pet hold will make you a pet controller supreme. Once you parse him and see what a nice little dot he is (solution to mana probs right there) you'll find him well worth the bone chip. If you solo as much as you are saying you do, you should be pretty adept at using him, and pulling your mob to where he's behind it should be second nature by now.  <br />
<br />
Ditch the spears, even at his 50whatever per hit, Jabober is outdamaging your spear very quickly especially with the long refresh on them. Never rely on something for agro with that long a refresh, it's basically taking your mana and throwing it on the ground. <br />
<br />
You should need two spells and two spells only in PoV. Festering on the mob on incoming to give everyone time to debuff and slow it, and hit it with a fear and it will come right to you. 2x CD negates Tash + slow off a chanter, test it and you'll see. <br />
<br />
If you can get the cleric to toss a virt on Jabober he can take care of splitting if you get two unsnareables that need to be split and you're worried about not surviving to get FD off. Jabober with a virt and a rune can survive singling stuff in sol ro tower, so he's more than capable of PoV. Get used to your /pet back off, and /pet follow hotkeys, practise somewhere safe like PoN splitting stuff near zoneline, and you'll get the hang of backing him off the instant he gets agro and then tagging off him.<br />
<br />
If your groups are so low in DPS that you are being put in the position of blowing your mana on DPS instead of agro then form your own groups and put a rogue or something in them. Higher DPS = mobs die faster = SK needs less heals. Sounds pretty obvious but you'd be amazed at how many people will put their level 59 friend who wants PLing in the group instead of that level 65 rogue who's slumming in PoV for some easy AA before bed.<br />
<br />
Hopefully none of this comes across harsh, it's not meant that way. You sound like a very tentative SK, can't think of another word for it so hopefully that makes sense. You're an SK--Tentative is not in our vocabulary or mental makeup. We don't worry about what this or that might do, cause if it all goes to hell, we've got FD. And you haven't lived until you've Feared something by mistake in the worst possible place to do so.</div></div><hr />

I have only seen Pact of Hate selling in the Bazaar once in the past month.  The guy was selling it for 12k which is a little pricy.  As was said, try getting an MQ on a spectral.<br />

Sorry for the long delay in response, and no it wasn't harsh, but helpful.<br />

Hah, I accidently feared in a LDON and wiped the group.  They were quite nice about it.<br />
<br />
I easily learned how to control my beastlord pet quick.  I'm now trying to get into the process of using my sk pet in the same manner.  <br />
<br />
I did not know about the mez.  I thought that I've seen my pet pounding on a mob in LDON and it not mez until I killed my pet.  I never asked, just assumed.  THanks for the information.</div></div><hr />
