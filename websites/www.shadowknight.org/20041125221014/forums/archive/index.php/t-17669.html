<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Small idea I came up with earlier, not sure if it'd appeal to many people but I thought I'd post it anyways:<br />
<br />
Remove Fury of Bertoxxulous from Grimror's BP.<br />
<br />
Add a new effect, Right Click buff, unique effect, that gives us a proc which is a combination of Mental Corruption and Shroud of Chaos... say 200dd, 200 heal, and 150 mana restore to self.<br />
<br />
It would bring the effect more in line with the usefulness of Warrior BP effect for example at least.<br />
<br />
Flame away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">200hp and 150mana on a single proc = horrifically overpowered, IMO.<br />
<br />
Then again, im not even near that part of the game, so it might not be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i dunno if they'd give us a proc buff that did 200 / 150,    with SA that'd be nuts... 600/450 ...  id bet if they did it'd be 65/50  (200/150 with SA)   but that is a good idea,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I meant 200 / 150 with SA3, sorry that slipped my mind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Leave my bp alone, i like 1500 crits on my spears.<br />
<br />
thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or just change fury of bert to fury of solesk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that would lower the ID by 5%, not worth it imo when u can just try for RZ ring and have 35% magic / disease both.. the only ones we use anyways.<br />
<br />
Plus, disc'd HT is a disease based spell no? If so I like the BP just how it is, but a mana / lifetap effect would be cool, maybe for something else though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We have a 24 page thread on changing the effects on the Ornate mold pieces to something useful, and so far nothing has been done.  I doubt we'll see changes to our Time BP anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disc'd HT is disease, but Improved HT overrides that and makes all HT's use &quot;Unresistable&quot; resist.  Only Solusek ID effects work on that.<br />
<br />
Fury of Solusek is never likely to hit our Time BP, considering how other BP's have specific resist ID's too.<br />
<br />
On the other hand... Paladin BP gets Marr's Blessing effect, which is essentially as useful to them as Fury of Solusek is to us (I.e. it affects all their direct healing spells, like Fury of Solusek would affect all our direct damage spells)... which could seem slightly overbalanced in their favour?</div></div><hr />
