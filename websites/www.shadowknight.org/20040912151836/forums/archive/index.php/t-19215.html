<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SkTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Looking for some advice on which AA to get next, at 73 aa, 6 in bank to spend...<br />
<br />
You can see the AA's in my magelo.<br />
<br />
I have gone through the basic tank role, at:<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
ND3<br />
PE<br />
<br />
I have also been working on the SA at:<br />
SCF3<br />
ToL3<br />
SA1<br />
<br />
I do not at this time have any of the HT aa's.<br />
<br />
At this point, I have 6 AA's saved up to spend, and am wondering which way to go.<br />
<br />
My original intent was to go towards SA3.  (Hard to beat the increased DPS, tanking (lifetap) and possible eye candy (i.e. when the SCF and ToL catch a proc, BAM!!!))<br />
<br />
But I have been reading and hearing a lot on how useful LR5 and ID5 are. (But, sad thing thing here is, contantly, I always get asked in groups and raids what my hit points are... I have NEVER been asked whether I have CS/CA, much less LR/ID, but maybe other ppl have different experiences on this)<br />
<br />
I do not think I will go the HT aa's yet, untill I max the tank/defensive AA's, but would be willing to listen to any suggestions otherwise?<br />
<br />
So, in summary, which to do:<br />
- Go to SA3?<br />
- Work on LR5/ID5?<br />
- Or some thing else?<br />
<br />
(Time split now between raiding and LDoN.  Raiding so far, I seem to be only extra DPS (argument for SA?).  Rarely am I pulling anymore, in either raids or LDoN.)<br />
<br />
(No gear giggling and flames, please...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, this is one of the best AAs I have ever spent points on, and you will especially love it if you are in LDoN.  Cast a pet, have a cleric virtue it (since they are wussy little buggers).  Make a hotkey for /pet attack, and then make another hotkey with /pet back off on the first line and /pet hold on the second line.  When you have a room that has a few mobs in it, target one, hit hotkey to send pet in to attack, then as soon as he hits mob you hit the hotkey to bring him back, and Viola!  single pulls.  In LDoN you can single pull consistantly.  Not even a bard can single pull better than a SK with pet disc.  I even use Mr Wussy to pull in BoT and he does it flawlessly.  The only time you have problems is when there are greens around.  They will aggro pets sometimes.<br />
<br />
I only have about 60 points, and I think I got pet disc around 50.  I think if I had to do it all over again, I would have got it around 30 instead because of how awesome it is for pulling.  It's also nice to have just so that your pet is useful and won't run off and get himself killed when you get hit by something tough and he provides extra DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with SA3, then LR/ID.  If you regularly use SoC, you'll wonder how you ever lived without max SA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tank, was if not recruited to, called upon almost imeadately to tank greenies in NToV when there were only 3 guilds capable of doing it,  have made what little name I have from tanking,  LR5/ID5, especially LR5.<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While groups might ask you what your HP are, LR/ID are the best tank AA's.  I consider myself a defensive class.  I would get these first, then either the PP/PD for extra hp, or SA for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you tank alot defensive AA are probably a safe bet. SA can also be fun, just depends or what you spend the bulk of your time doing.<br />
Later<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LR/ID are only needed if you cant tank the current place where you are grinding out AA's.  If you can tank BoT/Tactics with out LR/ID and your guild isnt going to be in the elements and need you to OT, then there is no need to rush out and get LR/ID.<br />
<br />
I suggest sticking it out with SA.  Those 195, 390, and 780 innate taps add up quick.<br />
<br />
I will admit that LR and ID are excellent AA's and I would do them right after you finish SA.<br />
<br />
I guess I think that once you set in on a set of AA's that you should finish them off before moving on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only one that's like this is SCF. almost all of our other AA sets give more benefit per point at the first level than they do at the second and third, soul abrasion included.<br />
however, some give more benefit per points at the third level than the second, and after you do the second you should follow with the third (nd/ca/cs/sa included)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you should also just keep your mood in mind.  Sometimes saving up six AA seems painfully slow and you just don't have the stomach for it.  When that happens, get the AA that cost 2 or 3 or 4 points and wait till you feel patient to top out SCF3 or ND3 or the like.  At other times, you've got a few saved and it's not eating you alive, and you feel like it's worth it getting one of the big AA levels done with, maybe -- so rack up a few more and get the big ones done.<br />
<br />
AA's can burn a hole in your pocket just like money.  Sometimes it's more fun just to spend them whether it is or isn't the best idea.  It's just a game.</div></div><hr />
