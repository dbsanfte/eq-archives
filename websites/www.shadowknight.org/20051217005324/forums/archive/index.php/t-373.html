<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Vedar</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really getting sick of HT being resisted on just about all Big mobs. What gets me writing this is I logged on and saw guild was getting a group to take down VS. I never fought him before and was told HT him and the wiz would manaburn him and we would try to take him out FAST. well a bit into the fight I pop HT and get resisted. then he lifetaps me for 4500 hp. and we ALMOST beat him. If I was not at the raid we probably would have won, which is why I'm pissed. You can chalk this up to life and learn, but COME ON why can't I HT a frigen Level 55 blue mob when I'm 60, while Wizards can manaburn for like 8K? It makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Oh then we can spend like what. 5 or 6 AA point to do a unresistable 900 point HT? what a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taedirk</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about the reason Wizards can is because they spend about 30 or 40 aaxp points to get manaburn and it drains their entire manapool.  Tell me, did you have to level to 59 and spend endless hours aaxping for your harmtouch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Vedar</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No but we get to spend 20-30 AA XP points for unresistable 900 points of damage. I would like to think our class defining ability was worth something, as of now its pretty much used for stopping that mob with a sliver of life from agroing other mobs.<br />
<br />
At higher levels I would rather it maybe do half damage if resisted or maybe make it usable more often.<br />
<br />
Yes I know this is a old dead horse but does not mean I won't beat it some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I load Shroud of hate and torrent of hate on every raids, and cast em on every mobs.<br />
<br />
_Shroud of hate is magic based and extremely low resist, if a mob resists it, then this mob is 100% MR and will resist non-disced HT.<br />
_Torrent of Hate is disease based and has extremely low resist as well, if a mob resists it, then this mob is 100% DR and will resist disced HT.<br />
<br />
Cast both spells on mob to know wich HT he would resist, so you don't burn it for nothing.<br />
I know a very few mobs that resist both.<br />
<br />
Resists on HT are not a problem for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">same myst... theres very few mobs that resist ht, its pretty much never resisted, something i learned awhile ago though... people just like to complain that lots of kunark &quot;uber&quot; mobs (im using the term very loosely since many can be taken with 1 group or less now and a couple even soloed) resist ht, and a couple of the velious ones<br />
<br />
btw wizards need to spend 12 in class on mental clarity (useless skill for the most part) then 6 on manaburn for the skill... for your ht aa's you spend 6, not to mention that you get ht's natural low resist rate as just part of the spell, in all seriousness all your jealousy over manaburn is gonna do is get the skill nerfed which would really suck since its balanced already in all but pvp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alhazro</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mystina is right, I use that method also when I am not sure if mobs are resistant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, same as Myst. But I only needed torrent of hate to test it out. If it resists torrent of hate then I assume that it wouldn't be immune to magic so used normal HT instead. I never met any mobs that are immune to disease AND magic at the same time. Is there one? Please enlighten me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use lifetaps to check for mr for normal ht and torrents for disc ht. I never have shroud of hate up unless I'm in an area with sk mobs that may cast it on me; at which point I cast it back to negate it. <br />
<br />
The only mobs I can think of that are resistant to both mr/dr are kunark things. I don't think I've met a mob in sol/sov that resists both, but I might be wrong. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nocifer:<br />
Telkorenar and Gozzrem, Velketor the Sorceror, most Kunark Dragons will resist both forms of HT.<br />
<br />
But just about everything else can be hit by one form of HT, which is why the aaxp ability is so ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
