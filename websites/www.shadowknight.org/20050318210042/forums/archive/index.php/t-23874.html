<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm now living on the sunny island of Guam, and being here means that my normal playtime is about 6 hours past most of my guilds playing time.  <br />
<br />
So...what parts of this can be solo'd by a 70sk with 120or so aa's, 6500hp unbuffed (try to get a conv/wunshi when going soloing, brings me just over 8 for one, 9 for both) and about 1800ac?  <br />
<br />
I also may have occasional access to a shaman, which I think should increase my abilities greatly as to what I can kill, but not all the time.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people in here that say something's soloable, but I'm not as uber as a lot of people.  I think my highest soloing ability is a named here and there in Harb. Spires on the bottom level, unless I kite.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and wish me luck heh...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">fear, growth, nightmare steed, iceclad SK are soloable.<br />
<br />
You can probably 2 box/duo the 4 SK's with the shaman.  Probably the wailing sister as well, I 3 boxed her with a cleric/enc/SK.</div></div><hr />

I'd bring a cleric too.  I was about your stats when I did the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you dont have Epic 1.0. Drops for the Side quest.<br />
<br />
The PoHate drop is soloable!<br />
<br />
Captain and Oldain need atleast a group if not more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 1.5 itself.<br />
<br />
The breeder camp gonna need group!<br />
<br />
Frogga can be done with less but i suggest full group.<br />
<br />
The sheath drops All can be soloed,PoFear,PoNightmare,PoGrowth.<br />
<br />
The Wailing sister in PoN can be duoed with shammy.<br />
<br />
The Sk in Iceclad can be soloed, other 3 i would take slower and healer atleast.<br />
<br />
The paladins can be duoed with just healer...got 2 of my bloods with just me and druid.<br />
<br />
Sir Felmont I would say atleast 3 groups and that would be cutting it close(depending on gear).<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />
<br />
P.S <br />
My biggest suggestion is read up in this forum ANYTHING and EVERYTHING you need to know about the quest is here just have to sit and search for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mriu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys for the replies.<br />
<br />
I've been reading up on this for the last couple days.  I never did 1.0 because when I finally got to the level required, and in a guild that could actually do it, I had a better weapon so it seemed to be a waste of time.  Well, that and my previous ability to maintain a thought process long enough to complete a quest was capped about the lentgh of time it took to do the thex dagger quest (loved that pally-on-a-stick!).<br />
<br />
For the Plane of Hate part of the prequest, is that soloable via kiting, or can I straight tank/lifetap that?  I can't really see kiting up there so I would imagine tanking/tapping eh?<br />
<br />
And the Breeder...that's going to be an interesting one.  I have a lot of excellent ench friends, and a good tank/cleric combo.  Would it be possible to just straight tank/dps it, and mez the babies?  Or is that just a waste of energy and too tough to think about?<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyraxx Shadowleezard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Waste of energy thinking about it unless you can get 2-3 mezzers. Final fight can be ton with 1-2 groups if you have a good tank/cleric and a bard.</div></div><hr />

  PoHate can be straight Tanked ..with lifetap..get positioned between the floors of the building and sit there in the corner of the stairs ...wait for PH or named split and tank right there dont move much just sit and lifetap sob's to death!<br />
<br />
Breeder gonna be a bit tuffer...the Babies are VER VERY resistant and need to be Malo'd before mez. so makes for some hard mezzes as you can immagine and teh Babies ALL FLURRY for 1k+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uannayven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have heard that the SK in Ocean of Tears, can also be solo'd is there any truth in this?</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt think so~<br />
<br />
Its dps isnt that great no, and its the easiest one to tank of the 4 but all 4 have alot of H/p would be long fight if soloing.<br />
<br />
Then the mana it would take in Lifetaps..and or DoT's and Taps for a long fight like that. So i guess it would really depend on what gear you have and how well buffed you are but i am almost possotive it cant be snared, which is why the iceclad Sk is soloable you can Kite it!  But as far as soloing sk in Ocean of Tears not likely, but ive seen crazier Shit happen~!</div></div><hr />

EDIT: There I go posting without reading everything twice.  The OOT SK isn't hard, and if he doesn't summon, he can be soloed.  You just need SOE and some patience.</div></div><hr />
