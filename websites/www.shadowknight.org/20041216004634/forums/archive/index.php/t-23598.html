Has anyone found a good place to AFK farm Dranik Loyalist Faction with a pet?  I've looked around Dranik Scar, but I haven't found a good spot yet; seems like most of the mobs there are &gt; Gonerer_41.<br />
<br />
I'm currently 65 and working AA, but I guess I could bump up to 68 to get the next pet if it's requrired for doing this.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zedlepln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The sheer number of kills required to get warmly faction does not lend itself to soloing, even for classes good at soloing. The number of kills per hour solo is not economical enough. Grouping where you get faction hits seems the most popular method, and it still takes a tremendous amount of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Based on what gives you the hit, your best bet is to try for the DPS slot of a PG or RCoD group it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I finally hit warmly about a week ago and was able to finish up the FT4 ring that I wear.<br />
<br />
I did most of it in RCoD. Depending on your gear you should be able to tank just fine for most of the camps in RCoD that give the faction.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of faction quests, but I turned in quite a few Kyv Hearts in a row (18) and did not see a change. Was at Kindly when I started and Kindly when I ended, and it still took me another 3 sessions to get to warmly.<br />
<br />
You &quot;might&quot; be able to get a low level to get an expedition off of RCoD, and then take over the expedition. Although I've never tried, theoretically, there would be spots in there that you+pet should be able handle afk.<br />
<br />
But it will be slow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it takes 1500 faction hits to get warmly.<br />
<br />
if you want to slaughter low level stuff, the top of the castle in DS is all kyvs, and the eastern side of DS (up the ramp) is mostly kyvs/nocs/ukuns. at 70, with around 210 as lowest resist they rarely landed chaos claws, so i was able to straight tank solo on top of the castle. they're all light blue there at 70. SoD/ToTC alone kept me alive when fighting 1 at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The expeditions get kicked after 5 or 6 hours in the zone too so you couldn't just leave it all day.</div></div><hr />

Won't help you hold aggro, but if you have AE'ing friends that'll do the trick factionwise just nicely.<br />
<br />
As far as expedition timers go, I know Vxed/Tipt worked on a 6 hour timer, but I have seen no indication that Draniks Hollows expeditions have such a timer (seen people sit there overnight), do the RCoD expeditions work differently or are you just basing that on general expedition experiences from GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've always switched out of dranik hollow expeditions before the 6 hours so I haven't been kicked.<br />
<br />
However, our guildie bots 6 and said his one man wrecking crew was getting kicked every day and he thought it was always around 6 hours.  Made sense based on some of the GoD expeditions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even if you do get kicked after 6 hours, it could still be a boon for afk factioners.<br />
<br />
If you could find a spot where you could get 10 mobs to aggro you, which there are in the RCoD instances.<br />
<br />
That would be 180 hits every 6 hours.<br />
<br />
Thats only a little over 8 sessions. /shrug<br />
<br />
Like I said, I've not tried, but for the person with lots of time on their hands, it might be worth trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What is the progression or factioning one wants to do any for OOW?<br />
<br />
My guild is doing Time and will be starting GoD soon, doing some epic mobs for OOW.<br />
<br />
What faction would I want to get?  Does it matter?  I noticed I get hits all over the place, but I hunt all over too.  Some hits are opposing, so hard to figure out what one wants.<br />
<br />
Is it anything like Velious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">dranik loyalists is the faction you need to do quests.<br />
if you're in time it probably doesn't matter, most quests aren't that high end.<br />
you can't lower it.<br />
<br />
overlord mata muram, and children of dranik / riftseekers are other opposing factions, but neither matter, at max ally you're still KoS i think</div></div><hr />
