<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not exactly a bug with SK's but on my first trip to the Plane of Disease I noted that on number of occasions that the Mobs me and my 55 lvl druid companion were kiting when they were almost dead would spontaneously regenerate about 40% of their hitpoints.  My companion said this was't unusual, but there were no spell casting messages to indicate how or why they had healed themselves.  Has anyone else experianced this with PoD Mobs and can you porvide an explanation?  It is a very annoying occurance as with the two of us most of our kites were in the 4-5 minute time range with the spontanaeous regenration that ups to 6-7 mins slowing xp considerably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has something to do with your aggro.<br />
<br />
All freaking mobs have INSAIN regen in pop planes when they dont have aggro. So when kiting them, this happens a lot at low health, they sometimes loose aggro for an instant, they also warp a bit sometimes,  cause you ran out of range and their non aggro regen kicks in. <br />
This should account for up to 10-20% in less then a tick.<br />
<br />
Best solution is when they are at 20% or less hp, stay very close to them, so they dont warp/loose aggro.<br />
<br />
I cant tell for sure if this is your problem, i am just talking from personal experiances in PoS.<br />
<br />
To see their insain regen, kite one to half and FD and be ready to be dazzled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just to clarify we were aggro kiting with the druid as bait and it seemed to be the point at which the mob gave up chasing the druid (with me inturn chasing the mob beating on it) and turned to flee then instantly it would be back up to 40% or so (probably a little less) and it would the resume chasing the druid.  When i get a few more lvls and can take the aggro myself i'll test the regen with FD like you suggest and see if this could account for the sort of health jumps i witnessed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Below about 30% health, and particulary when the mob turns to run, if the person who it hates the most is outside a certain range it basically gets a free regen to 30%. Neat eh :rolleyes:  So be sure to have the druid stick nice and close as you are finishing it off and you shouldn't have that problem. A pain for chain pulling if the puller has been the tank. Don't know the exact mechanics of it but if you do that it should fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basically Jupke covered it. It has to do with the druids aggro on the mob, your aggro wasn't high enough on the mob to notice. When the mob turned to run at like 10% health, it moved far enough away from the druid that it lost aggro. I have seen this also when the puller in PoV Inner runs out to grab a mob while the group finishes it off once it has turned to run, the mob regens a bunch of hps.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it has to do with the fact that the first person to get aggro or the person with the most aggro, haven't tested that out yet.</div></div><hr />
