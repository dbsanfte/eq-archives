--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Described below are most of the changes that have been introduced over the past few weeks on our test server. The information includes a host of new features, changes, and bug fixes. We have not updated you in a few weeks so here it is. The patcher and login news screens have been updated with this information as well.<br />
<br />
*** Headliners ***<br />
<br />
- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting city.<br />
<br />
- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana, and endurance will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under development. You may not be quite at 100% but very close.<br />
<br />
- Re-envisioning has begun!<br />
<br />
- Over 600 Spell modifications.<br />
<br />
- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas.<br />
<br />
- New Hot Spots!<br />
<br />
Estate of Unrest<br />
<br />
Solusek's Eye<br />
<br />
Kurn's Tower<br />
<br />
The Warrens<br />
<br />
Netherbian Lair<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns<br />
<br />
The Scarlet Desert<br />
<br />
The Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
<br />
The Hole<br />
<br />
The Grey<br />
<br />
Howling Stones<br />
<br />
The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out. They were able to complete many of the stages of the raid successfully and even multiple times without issue. There was one instance of a mob warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast improvements from its current state. We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to this.<br />
<br />
- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8).<br />
<br />
- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific changes.*<br />
<br />
- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*<br />
<br />
- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.*<br />
<br />
- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.*<br />
<br />
- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.*<br />
<br />
- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.*<br />
<br />
- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*<br />
<br />
- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions in game for details.*<br />
<br />
- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.*<br />
<br />
- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.<br />
<br />
- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Spells, Skills &amp; AAs ***<br />
<br />
- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA Auspice of the Hunter.*<br />
<br />
- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*<br />
<br />
- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*<br />
<br />
- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*<br />
<br />
- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.<br />
<br />
- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell timer.<br />
<br />
- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.<br />
<br />
- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be resisted much less often.<br />
<br />
- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.*<br />
<br />
- Added a 30 second recast time to spirit of the panther and spirit of the leopard. Additionally, the rate at which pets trigger the effect of these spells has been lowered to match the rate at which players trigger effects.<br />
<br />
- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.*<br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.<br />
<br />
*** Items ***<br />
<br />
- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage potential.<br />
<br />
- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect.<br />
<br />
- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.<br />
<br />
- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the Soul Orb.<br />
<br />
- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.<br />
<br />
- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.<br />
<br />
- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.<br />
<br />
- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab.<br />
<br />

<br />
- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell rune and +4 regen.<br />
<br />
- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.<br />
<br />
- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect.<br />
<br />
- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav.<br />
<br />
- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.<br />
<br />
- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called &quot;Oculus of Yar`Lir&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen.<br />
<br />
- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<br />
<br />
- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<br />
<br />
- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Missions, Quests &amp; Events ***<br />
<br />
- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions<br />
<br />
House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)<br />
<br />
Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)<br />
<br />
A Goblin's Escort<br />
<br />
Halfling's Treasure Map<br />
<br />
Signal Fires<br />
<br />
Sudden Tremors<br />
<br />
These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction.<br />
<br />
- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.<br />
<br />
- Changed the adventure &quot;The Gilded Scroll&quot; to fix some situations that could cause players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC.<br />
<br />
- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly after a failure.<br />
<br />
- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find.<br />
<br />
- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered.<br />
<br />
- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.<br />
<br />
- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring some extra allies with you.<br />
<br />
- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter will spawn directly on top of you.<br />
<br />
– Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk in Txevu.<br />
<br />
- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following:<br />
<br />
If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High Temple.<br />
<br />
If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.<br />
<br />
If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of the High Temple, the golem will ignore you.<br />
<br />
Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.<br />
<br />
This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive.<br />
<br />
- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** NPCs ***<br />
<br />
- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing them.<br />
<br />
- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted.<br />
<br />
- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more.<br />
<br />
- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in the geometry.<br />
<br />
- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Tradeskills ***<br />
<br />
We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details please see the post here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq...message.id=5800<br />
<br />
- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills.<br />
<br />
- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through foraging before.<br />
<br />
- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.<br />
<br />
- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.<br />
<br />
- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.<br />
<br />
- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.<br />
<br />
- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes.<br />
<br />
- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.<br />
<br />
*** Server stability ***<br />
<br />
- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely for memory leak issues.<br />
<br />
- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.<br />
<br />
- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.<br />
<br />
- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed.<br />
<br />
- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed or feared has been fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Chat filtering ***<br />
<br />
- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*<br />
<br />
- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat window.*<br />
<br />
- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*<br />
<br />
- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Mail System ***<br />
<br />
- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server from any of your characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Title Suffixes ***<br />
<br />
- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are the server titles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***<br />
<br />
- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.<br />
<br />
- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the Guild bank.<br />
<br />
- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Bazaar/Barter ***<br />
<br />
- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the search.<br />
<br />
- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being disconnected.<br />
<br />
- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the search path.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** UI ***<br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots.<br />
<br />
- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements.<br />
<br />
- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Miscellaneous ***<br />
<br />
- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.<br />
<br />
- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.<br />
<br />
- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of dynamic zones.<br />
<br />
- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash.<br />
<br />
- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.<br />

i guess classes with the buff extension AAs who want to grind out AA should use their potions up.<br />
<br />
- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete. <br />
guess i should farm crystals before the nice easy drake mission.<br />
<br />
 Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.<br />
i hope this fixes the other eye of zomm crashes.<br />
<br />
- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you. <br />
cool. will be easier to get an easy low level mission, if i decide to max out charm for whatever reason. now all they need to do is lower the required wait time between missions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not done yet. Let them put in shit little by little, so they can fix the bugs they'll create in small amounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im still trying to figure out what the qvic/inktu'ta flagging part means...<br />
<br />
If your Qvic flagged but not inktu'ta u have hail and get missing piece? or just frag/sliver of high temple if your not qvic flagged and raided in?<br />
<br />
Be a good move on both counts because the alt access quest is b/s, its actually more difficult than the normal flag quest, which is out of line because backflagging for anguish is as simple as having someone loot seal:mastery of all off a mob...(yeah they need the signets, but thats not exactly hard to get)<br />
<br />
just my thoughts</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelali</div><div class="date">04-07-2005, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im still trying to figure out what the qvic/inktu'ta flagging part means...<br />
<br />
<br />
My understanding is that they made it possible to do Inktu`ta for the flag into Txevu if you did the Qvic alt access quest instead of doing Ikkinz 4 (7, what ever you perfer to call it) and uqua. Before if you did the Qvic alt access quest, you didn't have the 2 pieces from Ikkinz and uqua to hand to the fellow in Abysmal Sea to get the cipher of Txevu, so you were *forced* to do the Txevu alt ent quest also if you did the Qvic alt access quest.<br />
<br />
so instead of being:<br />
<br />
Ikkinz + Uua + Inktu`ta = Txevu<br />
<br />
** or**<br />
<br />
Qvic alt quest + Txevu alt quest = Txevu<br />
<br />
It will be:<br />
<br />
((ikkinz +Uqua) *OR* Qvic alt quest) + (Inktu`ta *OR* Txevu alt ent quest) = Txevu.<br />
<br />
Personally, after the first GoD change to flagging (the no longer needing *every* person to do all 7 ikkinz and tasks etc) I think the backflagging become fairly easy. I mean, 3 raids and you are flagged for all of GoD. All these backflagging changes though really makes me wonder though, because it means people won't really do some of the not so high end stuff that still drops kick ass loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzil</div><div class="date">04-07-2005, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All these backflagging changes though really makes me wonder though, because it means people won't really do some of the not so high end stuff that still drops kick ass loot.<br />
<br />
I just finished doing the qvic backflag quest and let me tell you if a guild wants to choose to do it this way rather then run ikk4/uqua they are stupid.<br />

That change is pretty useless tho and like I assume they won't implement new fear spells at all. Just like the &quot;melee change 2&quot; never happened which should have introduced the &quot;openings&quot; after they recoded our discs..<br />
But let's wait and see.<br />
<br />
Personally this made me laugh.<br />
<br />
- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*<br />
<br />

* Denotes a community request.<br />
Like enchanters really requested that. More than a nerf than an improvement request, as far as I know they gave OoW NPCs 1 mana so Mind Wrack and the Enchanter manatap spells would work. Now those moby only would yield ONE total mana..</div></div><hr />

<br />
SOE has previously stated that OoW NPC's &quot;were given small mana pools to power innates&quot; or something to the effect thereof.  Before someone jumps on me saying, &quot;but procs don't use mana!&quot; I recall the comment striking me as a bit odd at the time, but NPC's do follow different rules than PC's, and I'm not completely clear on all the differences, so I didn't think too much of it.  <br />
<br />
This would suggest two things: first that enchanters would be more limited in their ability to drain mobs, but that they'd be getting more than one mana for their troubles; also that the infinitely drainable mana pools of OoW mobs were an unintentional byproduct, and that, while a nerf in some situations, the change would represent a boost in the intended situations.  <br />
<br />
Then again, this is all hearsay; none of us knows just what's going through the dev team's minds or what is/is not intended.</div></div><hr />

However, they are not concerned that ST or MW will be affected by this change because those spells are not direct drains, but have a recourse over time. The latter two spells are functionally different than the former. Regardless, I doubt I will even mem ToT on my chanter, since ST does just dandy.</div></div><hr />

well, 'better' is a sort of subjective word here. there's a few things you need to consider:<br />
clinging darkness - level 15 - 20 mana, 1.8 cast time, 4 second recast<br />
terror of discord - level 67 - 60 mana, 1.5 cast time, 6 second recast<br />
drea gaze - level 69 - 150 mana, 3.0 cast time (well, a bit less actually), 30 second recast<br />
<br />
now... assume for a moment that generally speaking single target aggro is your main priority, and that something like dread gaze isn't something you'll be using on every mob in your average tanking situation... so, we can toss dread gaze out, because that's an aggro utility spell.<br />
<br />
so you're left with CD vs ToD. well, i don't know the exact aggro numbers the code uses for either of these spells, so all we have is anecdotal evidence and personal experience.<br />
cast for cast, ToD is NOT signifigantly more aggro than clinging darkness is, both spells are roughly equal. i've played with this extensively since ToD came out in group and raid situations.<br />
my two best friends are a qvic geared wizard who's trigger happy, and a monk with a shinai of the ancients/eth destroyer who has a spirit of leopard bot. i group with these people all the time, and have since velious came out.<br />
they both test me on purpose. the wizard chains nukes constantly, the monk... well he just hits stuff a lot and procs things.<br />
i've tried using just ToD for aggro. i've tried using just CD. there's no real difference between the two, cast for cast, in an average group situation.<br />
i've also done this on Time and Ikk raids when i'm either MT or add/offtank MA, and had the exact same results.<br />
<br />
in any single target aggro situation, CD generates effectively the same aggro, but costs 1/3rd the mana and has a 2 second faster recast.<br />
due to the effectively nonexistent mana cost, quick cast time, and aggro comparable to another spell 52 levels above it... yes, i'd say CD is the greatest aggro spell in the game</div></div><hr />

The problem with this argument is that CD was never intended to be an aggro spell.  It will cease generating aggro on mobs that are unsnareable as of the next patch likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're forgetting some advantages ToD has over CD:<br />
1. It's higher amounts needing less casts, that gives you more time to melee meaning more dps (slightly faster kills), and more aggro.<br />
2. It isn't subject to the 160 hate hardcap from casting on unaggro npc's.<br />
3. You don't know the numbers but they've been posted 50,000 times so let me post them for the 50,001st time.  CD is 1200 hate max (plus a very small amount for the dot component), it's based on the mobs max hp as that climbs and eventually caps at around 12k max hp CD gains more and more, ToD is 1800 at all times, the mob can have 6 max hp or it can have 20 billion, it will always be 1800 where as CD might would be 5 hate in one situation and 1200 in the other.<br />
<br />
Also, Dreadgaze is 3 sec base cast time, it's 1.6 naturally and with any spell haste whatsoever it's 1.5.<br />
<br />
Chain casting CD is ~13846 hate/min, chain casting ToD is ~14400 hate/min.  They're about equal in that regard however, ToD is only costing you 20% of your melee and 50% of your total aviable casting time, CD is costing you 23% of your melee and 66% of your aviable casting time</div></div><hr />

this is true - also there's the fact that for the low-mid end sk, who does not have a large mana pool or high ft count, CD is substantially less mana across an average group-length timeline.<br />
<br />
brael - numbers aside, practical experience has taught me that in terms of actual aggro generation, a single cast of ToD will not hold aggro for any more of a sustained length of time, or generate signifigantly more snap aggro at a precise moment, than CD will.<br />
if you presume a general constant of needing to cast an aggro 3 - 4 times per fight (which, if you're at or below time level and have a high burst dps group is reasonable) than ToD is gonna cost you about 80 - 140 mana. CD will get you effectively identical results, and cost you 60 - 80 mana.<br />
the 0.3 cast time difference between CD and ToD is not, i think, enough to really quibble over. and CD refresher 2 seconds faster, meaning higher burst aggro.<br />
you're right about the caps, and the way hate works. i'll never deny that ToD is a wonderful spell that is *extremely* useful to have in certain aggro situations, and i always have it loaded in raids to use in conjuction with CD.<br />
however, i have never once outside of my testing used ToD in a group, except in groups with extremely high aggro members where i was initially fighting for aggro over procs and what not anyways.<br />
<br />
CD isn't the best aggro spell because of the direct translation of numbers. it's the best because it is a viable alternative to ToD, works so nearly as well as for the diference to be negligible, is 1/3rd the mana, and has a faster refresh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josahd</div><div class="date">04-09-2005, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot; and CD refresher 2 seconds faster, meaning higher burst aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
ToD is 2-3 times the aggro.  Couple second faster refresh vs massively more aggro per cast- ToD still wins on 'burst' aggro.<br />
<br />
Although if you really need that high of aggro for something, mem both and cast CD between refreshes of terror.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hard numbers aside.. if I'm raiding and I see a loose mob on a Shammy that had just slowed him, if I cast clinging darkness I still have to move over to the mob and either recast, taunt, or melee a little before it turns to me more times than not. If I use ToD, I don't have to move an inch. The mob comes right for me. I really wonder if you've ever used the spell before to say the burst aggro capabilities are equal. The hate numbers are there, the application in battle is there, why aren't you seeing it?<br />

<br />
Haha, if clinging darkness was the best it wouldn't be an &quot;alternative&quot; to ToD. ToD would be an alternative to clinging darkness.<br />
<br />
It will never be classified as the best because there are too many situations where you do not want to dot a mob.</div></div><hr />

shrug. i have seen it... i've been on raids where a loose mob goes after a caster, and one cast of CD has it coming after me. i've also had situations like where ToD did NOT turn the mob on me. <br />
i'm not saying ToD doesn't work, or that CD is necessarily works better than ToD. however, that there are enough situations in which CD can work just as well as ToD can, i find myself wondering why i should bother ever memming it outside of a raid situation (which, incidently, i never do)<br />
<br />
Haha, if clinging darkness was the best it wouldn't be an &quot;alternative&quot; to ToD. ToD would be an alternative to clinging darkness.<br />
which, to me, it is... but, since they're close enough to each other that it really doesn't matter which one you use, i'm not going to try to say 'CD is definately better'<br />
i just think the fact you get it at level 15, and at 70 it still works as well as a level 67 spell, says a lot about it<br />
<br />
It will never be classified as the best because there are too many situations where you do not want to dot a mob.<br />
which, of course, is ToD's other strength... and why i said CD was a viable alternative and not a straight up better spell</div></div><hr />

in any single target aggro situation, CD generates effectively the same aggro, but costs 1/3rd the mana and has a 2 second faster recast.<br />
