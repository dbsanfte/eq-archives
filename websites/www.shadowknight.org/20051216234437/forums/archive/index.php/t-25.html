<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chozzen</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings fellow SKs. <br />
<br />
I recall a topic some months ago regarding when a SK should start to consider the AC on armor more that whatever misc stats other pieces of armor may offer. <br />
<br />
Chozzen will soon be dinging 28, and I've decided I want him to forgo the route of his father (54 Mage was/is Main) and have him start dungeon crawling. As most Melee in the upper 20s/lower 30s seem to be flocking to the loio/OT/DL/KC route of life, i forsee Choz being the Main tank for mobs to hit while the caster folk do their thing. <br />
<br />
I guess I'm wanting to know if now is the time to start moving to a pure AC based set of armor/weapons/etc..or if I should simply wait until later on to pursue such matter. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for everyone's input and comments in advance. <br />
<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are a few exceptions... like you need your agi over 70? (never played a race where this was an issue) or you suffer a big AC penalty... also if your sta is over 100 you don't suffer any effects if your yellow sta bar is drained by fighting... so this can be very useful if using heavy weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The goal is always to have good AC, what that is at your level is your own decision.  The whole AC vs. Stats argument is really not saying get rid of stat armor but just that AC has a higher value than stats.  <br />
For example:<br />
12 AC 6 dex 5 str arms VS. 16 AC arms<br />
<br />
I think most people would tell you to take the 16 AC arms.<br />
<br />
Probably a bad example but sometimes it's good to make your own stat VS. AC table value wise<br />
<br />
for mine<br />
<br />
1 AC = <br />
7 HPs<br />
15 mana<br />
2 STA (sta = HPs)<br />
10 STR<br />
5 AGI<br />
20 DEX (i personally feel its worthless)<br />
3 INT<br />
<br />
WIS and CHA both worthless to me<br />
<br />
factoring in resists also makes it even more confusing but most resists tend to be situational except MR which is always the check used for doing something that pisses you off (charm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Personal Preference has been:<br />
<br />
AC<br />
HP<br />
STA<br />
AGI<br />
STR<br />
<br />
on my armor. I more or less figure when I have around 101 sta, some where in the range of 75-80 agi, and enough strength to carry around my armor, food, drink, utility items (food, fishing pole, SoW and DS Potions when I can afford em), and a bit of loot comfortably, I focus on AC and HP.<br />
<br />
It's unscientific to be sure, but it works for me. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I agree with Jobril there are &quot;minimum ideal stats&quot;  <br />
<br />
100+ stamina so you can keep attacking when your stamina bar runs out without any negative effects.<br />
<br />
100+ agility (i think) makes you not slow down in run speed when your life gets under a bubble <br />
<br />
enough strength to carry all your gear plus cushioning for loot<br />
<br />
after all those are settled then for worry about everything else in whichever order you value it most</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moolentheus</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most stats are situational. For example if you're on a raid and you're not taking any type of arggo from melee mobs then theoritically it doesn't matter if you have 0 ac or 5k ac because you're not getting hit at all. MR and other stats are still important.  Say when you're fear kitting while soloing,  STR and DEX are the most important stats while soloing because you're not getting hit much and they faster you kill the mob the less mana and HP you have to use but when you're tanking, all you need is enuff str to keep arggo and let the rogue do the most damage. This is were AC is most important (saves your cleric lots of mana)  <br />
Also when you're trying to do tradeskills most important stat is Int or wis and Dex for tailoring and str for smithing.... etc.  ac is usless in that case.<br />
<br />
Hope i'm not stating he obvious =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If 1 AC = 2 STA, then shouldn't 1 AC = 10 (or 11) hp, not the 7 you have listed?  I don't have the exact numbers, but Stamina gives between 5.2 to 5.6 hp per depending on Natural Durability.<br />
<br />
1 AC = 10 HP is my rule, but just don't nickel and dime your AC to death.<br />
<br />
Of course, if I could trade out all my AC for 10 HP per I would.<br />
<br />
I generally don't trade out AC for anything other than HP or Stam, except items that have decent AC/HP as well as resists that I can wear in multiple situations.  Not much point in alot of HP gear that you have to take off whenever you fight AE mobs (where it matters the most, sans Rampagers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilr</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, from 51 - 54 I soloed Skyfire Mountains.  Most important thing in the whole world was INT, since having 150 INT ment I could solo mature wurms via fearkiting.  <br />
<br />
 (of course this is when Kunark was first released and things have changed since then)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Xilith you are right I am still thinking like a monk where stamina = 4 HPs per at level 60 so yeah I probably have to do a bit of rethinking.</div></div><hr />
