<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got in, and jail is now filled with different Elemental types.  Caradon's cell is occupied by an Elemental.  Any word from those on Test who know this revamp if epic mobs have been moved or played with?<br />
<br />
*edit-well, mimics are gone, replaced by &quot;a chest&quot;...at least one very ill-placed see hide/sneak gargoyle on way to undead tower...no more using brell rogues to check spawns :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah reading they are re-doing this zone had me worried about the people just starting to do their epics.<br />
<br />
A chest?<br />
Is the chest a vendor by chance? I know that Innoruuk in new PoH actually will sell the shattered emerald of corruption.<br />
So..maybe the chest sells the key.No idea on Caradon though.<br />
Maybe they moved him somewhere more accessible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;a chest&quot;-definetely were not vendors, saw through rogue hide, kos, went splat.  <br />
<br />
And I don't see how putting them deeper in the zone would be more accessible; the gargoyle in tunnel on way to undead tower hits for at least 256, definetely beefed up and more difficult for 50's guilds if that's a preview of trash mobs.  Hopefully they moved epic mobs into the area above the jail or something, or in the city.  Guess we wait 3 days to see :(</div></div><hr />

And OMG i peed my pants when i started to go down them stairs only to find a huge earth elemental standing on them! :eek: <br />
Anywho, i am in need of the dusty tome, and am scared to see what and where they have been moved to..<br />
Guess this means no more duoing with hubbys 63 mage to try to spawn the guard.. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ainya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've noticed a lot of the same, no ratman anywhere, no mimics, also found out that the door leading to the chanter epic dude is locked..., never made it past the bank, the chests saw thru my hide/sneek quite fast and then i logged.<br />
<br />
Did find out the tower door is no longer locked, so if you are past the drop off point, and have no evacer or porter, YOU CAN make it back up thru the tower.  Will have to fight your way back out.</div></div><hr />

Anyway thanks to Ainya for linking from that post to here.  If you read my other post, you will see that the ghost of Glohnor is still alive and kicking down by the tower past the much harder hitting mobs like the constructs and gargoyles and that at some point the constructs that look like some of the little golem guards in OT become unmezzable/unstunnable by a 62 chanter and they mitigate slow from a 65 shammie.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of them putting all the epic mobs in a corner in tox forest.<br />
<br />
As for real info, I scanned quite a bit yesterday and also found nothing.  I will continue to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This definately has my intrest,if you find anything post it here thx.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully they dont tone down/up the challenge of getting your pieces from the Hole.<br />
As the epic is a headache enough at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The very first thing I noticed about the new Hole (besides the name change to &quot;The Ruins of Old Paineel&quot;) was the fact that the safe spot on the ledge next to the undead tower isn't safe anymore. That's where I had my Rogue scout camped, but he was killed by a Broken Gargoyle immediately on log in. <br />
<br />
I sent him back down to see how far I could get, and I made it to the long, twisting tunnel that leads to the undead tower before I got aggroed by another Broken Gargoyle. Unlike the mobs in the old Hole that were still scowling but wouldn't attack if I was hiding/sneaking, these guys will. Hugging the wall helped me get past the first one stationed in that tunnel (they don't appear to roam), but the second one got me, so I don't know what it looks like past that point.<br />
<br />
I did, however, find a Ratman. In the middle city area, past the bank, right before the broken gate that leads to the tunnel, I saw a Ratman Inhabitant walking across the courtyard there. I didn't follow him because of all the Gargoyles on the rooftops, and I don't know if he's related to the Ratman Guard in any way, but there he was. He walked into one of the buildings, but I don't know if he had any other Ratman friends inside.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that only two of the jail cells still had doors. The door to Caradon's old cell is gone and like Kyrkii said, it's occupied by an Elemental now. But I wonder if Caradon might still pop in one of the empty cells that do have doors. Maybe there's another jail somewhere. Dunno.<br />
<br />
I'm just glad I'm done down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dacajun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah! I just got to the the Dusty Tome part in my epic too... curse you SOE.<br />
I hope to convince some guildies to head down and see what we can find. Ill let you know what we find</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ratman guard roams near the bank with the chests down in the city.  We dropped him last night (was WAY easier than i remember haha, i never required a heal :) )<br />
<br />
we also killed a chest and it dropped jail key for caradon... so both those parts still working.  Saw Glohnor on track near Kirn's old tower, but no Caradon was up yet.<br />
<br />
anyway, we had one happy lv 58 SK last night getting both those pieces</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">F.Y.I. Caradon still pops in the same cell he has always been in. Just now it has no door and he has an Elemental cell mate. My Rougue is looking right at him as I type this.<br />
<br />
I would also like to confirm that Caradon is on a 2-day timer, not 3. This is the second time I've caught him only 48 hours after he was either killed or the server was reset. Or maybe I've just been getting lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zaknafene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The ratman inhabitant sees through rogue sneek and hide. The only one that I have found is the one before the tunnel down to the undead tower.  <br />
You can still drop down the waterfall to visit the Echo of Nortlav and see the Yael replacement Guardian of the seal.  <br />
<br />
Upon hailing the echo he says: &quot;Echo of Nortlav looks at Maittas with spectral eyes. An aura of mystery surrounds the figure as if hiding secrets of a bloody past.&quot;  Echo of Nortlav was holding the sk sword.<br />
<br />
Upon Hailing the guardian he states: &quot;Guardian of the Seal shouts 'Those who tamper with the seal shall suffer the same fate as that fool Yael!'  <br />
<br />
If you touch the seal the guardian will stomp on you. Hit me for 980 - lvl 5 halfling rogue.  Also there are two stone ward gargoyle types guarding the way back up to the undead tower that seen through sneak/hide.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Oopsies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did my part in the hole today with a few friends - 65 Paladin - 64 Warrior - 65 SK - 65 Shaman - 65 Wiz - 65 monk- 65 cleric - 65 Rogue- and me 51 SK.. This was seriously cake, Caradon is where he normally was, and once i turned in Key, i could have tanked him myself, he stayed on me till like 2 bubs then Pally got aggro, but these two were the easy part, Then going down to glohnor was more of a pain, since the mobs are now higher lvl, it took a bit longer, and once we got there, Glohnor is no longer sitting down, instead he is laying in a Coffin, hand in the Dark Shawl, and it takes like 15 seconds and the Mummy pops and u kill, i dont think we healed the Pally or any tank for that matter, at all... Easy stuff.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone else confirm this. My guild is planning a raid for The Hole and I have asked if we can try and get the Ratman Guard to spawn while we are there. I would like to make sure we are in the right area and not wasting my guilds time. Im sorry if this area has been covered before but I have never been past the entrance so I know nothing about the area.  Im guessing at level 51 it would be suicide to try and solo in the hole yet.<br />
<br />
I know this might be a newb question also but I tried to get in to Paineel the other day and got a message that it was locked and I didn't have they key. Where and what do I need to do to get the key?<br />

Thanks for any help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Skaarx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I saw Caradon up in the jail area.<br />
I think I also killed a ratman guard behind the bank area, well I actually killed a ratman, just dont remember his name ;)  He was a roamer. It is well possible that he roams past the bank (he was walking that way)</div></div><hr />

curse SOE, why? for throwing a curve ball into something you thought was gonna be easy?  btw im glad i read they were revamping the hole on Dev's corner and immediately finished that part, to bank unfortunately.  <br />
<br />
Anyone seen anything else cool in the hole revamp that doesnt have to do with epic...like raid mobs or anything.  i havent been yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Murgutroid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know this might be a newb question also but I tried to get in to Paineel the other day and got a message that it was locked and I didn't have they key.

<br />
To get into Paineel you need a Bone Crafted Key. And all you have to do to get that is get your Heretic faction up to amiable and ask one of the skelly guards in the newbie area for one.<br />
<br />
As far as the Ratman Guard, I've been down there a couple times since the revamp and haven't actually seen him, but I have seen the other kind of Ratman (Inhabitants) down past the bank. The ones I saw were closer to the broken gate, but the Guard may wander farther, I don't know. That's the only area I've seen any Ratmen in yet, so it's definitely where I'd start looking.<br />
<br />
If you still have business down there, I wouldn't sweat it. They changed all (most) of the mobs, but I don't think they really made them much harder. At 61 everything is green (even the huge Golems that  hang out in the first pit now) at least until you get past the jail. I don't think getting to the bank is really any harder than it ever was. I went down there with a single group (avg level was maybe 60) and we had no trouble at all. In fact, it was so easy we got bored and turned around by the time we hit the broken gate and just bum-rushed our way back to the top. We fought our way up to the tower and across the bridge and out without ever even slowing down. I think a single group in their low 50's could still probably do really well down there. <br />
<br />
The zone is different, and maybe more interesting with all the new mobs, but I don't think it's anything to worry about.</div></div><hr />

.... right up to the point when you go past the broken gate.<br />
<br />
After that the mobs in general were conning blue to 65th and we found that the Gargoyles were unmezzable (to 65) and mitigated slow.<br />
<br />
So be prepared</div></div><hr />

- Ghost - Left Graveyard - Skele spawns right (at castle)<br />
- Mimic AKA &quot;A Chest&quot; - In bank (secret wall)<br />
<br />
The spawn times suck , i think all the NPCs for SK epic are on a 3 to 4 day spawn at worst.  I have notices ppl exping Cara and killing him thinking hes an &quot;uber NPC with cool drops&quot; and ofcourse hes not, but, kills the timer.</div></div><hr />

Went down with a group today and two dropped back to back.<br />
<br />
I am not familiar much with the hole, but we got to the bank, and then went down the hall a bit, went left,, across a room and set up camp in a corner next to some doors and in site of a courtyard. I wish I knew the area better to give a more detailed description of the spot. But in that spot the puller was able to pull the bank and the wandering ratmen. Within in a couple of hours we had a tome and 2 cell keys. Now if I can just get the Ashenbones to be as generous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Had mine drop last night.  Was just surprised it took 9 hours to get just one, when most people who post about the key say they got it in 3 or 7 kills etc.  Guess making me kill over 70 is the game's punishment for the rest of my progress being relatively easy.</div></div><hr />
