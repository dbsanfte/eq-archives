<br />
I've been 3boxing ldons lately and if my pet is in any danger when im pet pulling i blast the pet with an SR on my cleric and you know me hitting the mob once or casting a spell on the mob makes the mob HOTT turn to me...but whenever i heal the pet the HoTT stays on the pet... so im thinking that healing the mobs with the cleric isn't getting any agro? If so this might present some options to me being able to pull hard ldons effeciently (i hate looking for other people normally just do ldons with my sk, bst, cleric and my wifes wiz and maybe one or two of her friends random classes...)<br />
<br />
Anyways any info appreciated on this i've pet pulled hard ldons abit but i would always get to a spot where the pet would just repeatedly eat it and give up on it in the past now with me SRing the pet this could be a non problem...</div></div><hr />

<br />
for some strange reason cheal does not give agro all the time from what I have seen, possibly other instant heals as well.  I saw this when i was boxing a cleric in hob for faction and he would miss the faction hit even though he had chealed me when the mob was at 40%.<br />
<br />
this may be what your seeing, but it is allot riskier as well, especially to relly on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One option is just to put a heal over time on the pet before you send him in, and get him to run his scrawny ass as fast as he can back. Breath of Trushar usually works for me, as I regularily group with a shammy friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">window</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it probably has to do with initial contact agro &amp; range agro being greater than the clerics heal agro at whatever distance... and other mobs only assist if a person/pet within whatever level is the target of the mob you're pulling.<br />
<br />
for example... if you sit when your pet has agroed a mob, the mobs agro shifts to you and adds come if any are in assist range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested it tonight in my ldon before work... f8 targetted a mob that past 2 other mobs told pet to attack didn't tell pet to back off till it was got to like 70% at which point i SR'd (supernal remedy) and then told pet to back off... no add's came so im wondering if this might be an effective way for me to 3box hard ldons eventually...?<br />
<br />
The reason i brought this up is before i would just SR the pet if he was at like 40% life cuz pet with virtue + kragg's &gt; then dealing with 2-3 normal ldon add's and was noticing no mobs agroing when i healed with cleric...<br />
<br />
Oh yah and btw i have HoTT if i pet pull and cast any spell on the mob the mob shifts to me or the person that cast the spell instantly even if i just stand in teh way of the mob and my pet (ie get into its agro range) the mob switchs targets to me... but it wasn't shifting target when i healed the mob and 1 cast of SR should be more agro then 1-2 hits my pet gets on the mob to pull it...</div></div><hr />

Edit:Im not refering to the fact that your healing your pets.</div></div><hr />

I have a shaman/mage combo I've played for years and have never drawn agro. I have recently brought up a cleric through the ranks and have never drawn healing agro with him as well.<br />
<br />
I always pet pull with a HoT on mister bones to ensure his survival on hard hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice idea, thanks, and I'm surprised this never occured to me.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed is that cleric spell Divine Intervention can be cast on a pet.  I've only done this a few times though and haven't seen it go off, so my testing is not scientific, but does anyone know for sure if DI will pop on Goner, and if so, under what circumstances?  Like, will a CHA buff increase the odds for DI on a pet?  <br />
<br />
But yeah, I guess if you can land BDA on Goner after his first swing, you can basically pet pull anything in game.<br />
<br />
I also three box LDoN's on my cleric, sk and enc.  I will also test agro healing on pets by hitting Goner with a Supernal Remedy a few times when he first gets agro and as he's running back.  Until now, I've just sent him in with Holy Elixer, and the 900 per tick on this has allowed me to use pet pull to get named mobs single out of mob clusters even in Kod'Taz.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Only problem is the door which can be sploited through but I wouldn't recommend anything illegal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravenar</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I use a pet with mage gear and Virtue.  There have not been many times that my pet does not get back to me before he needs healed.<br />
<br />
More importantly if you have a SOWer, have them cast their biggest SOW on the pet before they enter the dungeon.  <br />
<br />
Last but not least with pet affinity, Pack Shrew can be placed on a the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do I have to wait unitl the mob is already back to me before getting up...and do you think the cleric's healing aggro is affected by whether or not I am feigned?<br />
<br />
Like if I stand up,..and then the cleric heals....will he get aggro he would not have if I was still FD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) You just need to have yourself and pet out of agro range of other mobs.<br />
<br />
2) The cleric will not get agro period unless your pet dies and he is the only one standing and is within agro/melee range.</div></div><hr />
