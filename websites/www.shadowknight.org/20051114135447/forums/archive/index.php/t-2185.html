<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have been looking for an inclusive site but i couldn't find one so i have pasted all the info in this post so its in one spot. Happy hunting.<br />

Sirtha Scarscale says 'The sarnak are a mockery of the Iksar. They are nothing more than beasts fit only to do our bidding! I require you to bring me the sword of one of their Order of Knights and the head of a sarnak berserker. These beasts have been attacking our patrols of late. I also require a stone called a ruby and a banded helm. Do this and I shall make a helm for you. <br />
<br />
   The Sarnak Knight's Sword drops off a Sarnak Knight in the Burning Woods, this is a high level zone so be careful. Knight's are by the castle or inside the castle. The Sarnak Berzerker head drops at a rate of about 1 in 4 off of Sarnak Berzerkers in Overthere or Frontier Mountain and looks like a Skull. Hand these in with a ruby and a banded helm and you will be rewarded with a Dreadscale Helm AC 11, Int +5, Sv fire/cold/dis/poison/magic<br />
<br />
Sirtha Scarscale says 'I currently have need of a complete skeletal hand, for the research I am conducting. I wish to study its properties and form so that I can make gauntlets befitting our station. I also require two rubies that hold the stars within and some banded gauntlets to complete my ritual. Do that and the gauntlets are yours to keep. <br />
   The Skeletal Hand drops in the Lake of Ill Omen off of Charbone Skeletons. Drops at a rate of about 1 in 4. Graphic looks like a spiders leg. You then hand in 2 Star Rubies and the Banded Gauntlets for the following: <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sirtha Scarscale says 'Cactus quills can be very lethal. I seek to work them into my new boots. Find me these quills, a pair of skeletal feet, an emerald of fire, and some banded boots so that I may start working on them. Why are you still here?! Begone! <br />
   Cactus Quills are found off of Thorny Succelents in Overthere. They drop about every 1 in 6. The Pair of Skeletal Feet drops off the Thick Boned Skeleton in Kurn's Tower. This is a 1 in 4 drop approx. Item looks like whiskers or barracuda bones. <br />
Hand these in and you'll be rewarded with: <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sirtha Scarscale says 'The hideous Golra are hardy creatures. The tales indicate their ferocity almost matches our own. I wish to gain a trophy of one of these beasts. Bring me the skin of one, two blue sapphires, and banded sleeves. Then I shall give you these fine vambraces. <br />
   The Hulking Golra is a MOB in the Timorous Deep. Not sure on it's location there at this time, will post when I find that out <br />
Hand them in and you'll recieve: <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sarth Scarscale says 'Do you know the beasts that call themselves sarnaks? One such beast who calls itself Zorash attacked an envoy of merchants who were to deliver a pair of special boots to me. It taunts us by wearing them as a trophy. Bring me the skull of this Grachnist and the boots. Return them to me along with a star ruby and your banded greaves, and I shall craft you an excellent pair of greaves. <br />
<br />
    The Skull of Grachnist drops off of Grachnist himself a nasty MOB I wouldn't think of soloing till you are in your low 40's. Get a partner he'll spawn at the Northernmost Goblin Camp in Warslick's Woods. His skull only drops about one in 4 kills so this could be a long camp. Zorash's boots drop of Zorash, a named Sarnak in the Overthere. He spawns close to the tower just south of where you zone in from Warslick's. Keep killing everything there and he should spawn once every few hours. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sarth Scarscale says 'Have you ever encountered a drixie before? I crush every one I see. They are an annoyance beyond mere words! Kill the Queen and bring me her wings as a trophy along with an emerald of fire and a banded mask. <br />
<br />
The drixie wings drop off Lady Chromoire, a named Drixie in Firona Vie zone. If you kill enough Drixie's she'll pop. Hand this in with a fire emerald and a banded mask and get<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sarth Scarscale says 'Ahhhh....a breastplate you want, is it? Well, they are not easy to come by. Fetch me a scorpion chitin. Intact, mind you! They are extremely fragile and must be treated before they can protect your carcass. Also, fetch me a war braid from a sarnak to connect the pieces. I also require a ruby and your banded tunic. Do this and I shall make it for you, hatchling. Now, go! <br />
<br />
The Sarnak War Braid is a very common drop off of Sarnak Berzerkers in the Overthere. The Scorpion Chitin remained unsolved for many moons but now has finally been discovered! Zatharus of the Sarynn server informed me that his clutchmate Kletatelk has solved this quest. Many thanks for their info. The Chitin was taken from the slain body of a large heartsting scorpion. This scorpion was slightly lower in power than the legionary who was 22nd level. It is a new mob added on the patch January 9th, 2001. Other reports state that it may take a few kills before one will drop. <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Sarth Scarscale says 'Have you ever seen Bloodgills? I hear they will devour a broodling in seconds and that their scales are tough as iron. Bring me some of these scales, a banded bracer, and a sapphire as blue as the sky. Only then will I give the bracer to you, broodling. <br />
   Bloodgill Goblins inhabit the Lake in the Lake of Ill Omen. You can pull them from the lake onto the shore and you should be able to take them in your 30's I believe. The scales drop off them about 1 in 6. <br />
   Hand in these items and recieve:<br />
<br />
<br />
for some reason the pictures of the items are not being put in, anyone know why that is or how i fix it??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As stated previously, the Champions of Cabilis (http://www.iksar.org) website does have a comprehensive listing of all the Dreadscale quests, as well as the khukri quests and the quests associated with the other iksar classes.  Much of the information associated with the quests is missing from the above post, so take the time to visit this site - you won't be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TunnelRatX</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been trying to get Zorash to pop with no luck in OT.  Thinking about making a lvl 1 Ranger alt just to see if he's up or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">06-12-2002, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people go to the ruins near the mudpond or the tower near Warslik zone.  Personally, I grabbed a group and headed to the ruins north of the Frontier Mountain zone.  There are ALOT more spawn spot here giving a greater chance for a pop if you can keep them cleared.  I did this twice (having changed servers), and the second time was just myself (at 43) and a level 50 Necro.  Neither time did I spend more than 2 hours before he popped.</div></div><hr />
