<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, <br />
<br />
Im trying to camp the Eye of the Dark God in Plane of Fear.  However, Ive heard that if Cazic or golems are up, it will be almost a automatic DT... any suggestions on how i go about soloing this drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cryptia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did it with CT and the golems up, as soon as you zone in run back to the NW corner of the fire wall, then FD off any aggro. As long as you head straight there, you shouldn't have a problem. Just be sure CT isn't wandering around back there at the time, which he usually isn't. :p<br />
<br />
Clear a few odd wanderers back there first, then run through the fire and aggro the temple, target an AMY, run out of the fire, then snare your target once he comes through the fire and FD again.<br />
<br />
He'll stay right there while all the others reset. After 2 minutes your mem wipe should come and snare should wear off, stand up and nab him. Repeat as many times as you need, took me about 7-9, can't remember exactly now.<br />
<br />
Don't expect to do this with buffs, as the dispelling eyes are everywhere. I was repeatedly dispelled everytime I ran towards the castle and aggro'd it.<br />
<br />
Maybe that will help you or maybe I typed too much, I get carried away at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the same thing. Key is to make sure to wait for the message informing you that aggro has cleared before getting up from FD. <br />
<br />
There are tools that would help to keep track of wandering mobs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are tools that would help to keep track of wandering mobs too.<br />
<br />
Ew, somebody actually advocating using those &quot;tools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anybody else a bit nostalgic for the days when maps and the other &quot;tools&quot; didn't exist, and you had to play the game for real?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=advocating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wooot got the eye of the dark god... thanks for the help guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whenever I zone in the zone agros on me. Its never cleared.  So looks like im gonna need a group for this  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went solo a couple of times, but finally got the drop when I went up duo with another SK.  He took a DT once, because he forgot to wait for the clear message before standing up.  With 2 FD classes, it is easy to pull the whole AMY temple, snare (2 snarers is good, as they will resist now and then), wait for clear, and kill (if 2nd didn't get aggro from adds, he can solo the amy while you wait for clear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A group makes fear much harder pez.... you have tools for dealing with the extra aggro... if you have a group you will have to clear, whereas solo you don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really very hard to clear fear with a group of 66+ though.  I had been doing other epic stuff for the shammies so went in with (2) shaman, rogue, mage, and myself and we owned the place fast.<br />
<br />
The temple pull I just trained us and we took them all out at once.  In total I don't think I was there for an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I guess it would be more accurate to say that clearing isn't hard... it's just time consuming.  You can feign flop there and kill amy's to your heart's content with no break in solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tried this shits last night with full fear pop...<br />
<br />
<br />
Gah damn scarelings are worse than prots in PoG. I couldn't kill shit with the zone wide aggro from em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Othos El`Gimpo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds about right what I'll be experiencing as Covi in a bit, but here it goes. Update comin' soon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the group. I'm pulling for a monk friend or two, another sk, and 2-3 necro friends to accompany me. We all have the ability to clear aggro, and despite no healing, at least directly, the recourse heals between the necro's and sk's should help. PLus a huge amount of DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i got this drop today. it was easy.<br />
<br />
i camped it for several hours last night and killed every single amy in the zone (except those right near fright and dread) without a single death. when you zone in, just hightail it north to the temple with the fire ring around it. FD on the NORTH side of this temple and clear your agro. then buff up and get your pet up. walk through the fire toward the temple, touch the side of it then back immediately back up. it will agro just about everything inside the temple. when they run out, just target the closest amy and snare, as soon as snare lands, FD. after 2 mins you will get an agro clear message and a FD has worn off message about the same time. stand up, kill the mob, and repeat. they are very easily soloable, at one point i was soloing 3 at a time with no problem with only self buffs, and i only have EP level gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Othos El`Gimpo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haha hell yea, I got my drop in Fear after 3 kills. That strat listed above works flawlessly. Just got like 4 or 6 adds and killed them off and I had NONE after I got to Firewall of temple.<br />
<br />
Thanks for that tip!</div></div><hr />
