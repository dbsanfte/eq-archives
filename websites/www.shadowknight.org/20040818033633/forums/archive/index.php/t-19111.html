We, the Wayfarer's Brotherhood have discovered that powerful magical energies of a scale never before experienced have been focused deep within Miragul's Menagerie. Rumors persist that this magic is far more potent than any seen before; so powerful that the magic has created a physical form for itself. Deep within the heart of the Menagerie dwells this creature of pure magical energy, a unique form of life we have dubbed the Synarcana. <br />
If left unchecked, the Synarcana could destroy all of Antonica and warp the very foundation of our reality. The Wayfarer's Brotherhood is seeking a band of adventurers brave and true to root out the Synarcana before it becomes even more powerful. We are in desperate need of your help to control the rising menace of this presence. <br />
<br />
Beyond simple fame and bragging rights, one of the living participants in the first raid to successfully complete this task shall be rewarded with a gift from the real world. Curt Schilling, World Series Co-MVP pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks (Officially now a member of the Boston Red Sox), is so impressed by the incredible challenge presented by the power of the Synarcana, that he has pledged to grant a single signed jersey to one of the living participants of the first raid to topple the Synarcana. <br />
<br />
Do you have what it takes to destroy the mystical menace of the Synarcana? Be the first to do so and win Curt Schilling's jersey. <br />
<br />
The challenge officially begins Sunday, December 28, 2003, 5:00PM, Pacific Time. Our logs will determine who completes this challenge. The raid must be completed inside the time limit, and not during the 30 minutes after the raid is &quot;over.&quot; <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
