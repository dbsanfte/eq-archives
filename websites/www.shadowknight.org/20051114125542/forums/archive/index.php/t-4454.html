I am non KoS to Necros, been in the Necro Guild Several times, but Argest, and some of the Merchants still won't sell to me, and one Banker is still KoS....<br />
<br />
I'm Stumped, best I can do is assume it some sort of Residents Faction, but I've turned in enough Bone Chips to Choke Sontalak 5 times over.....<br />
<br />
Oh Yeah, and the banker and Argest con Ready to Attack.....</div></div><hr />

HOWEVER I was still able to turn the keys into him and get the piece i needed from him.  I got as far away from him as I could while still being close enough to trade and somehow got him to take it.  This didnt work the first time or two i tried it so dont give up, just keep handing them in and he'll take them eventually even if threateningly. :cool:</div></div><hr />
