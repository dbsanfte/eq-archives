<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leizark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight I couldn't sleep for some reason; so like any normal person, I logged on to EQ. Seeing that it was so late I decided to solo a bit in PoN.<br />
<br />
 Since fear kiting itsn't an option in that zone I naturally turned to agro kiting. I found a nice open area free of spawn and went to work.<br />
<br />
 I'm only lvl 58 right now so I was using all the dots availible to me at this lvl along with the lvl 58 Bob smacking the mobs hindquarters.<br />
<br />
 Then it got wierd. I would finally have him down to around 15% hp, then amazingly its hp would jump back up to 30%. First time I didn't really think anything of it, your random lag perhaps. Then it happened again....and again. Each time reaching around 15% hp and jumping back up to 30%.<br />
<br />
 I finally had to FD, kill pet and /q out.<br />
<br />
 I tried this a few more times on treants, ravens and one of the spiders. Each hit the magically 15% mark and refused to go any lower.<br />
<br />
 Has anyone besides me seen or had this happen to them at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stavanger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up, this happens in most PoP zones (all that I've tried to solo in anyway). Basically, if you get too far away from the mob when it's that low on health, it 'mends' up to 30%. Only thing you can do AFAIK is stick reasonalby close to the mob. When the mob drops below 30% I'll recast festering darkness so that it doesn't break when I'm trying to stick close, and run it around in quite a tight circle (easy with my horse). It's a royal pita, but hey.</div></div><hr />
