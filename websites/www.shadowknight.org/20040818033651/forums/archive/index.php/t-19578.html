<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Child's Tear(from PoF) and apprehensively TS faction.<br />
yes, I know shaman epic require max ally faction.<br />
<br />
Can shadowknight raise to max ally faction ? if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, you could conceivably run a few thousand Seals, or turn in a few thousand cold medicenes, or do multiple parts of the shaman epic over and over and over if you wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Taken from research into doing the epic on my Shaman, and conversations with others, none of the tips to MQ have been verified by me personally:<br />
<br />
The easiest part of the Shaman Epic to do (after the initial kill in OOT or Butcherblock) is &quot;The Test of Might&quot;.  Basically go through part of the shaman epic including talking to a drunk and sitting underwater for hours, then go to RM and kill a pally and an Sk over and over take thier weapons to a lesser spirit in West Karana (you'll need a tracker and the guy doesn't stop so you'll need to give him the items on the run) and  you get up TS faction.  Keep killing the guys in RM and doing turn in after that.  That's the only way I've heard of it.  Also shaman are very wary about the MQ'ed tear in regards to the faction issue. so you should go to max faction with the RM kills then make sure you tell the Shaman that.  Should get a pretty penny out of it but not sure it would be worth it for you unless you plan on doing the MQ more than once.  Though I've heard that after maxing faction you can also kill Black Dire in MM then do the turn in to the lesser spirit in TT and get the shaman mini-epic SoW boots.  No Drop but insta clicky sow from inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So you're saying that I can use the SHM SoW Boots even though I am an SK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nzab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seen two MQ's of the tear fail.  I have never seen a shaman mq of one fail, though, with no special faction work after epics.  I don't know if the NPC knows if it's a shaman, or not.  If I was non-shaman, I would definitely work TS faction before trying.<br />
<br />
As far as the boots, that's a good one.  I don't know if anyone has tried it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not sure that SKs can get TrueSpirit faction high enough to do the Shaman epic. I skipped parts of the Shaman epic with my shaman and was advised to get faction to max ally before trying the tear hand in - not sure SKs can get this high.<br />
<br />
The only part of the Shaman epic I've tried to do with my SK in order to raise faction was the one with the drunken shaman in the sewers ... i have high indif TrueSpirit faction and he wouldn't have a bar of me, I think because of my class not faction level. Sorry this is all a bit vague, was a long time ago but just a heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since I also 2-box a 65 epic shaman I was crusing through the Crucible forum, and it was as I expected and earlier posted.  The general consensus is that the tear CANNOT by mq'ed by anyone other than an ally TS faction Shaman.<br />
<br />
Recently, a bard posted to say he had done it (although he wiped on the mob).  However, he was unable to show a SS of it to prove it when they called him on it.  He also was unable to provide a SS of the Wandering Spirit in WK con to show ally.  So, looks like the tear is wasted in your bank, Vaelenu, which means if it drops on a Fear raid, have the already epic'ed shaman loot it for a MQ, if there is no shaman that needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Originally posted by Keevel <br />
then go to RM and kill a pally and an Sk over and over take thier weapons to a lesser spirit in West Karana (you'll need a tracker and the guy doesn't stop so you'll need to give him the items on the run) and  you get up TS faction. <br />
The Wandering Spirit in West Karana will stop moving if you hail him.<br />
<br />
Easiest way to build up faction is to kill the two mobs in Rathe Mountains and repeat the turn-in over and over.  Dunno if SKs can get Truespirit faction high enough to MQ the tear, what I've always heard is that only a shaman with max ally faction can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vaelenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't have a tear in my bank, not sure why you thought I did. I did the epic on my Shaman and tried doing the test of wisdom with my SK to raise TrueSpirit faction as it is helpful to me for the SK epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We cannot.  I had a tear and max ally with Truespirit.  Raky ate my tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can we MQable the shaman epic ?<br />
<br />
That has to be the most retarded (ab)use of an acronyme I ever saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sadly you cannot use the sow boots from the shamen epic in your invintory... i have tried and it says your diety, race, or class cannot use this item ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ourok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you gotta be a shaman to MQ the shaman epic from what ive heard.... thats kinda ironic... because if ive done my epic already as a shaman i probly dont wanna even see the parts again hehe</div></div><hr />
