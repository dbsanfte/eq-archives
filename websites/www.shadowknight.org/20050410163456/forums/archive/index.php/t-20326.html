<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Friend of mine is quiting EQ and is graciously giving me his account, and on his account a element eqiuped Shadowknight lvl 65 81 AA's, unguilded.  Currently I have a 61 rogue and a lvl 51 warrior so know a lil bit about tanking and such :)<br />
<br />
Well, I know absolutely nothing about Sk's and I thought this would be the best place on some tips for pulling, tanking, and what not.<br />
<br />
I need knowledge on...(the sk has all lvl 65 spells pre ldon)<br />
<br />
1.  What spells do i use to pull with?<br />
<br />
2.  What spells should i use for aggro control?<br />
<br />
3.  Whats the SK's main job during a raid usually?<br />
<br />
4.  What buffs are a must before a exp grind? (virt,kei, ect)<br />
<br />
5.  What are the good GoD AA's?<br />
<br />
6.  And lastly, how the heck would u 2box a rogue and sk on the same computer?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks guys, i appreciate any help!!  I look foward to reading your tips when im work!  Thanks agian fellas, ill post a magelo when i can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. most likely you wont be pulling but if you are and tanking cast an aggro spell.<br />
<br />
2.  clinging darkness and fear.  the low lever versions of both<br />
<br />
3.  your probably wont be offtanking so assist and melee.  cast zevfeers bite and also aura of hate if you have lots of melee in the group.  <br />
<br />
4. best buffs combo is.  KEI, symbol of kazad, blessing of the 9, focus of the seventh, brells stalwart shield, and vallons quickening. self mana or hp tap too.  then any utilty buffs liks damage shields or resists.<br />
<br />
5.  havent bought any yet cause they all look like crap to me<br />
<br />
6.  get EQwindows.  better have a good comp and connection though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likely you may get a few... less than favorable... responses to your post.<br />
<br />
That said, the best thing that you can do is just lurk and read here.  All the questions you have asked have been answered here in the various forums, and not that old that you have to dig back several pages.  The forums are divided out in a logical manner and you should be able to find what you are looking for by reading some of the stickies and a bit of search for more specific information.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. Depends.  If you're working on a split of snarable mobs, and a successful split matters, use festering darkness.  Non-snarable casters, use cancel magic.  Where timing matters, use a bow.  Pulling is a &quot;learn by doing&quot; thing.  No hard rule for all situations.<br />
<br />
2. CD and Fear.  Since you played a warrior, you should know how taunt works (shhh, dont need to argue the validity of that =P).  There is no snap agro that rivals the taunt button.  For maximum effect, press taunt *then* cast an agro spell to give a big buffer.<br />
<br />
3. Again, depends.  Until you gain more familiarity with the class and can spot the places you should jump in, just do what runcade said.  You have snares, FD, harmshield and massive agro generation at your disposal ... keep an eye out for where those would be useful in pulling situations.  You're a 3rd rate tank with decent lifetaps and massive agro ... watch for where that would be useful in add situations.  Dont think we need to give much away here, its pretty obvious when you keep your tools in mind and see what goes on in raids.<br />
<br />
4. Soloing at 65 sucks ass, dont do it under any circumstances.  Grouping, *shrug*, in-group buffs are fine.  There should be no need to get external buffers in any situation.  You come with your own C3 at all times (pact of hate).<br />
<br />
5. There are no good GoD AA's.  But theres plenty of worthwhile Luclin/PoP AA's that should keep you busy for another 200 points.  No joke, take resists over that GoD crap.<br />
<br />
6. www.eqwindows.com<br />
<br />
Good luck.  Its a damn fun, if misunderstood, class.  No one is gonna hand you a role, you're gonna have to make it.  Thats part of the fun.  I highly recommend finding a veteran SK buddy on your server who doesnt mind fielding your questions in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfavorable response time.<br />
<br />
Drifting, please, do yourself, your friend and the rest of the SK community a favor and don't try to play a level 65 toon you have no experience with.<br />
<br />
You're going to be missing all of the skills that you would have developed over the course of leveling and playing that character.<br />
<br />
Not that there aren't plenty of asshats out there who simply twink up and PL a character on another account and do the same thing, but you're in a unique position, in that you've just been handed a fully equipped toon that has (presumably) a name for himself and has been played decently in the past.<br />
<br />
If you want to learn the SK, and are hell bent on playing the one that was given to you, I'd suggest you only do so in groups of close friends who all know what the situation is.  Let them know before hand that this character was given to you, that you don't know how to play it, and that you're going to be fucking up for a while.  That way, when you do, they'll know that it's because you don't have the experience with that character and they'll be more likely to over look your mistakes while you learn.  Under no circumstances should you play in pick up groups with this character until you know the toon and the class at least as well as the class of your main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm.<br />
<br />
This guy liked you enough to give you his EP equipped SK, but not enough to give you a 10 minute rundown on how to play it?<br />
<br />
That sounds extremely odd.<br />
<br />
In any case, better check he's made sure a few of his friends know about you, or you'll be branded an ebayer the first time you come in contact with them.<br />
<br />
Yantis' customers use the &quot;friend left me his account&quot; line so often that as an unskilled level 65 player, you'll need to be able to prove your innocence.<br />
<br />
Groff's advice of staying out of raids and pickup groups for a fair while is good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldnt spend real life money on a made up person, in a computer game.  <br />
<br />
All of his ingame friends know he gave his account to me and they are all willing to help me figure out how to play the sk, so in that aspect im good.<br />
<br />
With that being said, thanks for the responses.  Even the unfavorable responses carried some weight.<br />
<br />
First off, I will not jump into pickup groups with the SK until i know what the hell im doin.  That being said, i will prolly work with my sk with my guild, Ill do guild only groups until i know what doing.  This will take a while, but thats ok.  I am willing to learn about a class I haven't played yet.<br />
<br />
DLed EQW, i like it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You might also, if you're planning on keeping this toon, invest in a name change.  While you've  not really done anything terribly wrong, it might help to distance yourself from your friend's name and reputation, which can help with minimizing misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
<br />
All it takes is one person bitching about &quot;fucking ebaying noob assholes&quot; on your server board to mess up your reputation while you're learning your character.<br />
<br />
And be sure that your friend really is gone for good and won't be coming back wanting his toon back before you go and change the name. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1. What spells do i use to pull with?--<br />
<br />
For fast agro, fast tags, use a bow- I use a bow 99% of the time in places like sol ro<br />
For summoning mobs, careful on using damaging spells especially on a longer pull where Festering will have done enough to get you summoned<br />
CD<br />
Fear<br />
Proximity<br />
It's going to be situational depending on whether you are doing the pulling and tanking, or you are pulling to an MA, or you are tagging off a puller, etc.<br />
<br />
I'd advise going somewhere fairly safe and practising how to FD split, etc- CoM is a good place for this. <br />
<br />
When you do get comfy playing him and join pickup groups there are going to be people who are used to good SKs and will expect you to be able to pull well- and others who will have no idea that SKs can do anything but hold agro and look cool. Be ready for both instances.<br />
<br />
2. What spells should i use for aggro control?<br />
CD, Fear (Terror if the level of the mob is in question), and the non spell things like taunt, sit, etc. Getting agro is easy, agro control is the next step. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Whats the SK's main job during a raid usually?<br />
Tanking, offtanking, tankmezzing, saving the chanter's ass, pulling, voicing, kiting, distracting, dragging.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. What buffs are a must before a exp grind? (virt,kei, ect)<br />
K/9s, C4 or C5 (Pact of Hate is 1 mana per tick more than KEI), shammy buff if you can get em, beastie crack, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. What are the good GoD AA's?<br />
The ones they gave the Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some extra advice, since your bullets have been answered.<br />
<br />
Learn your spells.  Get comfy with their mana cost, casting times, and refresh rates.  Clinging Darkness and Death Peace will be your best friends.  Especially FD in your situation.  :)<br />
<br />
Go someplace easy and practice pulling (FD splitting), aggro kiting, and fear kiting.  Play with your pet and get used to his idiocy.  After that, get in a group and practice aggro management (taking, keeping, and losing aggro).  <br />
<br />
Warn those you group with that you are a green sk, and you want any advice that they can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As an SK you will usually be MT and assisting someone else on pulls.  Just do a /assist &lt;puller&gt; and cast festering darkness at max range on incoming pull.  Unlike others here, I dont care much for the fear for aggro method....your 2 lower level &quot;terror&quot; spells work just as well (better in my experience).  Also, make sure you cast your best &quot;voice&quot; spell on yourself and keep it up.  You will also need to become familiar with FD splitting.....you can practice this on much lower level mobs solo somewhere so you don't wipe your group:-)  Don't worry about learning to fear-kite as you will never use it at 65....even aggro kiting is a bit useless and i would definitely not suggest it until you are familiar with the character (don't want to screw around aggro-kiting BoT or PoS mobs:-).  As far as buffs go, KEI is a must and any HP buffs you can get are good as well....I disagree with getting kazaad + Bo9 unless you have a 62ish cleric and druid in your group (these spells have very short durations compared to Virtue).  As far as 2 boxing a rogue and SK, this would have been great for fear kiting pre-level 59, but is useless post 59...would suggest LFG with friends.  Your job in a raid will vary.....you will likely not be the MA or SA, as a 65 warrior with /disc def is far better at tanking raid level mobs.  You can use your group mana/HP taps to help your group in a raid, plus you can assist on corpse summons, aggro control, offtanking, etc.</div></div><hr />

I do appreciate all the replies and I tried out the SK last night in a all guild group in PoV, I went MT, did ok.  No deaths! Wooo!<br />
<br />
I used many spells, tryin them all out, seeing what worked, what didnt, what caused too much aggro, what caused not enough, ect.<br />
<br />
After i get my 2nd comp rigged up, ill be able to 2box<br />
<br />
Cant wait :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">FYI, 2boxing a tank and a melee will prove to be quite difficult.  Getting and keeping aggro + mob placement is a full time job...Would be much easier if you were 2boxing the SK with a caster of some sort.  I'm sure it can be done, but don't expect it to be easy (especially being new to the class:-)<br />
<br />
P. S. - BTW, just dinged 63 (I almost don't suck anymore...lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Very interesting thread.<br />
<br />
I would have suggested running a noob SK up to about level 50 before ever touching the 65 toon.  Sure expected flames, flames and more flames...<br />
<br />
Chalk it up to a slow week and the availability of newtank...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can offer some unique perspective on your situation, as I am the only person I know of who 2boxes a SK and a rogue 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
I really like running the SK and the rogue on the same machine using EQW.  I set it up so that one window is almost directly on top of the other, with both windows at the same resolution.  Since my SK is always MT and my rogue always wants to be behind the mob, my characters are always looking directly at each other.  I find this very helpful for keeping my bearings and for mob positioning.  Also, it doesn't take very long before you can judge whether the other character is out of melee range using this method.  This allows for very quick corrections.<br />
<br />
You will find that you can be much more efficient if you pay attention to character positioning before mobs get to camp.  Get your SK facing the direction that the pull will come from, so you can pull it directly in with your agro spells.  You will want your rogue out in front of your SK, facing the SK, so that as soon as the mob gets to the SK, your rogue is already in attack position.  Remember to hide/sneak your rogue to help avoid agro from the incoming mob.<br />
<br />
2boxing a SK and a rogue, you can learn a LOT about agro management.  I keep agro primarily with CD, using spears for dps and a little extra agro.  Since you have control of both the agro spells and evade, it is very easy to keep agro on the SK once you get the timing down.<br />
<br />
The biggest challange during chain pulling is making the transition from mob to mob when there are runners.  I have my rogue chase runners while my SK gains agro on the next mob.  This takes some getting used to as you have to be able to make a lot of quick movements on both characters at the same time.  Also, if there isn't another mob incoming when the last mob starts to run, make sure you get your SK down to med as quickly as possible while your rogue finishes off the runner.  As MT, you don't get much med time so grab it when it's available.<br />
<br />
I really love SK atk taps, it's so nice to have that permanent atk buff for my rogue.  Also, since you always have a rogue for dps, your SK can really pay attention to agro, lifetaps, etc rather than being overly concerned about dps.  I would say that AC/HP buffs for your SK and haste for both are the most important outside buffs.  KEI is nice but you can always run with Deathly Temptations or Pact of Hate for mana regen.  I very rarely have KEI on my SK and mana isn't really a problem.<br />
<br />
I guess the biggest thing I can offer you is that in order to successfully 2box a SK with a rogue, you need to think of both characters as you &quot;mains&quot; rather than one as a main and the other as a bot.  Both require your full attention at all times in order to run efficiently.  At this point, this is second nature to me, I kind of think of my two characters as a single mob shredding machine rather than two individual characters.  This is different than how most people 2box but, in my opinion, far more fun.<br />
<br />
Good luck and if you have any other questions, please ask!<br />
<br />
Edit:  A couple more things...first, learn to play without ever using your mouse (during combat at least).  It is a huge pain in the neck to find your mouse pointer every time you switch windows.  <br />
<br />
Second, the reason I said I position my windows *almost* directly on top of each other is so that I can see my backstab button when I am in the SK's window.  You want to hit that button the second it pops so seeing it is very important.  After a while, you will get a sense of timing and you will be able to switch windows, hit backstab, and go back to the SK without even thinking about it.  But until then, make sure you can see that button!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks for your reply bro, Ill use your strat out tonight and see how it works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd suggest slowing down a little bit.  One night in PoV is a start, but more seasoning will be needed.  Not that I think what you are doing is instant death (though it may be), but you still have a bit to learn about the SK.  Learn what he can do in a dungeon, learn how to control agro, not just jump to the top of the list.  MTing is fine,  but getting agro and having the gear to take a beating long enough to get a heal isn't the whole game.  Yeah your SK is a blast and you just want to jump right into him, but I'd suggest that taking your time may help improve long term enjoyment.<br />
<br />
edit - I can english<br />
<br />
note on the politeness of the thread: The original poster has also not responded to any of the warnings or criticisms defensively which is buying him credibility and is rarely seen.  <br />
<br />
Note to the original poster:  If someone suggests that you trade all your gear for a fungi and a two-tined pitchfork and delevel to 55 to get AA's in KC - just nod and smile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Aye, I will most def learn the class a lot more.  There so much about this class, im falling in love with EQ agian.  Very scary thought.  <br />
<br />
Went to Chardok, tanked agian, fucted up a couple times tryin to FD pull.  Its ok though, im still learning :)<br />
<br />
Have to work on the whole timing thing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Arches Nie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I agree with the idea of making a new SK and leveling it up a bit until you are more comfortable with the class.  Thats what I did when I was taking care of my best friends 65 shammy.  Ended up wasting some time cause my friend came back to EQ, but thats besides the point.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm guessing the guy your talking about is Newtank? LoL<br />
<br />
But yes, I am enjoying playing him very much.  Very confusing at first, lotta new buttons! YaY!!  <br />
<br />
Took SK on a small pick up raid for Xanamech, learned some new things, very interesting.  Landed a Ht for 8000dmg, that was neat! :)  Got the kill shot.<br />
<br />
Thanks agian for the replies.  Got one more question though,  I have the greaves that cast Cloak of Ahheva(there name escapes me atm)  What should I get to upgrade them. They are 40ac decent stats and hp, but I think I can do tons better.  I thinking Nro ldon greaves?  Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkcorruption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">if you ever dont want your SK anymore email me at Daniel_85222@hotmail.com lol jk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Before you start asking gear questions, you need to set up a Magelo. With 4.8k hps, I highly doubt Ornate greaves are your weakest slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Drifting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You are correct sir, but  I think that would be one of the easier slots to upgrade.  The ldon greaves from Nro look for nice.  Might try for those asap.  Only in guild groups though, dont want to embarass myself too much. :)<br />
<br />
Need a earring slot though, gotta earring of solstice in left, thinking maybe lupine frenzy or maybe masquito leg, dont have too much plat atm :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Legs and BP from LDON are good ones to get.  Both are among the harder pieces to get filled with elemental armor.   Especially if you get either the legs or the BP augmented, you'll have a good piece that will let you feel comfortable about your gear for a good long time.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't get anything but the legs or BP even if your slots are junk, till you get the legs or BP.  I don't like the idea of putting a lot of work into an item and then quickly replacing it.  You will likely see many elemental bracers, sleeves, wrists, gloves before you see some elemental legs or BP's.<br />
<br />
If you can scrape some cash together, bloodmetal earring of engagement is a good one.  That runs about 20k or less on my server, so you may have to save up for a while.  Solstice earring is perfectly fine for a while, while you upgrade other slots.<br />
<br />
Cultural armor is cheap these days, by the way.  Check out the stats and the prices -- much better for some races than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Prylos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">driffting yours deffinatly is a unique case. If i may make a suggestion.. I understand you are probably enjoying the new &quot;toy&quot; you've recieved, but your are a greenhand at the sk thing...and if im not mistaken.. sks are considered the &quot;less popular, and least played&quot; class..some others even believe they are worthless period. So i must come to the conclusion all of us play an Sk because they are fun, and most people probably role-play with them. Just my 2cp but i would suggest making you own sk and playing him all the way up, using your friends sk as a role model...then even passing down some of the' non-no drop&quot; gear to you sk. <br />
<br />
thats jus my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">One thing I didn't see mentioned - if your friend knew any SKs, it wouldn't be a bad thing to get some small groups that included all people who knew the situation, and learn in that setting from the SK.   You could try the techniques and play style he shows you,etc.<br />
<br />
I also strongly agree with the idea of building your own SK to at least a low level to get a bit of the &quot;flavor&quot; of how the progression went at lower levels .... I'd say you'll understand the class better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you haven't done so already -<br />
Level an Sk up to 30<br />
it's not to hard and it's pretty quick now-a-days<br />
You can make your stupid mistakes and no one will really flip out<br />
30 is the level where you really have at least one of each spell line you are going to get (bite excluded), but you'll start getting the idea.  (oh and fight in dungeons, you learn more, but usually the hard way there)</div></div><hr />

 Unlike others here, I dont care much for the fear for aggro method....your 2 lower level &quot;terror&quot; spells work just as well (better in my experience).  Also, make sure you cast your best &quot;voice&quot; spell on yourself and keep it up....As far as buffs go, KEI is a must and any HP buffs you can get are good as well....I disagree with getting kazaad + Bo9 unless you have a 62ish cleric and druid in your group ....  <br />

If your using terrors at all, much less voicing yourself to hold aggro, you will always suck compared to any SK just using Darkness+Fear. try it, you might like it.<br />

If you have the opportunity to get Kazad+Bo9 get it. If your begging for buffs at nexus rock in PoK, then go virtue, otherwise, get the 9+Kazad.</div></div><hr />
