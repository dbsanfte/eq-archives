<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ukbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read through the sticky on AA Exp, it was great, thanks to all who contributed to it.  I intend of follow advice from the AA sticky and do CA1, CS1 ND1, and then do Physical Enhancement (PE).  However, some questions came to mind.  The sticky indicated that you received the max benefit from PE after doing first levels of CA,CS, ND, so does this mean that the benefits of PE do not continue as the character's abilities improves with more AA levels?  Does PE do a one time enhancement on existing stats/abilities, or does it continue to improve your character as you gain aa levels?  If it is a one time enhancement, then isn't it best to complete all levels of CA,CS,ND to get the most out of PE?<br />
<br />
I'm an Ogre SK, only three and a half blue bars into level 65, and have just begun grinding AA exp, putting 100% into AA with no reg exp for a while.  After I get the defensive AA's out of the way, I'll do a 90%AA, 10% reg exp split, but thought it important to completely focus on AA now. <br />
<br />
I've just completed my first seven AA levels:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Combat Agility 1<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

If you dont have them to atleast 1 then you dont get the increase PE provides until you get them to at least 1. Once you get the increase, that's it, it doesn't scale and it doesn't go away.<br />
<br />
You could do PE first, but it would improve 0 because you dont have the others yet. <br />
<br />
The reason you should do it after getting them to all to level 1 is also AA cost vs improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, this is to maximize the value of the AA's you purchace.  To buy PE earlier would mean you bought something you can't fully utilize yet.  <br />
<br />
Buying the others first doesn't lessen them in any way, you get the full benefit while you are saving for the next purchace.</div></div><hr />
