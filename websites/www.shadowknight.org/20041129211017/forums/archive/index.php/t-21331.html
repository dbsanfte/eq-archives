<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think the best thing that SOE can do to regain some balance and to instill some new life into EQ is to introduce 5 or 10 more levels for characters.<br />
<br />
There are just too many people all at level 65 with very little room to improve thier characters anymore. There is not that much difference between have 100 AA's and 150 AA's.<br />
<br />
This would also help the casual / non-raiding players. As a non-raider / light raider I could think to myself...well, I can't kill these now, but with 5 more levels I bet we could single group kill mob X.<br />
<br />
The power gamers would all charge up to 75 and have fun in that nasty GoD content (instead of them lowering the GoD content). <br />
<br />
Also, maybe then a level 70 sk could tank as well as a level 65 warrior.<br />
<br />
Would it make old content obsolete - no. It would make the older content the domain of the casual players and family style guilds while the power gamers would not need / want the drops from the older stuff because the are getting bigger/better drops from GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't you realize that it's the treadmill that wears people out.  You get levels but the grind is the same ole same ole.<br />
<br />
Those of you around 55-65 now (with any char), can't tell me that PoV doesn't feel just like a higher level DL. <br />
<br />
Great welcome to your 5-10 more levels and same cookie cutter experience.  Until they stop making every zone (with few wonderful exceptions, mind you) out of the same mold, all levels are going to do is lengthen the treadmill that you're on before you burn out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually PoV feels nothing like DL to me, and I spent a LOT of time in DL back in the day. I agree that treadmills suck, but there needs to be progression.<br />
<br />
We know now that they're adding 5 more lvls, but I'd have been happy with any kind of noticeable progression. It's just that adding lvls is the easiest way to make characters more powerful.</div></div><hr />
