This weapon should at least be on par with the paladin swarm pet weapon but its not in anyway. Further from it its alot harder to get as well.<br />
We all know what it is , every class gets some nifty weapon with a cool grafic and good dmg dly and a pet proc that wields their epic. Ours is sub 28 dly and SUBSTANTIALY less dps then the other 2hander swarmpets because of the lack of a 2h dmg bonus. And the grafic looks goofy to its sposed to be fearsome , not some Englarged caster dagger (&quot;The putrid fish&quot;).<br />
Post feedback flame away etc , i hope this is changed sometime , like the dly is uped to 28 and dmg uped to 39 er so to compensate</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only Melees.<br />
<br />
Thats weird, Is the pet LIKE the class of the caster?<br />
<br />
Used to be, but SK one was overpowered cause it could HT, so they nerfed it to a warrior pet.<br />
<br />
Like does the warrior melee?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Does the wizzy one cast????<br />

There is no wizard one.<br />

dmg/dly makes me feel cheated... If I could wield the paladin one, I would. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

dps would be less than my cudgle it seems<br />
<br />
Although what do the pets do I think i parsed a beastlord one at 80dps once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last time I prased it the proc came out to 17.83 dps over a 7 hour exp session in PoE.  The melee damage was 85 or so with 1550 atk if I remember right (don't have the log anymore and didn't write down the melee damage just the proc damage).  Anyways, ours and the Paladin weapons were parsed and the result was they were very similar in melee dps, ours had a slight advantage (~2% was a very good/long parse to so its accurate).  The only good thing a Spear of Fire has over our weapon is the fact that due to its higher delay its more friendly to casting between swings, but Paladins can't be attacking a mob during cures/heals and only stuns so that benefit is minor to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkreapyr</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would pet proc enough to switch it in and out just for a pet ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thuggo</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pets are very short lived.  It's a toy weapon more than anything.  Our weapon is ok, go check out the rogue and monk swarm pet weapons.  They are both very rare and the damn monk one looks like a balloon.  Poor monks after all they've been through to saddle them that. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggthegrmreapr</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">let the pets HT, and then it would make it a better weapon...  of course the pallys would bitch then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sesshou</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone would bitch, and for good reason.  A proc that does ~1000 + whatever melee the pet does would be kind of nuts.  I am surprised that the weapon parses out to about the same as the paladin weapon in raw melee damage, I had thought that two handers of less than 28 delay were effectively worthless.  Looks like I may have to rethink a thing or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkenesis</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't use swarm sword full time unless they redid the dmg/dly.... I'm still very inclined to use 40dlyish weapons.  I cast a lot.  Like the only non-damaging spell I don't have lined up on raids is Death Peace.</div></div><hr />
