Spent the last hour using search to find it and thus far no luck.  Anyone able to point me in the right direction?</div></div><hr />

They suck as we have better alternatives.<br />

They need to be fixed/retuned/scrapped.<br />

The end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guild I apped to on my server has a SK that insists that terrors are great, so I was digging through for some of the terror posts to help point out that terrors suck.  That specific one I wasnt able to locate, which is why I ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10. Fear/Terrors: Fear needs it's bugged aggro component removed, the spell is a poor substitute for an aggro spell and I can't think of any SK that enjoys having to use it for non damage aggro, it's slow casting, long refresh, and just plain gimp. Terrors need a complete overhaul. The mana:hate ratio needs to improve significantly with each upgrade in addition to a change in the amount of hate generated by these spells, the first one is fine, but from there they need to scale up to 1400 or so for Terror of Thule and 1950 or so for the OoW one. These spells are meant to be our taunt spells, let them be the most effective aggro generators we have. The current spells provide less in the time it takes to cast and refresh than a Warrior will generate with procs on his mainhand only in melee combat.<br />
<br />
Do a search for things like &quot;Terror AND parse&quot; and you'll come up with quite a few discussions.<br />
<br />
IMHO the main issue with Terrors is the near-requirement of you being in melee range. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personal experience: Terror is absolutely and completely worthless as an agro getter if the mob is out of melee range. Given that the times you need a quick snap on a mob is usually because it's running over to a cleric to beat the shit out of it, you don't want to have a spell up that's useless at long range.  <br />
<br />
I keep Terror and Fear up together only if we're doing a raid or event where we are mezzing a lot and there's no chance I'll be tanking- Terror then for me is just another nondamage spell that I can hit while waiting for the long refresh on Fear. Those are the times I don't want to have CD up for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
If I'm MA on Time Trials, I use Terrors and Fear. Again, because my personal playstyle is that I like to have two spells to alternate between to keep me from falling asleep :p and I don't want to take a chance that I'm on a mezzable by mistake (which happens if the chanter asks for an assist for unmezzable and then cycles too quickly to the mezable for some reason and you are on the wrong mob). <br />
<br />
So while I agree that they suck, I won't be a snob and say I never use them. I do, situationally, and that's just my playstyle. I do not have any issues with agro and tend to use fear 99% of the time. Terrors are there for an additional quick nondamage agro in situations where fear hasn't popped, and I don't like to worry about a dot. However I have a crapload of mana so don't worry about the additional mana cost. I never would even think of relying on them in exp groups, LDON, etc.  They augment my main agro spell, nothing more.<br />
<br />
All other times it's CD or Festering all the way.</div></div><hr />

Instead, get him out somewhere with you, with folks watching so he can eat his words, and have an aggro contest...him with his terrors, you with fear and cd. No one even turns on attack. Once he admits to being wrong ( or just stands there like a fool in denial ), /duel him and kick his ass for wasting your time.</div></div><hr />

Basically Raev, when it comes down to it: there are two types of SKs. Those who read SK.org and those who suck.</div></div><hr />

There is occasionally some overlap in those categories.</div></div><hr />

Search under my name or posts that I started. Think I authored the latest request for Terrors to be fixed, and stated why in that post (Arena).</div></div><hr />
