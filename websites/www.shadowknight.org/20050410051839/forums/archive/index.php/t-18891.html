<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Illia's is not very helpful with this since there's so many factions, and people were submitting bad info.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on taking the pet crew in to take down the Praesertums, and I decided that factioning up for this job isn't a bad idea.<br />
<br />
I tried swarming Recuso's for a bit, but then I realized that Though Leeches and Spire Spirits gave faction hits the same as Recuso's, as well as Seru and Citizens of Seru factions.  Does anybody know if Lord Seru is the only mob that will aggro when Seru faction is KoS?  I could really care less about Citizen faction, obviously.<br />
Also, I didn't notice Hand Legionnaire faction ever raising, so I went to Katta Castellum and sure enough, killing a guard raised it.  I don't think we are ready for the faction time sink of bottoming out Katta factions and then bringing them the whole way back up just to get that one faction up.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know which factions actually matter to travel through Sanctus Seru to get to the Praesertums?  Which factions they will aggro on?  I can assume one will aggro if I am KoS to its particular guild, but I'm not sure about the Seru faction.  Likewise, are all guards on Hand of Seru also on Hand Legionnaire?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind just casting invis and CoTH'ing all to a saferoom each time, but the mage is skeptical on being KoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">only tower i know that has a see invis mob that would block a cother from getting to a saferoom is the NE one, its a GM on the first floor standing between the stair entrances.<br />
<br />
As for factions, kill in a praesterum tower, all of sseru hates eachother, when your killing in one tower, another tower's faction will be raised. go get 1 of the praesterums done, then you should be non kos to one of the other towers(huge ass faction hit) go to that tower next.<br />
<br />
iirc all of the towers have a safe room at the top that you can coth to. only one that is problematic is the NE one mentioned, but you can just have your mini raid kill him first, nothing else added on us when we killed him to get a cother up.</div></div><hr />
