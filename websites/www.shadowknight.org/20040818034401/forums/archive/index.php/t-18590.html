<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styggve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ill be holding a hunt for insignias on sunday and could use some info on the nameds.<br />
<br />
Ive tried searching here but no info on how &quot;strong&quot; they are. On allakhazam Ive seen everything from 2 groups to 50 people getting wiped. And allakhazams info is always so correct :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Altho the 50 people getting wiped must have lousy tactics <br />
<br />
Im curious, how many people will I need?  We are all 65 but not elemental equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The third floor named are not hard, they just have a bazillion hp.  One group is fine, but bring as much DPS as you can to speed up the process.<br />
<br />
And don't forget a rogue to open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I couldnt imagine doing it it with 1 group, it would be so friggin slow.  The named are a joke, but take forever and a day to kill.  They do spawn pretty ooften, I would suggest bringing a bunch of people though, you you can clear them as they spawn.  If you can clear all the spawns you get about 5-7 insignias in an hour.  with 1 group becuase mobs have such huge hp/ac (especially named), you probably end up getting 1 or 2 an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best done with 3-4 groups, once your the room, single pull are easy, as long as you keep the room under control. With 3-4 group should be able to clear the room or come close to before repops.<br />
<br />
Best advise kill all 4 guards outside the room, pull the 2 door guards and kill them in that room. Enter the room, pick a side left or right. clear that corner, move raid to corner, chain pull to that corner until next corner is clear, move to next corner, rise repeat until everyone who need insignia has it. Named spawn commonly. <br />
<br />
As for the different named, General is melee fight. My parses showed as having around 240k-250khp, so be ready for a long fight. Advisor is biggest bitch and any add's or wipes you have are probably due to him, less HP then gerenal(noticeable less), but likes to aoe grav flux so have DMF/bobbing corpse up, makes for a fun little fight, great when you weren't ready for grav flux and start getting dmf up mid fight. Arbitior, is a caster, probably the weakest of the 3. All 3 are easily snareable if you need to split them, however The arbitor likes dispel snare off himself and if the advisor get to close you get the joy of FDing while being grav fluxed. The room can go from being a long boring camp to hair raising raising time in a matter of seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure that the Advisor is always facing a corner when you fight him.  The gflux will send any unlev'ed people to the other side of the room and agro whatever is not cleared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Styggve, I don't know if you did this already or not, but I would recommend at least 2 groups.  Vany and I did it last night with a single group, and it was a 25 minute fight against the Advisor.  Luckily we only needed one insignia.  The group makeup was Sk (me), War, Rog, Enc, Cleric, Druid.  Would have been light on healing if we didn't have two healers.</div></div><hr />
