<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can anyone give a rundown of the quests given out in Chardok?<br />
<br />
im thinking of going to raise my Brood of Di'Zok faction (which is bottomed out... uch) to check out those nice Chardok quest items. <br />
<br />
also, does anyone have any good insight in raising brood of di'zok faction (other than mass murder of droga/nurga)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranaz Asmogian</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done this quest as a 60th level monk.<br />
<br />
YOu have to kill golbins in droga/nurga..I mean ALOT<br />
<br />
you are looking about 3k goblins...the golbins drop salts and skins that you can hand in..but 2 skins or the 4 salts you hand in, are the same as killing one goblin.<br />
<br />
Once you do the faction work.. the first 2 rings are easy. For the 3rd part you need an urn from drus (took me 10 kills for her to drop it) and a sinew from juggs or trak (3 dropped on night of Jugg hunting).<br />
<br />
If you have any questions... I would be more than happy to answer them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from what ive heard, 3k goblins is a very low estimate :(  more like 6-7k (when faction is bottomed out).<br />
<br />
thanks for the info tho. isnt there another quest for a shoulder/wrist/waist item with AoB?<br />
<br />
also, not to sound ignorant, but who and where are drus/juggs/trak (not trakanon is it? uch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dourden Tyler</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you are still 45 as your sig says, then head to Nurga to the Briarweb spiders. That way you can get xp as well as faction. They're good xp up to 48.<br />
<br />
drus = Drusella Sathir, the boss mob of Howling Stones (Charasis) also Venril's ex wife<br />
juggs = Juggernauts, the big bad golems in Sebilis<br />
trak = Yes, Trakanon. The last raid I was on he dropped 3 sinews<br />
<br />
Also...you do need to be level 50 to get the first ring<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing this on and off lately.  Usually I'm solo (me with or without pet).  Sometimes I havea partner, sometimes I tag along with larger groups and load up my uber SK AE spells.<br />
<br />
Dunno how many I've killed, or even how many hours.  It's been at least 6 hours I'd say.  In all this I had saved up 66 salts and 10 skins, handed them in and I'm still at scowling.<br />
<br />
I've heard 14-30 hours total to get to ally.  I'm probably being really stupid.  30 hours of &quot;free time&quot; could get me probably 4 AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gheeb</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent between 15 and 20 hours killing constantly around the Chief's room right after Chardok was changed, but before SoL was put out.  I was still scowling.  Then I played DAoC for a while, and have since retrashed my Sarnak faction. :rolleyes:   At least I got an idol out of it.<br />
<br />
I've gone to burning my non-raiding, non-xp time to other quests, like finally working towards finishing the greenmist and the coldain rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a consolidated list of the new DROPs vs. new QUEST items from chardok?<br />
<br />
Mal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the 8th Coldain ring, but am scowling to Dain.  Since my guild hasn't killed Tormax yet (I did mooch one Tormax hit from someone else's kill) it's not really feasible to fix my faction.</div></div><hr />
