<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done this part of the quest recently?  I'm going off of the walk through in Dirty Deeds and I spent a couple hours in the room where the undead blacksmith is supposed to spawn (#9 on eqatlas map of the second floor).  The spawn point that is attributed to him doesn't despawn/respawn every 12 minutes that I could tell in my time there (have seen reports that it did) and I've been getting all manner of kly there but no undead smith.  <br />
<br />
Someone please tell me that he's just a PITA to get, and that they haven't changed the spawn location or something deviously bastardish like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is just a pain in the ass to get.  I had to camp him for 2 days at about 4 hours each (long KEIs) before I had him pop... of course right after my KEI wore off.  Just be patient and keep smacking around Kly and whatever else decides to come play tag with you while you're there.<br />
<br />
And just for reference I did this about 2-3 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did my Visceral Dagger 2-3 weeks ago (With no KEI Whatsoever, BTW). The Blacksmith actually poped for me on 5th clearing of the room. I think I was probably lucky tho, as I got the lab and 1st floor Imps in 2 spawns as well. The only real PITA for me was the Church IMP, who took me around 10 spawns. Still, I got my dagger done in one night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 spawns for the church Imp and you call that PITA ? Muhahahahahaha. For me it was more 100 spawns, not including the Lab's Imp.<br />
<br />
This is the test of Patience...<br />
<br />
Just keep the room cleared, you will finaly get the Blaksmith.  Good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azrexel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I`m still camping the Church in Dalnir after 18 straight hours, can anyone tell me if the Sharp Metal Shard is no-drop? I`ve looked on Allakhazam and Everlore and they just say lore. If its not no-drop i might be able to buy it in bazaar and finish this Khukri quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All Pieces are no drop. <br />
<br />
The best you can do is try to buy the completed Hero's Khukri or an MQ of the Visceral Dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I finished my Visceral dagger this weekend, after a relatively short camp, I suppose.  I had already collected the illegible scrolls from CoM when I was leveling there, and picked up the ones from Mistmoore while I was helping a Shaman friend kill Black Dire for his epic.  I went to Kaesora and picked up the last page I needed off of the Failed Crypt Raider in about 15 minutes, then headed down to Droga jail to get my keys and finish up the stupendous tome.  Ugh.  Bone Key and Bone Necklace both dropped within 15 minutes, but I had forgotten shrink potions so I couldn't get through the damn doors to get to the Penkeeper spawn point.  So I hang around until the Shammy is online again, then have him come down and help me out.  I figure it's much less dangerous a camp (even though they're green, they still hit hard enough to make me nervous when I get more than 3 or 4) as a duo anyway.  So we wiggle our way through the bars and set up shop inside the jail. And wait.  And wait.  And kill the penkeeper about 10 times with no drop of the key I need, then wait some more.<br />
<br />
Once again, from the walkthrough, I thought the bone necklace was supposed to be the rare one, but it seems that the penkeeper indeed only spawns in one spot, and he drops the stone key much less frequently than the penmaster drops the bone necklace.<br />
<br />
/sigh.<br />
<br />
I should have started this much earlier.</div></div><hr />
