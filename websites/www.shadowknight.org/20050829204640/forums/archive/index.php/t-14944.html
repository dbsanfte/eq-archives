<br />
The first time I went down there was a 1 or 2 years ago, to get the ancient coin off the Failed crypt raider for my bard. We wiped out the library a few times. After about 4 hours, we were about to give up and leave when the Raider came rushing out of the library at us. Killed it, got coin (let page rot cuz we didn't know what it was at the time), and vamoosed. <br />
<br />
The second time was recently for myself, solo this time. Took me about 2 hours for him to pop.<br />
<br />
He always pops in the library, he seems to be the one &quot;wandering&quot; spawn in there. He'll be sorta walking around the inside the library more or less. He does have a PH, so he is a random spawn. Just kill and be patient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Logged in the next morning to get aggro from my Crypt Raider.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabbuk</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes indeed, look at it as a gift.  When I did the Dalnir's part of the quest I burned through the first 3 drops, and the last took me about six hours (might be longer, maybe I'll go look at myself bitching in the Khukri quest thread :) ).  I know a lot of people spent hours and hours on the chapel part, but he popped for me as the second mob.  I'm always sure to bow in the direction of the EQ mainframe when mobs pop fast like that for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ophidius</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe I dig. I just (ten minutes ago) bought a greenish metal shard in bazaar for 2500p. I now have every piece and will do the final combine today at level 32! One helluva week spent doing this whole quest from scratch almost entirely solo =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ophidius</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can use it. it wont proc for another 17 levels =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orthogonon</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just helped a monk friend with crypt raider.  Took us about 45 min or so to get him.  If you base your camp at the fountain thing in front of the library, he will charge you when he pops.  For some reason he seems to have a wider aggro range than the other mobs in the area.  Just kill all the stuff (especially cleric skels), clear the library when it pops and he will eventually spawn.<br />
<br />
Btw, when i killed him for GM a long while ago, seemed to take about the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />

Time camping him previously: 1hr.  Pretty sure he spawned in the location that the Librarian usualy is in, think he may be the PH.  Also got Spectral courier on server up.</div></div><hr />
