<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Idea:<br />
Looking for odd places to raid or group, don't care about faction.  Have a new guild I started that is just about having fun, so that is the most important factor.  <br />
<br />
The idea is that we're not worrying about uber loot or the normal exp trail, but are more worried about getting our moneys worth in fun out of the game each month. <br />
<br />
Resources:<br />
The guild will be limited to about 50 players (not total chars).  We'd have a raid force of about 15-20 each time (just being realistic on shows), ranging from 52-65.<br />
<br />
What feedback I am looking for:<br />
What fun odd zones have you experienced or wanted to go to that may well be outside the normal path?<br />
Where do you think would be fun if faction, loot wasn't a priority?<br />
What other information from me would you need to give feedback?<br />
<br />
Ideas we've had (and feel free to comment on them):<br />
Felwithe<br />
Gukta</div></div><hr />

<br />
I frequently duo in Felwithe with my brother's shaman. Out of courtesy I leave all the vendors and quest NPCs alone and only take out the guards though.<br />
<br />
If you are interested I have a color map listing all of the guards and their pathing. I am was working on doing it for every &quot;good&quot; city on Norrath but havent had the time. I would be glad to e-mail it to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dester</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A level range would be nice/ and gear types you have.<br />
<br />
By your sig your level 40 and im gona base off of that.<br />
<br />
Honestly there isn't much to &quot;raid&quot; at level 40.  Might try the Hole at mid 40s.  Just the upper parts.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the 50s you can start hitting Keal. <br />
<br />
Some out of the way places I have found inclue Sirens Grotto (mid 50s at least), Plane of Mischif (mid 50s), Dragon necropolis (mid 50s), Plane of Hate (low 50s you can do the zone in area), Old Selibis (need key, upper 40s low 50s to start).<br />
<br />
Most of these zones are usually devoid of people on E-Marr unless a guild is droping the &quot;boss&quot; of the zone.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The level range will be 52-60 as listed in my original post.<br />
<br />
Gear Level will be descent bazaar gear (no high end) and planar gear for the most part through BOT.<br />
<br />
Keevel is being leveled up to make sure we have tanks (seem to have alot of casters who liked the guild concept)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions.  Is there anything a bit more off the wall that anyone has for suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramgar SK</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With levels 52-65 and 3 solid groups, you can hit any of the 55+ zones.  Nadox is a fun place, as is Torgiran Mines.  They are out of the way enough that they are never crowded.<br />
<br />
With a raid force though, you'll probably want something to challenge you, so look for named like Spiritseeker Nadox.<br />
<br />
We hit Greig's End last night.  Named there are interesting and pop randomly in spawn points throughout the dungeon.  It's a fun, almost always empty zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Realized that many of the guild members were in the same situation as I (one or two chars and only earned, made or low level bazaar bought gear).  Also didn't want to wait until we can get a raid force together to find out what everyone's level of raid competancy was. <br />
<br />
so..  We're getting all the 40+'s (I've raided with most of the 55+ crowd andknow thier capabilities) ans farming Nurga for the quest drops.  Yes it'll take a while, but should provide us with some upgrades (as well as a training ground if needed).<br />
<br />
But keep me in mind if you see anything fun/unusual and wierd.  I'm keeping a list of ideas so we have options.</div></div><hr />
