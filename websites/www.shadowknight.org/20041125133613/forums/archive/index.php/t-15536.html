<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Time seems to have forgotten the &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; 2H weapons that PoP made so useful.<br />
<br />
Time has exactly ONE 2H weapon...  for all the 2H weapon users.<br />
(and vanazir's has yet to drop even ONCE on our server...)<br />
Time has multiple weapons for clerics and Shaman and monks and Beastlords....  where is the meat and potatoes WAR/PAL/SHD/RNG 2HS?<br />
<br />
Now, the greatstaff of power comes along (50 30 +10% 2HB, 300hp, procs a mana gain and has a 30% all resist nuke focus.)<br />
<br />
Our casters and priests complain how terrible it is while I can only drool.<br />
<br />
I ask a very simple favor.  Make the Greatstaff  ALL/ALL or at least put SHD on it. (Pallies/Beastlords/Rangers will take it too im sure)<br />
<br />
Would be nice just once to wield a weapon that actually pays attention to the fact I am am also a caster.<br />
<br />
if its not too much annoyance, I would also like to see a WAR/PAL/SHD/RNG 2HS please.<br />
<br />
<br />
Variety would be nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arbaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It would be very nice to see other classes added to that particular item, especially us ^^. I personally do not think it will happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would be a change that's well in order, but I don't see it as particularly likely either.  Start up enough of a bitch fest on enough class boards and you might have about a minute chance, but I don't forsee anything being changed - at least not with the greatstaff of power specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well first off we need Sk only weaps tht have spells WE CANT CAST ON OUR OWn, every time i see a fuggen Sk only weapon with a proc its some mid lvl crappy spell that i can cast and regen with KEI in bout 23 seconds, jesus , i agree with above some friggen variety is needed.. Pallies get Jeldorin ( withh 100 hp self heal proc) and we get a ugly 21/24 with no proc and looks like a newb weap..<br />
<br />
I want a weap that procs Life leach Useable at 49-52+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah, pallies also get &quot;Hopebringer&quot;... not like I'm EVER going to be in Time any time soon, but where's the SK equivalent? (or anything close to it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as a caster giving up 2 slots for one item isn't acceptable, unless it has like both BA4 &amp; AE4 or something, i wouldn't imagine any nec would consider it if they got into time. i would wield it now, but my nec has gimp gear.<br />
<br />
adding an effect that procs in combat at that level is just laughably asinine. especially something like, random 1-50 direct mana increase. whoever decided to add that weapon doesn't understand jack shit about the game.<br />
<br />
what a joke. go team stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah, pallies also get &quot;Hopebringer&quot;... not like I'm EVER going to be in Time any time soon, but where's the SK equivalent? (or anything close to it) <br />
<br />
Cudgel of Venomous Hatred is the SK version of Hopebringer.</div></div><hr />
