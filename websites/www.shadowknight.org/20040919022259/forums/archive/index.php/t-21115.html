<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritkiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually like to keep Feign Death up as an emergency spell, but find it to be a hassle to get off in time, and with harmshield's quick cast time but only 18 second fix was wondering which one you all use, if any at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boodadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">51sk here and i use FD mostly, now i WILL get harmshield up if its looking like a particularly bad group but due to the reuse time of it i prefer FD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When i was camping reports in seru I had both memmed so if I had a bad pull, i could HS and have 18 sec to get the eff out. <br />
It was a blast diving off the 3rd balcony floor and running out w/ a huge train.<br />
<br />
Some things I've noticed:<br />
HS has the same cast as death peace, but I channel HS almost 100% of the time and Death peace gets interrupted a ton more (my observation). So for a bad pull I would use HS in conjunction with FD. <br />
Think of HS as a &quot;get out of dodge&quot; spell. You can't attack or cast during it, so it's not like you can finish off a mob while invul at 10% health. It's basically to get to a safe spot to FD.<br />
<br />
In a group situation, go with FD - we sk's just love being the only one left when the harmo ranger brings 3 mobs to camp and the chanter/slower dies. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rarely have harmshield memmed.  It's nice if you have to position a mob somewhere before you feign (or die)... you can have trash beating on you while ya want for hte big guy to get in position then try to get your feign off.<br />
<br />
Mainly it's handy for pulling big stuff, or trying to make a death run to a safe spot somewhere, but in general it's a waste of a spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Harmshield's value as an &quot;oh shit&quot; spell is greatly diminshed by the fact that you can't be healed while it's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only time I hve it memmed is on a raid where I need to HS pull something.<br />
<br />
Otherwise seems like a waste of a needed spell slot.  If I am going to die then well guess I am going to die if FD cant save me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Death Peace is memmed at all times. <br />
<br />
HS is only memmed for specific instances when I pretty much know I will be using it, which only occurs on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">most of us are 60+ and have death peace.<br />
<br />
once you have death peace you'll only rarely use HS...<br />
just for that reason i'd get in the habit of using normal FD, since the circumstances and results are different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The last time I used HS was pre-PoP... in The Grey when I used to pull 40+ skelly trains (and FD them all via pop-n-drop so that they could be picked off a couple at a time for the group to kill).<br />
<br />
FD/DP, on the other hand has never been unmemmed since the day I got it.  Well, except for the time I had a train in PoJ and I right clicked the DP spell gem instead of left clicked... and I had just sold my BE legs the night before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HS is pretty handy pulling in GoD zones where mobs outrun you and hit like trucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FD/DP has been spell gem one since level 30.  HS used to be gem 7 until I hit 60, and I dememed it.  Death Peace is that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still don't use it there. Just pull with arrows and FD the moment you shoot...by the time it goes off, the mobs should be standing on you. Makes for easy tag splitting, esp when the brute looking guys stop to cast that crap spell on you that is a fast cast ( his animations take a bit ) and you should resist 99/100 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't use Harmshield except to jump off cliffs or run through somewhere stupid.  Handy for that.  Also good for AoE mobs where FD won't protect you but this can screwup healers and make them waste mana.<br />
<br />
In groups/solo Harmshield is useless unless you are planning to run to zone.  Otherwise mobs will still be there when it runs out and you will still be hurt.  Also much easier to train group accidently with HS since you can still move and mobs are running about very angry.  FD seems to reduce their aggro radius back to normal.<br />
<br />
Real trick is getting high enough to get death peace then you won't care about Harmshield anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As pretty much everyone else said HS is not something i ever keep memmed.  Recently i have only used it to pull GABs in fire.  DP is the way to go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didnt get the HS spell until I was 65 with 200 AA's... I only got it so I could help pull in Plane of Water for Coirnav... Rather than that, I had never 'needed' it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">depends what you do.  I always have FD up, unless I am in a fight where it is of no use (Quarm).  I hate having HS memmed, but I am forced to do so when the guild requires me to have it memmed for certain raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I cant say as I have had a lot of use for HS in combat, its more a recipe to get left behind when the wizzie decides to evac.<br />
<br />
Bout the best uses I had for HS was to get past yelinak when i was doing SS armor quests, and for cliff diving into the Hole, and for doing some recon when i entered zones for the first time<br />
<br />
However HS is a good safety net for learning how to pull mobs you never pulled before (you get a good feel for aggro ranges, and how social mobs are with a relative level of safety), as well as getting a look at how the mobs path w/o having to die right away for the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The fact that most every shadowknight has DP permanently memmed is one of the reasons a hotkeyed DP (even with the cast time and mana cost remaining the same) would be so nice. It would free up a spell gem which is more or less permanently used as of now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RANT:  I grouped with another SK the other night who didn't have FD memmed, mashed taunt, weilded a 1 handed and only cast spears.  It made me grateful for this board<br />
<br />
I have HS in bank and had some ides for it thanks Amphitryon for adding to them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/shrug, HS is permanently memmed for me in slot 7, DP in slot 8</div></div><hr />

I never got the HS spell, didn't even know we had it........time to log on, and play with it.  Now I remember all the times when I wish I had HS....damn wizzie bro accidently gating out of poj halls of testing, and bard speed.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I would welcome it as a hot key I don't have DP permanently memed.  If I am pulling or soloing away from an easy exit I will keep it up.  Also on raids.  otherwise I may mem it when starting out with a pickup group till I can trust them then I mem something useful.<br />
<br />
Not worth having memed (unless pulling with room to FD) if you are the only tank in a group as if you do FD you will wipe group.  Groups take a very dim view of this.  If you are MA stand and die, only exception would be if the healers are all down already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Interesting to see the two different schools of thought on this.<br />
<br />
I always have DP memmed, and HS right below it. However that's because I do use HS enough to where I would rather have it up than not. I pull on a lot of raids, tend to volunteer for the jobs that require some type of HS run, tend to get into sticky situations when exploring with people and sometimes an HS run is the only way out.  I almost never pop it in an exp group though- and if I do it's a last resort and everyone else is dead. Blowing healer mana on an HS pop isn't cool. <br />
<br />
Since the day I got some type of FD, it's been in slot 7. Never once played without it memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vixeena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Playing on a PVP server, i pretty much need all the &quot;god damnit here we go again.. time to try and stay alive&quot; stuff i can get. <br />
<br />
HS , SS and FD  pretty much prema-memed unless on LDON.  And yes it is frustrating as hell to have only 5 gems left to work with.  :( <br />
<br />
(FD in PVP is to de-agro pets)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Squigle - Maybe this only works at lower levels, but I need FD memmed in pick-up groups all the time and when running to where I'm gonna hunt.  Brell has alot of asshats who train zones, books, etc.  <br />
<br />
My use for it this weekend in a LDoN hard was after the pulling pally (God I wish people knew what an SK could do, that groups would have been so much faster) got stuck in a wall agroing 5 mobs (no chanter in group).  I used CD to get agro pulled the mobs to a wall (It may be me but I seem to avoid more hits with my back to a wall) and told everyone to run.  Ht'd one to make less MOBS hitting on me.  Druid who was back-up healer was oom from nuking the previous 2 single pull mobs and couldn't succors himself or group and just decided to melee until he was dead.  Cleric gated.   Both Pallies were dead from chain stunning the mobs on me until the mobs turned and killed them.  The rogue decided to backstab the named I had on me until he turned and killed the rogue.  Nothing I could do, cleric was safe so I FD to save her one more rez - that mana being the difference between a sucess and a fail as it turned out - and after a couple minutes pull the corpses to a safe spot for rezzing.  Then I put the Druid on my ignore list.<br />
<br />
After one or two of those kind of situations you just don't trust not having it up all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">even though i rarely use harmshield, i still keep it memmed because its a 10 min timer to be useable, plus you never know when its gonna come in handy. i also always have FD memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">FD is good in groups, even groups that you trust. The cleric won't get mad at you when he says &quot;Shit, i think CH is gonna be late....&quot;, you FD at 2% hp, he heals you, you stand up and with one clinging darkness/fear you have agro again, and he got hit once. Shit like that can save your life, and save your group. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />
