<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I recently RTed for my guild against IV in AR.  I don't really have any idea wtf I'm doing, could someone help me out please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have a healer ( or healers ), Pull or be the 1st one to attack the mob then HS ( you still stay on Rampage ),  MT gets aggro, you stay in mob's Rampage range and cast a lot of lifetaps.  <br />
<br />
That's what I used to do when I had to be Rampage tank.  If you want to get off Rampage, FD a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rampage is a second agro list that is built in the order that you do anything agro inducing to the mob.  Rampage hits the person at the top of this list unless they currently are attacking them.  It never changes (theres exceptions, but in practice).  So to control who's RT, that person must engage first or right behind the MA.  Usually have the RT pull the mob when ready to engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also use Harmshield as rampage tank, which is great for situations where original RT has died and you are next on the list and need the healers to catch up...let them know you have HS up for 18 seconds so that they dont waste mana while you're invulnerable.<br />
<br />
If you are RT and FD for some reason, the next person on the rampage list will become RT until you stand back up again, and then you will resume being RT. FDing several times as suggested above might clear you if you get one of those rare 'mem-wipe' FDs, but generally FDing is a bad idea because there is no way to make sure that a slower/healer/bard isn't the next one after you on the rampage list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you need to avoid a round or two its best to back out of the mobs rampage range rather than FD.  Generally what I do is pull the mob into camp using something extremly low aggro like an arrow, the tank gets the mob and the mob will now start hitting me on rampage, let it land one round if you're full hp, then invul for 18 seconds, get your heal while invul from divine arb so you'll be good when it disappears.  Now just stand there and get hit, keep your aggro low but don't FD.  Optimally you would want every non RT to be higher aggro than you so in the event that the first tank dies you can be sure the RT doesnt become the focus of the mobs attention and get someone else doing rampage.  Use whatever you can to lessen damage intake to yourself - lifetap procs, casted taps, aura of pain, torrent of hate, etc... don't build up alot of aggro though as FD'ing is risky, get heals while you're hit and thats all there is to it.  Also, don't let your guild know what a Divine Hammer of Consternation is or you'll never RT again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats worth remembering, Divine Arbitration works while you're invulnerable? I love that AA even more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, forgot to mention since someone will probally bring it up or wonder.  The reason you take one round before going invul is because you won't be in any real danger from 1 round and it gives you another couple of seconds for the fight to be going on for the mob to get slowed, crippled, etc before your invul is gone helping you survive a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bainin01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IV in ahkeva is a rooted mob.<br />
<br />
Use debuff/ memblur judiciously. Establish an MT and as many RTs as you want prior to engage.<br />
<br />
IV can be annoying, he (she?) blinds and knocksback the MT continuosly. If youre not careful, you will become the MT early on.<br />
<br />
Let the MT build enough aggro so that he is being summoned back to IV before you step in to melee range.<br />
<br />
IIR the knockback is a proc, so it can hit the RT...make sure you put your back into the altar (stone) behind IV and do your best to stay there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, thanks for the replys guys, they really helped.  I have another question though, today we were gonna kill IV again, me and my buddy are the RTs, ok, no big deal, I engage with the MT, hit the bash button, and get aggro, I go blind immediatly, and try to spin the thing around, next time I can see, I'm naked in pok, get rezzed midfight, get like 8m, cast mental corruption, and chain cast CD/fear/festering(when I could)/terrors for the rest of the 20min fight, and all I manage to do is get aggro a few times accidently.  <br />
<br />
What is the easiest way to get ramp aggro back after you have to FD, to get aggro off, or die because the MT is messing up badly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ramp list never changes.  Reread whats been said in previous posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with Rampage list never changing, as I have seen that in action.  However that does not mean Rampage never moves.  I have seen is move a bit based on distance (I think) between people on the list.  This is true in particular if the RT dies.  I find this is more true for mobs we walk than mobs we corner.<br />
<br />
One comment back to the best way to get on to the Rampage list is that I have seen is that the RT takes the mob first from the puller and brings it to the MA.  AE Taunt is effective to pull the mob from the RT (or FD the mob off).<br />
<br />
IV being permarooted, we generally have the MA build aggro for a long time (non-damage) out of melee range.  Best if this is a Pally or SK (Stun or Fear), but is workable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On rooted mobs you can just build sick aggro with multiple tash or slow or something of that nature.  MT runs in, AET's and has the most aggro.  Bingo, uber aggro for the entire fight.  Was a useful tactic when warrs actually didn't have unshakable aggro.  Now it doesn't matter so much.<br />
<br />
Since a rooted mob never leaves it's spawn.... NEVER FD if you're RTing a rooted mob, because it WILL memblur.  The second you FD on IV, you die.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, every once in a great while, you'll be back on the rampage list if you get rezzed back into the fight, although I've personally never experienced it.  You die, the next person on the list has it until they die or go OOR, or the mob gets memblurred (rampage on ele mobs that memblur can be real fun, since it switches every time the mob blurs).<br />
<br />
Rampage used to be a nice niche knights could fill well, save the warriors for the tank rotation in case you lose a couple.  Anymore though, a lot of the elemental shit we fight will 1 round elemental knights on rampage... really need a defensive warr doing it.  I've had magmaton 1-round me on ramp with over 9k buffed hp (really makes me wonder sometimes about all these people that say 'warriors only tanked a mob the first 2 or 3 times we did it, after that it was a knight.'  I don't see elemental geared knights successfully tanking, say, most pofire minis without some serious luck, as some of that shit can 1 round a defensive, elemental warrior if they get unlucky.  Just think what it can do to a knight.....).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kinda OT, but didn't the uber guilds like FoH, AL, Triton etc... have knights tank Time bosses, and I heard they had a monk tank EP bosses cuz they were bored?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gaeanin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm not here to answer your question but ask a few more while we are on the topic of rampage :)<br />
<br />
I may be being stupid here but who and how many people get hit with rampage. I have heard that different mobs have more or less spaces on the rampage list? Also does the main tank also get hit as well as the rampage tank?<br />
<br />
Also some people have mentioned the rampage tank pulling the mob or being the first to engage it or something, but doesn't that leave them with agro instead of the main tank? Raids that i have been on, the main tank engaged the mob first and then the rampage tank was just sort of hitting the mob like any other dps did...I assume he was the second person to hit it, but i wasn't really watching.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any clarity you may be able to bring me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends, Kunark/velious/luclin rampage only hits one person, and has a rampage list.  The MT does not get hit with rampage, becuase it is a different list than the aggro list.  PoP mobs can hit like 10 people that are on the mobs rampage list, someone correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lots of AE ramp in pop and god.  not a fixed number, just everyone who is in range of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">AE ramp isn't really AE.  The Rampage list goes off the order you engage the mob and has a range, some mobs have a range of 1, that means it will hit the highest person on the list in range not the focus of it's attack, a size of 10 would do the top 10 people, ae can be larger even as high as 72 or 500 or whatever, if you aren't on the mobs aggro list it can't possibly rampage you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">if you get one of those rare 'mem-wipe' FDs <br />
<br />
this brings some light into the issue we had on RC. Somehow the healers slept incoming, allwent down the drain, I FDed in the end.<br />
<br />
On 2nd try i never got hit by rampage, h ewent right on the 2nd in line.</div></div><hr />

Ok, that makes sense, but I've been having other trouble with rampage on permarooted mobs.  Been doing alot of Ssra, and always have the knights enter the rooms first and tag the mob (say AL).  Then we go in and clear/buff whatever, staying out of the AE.  But it seems to me a permarooted mob can clear its rampage list either periodically, or if no one is in range/LoS for a period of time, which goes against what I thought I knew about rampage.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this for me?  If so, how do you handle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We generally did the Rhags differently than you describe.  We had everybody get in and hide from the AE.  Then, have the RT, SA, MA (and all the warriors at least sometimes the knights as well) plunk arrows from the doorway.  Then, when the MA rushes all of these folks are ahead of the healers on the rampage list.  Also, when we enter room we use Target's Target to determine who the mob is on.  If the mob is on anybody, we have them relog before we get started.</div></div><hr />
