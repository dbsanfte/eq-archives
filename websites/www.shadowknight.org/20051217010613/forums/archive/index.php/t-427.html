But are we kings at gaining aggro fast? It seems that other classes are close with the new Luclin spells (Tangling Weeds etc) and Slow v2.0.<br />
<br />
Also, there are times when we have to grab aggro without dotting the mob so that the chanter will be able to mesmerize it. How does that situation look for us compared to other classes?<br />
<br />
Please motivate your answer, with and without HT used.<br />
<br />

I feel that especially rangers are intruding in our class specific ability (attaining aggro). Sure, we take a beating better than rangers - but not by a large margin. Chainarmours are getting better and are not far behind in AC compared to plate. It is mainly the HP that makes the differance between our classes tankwise. In xpgrinding, this differance is almost negligible.<br />
<br />
I'd like us to be best at these three things:<br />
<br />
1) gaining aggro fast (with or without dots)<br />
2) keeping it <br />
3) turning it over when it feels right <br />
<br />
Aren't we supposed to?<br />
<br />
Currently, I experience Rangers are more than capable to grab aggro when xpgrinding. SKs have the edge in a raidsituation where FD often keeps us alive and kills the ranger.<br />
<br />
It all comes down to this: Rangers have the ability to grab aggro fast, even without dotting. This ability together with the high damage output makes them even more attractable partners in xpgroups. We used to be better at aggromanagement compared to other classes.<br />

It might be more accurate to say &quot;SKs can gain aggro the fastest of the classes you WANT to gain aggro.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enchanters and shaman are manageable - we just need to plan our taunt activities around what they're doing, so we're gaining a bag of aggro before they do their bit, and can recover attention rapidly &amp; smoothly .  Rangers, of course, like rogues and wizards, are prone to gain unwanted aggro and get eaten if they're not careful - they aren't our responsibility, mostly, as they have adequate aggro management abilities - if they fail to do them, shame on them.    <br />
<br />
Shadow vortex is probably our highest aggro spell that doesn't interfere with mez , followed by Shroud of pain  - STR taps are next, with Shroud/Torrent of hate having only fairly weak aggro.  Wave of enfeeblement is our only AoE debuff, but it's pretty crummy and almost never worth using.<br />
<br />
I must disagree about people preferring rangers for EXPing - most of the caster types I know much prefer an SK (maybe that's just my personal charm ;) ) - we can take and hold aggro and survive doing so.  We won't put out the same damage that a ranger will, of course, but we can more than pull our weight in EXP groups.  Aggro management, pulling, and tanking would be our strengths, IMAO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thenger</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a group where the people who play their classes know how to, the rangers do not try and get aggro, at all.  For instance I was in a group in CT, mostly everyone in the group was 60th, if not then one or two perhaps 59th.  Before the pulling even started I told the ranger that I would snare to build up agro and he agreed with me since he know I had alot more AC then he did, not really sure about our HP issue, I know I had more just not sure how much more.  This was a very well balanced group and I was able to keep agro for most of the fights, the ranger and rogue perhaps getting agro for a round or two, max before I had to recast a spell to get agro back.  Oh and mind you this was a level 60 ranger duel weilding his epics and I could keep agro fairly easiy.  <br />
<br />
In the end it really matters on the people behind the character, if the ranger wants to get agro, let him die, and he will fast.  It's always a good lesson for people to learn how to play their class, a fast and painfull death.  Just a reminder, always have your level 9 spell up and ready, DC is an awsome taunting spell.  Use it wisly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't think it's meaningful to talk about taunting if the class can't handle the damage being dished out<br />
of course the best &quot;taunters&quot; are shaman, chanters what have you, but really what idiot playing one of those classes &quot;taunts&quot;, anybody with any brains playing those classes wants to go about their business in peace<br />
and while rangers can take more damage than casters i've not met a ranger can tank better than an sk, rangers are melee damage dealers and if they have any clue will be just as concerned about aggro management as the casters, rogues, etc<br />
i group with a ranger normally yet to have any problems keeping aggro off him, maybe the odd pingpong once in a while<br />
and the casters in my group like me to be MT because i can hold aggro, get aggro off them and crucially stay alive till the end of the fight doing it<br />
as for aggro without DoT i find shadow vortex carries big aggro, shroud of pain is pretty good too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another think to keep in mind with SK's and Agro is not only our ability to make it fairly quickly. But more importaintly our ability to let it go when needed.<br />
<br />
FD is as big if not the biggest asset you have in your Agro bag. Our Tanking ability is also a factor. While Rangers are actualy quite capable tanks, they do have limits just as we do. There biggest problem being the inability to dump agro, same with Pallies, they are equal tanks to us but have no ability to dump the agro.<br />
<br />
Ok back to the topic, agro spells and what I use when:<br />
Normal agro spells:<br />
DC: GREAT agro for low lvl spell, fast cast time. Problem is it is a DoT, wich I rarely have issues with, also some new Moon mobs are very rez to it and the agro it generates seem's poor on some of them. <br />
<br />
Shadow Vortex: Works great in place of DC, if I'm not main tank and don't want to Dot mobs.<br />
<br />
Raids: Whole diffrent can of wurms, I have just recently gone back to having DC loaded for raids. I rarely tank but when I do need to I need agro and need it now, ie letting people camp, regrp or pulling an AoE mob to the right spot when MT drops. <br />
<br />
Example: Last night in Keal we where clearing for Vindi, we had a little issue with the tag on the pull and ended up with 2 PoZ and 2 Arena mobs. Not a big loss but our MT droped as the 2nd Cleric in the CH rotation whent LD (yar good timing). Needless to say that PoZ tore thrue the spam healers, and clerics. HT/DC and guess who getting beat on? yep me, in 1.5 seconds.  We have a great raid crew, every one backed off except our last free 60 War (other 2 where on the other mobs, and Chanter Dire Charmed one$$). In abought 5 or 6 sec he shouted for me to drop it to him.. FD, boom he got agro I got a cheal and he called assist. <br />
<br />
To your Question: Are we the King of instant agro? Not the king but we in the royal family  -BUT-  We are the King of Agro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulle</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers can dump aggro with jolt, or cinder jolt.  I had never thought about it honestly, but ya, they can probably take our job of no dmg taunting in multiple pull raid situations.  Sometimes all the chanter needs is a couple of seconds with the mob hitting someone else to land tash/mez.<br />
<br />
I've usually done this job, but I think a ranger with tangling weeds, could pull aggro faster than I could with shadow vortex(keeping the no dmg part in mind).  <br />
<br />
But I play on Sullon so I never group with rangers anyways.. hahahahahaah.<br />

<br />
All are excellent if you want to gain aggro, and fast.<br />
<br />
Str taps, it might be me but I have never seen them affect aggro.<br />
<br />
I feel that especially rangers are intruding in our class specific ability<br />
<br />
I never saw this defined for us anywhere, it is just a nice bonus that was discovered ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keyan Aubaine</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct Sekmeth, it's something we grabbed along the way, halfway between an accident and a way to balance our extra abilities (leeching stats/doting).<br />
<br />
It's only very recently that VI started actually increasing the hate directly as an obvious main concern, like with the enchanter trickster buff or with the effect on blade of carnage/hategiver.<br />
When you look at our old spell book, ALL our spells have a primary focus, be it sucking life, slowing movement, doing damage... the taunt potential is just here to compensate that beneficial (for us) effect.<br />
Later with kunark they gave us spells in pretty much the same lines, only more effective, but still none of them focused on agroing.<br />
In velious we recieved Death peace and Shroud of Death, increasing our survivability.<br />
In luclin we recieved low agro spells (torrents), a self buff...<br />
<br />
None of our spells is designed as a taunt, they are all designed to enhance our melee abilities with spells.<br />
Our spells happen do draw lots of agro, and we use it to our advantage, but we've never been designed that way.<br />
<br />
We are designed to be independant killing machines, with a lower damage output, but able to do a lot without help (be it soloing, or without a cleric watching us too closely on raids), lifetaps, feign death, self buffs...<br />
The same way paladins are designed to have a lower damage but are helping others survive, they got wave of prexus for this, and it just happens to increase their survivability as a side effect, but this was not the main concern.</div></div><hr />
