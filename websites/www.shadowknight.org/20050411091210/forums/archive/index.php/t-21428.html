<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just noticed after that gates re-tuned patch that resists have had some kinda sneaky change. I have been able to land festering darkness so reliably now against elementally geared im thinking resists got nerfed to a point. Sure you might resist one or 2 volleys but it lands. Anyone else notice any kinda changes ( PVP ONLY )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they changed it back luckily for me, half the members of all the time/ele guilds on my server are griefiers and yet like 90% of the ele members i encountered were still immune to festering and 100% of the time members. Then i'd have their shamans who could previously not kill me slowing me rooting etc before even bothering to malo me =\. Some of the dot stacking was ridiculous too especially the curse ones. The one change i was happy to see though was that all classes could effectively land nukes, would think all classes should be given some form of a lurish dd or dot for high end pvp even if it is pvp only.<br />

You know what really bugged me is no one ever freakin talked about the change, never popped up on this board or any other class board i saw even one's with pvp sections. Took a few days for the pvp post on the EQ board to recognize it too. Anyways all the highend guilds on pvp servers had numbers+more hp more ac more mana more focus effects + more ft + more dps + more of everything they didn't need to be able to land critically debilatating effects like roots, snares, slow etc on the rest of the server without it in turn being able to land on them to win pvp. But then again most of them dont really care for an even fight...</div></div><hr />
