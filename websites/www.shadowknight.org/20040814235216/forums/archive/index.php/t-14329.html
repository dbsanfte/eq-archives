<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am planning on doing the coldain ring quests very soon, the eighth ring looks great.  Is it important or really useful to do the shawl quests.   I dont want to do them unless the item is really useful.  I have seen them in the magelos of some SK's but it seems a step down from good armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I started mine because I was helping a couple of shammy friends with the quests and we figured that we could complete more if we split up the tradeskill work and just MQ'd the items for eachother. <br />
<br />
I'd imagine that the only reason you'd use it as a shadowknight is the FT on the final item.  It would probably be a help in downtime, but other than that the stats aren't nearly good enough for me to want to wear it full time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jaxxan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well i spent about three months questing my 8th shawl. it's been priceless to me. With FTIII from the shawl and FT1 from solstice earring it's kinda like having Clarity 1 all the time.<br />
<br />
The effect is a 20% longer duration for all benificial buffs. this includes gather shadows, shroud of death, banshee aura, augment death, etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
The stats are great but they aren't bad either. 8ac 8cha 8wis 8int 50hp 50mana and 8 to all resists. perfect hyrbid item.<br />
<br />
I wear mine all the time cause i dont have any better and it was a feeling of great accomplishment when i completed the quest.<br />
<br />
I'm the only SK on my server that has one or that wanted to have one to the best of my knowledge. it has to be a pretty damn good upgrade for me to replace it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I'm doing the shawls myself, at least up to 7, I'm not incredibly uber, so I don't see myself getting better for a while, and the mana and focus would be great for self-buffs and downtime if nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did the ring quest solo for kicks. I dont even want to touch the shawl quest, too much tradeskillings...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd love to have the 8th shawl for the FT3, but I'd rather poke my eyes out than do tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most of the shawl quests can be MQ'd though, so working up all tradeskills isn't really required.  Tailoring and fletching are absolutely needed, and there is an overlap with jewelcraft and smithing when you get to the 8th shawl.  The rest shouldn't be that bad at all.<br />
<br />
The biggest trick is just finding someone with both Jewelcraft and Blacksmithing at those insanely high skill levels to create your armor kit for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">MQ'd? Well, you can technically MQ up to about the 4th, but those all honestly all pretty damn easy except the egg farming for the souffle. 5th, 6th, and 7th are not MQable (Although you can buy some of the no drop pieces for the 7th), and those are easily the hardest. 6th combine is a 210 Tailoring Trivial, and 7th needs a whole mess of tradeskills. <br />
<br />
The Blacksmithing part is frankly pretty easy, all you need to do is max out Fine Plate, which isn't that hard if you don't mind farming leather padding. Besides, the person making the armor kit would need his 7th shawl and could only do it ONCE, because you need to turn in your 7th shawl to get the kit, and once you get the kit, your shawl is marked as being &quot;Dain Approved&quot; and I'm pretty sure you can't get it again. So someone CAN MQ you an 8th shawl, but they lose thier own chance at an 8th unless they go make themselves another 7th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After you give the shawl to the chamberlin or dain it becomes Approved.  This is so you can only summon the dain once.<br />
<br />
other then that you can hand it to the dian any number of times to get the letter.<br />
<br />
Btw I am just lacking the final fight to get my 8th shawl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought you didn't have to do that bit if the dain was already summoned though... I could be wrong, of course. I'm no where near that close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hrm, Looking at the Quest writeup on eqtraders, it appears you CAN get unlimited issue kits. My mistake then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">but those all honestly all pretty damn easy except the egg farming for the souffle.<br />
6 griffs, 4 eggs. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">4 griffs, 4 eggs here, so ha ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just MQ the third Shawl and you need zero griffs and zero eggs.</div></div><hr />
