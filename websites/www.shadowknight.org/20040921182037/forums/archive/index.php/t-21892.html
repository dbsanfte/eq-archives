She's 35th has a mess of hit points, since she was once a favorite level camp and is on a 6 or so minute spawn if you do end up killing her.  I know she wears out a lot of folks, but for parsing, she should put up with the abuse.  I'm half tempted to see if she's light blue for using her as a practice dummy to get my 2h Blunt up to snuff.</div></div><hr />

Heard about these, but since i'm KoS in every city that has an exterminator, I figured it wasnt worth the effort of factioning up just to see how much of an increase combat effects 10 is when added to WA5 in terms of proc rate.</div></div><hr />

i'm pretty sure you can't get skill ups off of a light blue mob.</div></div><hr />

there's a bear in the caves near velks... he's for the eyepatch of plunder quest. god what is that thing's name.... anyways, he's green and has about a bazillion hp and, granted, he attacks, but shouldn't ever be able to hit you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bloodmaw.  And I don't think it's a bear, per se.</div></div><hr />

okay, so bear... wolverine... kodiak.... thing. it has the same model as the kodiaks, whatever it is =P</div></div><hr />

I've actually seen it happen.  It's a lot rarer an occurance, but I don't have that many skill points to go on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just a friendly reminder to people reading this thread, a few of the suggestions shouldn't really be used for parsing anything except stuff like proc occurences and whatnot. While comparing the damage of two weapons on a level 1 mob isn't entirely worthless, I wouldn't put all that much salt into it. Find a higher level mob to parse on for more accurate results. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">used for parsing anything except stuff like proc occurences and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Thats exactly what I need it for~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah that was just a warning to others reading the thread thinking they'll go parse damage and stuff now. I've seen it happen more than enough times already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Damage comparisons are mostly valid no matter what mob you use, as long as you use the same one.  Procrates are great on anything.<br />
<br />
If you are 65, use the Ogguk Exterminator.  He is very low, hits pathetically, and you can usually out-regen him without help, if your AC is decent.  Any weapon that procs a heal or a tap will put you ahead of him.  If you cannot pull him to the zoneline solo despite being KoS, then you really shouldn't be playing a shadowknight.</div></div><hr />
