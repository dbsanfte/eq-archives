<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darilius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, wanting to just test some things, I bought an Illusion: Iksar potion and headed to the hermit in west cab. before, i was kos (as ive only killed bout 30 forsakens) but after i used the potion i was amiable to the necro and ally with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Now, I know this is too good to be true. I hear of everyone else slogging through thousands and thousands of Forsakens to get to non-kos with these walking suitcases.<br />
<br />
So, please, someone burst my bubble for me. I cant do the GM quest like this, can I? Meaning that if i do certain turn-ins like this theyll get eaten, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wrong. You can do it that way.<br />
<br />
I didn't have necro faction til like oh a few hours before I got GM.<br />
I had been 2boxing my friends chanter with Project Illusion and just Iksar'ing myself for the handins.<br />
<br />
Worked just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Theemop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I&quot;ve been using Iksar Illusion through out the hole thing as Gnome SK.  All you have to do is look at the walk through in this thread.  If the words coming out of the quest npc's mouth does not match what is writen in this thread then your faction may not be high enough even with the illusion.  I did not run in to that problem at all though.  I went all the way through the Khukri quest and I'm doing the GM quest now and only have the Greenish Shard and Mirror left to do.  Haven't had a problem with the illusion the whole way through.</div></div><hr />
