<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Firee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">to get the mirror, i was told that i must down the poor boned girl ---DS in howling stone...<br />
<br />
who can give me some advice about it? how many guys i need? and what's the weakpoint of DS? and also, some detailed info about DS?<br />
<br />
(I am 60 DE SK, 5300HP of full buff, 1300ac of full buff. In my server, level cap is 60, and no AA. for we didn't have the LUC version open.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Download a map.  Get a single exp group together (including a rogue).  Have fun.<br />
<br />
Its not hard at all for a group of 60s.  Drusella herself is easier than the mobs on the way to her.  The one sticking point: keep moving to stay ahead of repops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having a 60+ necro helps.  Their undead slows and mezzes are nice, charms are nice as well.  The golems are flagged as undead, IIRC, so it makes Drusella's room a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Basically, the crawl through East wing is pretty simple, you don't absolutely need a roge if everyone can get a lev and a SoW/SoB/SoE.  Kill the golems at the entrance to the south wing, crawl on top of one of the fire pots there outside the door, then lev/run with speed buff across to the top of the East wing false stairs.  East wing door isn't locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pyroglyphix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, a rogue is needed, unless you have someone with the key. The door just past the golem room, right before Drusella, is locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had lots of fun collecting the pieces for the master key (iirc finger, thumb, forearm, glove). The south part was hardest to get (without a rogue), as you need to progress through north and west wings first, and it took us like 6 attempts to spawn the first boss.. I actually did this over the course of two days, and didn't log between or I'd lose my no rent keys.<br />
<br />
There's a trick to get to the east wing without the previous no rent keys, so I only worried about the south wing. With sow+levi you can float from west stairs to east stairs, avoiding the trap. The door isn't locked. However, if you get a group to HS, someone is guaranteed to not be able to do the float. Tried with 3 groups, and there was always one or two that couldn't do it. That's why I decided to work on the master key. Heck, I didn't even know I'd need it if we didn't have a rogue in group. After doing the combine, the door unlocked, though.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for Drusella to be up when I have time to do something about that. Can a druid track her from entrance? I figure you need a minimum of 4 people close to 65 to do east wing without risking a wipe. The spawn rate is quite fast, so if you linger, you're likely get adds. I strongly suggest a pacifier to single pull.<br />

<br />
Maybe you can get a no rent key in east wing for Dru's room, so you won't need a rogue? We didn't bother to spawn the Undertaker there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A druid can track her from the zone in but not a bard. I know this because I remember my first ever drusella kill when I was getting the mirror for myself and I brought a druid to see if she was up. Yeah 4 65s will be mega overkill considering 65 sks can solo her without too much problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know if the not-so-recent revamp has anything to do with, but south wing can be rough on 3 60+ people, and east wing can be rough on 4 (possibly depending on the route you take, and your experience of the zone)</div></div><hr />
