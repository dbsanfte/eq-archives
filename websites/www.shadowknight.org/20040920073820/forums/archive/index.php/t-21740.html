<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mnayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Post on EQ Live Forums (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shadowknights&amp;message.id=2368#M2368) <br />
<br />
Shadowknights,<br />
 <br />
We are currently gathering suggestions and feedback from the community on what you would like for your epic 2.0 effects. This would include any clickies, focus effects, or worn effects that we can place on the weapons to make them desirable for the intended class.<br />
<br />
While any suggestion is appreciated, please do keep in mind that we do have some constraints on what we can place on an item. We can only have 1 clickie, proc, or worn effect on an item, and we can only have 1 focus effect on an item. In terms of worn mods, we can add any of the currently existing mods to an item (for example haste, attack, shielding, avoidance, etc).  For clickie effects, we can and probably will use recast timers; so we can make powerful clickie effects and take on a relatively long recast time (instead of instant recast) to balance out an effect. Please keep in mind we’re talking about clickie/proc effects and are not currently looking for suggestions or feedback on stats, weapon type or design.  Please try to stay reasonable with your suggestions (IE: no death touch, AE rez, etc.) but definitely be creative . Thanks for the feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">100% nuke focus to lifetaps<br />
<br />
300 unresistable lifetap proc<br />
<br />
5% shielding, +5 combat effects<br />
<br />
yeah, thatll do it~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how useful is shielding, especially with the extremely low DB's on gates mobs?<br />
<br />
Straight lifetap proc seems to be the first thing that comes to mind, but someone mentioned on that thread the idea of a ZB style proc.... that has some potential imho.<br />
<br />
If it is a straight lifetap proc, it needs to be big enough to really make a difference.  250-350 range on gates mobs at a minimum, and it should be unresistable.  Impossible to say how big it should be vs  OoW mobs without knowing how much damage they'll do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Required lvl of 70 wuwu another object I'll never get!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Powerful pet focus effect.<br />
Proc (or better yet clicky, but doubt we'd get it) some kind of useful debuff I'll have to think more about.<br />
<br />
Maybe not as immediately useful as a ZBite proc or lifetap focus, but that's the kind of stuff that'll give the weapon longevity, and that's a good thing.  <br />
<br />
Shielding, Avoidance, Spell Shield, Combat Effects, Strikethrough, Accurace - we love them all, the more the merrier.  Don't put haste on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A Zbite like proc would help alot, I'm really against a pet focus, I'm probably in the minority, but I think a weapon should have effects that do work while actually using the weapon(swinging it, not just holding it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think longevity...<br />
<br />
Click &gt; worn effect for that reason.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking...<br />
<br />
+10% 2hs is better than any type of +ATK as it won't be hitting up against the cap that way.<br />
<br />
Focus: Pet Focus. That's something we can use forever after, and it would be something we don't presently get anywhere. A fitting focus for an Epic SK weap.<br />
<br />
Click effect: Divine Arbitration, semi long recast delay. This is the ultimate in a selfish SK spell, steal everyone's health and redistibute it for your benefit. Without a way to heal them like clerics/paladins, this would not be overpowering, just a great tool when you've screwed a pull and need to &quot;heal&quot; yourself, or to save a weaker member getting a beating before you can taunt it off. Or, just before you splat on a tough mob. Save yourself at the expense of others. Its an idea anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">... we need all the tanking help we can get, how about a proc tap that has AoP-like recourse that add AC and  Hps into the mix as well.   Bleeds off rapidly, but gives you an extra edge for a bit.<br />
<br />
Sorta suits the class, steal life from the foe to feed your own power.<br />
<br />
Scaling it properly might be problematic though, particularly at the bleeding edge of gear.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, one that has a Fear2-like stun effect, that agros like pallie stuns.  Can sub in other weapons on raid mobs, but would sure be nice for tanking duties.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Proc: 310dd, 200 heal, 75 group heal, 35 group mana, unresistable<br />
50% distance focus<br />
15% offense<br />
<br />
If we were going to get a click effect I would do another HT, an ae aura of hate (that stacks with all), etc... Pet focus should be aviable to us through other methods, we shouldn't have to blow our epic on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I kinda like the idea of a z-bite proc effect (tho better) as I am soooo over the whole solo idea. I prefer to make my allies and myself stronger in order to kill my Foes.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
What Brael suggests seems pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Brael's stuff makes for a hell of a nice weapon, but it's still something that will eventually become obsolete.  With something like a pet focus and indefinately useful proc/clicky (proc as in fire &amp; forget type proc like earthcaller - not something you need to *keep* proccing), it'll have the same shelf life as the cleric epic.<br />
<br />
Depends on what you want out of it I suppose... long-term tool or badass weapon for the era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, what click would you give us?  We should have access to pet focus without needing our epic for it unless it's a huge focus, and even then not all SK's use their pets so even that has limited value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">AE AoH should be in anyways in some form like a OoW AA.  Something we should be due without using an epic effect on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I said &quot;powerful&quot; pet focus. ;)  Make it significant.  SK's who never use their pet shouldn't be a reason to not give us a pet focus - there are members of every class who don't use all the tools available to them.  <br />
<br />
As for what clicky/proc, I havn't decided yet - an impactful debuff or perhaps a buff with reasonable but not excessive duration (couple minutes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok so ... hrmm..<br />
<br />
Make sure it has a really annoying lag causing graphic that looks great when it procs too .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm another idea... Rowyls Gleeful Destruction worn effect<br />
<br />
But, back to the pet focus thing, if anything that should be obtained by an aug you get as a reward along the way (think shaman sow boots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Already postet on the soe boards, just doing a copy/paste:<br />
<br />
Worn Effect: 20% Leechcurse  (heals user for 20% of the damage done to his target per hit, does stack with Leechcurse disc)<br />
 <br />
or/and<br />
 <br />
Focus Effect: 50% Improved Damage on all Spells<br />
 <br />
or/and<br />
 <br />
Clickspell: Selfbuff/Debuff +500ATK/-1000AC stacks with all ATK and AC buffs (numbers to be adjusted as required)<br />
 <br />
or/and<br />
 <br />
Clickspell: Unresistable Disease Debuff on Targeted NPC Resist Disease -60<br />
 <br />
or/and<br />
 <br />
proc: 100 mana drained from target<br />
 <br />
or/and<br />
 <br />
proc: drain 10 AC from mob each time proc goes off - duration 5 minutes. <br />
        Example: Each time the proc goes off it adds to itself till it starts decreasing after 5 minutes - if it procs 10 times within the 5 minutes on the same mob the mob will be debuffed about 100 ac and the sk will have gained 100 ac , now the first 10 ac that got drained will fade buff/debuff decreases to 90 ac debuffed/90ac buffed. If the mob dies the buffed ac will stay on the sk till it decreases completly, but if the sk starts fighting a new mob and the proc goes off it will debuff again for 10 ac and decrease the existing corelating ac buff on the sk to 10ac.<br />
This proc will only have minimal influence on short fights but as fights duration increases its value increases too. If more then one sk with this weapon is fighting the mob all can stack with each other up to a defined maximum of maybe 300 ac or variable from mob to mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Focus: Nuke focus that works with all our nukes, including super HT. I.e. an 'of Solusek' focus.<br />
<br />
Skill mod: Weapon skill mod.<br />
<br />
Shielding or avoidance unless that conflicts with a weapon skill mod, in which case I would prefer shielding/avoidance.<br />
<br />
Equippable in range slot! <br />
<br />
Effect: I'm  with the clicky crowd here. Something flavorful and unique that remains useful even after the weapon is obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Be nice if SoE decide whether we are a pet class or not. <br />
<br />
Personally I would rather that Shd's be included on the existing Pet Focus items/augs than it being on our epic.<br />
<br />
+20% to Weapon Skill would be a nice way for SoE to raise our offense to cap without annoying the dps classes.<br />
<br />
Other than that then :<br />
<br />
1. Just your basic LT or DD proc (make it a reasonable amount)<br />
<br />
2. A stackable (this is important!) debuff/buff spelleffect.<br />
<br />
Guess it depends on if we get any changes from SoE to up our tanking ability. If we do and are finally up there with Paladins, then a more offensive (ZB) effect is better, if not then more defensive (ac, atk debuff)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You guys don't dream enough. An HT proc would rock, using all the aa's you've put into it.

3) Improve Augment Slots as you progress also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">+atk would be pointless.  The final weapon is for the end-game SK, who will have atk capped anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">you are probably correct. My bigger point though it to make the epci continue to increase in power as you go through the adventure..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I liked the proc on the old epic ... make it 240 hp's tapped per tick and last only 3 ticks so it can go to the short buff slots.<br />
As a worn effect some kinda permanent lifetap, say like 5% of the dmg done would be cool.<br />
Hmm clicky ... maybe an instant Cast FD with a medium to long recast.<br />
As Focus id like to see kinda 50% improved Healing to all our spells which heal HPs<br />
<br />
would greatly help with tanking and we finaly would have our hotkey FD   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Right click defensive ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ilvai Oloth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">lol, skvan. ;)<br />
<br />
I personally enjoy having a lifetap proc on my weapon...  as long as it has that, I'm sure I'll be satisfied with whatever else they put on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Proc:<br />
 <br />
300 damage to target, 300 health to group, 150 mana to group, -500 MR or Unresistable.<br />
 <br />
Focus:<br />
 <br />
A Solusek type damage focus, 30% or better.<br />
 <br />
Click:<br />
 <br />
Once an hour, 5000 damage to target, 5000 health to group, 2500 mana to group. -500 MR or Unresistable, instant cast.<br />
 <br />
Worn:<br />
 <br />
+2h slash (assume it's a sword), +bash damage, +avoid, +shield should all be acceptable.<br />
 <br />
I like the request some of the others have made here that convertible would be nice 2h or 1h/shield combo. Make the uest result in shield and 1h, make it so that the clicky on the shield converts the sword between 1h and 2h and have the shield effect check to see if it's effect is blown before conversion to prevent abuse of the big Z Bite. Maybe make the shield wearable on back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Proc: Z-Bite style proc, prolly weaker and skewed towards the lifetap side like Brael's recommended version, since too much mana could be imbalanced. (esp. considering by endgame OoW it looks like we'll have FOUR Zev's as is)<br />
Skill Mods (they can do 2 skill mods on an item, right?): +10% 2HS(or 1HS if the epic is 1HS) +10% Offense<br />
Focus: Damage focus that covers HT, all DD and all DoT lines, hopefully around 50% or higher mod.<br />
<br />
And of course most importantly, make the storyline to it at least as cool and innovative as the original SK epic's - collecting all the parts sucked, but the storyline on the original was quite amazing overall.<br />
<br />
Oh, and make sure the name doesn't suck ass. XXXXXXX's Reaver of Harnessed Chaos would be cool and fitting the prelim images.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'd really like to see progression of the epic through the use of augments.<br />
<br />
Say SK epic 1.5 has these stats to make it comparable to Vanazir's from PoTime.<br />
<br />
Damage: 60<br />
Delay: 38<br />
Some stats.<br />
Proc: Dark Siphon<br />
Slot 1, type 9: empty<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, during the rest of the epic quest, you have 6 major milestones, each gets you a new type 9 augment.<br />
<br />
1st<br />
Damage: 5<br />
Some stats.<br />
Skill mod: 2HS +3%<br />
<br />
2nd<br />
Damage: 10<br />
Some stats<br />
Skill mod: 2HS +6%<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
5th<br />
Damage: 25<br />
Some stats.<br />
Skill mod: 2HS +15%<br />
<br />
6th<br />
Damage: 30<br />
Some stats<br />
Proc: Zevfeer's Bite<br />
Skill mod: 2HS +15%<br />
<br />
Alternative to the 6th augment would be a replacement of the blade with a more prominent particle effect to make it visibly different to the epic 1.5 model.<br />
<br />
Then during the expansion following Omens, progression based quests could be implemented to keep people's epics current.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Proc:<br />
350hp/150mana self tap - Suppose could be a group one too if not demed to powerful.  Is a lvl 70 weapon I suppose.<br />
<br />
Focus:<br />
Summoned Pet is considered 20 levels higher than base or something a bit higher than the normal pet class focuses.  I'd be a bit against spector image too since that's more what necros have now.  See a skelly pet at a raid and it's obviously a shadowknights.  Maybe this focus would also summon the pet with a weapon or spercial graphic like has armor?<br />
<br />
Click:<br />
Damange Shield that stacks with other stuff, but maybe not all.  It does 50dmg and gives us back 10hp per hit.  Not the craziest but what clicky is?  Also could maybe instead have a click effect that casts a sk type Bulwark of Vie self only.  That could be cool.<br />
<br />
Decided to elaborate more on the DS, stacks with like CoL but not druid ds.  That kind of stacking.<br />
<br />
Skill Mod: +20% 2hs (don't make the fucker a 2hb).<br />
<br />
Worn:<br />
Strikethrough 20%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Juggernaut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sorry but Pet Focus is THE last thing I would want on an epic<br />
<br />
I hate the fact they've given us so many damn pet AAs as is, last thing I need is for them to start balancing us with our pet as the main focus for balance<br />
<br />
What do I want on the epic? am still thinking about it, there's a few good suggestions mentioned above, but it sure as hell doesn't involve a pet focus, I'd be pissed if they added that<br />
<br />
EDIT:  As to why I hate pets? I played a mage from 99-early 2003, am bitter, pet's are too situational, they die too easily, focused or not, felt like playing a gimp wizard, our pet is an ok DoT and a tool for pulling, nothing more<br />
<br />
So think more Shadowknight when thinking of the epic, and less Necro hand me downs, heck I can't recall the last time I saw a necro using his pet when soloing or in a group</div></div><hr />

you would have your suggested lifetap proc, a type 4 proc, and a type 8 proc, in addition to the leechcurse focus. SoE wont go for this.  Maybe a type 5 aug slot for a 2h damage mod and a type 8?</div></div><hr />

The last thing I want, is to be tied to an inferior weapon because it has some focus effect I can't live without.  <br />
<br />
Same for a click effect, unless that click makes it a better weapon, it'll only end up being obsolete even faster.<br />
<br />
We're a melee class, weapons are always going to be replaced by better weapons.  Making our epic weapon a focus or utility item just means it'll start in a bag, instead of ending up there.</div></div><hr />

Another option although they would never do it, give it the right click necro res, even if could only use once an hour and still needed the stone would be worth it.<br />

<br />
We're a melee class.  We use weapons to hit things with.  Any effect which adds lasting utility to our epic, but detracts from it's primary use as a weapon is bad, in my opinion.  I don't want an epic clicky item to keep in a bag, I want an epic weapon, one that stays in my hands as long as possible, because of it's ability to deal damage.<br />
<br />
If I have a choice of &quot;1 clickie, proc, OR worn effect&quot; on the epic, then I sure as hell want it to be one kick-ass combat related effect.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the focus effect.  A 75% DD focus might sound great to some, but all that will do is end up tying you to an inferior weapon until you finally find a weapon that is so superior, that it eclipses even the spell focus.<br />
<br />
A defensive effect on the epic would be just as bad, since it would ultimately factor into our balance as a class, tying us to the epic again, way past it's worth as an implement of destruction.<br />
<br />
How many people asking for lasting utility on the epic actually got their current epic when it was new content?  You look today and see clerics still getting their epics, but SKs shopping in the bazaar for better and long for an epic that is as useful as the clerics.  I got my epic when it was the absolute best weapon in the game and believe me, I never wished for a little more utility on it.<br />
<br />
Ask for interim items that provide lasting utility, but don't sacrifice one iota of offense on the weapon to get it.</div></div><hr />

I ask because, like epic 1.0, it was 'unattainable' at the time they came out, unthinkable for me to get one kinda thing -- so I basically never started 'em till I had nothing better to do (finished levelling, etc.).  But if they are staged or progressional, then I am definitely interested; since having say, 1.4 would be better than what I have although I would still 'never' see 1.9/2.0.<br />

To veer back on topic, I think the good stuff has been mentioned already.

There will be two stages to the epic 2.0 quest.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5, which should be roughly equivalent to a PoTime weapon and questable by casual players.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0, which will be the best weapon in the game and require a high end raiding guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I think the pet idea is stupid. Yeah you want it to have longevity, but a pet buff? Thats ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I think the 2h should be able to morph into a sheild. The sheild should be range/back/secondary equipabble. When you have it on your back it should appear the same as if you had it in your secondary slot. (Its an epic, so it would be cool to have a sheild on your back, when you eventually upgrade the weapon.) Some cool particle effect for the sheild would be sweet. The 2h and sheild should have the same proc/effect/mods just the stats would change a bit. (I'm not saying you should be able to have both at the same time, one or the other) You could even have it go from a 2h to 1h &amp; sheild, then give the 1h a proc and the sheild an effect.<br />
<br />
Some cool effects I think should be on the epic 2.0:<br />
<br />
+offence <br />
(Then when you have it equipped as a sheild with a 1h or eventually a new 2h, it still gives a nice bonus to our skills. None of that +2hs mod crap.)<br />
<br />
I like the leechcurse type effect, something like 10-40% Maybe scaling with content.<br />
<br />
Reincarnation - once every game day (or RL day) kinda like DI (or I think thats the right spell). Maybe clickable on others?<br />
<br />
ZB proc is cool, but I think a proc is nothing compared to an effect/clicky.<br />
<br />
Maybe some type of atk/ac aura that affects a certain radius around you. Goes in bard buff box.<br />
<br />
Along with the aura idea, maybe an aura that slowly drains health from every pc around you, maybe something like 1hp-5hp a tick per person. Have a max of the amount of people it can effect at the same time.<br />
<br />
A massive AE HT that takes you to 1hp (or some low amount), makes you feign death and maybe has some type of rez effect. I.E. drains your strength for a set amount of time ect.<br />
<br />
Some kinda of Death Knight skill, where you turn incorporal and have massive atk bonus for a set amount of time. Maybe it lowers all your casting times during the duration and has a 50% or greater damage increase on your spells for the duration.<br />
<br />
You could go the opposite and have it be a defense (not defensive) type effect, where it has some type of AE taunt and lowers all your attacking skills while raising your defense.<br />
<br />
Both would be cool with some massive monster transformation. Maybe they could make you as big as a boss mob, so that you could fight like power rangers!<br />
<br />
Summon Death: Summons some type of Grim Reaper that does a rain or AE damage against all the mobs in the area. Kind of a flyby type of thing. Would be a cool animation.<br />
<br />
If anyone likes some of these ideas you can repost them on the SoE board, I don't have an account there.</div></div><hr />

Click Effect: Imbue pet with a 45% slow proc (doesn't stack)<br />
<br />
Focus: something that doubles the duration or halves the mana required by long-term detrimental spells<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno.  I'm thinking mainly of soloing ability, since it's basically non-existant  from late PoP on.  I miss being able to solo effectively for AA points.  Aggro kiting is about the only way to do that now, and that means your pet does most of the work.  When aggro kiting, I can't load up the dots because I will go OOM long before the mob is dead.  When aggro kiting, weapon DPS and procs are meaningless.  Instead, let my pet proc a slow so that I can possibly snare kite til slowed, and then melee it after slowed.<br />
<br />
I'm sure those two ideas aren't very good.  Feel free to poke holes in them.  The problem with most of these solutions is that they won't scale at all and will be obsolete immediately in the next expansion.  The Zev's Bite proc sounds interesting, but will it matter during the following expansion.  Also, it won't be useful once the weapon is bagged, and I too would like a weapon that retains SOME value long after it has been bagged for inferior ratio/stats.<br />
<br />
Another nice proc would be a Fear2 type stun we've talked about.  Barring everything else, I guess a lifetap proc or maybe the leechcurse proc some have talked about.</div></div><hr />

He's right about not gimping the weapon with a non-combat proc for the sake of longevity. Those things should be on interim rewards. I'm talking pet focuses, 50% solusek focuses, etc. I still think 15-20% 2hs mod is the bomb!</div></div><hr />

Effect: Divine Arbitration (Triggered) Charges:Unlimited. Cast time: Instant. Reuse timer: 420 seconds. (7 mins)<br />
Focus Effect: Death's Vengeance. When wielding a two-handed weapon, any succesful riposte's damage will be quadrupled (4x), and a 50% chance to Flurry upon that riposte - with all proceeding attacks in the Flurry being given a +30% damage bonus.<br />

The first would lower resist rates and fizzle rates (the effect already exists, for anyone who has had Brilliance of Ro will attest), and the second would increase spell-based DPS output beyond what foci allow.  If twenty percent is too much, lower it to 15 or even 10.  Dont assign the standard limitations of minimum duration or Instant only.

For epic 1.0 we had pretty close to the least powerful epics with the highest difficulty of aquiring, id like the reverse of that this time round :p <br />
<br />
If ya want an epic that will last forever, put a click rez on it for say 75 percent and have it consume multiple peridots or opals for each cast.  I suggest dots and opals becuase i already carry those around :p.  I have rez on the brain becuase im down to my last staff of forbidden rites :D .<br />
<br />
And boo to all the people that have suggested anything that takes up a buff slot or is a dot.  Im just assuming epics will be the best items in the game for each class hands down, if your in a position for being able to get it you will agree with this.  But i suppose there is a chance they will make the quests easy so everyone can enjoy the epic2.0.<br />
<br />
Epic2.0 should also have ac and hps on it so there is no point to using sword and board.  Unless the suggestion of having it able to split out into different configurations happens.</div></div><hr />

Our epic was badass when it came out.  Hard?  Yes, but badass.  That proc meant something back in kunark.  <br />
<br />
But i suppose there is a chance they will make the quests easy so everyone can enjoy the epic2.0. <br />
<br />
Not unless they change their mind.  Already stated it was for the top-end crowd.  Granted, everyone'll see it eventually due to mudflation, but not for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">If the epic (ie 2) involves the same amount of work and commitment 1 did at time of release, then the vast majority of posts above are short selling what the weapon should be.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see an item that retains a unique value as a secondary item long after it is no longer your primary weap.  Which means a foci, effect, or buff that is pretty special and that the item is range or back equipable. <br />
<br />
Much of the posts discuss stuff which is incrementally nice, but neither class unique or long term in vision.<br />
<br />
That or the epic2.0 is a lot closer to rogue 1 in work than sk 1 was at release.  It was months before there was even one on my server, and by the time there was four luclin was out and people were getting better.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Slein Jinn, please re-read my post.<br />
<br />
I DID type it after flying back to Ohio from Australia (24 hours travel time total) so it may have been written a little wonky. If re-reading it doesn't help, let me clarify here:<br />
<br />
Make the epic have two stages. <br />
<br />
In one stage, make it a 2 hander with the ability to do a lot of DPS. This would include a proc/clicky with a very powerful effect, however one day the sword and effect would become outdated.<br />
<br />
In the second stage (the weapon would need to be able to switch between the two stages at will), make the epic a one handed weapon plus a shield. These would do less DPS than the two hander, but could have improved tanking stats. Also, because there would be two items, they could both be given effects or clickies that would have great utility and would be usefull even after the weapon itself became obsolete.<br />
<br />
Thus, our Epic 2.0 would both have long lasting utility and be very good for dealing damage. For balance reasons, there might have to be a delay (maybe a long one, like an hour instead of a minute) between switching from the 2 hander to the 1 hander/shield.<br />
<br />
EDIT: To be clear, the &quot;stages&quot; are not epics 1.5 and 2.0. Both 1.5 and 2.0 would be able to convert - at least thats how I see it. If we pitch the idea to SOE they may want one stage to be 1.5 and the other to be 2.0. All that really matters is that you can switch back and forth at will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about a weapon that improved against different types the more you kill?<br />
<br />
as an example, give it 3 damage modifiers<br />
<br />
+ X against undead<br />
+ X against animal<br />
+ X again humanoid.<br />
<br />
For every 1,000 mobs of undead, you get a +1 to damage against undead. So if you killed 3,000 you would get a +3 to undead. make it max out about +10 to any type.<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe this is a dumb idea, but I am posting it anyway. Everyone would just go to kurns and sit there for 5 hours and kill skellies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry but I really don't like a lot of what I am reading here, though some have good ideas. Since there are going to be 2 versions of the epic (epic 1.5 for casual gamers and epic 2.0 for raiders), I think the effects on these should be as follows:<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5:<br />
<br />
Proc: Make a new spell in the database that gives 500 direct damage to the target, heals the group for 500 hp, and gives 50 mana to each group member, range 200<br />
<br />
Worn Effect: 200% chance to hit target<br />
<br />
Focus Effect: Make a new focus effect for this weapon, that is +30% damage imcrease to all direct damage AND damage over time spells, and reduces the mana cost on all spells by 20%, works up to level 70<br />
<br />
Make it range slot equipable for the inevitable future upgrade that would otherwise make us bank it<br />
<br />
Make 4 Type 8 augment slots on it<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0:<br />
<br />
Proc: Make a new spell in the database that gives 1000 direct damage to the target, heals the RAID for 1000 hp, and gives 100 mana to each RAID member, range 400<br />
<br />
Worn Effect: 200% chance to hit target<br />
<br />
Focus Effect: Make a new focus effect for this weapon, that is +40% damage imcrease to all direct damage AND damage over time spells, and reduces the mana cost on all spells by 30%, works up to level 70<br />
<br />
Make it range slot equipable for the inevitable future upgrade that would otherwise make us bank it<br />
<br />
Make 5 Type 8 augment slots on it<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I really hope you at least consider these suggestions. Thank you for asking.<br />
