<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 59. Thought I was tough. Been a regular of PoN hedge and PoD ncy camps for many weeks but the xp had finally become crappy when I hit 59. Was a suggestion from a guildmate to go to CoD and get a group together there at the entrance. No prob, I bring a few friends, make a group and get ready to rock. With full buffs I run about 5800 hitpoints (my magelo does not show all my augments, there's one on every piece I own). AC can be around 1200. Now, I've tanked things that have hit for 375x2 with no problem.<br />
 <br />
Well, these things hit for max 500 on me but the normal is about 275-425 single hits. Yesterday I went down 5 times!! This morning I went down 4 times. I am starting to get frustrated because I hate having the group wait for me to get rez'd and not to mention the danger when MT goes down in a group full of paper armored dps and casters. I think the problem is that I have to pull. I found out early I need to stay away from the Greater Puss guys (omg, horror story) so I try to pull around them, I attempt to bring singles just for the fact that my wife is our chanter and she cannot mez them. Also to add that we brought another chanter and mez failed and wiped half the group shortly thereafter. So singles are best. The problem with this is when I have to split, I normally get hit a few times waiting for the dark'd mob to move far enough out of ranger of spawn spot to split. So I usually am bringing the mob in with 70% life. Lower if I had to split a Greater off. <br />
<br />
The question. With my hitpoints and AC, bringing a mob in to camp with my life at 70%, should I be dying so much ? Am I not supposed to be tanking these things ? Do my clerics (I don't want to offend any of my friends) not understand how hard these guys hit ? They can triple me for up to 1500 in one round so unslowed these things are really mean. I am just confused, how did I go from the perfect tank in PoD and PoN to a dead man walking in CoD ? <br />
<br />
I don't want to offend my friends who are the clerics but I really think they need to hit CH right when I bring the mob to camp, and heal as needed until slowed. Am I wrong ? I really believe I should be able to tank these things without going down so much. Suggestions ? Comments ? I try telling my friends in subtle ways that I am not a warrior with 6k hp and 10% total mitigation. Should I just give up and get a warrior to tank ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't say it is your fault at all man. I went to CoD when I hit 60 and I used to get raped too. One of my best friends in the game is a cleric and after finding out that I could get owned in about 3 seconds we needed to make a new plan. She would put an elixir on me as soon as I was in range to get me through that window where the mob is unslowed, and basicly Ch directly after. <br />
<br />
For me, every time I would jump tiers in PoP I found that there was always a certain amount of time needed to get used to the DPS on unslowed mobs. If the clerics are your pals you just have to make them understand that they need to be ready for worst case scenario. Healing early and having it not be totally mana efficient is far better than having to train out of a zone or die and rez the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gromrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I was playing my cleric I had gotten used to letting my friend's warrior get down pretty low before starting a CH on him.  Well, the first time I went to PoV with him I learned mighty fast that those tactics were never going to work.  I would usually have to start my CH as soon as he was in range on incoming to land it in time.  The mob usually got slowed pretty quick after it got to the group, so that first heal was the only one I had to start when he was at about 70-75%.  Occasionally I'd have to take a couple hits or use my DA, but not too often.  I'm not sure how the mobs in CoD compare to PoV since I never got flagged for CoD.  I stopped playing EQ before they opened most of the PoP zones to everyone for exp.  Just let your friends know they need to heal a little earlier until the mob is slowed and then work as normal.  Having them cast a celestial on you when you go out to pull will help a lot as well.  I would usually do that for my friend when he ran off to pull just to buy me a little more time before I had to drop the CH bomb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IMHO, you shouldn't be getting hit at all using snare until you get back to camp.  You should have run3, and sow when available (not sure about CoD) to keep you ahead of the mobs.<br />
<br />
There are other CC methods besides Mez.  Root is extremely effective.  Snare kite is another.  If you suspect an add, give the target and have a rooter be ready.<br />
<br />
I highly agree with Gromrot.  Your healer needs to adjust.  Heal early, have patch healers heal you on inc while the cheal starts and slow lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gromrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, before we had a chanter or bard high enough to mez adds for us reliably, our wizard would snare kite and/or root any adds we had.   He would usually try to root the add, but if he had problems with root getting resisted he would just keep kiting it.  That usually worked very well for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have played a cleric a bit and have tanked in places like CoD (and worse).<br />
<br />
The first thing to recognize as a cleric is that Cheal has problems for those tanks that are &quot;new&quot; to that tier before the slow sets in.  In these situations, a cleric may wish to HoT as the mob comes to camp and to spot heal until the slow lands.<br />
<br />
As your level builds up (and eventually your AAs), you can get to only using Cheals (your mitigation and avoidance basically makes that unslowed bit a much smaller percentage of your hps).<br />
<br />
I remember tanking in PoV for my first time when I was level 60.  The golem tripled me and proced in the first round of combat and I lost 1/3 of my hps in that single round of combat.  The first time a cleric sees this they tend to panic.<br />
<br />
Now if a cleric doesn't know you (i.e. your in a pickup group), he should treat you as a new tank to that level until he knows otherwise.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Greater Pusslings in CoD are mini-named and drop actual loot.  They are not slowable iirc and will suck a lot of mana from your group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The problem with rooting and kiting is casters tend to get 1 rounded if it's resisted (tried this, ranger went down in two rounds then the mob turned and killed the cleric in one round), which then turns into a waiting game of rez/rekei/revirtue bla bla bla. I like to bring singles.<br />
<br />
Bringing singles is not just darkness and run back to camp. As you kill more and go down further into the halls you have to split. When you darkness one, the other of course comes faster. Since you want the one you darknessed far enough away from their original spawn spots you usually have to take a round of beating from the unsnared mob so the snared mob can make it's way towards you.<br />
<br />
The other problem with kiting and splitting in CoD is tight quarters. It's not PoV with an open area you can have ample space to run in circles. You camp at the entrance and there is usually 2 groups there pulling from the 3 hallways. Kiting around would definately piss off the other group, I know it would piss me off if they were kiting around my group. During splits, I tend not to run too far away in case the other groups puller is near. <br />
<br />
But on a good note, I hit level 60 and can tell a huge difference in tanking ability. I also went 2 days straight with only 1 death there. Somehow, amazingly... there was this cleric named Page who reset my belief in clerics. Kept me alive the whole time. I told her of my prior days experience and took the advice here and asked her for an elixer on Incoming. She did so and everything went smooth, almost easy. I can't believe that's all it was, a stupid elixer would have prevented about 10 deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ognij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Level 61 helped a lot for pulling CoD as it added Festering Darkness to the spell line up.<br />
This seems to generate less social agro and allowed single pulls to be made more easily.<br />
Its quite a slow 'snare' too, so it gives the casters more time to debuff the incoming mob so that it is already slowed by the time it is in the camp.  Drop a CD or two on the incoming mob as well and it should keep the agro on you and avoid the shaman/enchanter getting hit.<br />
<br />
Sometimes targetting is difficult due to the cobwebs in there, a way around it is to cycle views using F9 so that you have a better viewpoint on the mobs.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for the 'wanderer' in CoD that likes to appear at the 'crossroads'.  Its easy to run into him on a pull sometimes, usually he can be avoided by careful planning, or FD if he is unavoidable.<br />
<br />
If your enchanter has Dire Charm, the little rats make great pets (scrounging rat I think they are called).  They often spawn to the right of the 'crossroads' and you can pull one back for the enchanter to charma nd add some reasonable DPS to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Onji on the festering darkness comment.  Basically, I'll pull a mob and lead it with run3 until I am in sight of the camp.  Then I will cast festering darkness on it.  If you time it right, the mob can be malo'd and slowed just as you engage it.  This helps a LOT when you have relatively low hp for the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Practice pulling a bit more would help too.  I started tanking there at 57, and with similar hp but lower ac.  On a good night, I could pull singles on most of the pulls via prox pulling.  On the chance of an add, FD or if group can handle two bring em both.  Only deaths I took then were both to the same Greater, he wiped group the first try, then second try I died with him at 2% :( .  You'll have to practice the prox pulling to get good at it in there, since targetting is a pain due to the spider webs.  Having a #1 helps, though any invis works.  (and to note, I got out of practice after I hit 58 due to getting my HoH key, and when I later went back to CoD at 61, I suddenly couldn't pull worth a crap due to lack of practice)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Simple.<br />
<br />
Festering one mob, run it back with add, fd, add resets, single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea, I learned I'm pretty much a kick ass puller. The problem was people not paying attention to what I was saying.<br />
<br />
Things like... heal me.<br />
<br />
Seriously. I don't know what the hell the problem was with some of the clerics I was with but today I was pulling and tanking with only a mere Temp on. That's about 4300 hp for me. Compared to 5800 fully buffed those other clerics were dealing with. Get real right. Frickin clerics I swear. Dime a dozen but it seems you have to bring the whole dozen to get one timely heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One of your problem is slow not landing fast enough.  With a festering and a fear, the shaman can cast malo/malos and 2 slow without aggro.  Try to coordinate landing the slow before engaging the mob and you'll be just fine.<br />
<br />
No cleric can heal you effectively without a slow in those PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I avoid CoD like the plague (no pun intended)... always have mainly because all my favorite spells to use don't land. It limits my effectiveness, kind of like BoT South camps. Other thing is the unslowable CoD mobs are just plain annoying.<br />
<br />
When I was that level I went to PoV, even though those damn golems unslowed can still rock my world.</div></div><hr />

You could just possibly be right! Before I got Festering I would 2-3 times cast CD on INC and hit it with a spear right before engaging. The spear is always resisted so I figured it for great agro but it seemed my wife (chanter) could only tash the mob. If she tried to slow it before engaging it would make a beeline for her instead.So she would start slow when I hit attack, this would cause 2-3 rounds of combat damage I am taking by an unslowed mob. I will definately try the fear thing. Kinda a new thing for me since I'm new to these levels where fear doesn't make them run away and get friends :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just keep in mind, DC pets still can be feared, i forgot that once :D<br />
<br />
And CoD sucks ass imho. Allmost all our great 60+ spells are perma resisted there due to immunity, i prefered PoD, the castle area there, get a good group and chain kill, till i got into HoH and BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I spent a lot of time in CoD; and although usually we had a slower, occasionally we wouldn't have one and in those instances I made sure we had a top-notch cleric or we'd go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I preferred to fight the undead mobs past the 4-way, meaning we could have a necro slow if no shammy/chanter available.  You just have to be a bit careful if Carprin was up but otherwise most other groups preferred to fight at zone in and pull the pygmy things or rats.  If Carprin wasn't up and most of the mobs didn't see invis (go figure, undead but both invis and ITU works) we might go deep into the undead area.  I found the xp very good in comparison to other Tier2 zones.</div></div><hr />
