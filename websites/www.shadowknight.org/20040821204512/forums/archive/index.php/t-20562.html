<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright i got a recent experience with someone i know going to see this movie. All of a sudden out of the blue, this person starts going to church and wants the rest of their family to go with them. Take note of the fact that they really did not have much concern for church or religion before seeing this. It just strikes me as odd and i think it is totally stupid. Comments? Experiences?<br />
<br />
God must have loved his son so much that he gave him his own major motion picture i guess....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...but I see a lot of white non-negro types talking like they are from the 'hood, and a lot of tricked out japanese cars, and a huge resurgence in the popularity of fantasy related stuff.  <br />
<br />
all due to the influence of media/movies.  Why do you find it so strange?<br />
<br />
People are impressionable, dumb people even more so.<br />
<br />
That said, maybe your friend had an epiphany, and Mel Gibson was just the vehicle God was reaching out through... <br />
<br />
Even an old fart like God probably has realized there's a better use for mass media than Jimmy swaggart type sermonizing.  <br />

so true, i like to use the analogy that ppl are like cattle just following the herd.   <br />
<br />
Does it drive you nuts when stuck in traffic for hours and when you finally get to the end of it, it's just someone pulled over or something and people just have to stop and look like they've never seen something like that before...</div></div><hr />

Bottom Line:  There's some pretty stupid people out there.</div></div><hr />

I guess the real question about your friend is whether or not he's happier now than he was before.  I am not sure if it matters if it makes sense or not, as long as it works for him.  Haven't seen the movie though so can't really help much there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Watch this movie! Just... not at work or with a toddler on your lap watching you play with the computer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who the fuck cares why your friend reacted to the movie the way he did.   Just make sure that you don't go watch the movie or you might go crazy too.  Totally crazy shit like going to church on sunday and shit,  better yet, watch the movie,  but wear tin foil on your head,  that way they won't get to you the way they got to him..</div></div><hr />

Cloth armor for loot and a 72 hour respawn timer. No wonder the Romans thought it sucked crossing Jesus like that.</div></div><hr />
