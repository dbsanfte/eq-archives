I can solo guards...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroolhand</div><div class="date">04-14-2005, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you asking about the faction quests that are given out at the wayfarer's camp? If that is the case, I believe there aren't any that you can do after reaching indifferent.  But thats ok, because at indif, you are eligible to begin your progression with the faction of your choice via solo'able tasks.<br />
<br />
I think your asking about the Way-camp ones like collect 10 frothing drake bloods etc. To my knowledge these are just ways to get extra faction hits of your choice while you work up to indif......those particular npc's quit offering quests after indif for me.</div></div><hr />

makes perfect sense to me... there were easy faction quests before... now he's looking for more easy faction quests after.<br />
<br />
Once you hit indifferent, you can start DoN progression, and those are like a bit more difficult faction quests that can only be done once.  For my evil progression, the lavaspinners were quite easy, but I didn't attempt the basilisks or the stillmoon drakes yet.  I enjoyed the 'wayfarer' tasks until indifferent as well...<br />
<br />
not sure (i haven't checked)... but if you're willing to ping-pong between factions... you can try doing some good wayfarer quests until you're below indifferent again.</div></div><hr />
