<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I killed princess now a few days but the island is pretty camped now as all seem to be in epic panic atm :)<br />
<br />
Is it possible for ..that the BoA drops as well from one of the other mobs on Island 1....and further, is is possible to duo (me and a 61 cleric) the 2nd island? <br />
<br />
Thats the last dang thing i need for mine and it seems is the new bottel neck.<br />
<br />
thx<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phlegyas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'd get a lot of adds on the 2nd island, might be a problem for just 2.<br />
<br />
Only the boss mobs drop the class common islands for the first few islands, later on though, the island mobs will drop them.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im in the same situation, BoA is all i need for my epic too. me and monk friend cant get through to island 5 but the named there death touches and thats is usually how far we go. i think ive killed mini boss mobs about 10 or so times now and still no luck, <br />
 and to get one thing clear, can the boa drop off any mini boss on each island or just the ones posted on allakhazam. thanks</div></div><hr />

We took a raid up there today, nothing on Islands 1-4 dropped it. We killed the Spiroc Lord aprox 20 times and got 4 spiroc wingblades, but not one BoA. I've been to Fear and 5 golems kills (3 war epic drops), no Soul Leach either. Anyone else see an imbalance?  :( <br />
<br />
What recommened force should I try to take to take to say, clear island 2 on occasion? The peeps I have are mostly non EP/Time geared, though several 65's. Or if anyone has an extra on Tunare?  ;)</div></div><hr />
