<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Old Spell Clean-up<br />
<br />
I have a couple old spell issues, that I think would be useful to fix up.  Some honesltly appear to be oversights, while others are my hopefully balanced suggestions.<br />
<br />
1.  All &quot;Aura&quot; Spells to the short buff box.<br />
<br />
Aura of Hate<br />
Aura of Darkness<br />
Aura of Pain<br />
<br />
Should all go to the short buff box.  It would make these spells more desirable on raids, where buff slots are at a premium.  Not everyone can have a bard in their group and these spells are bard-like functions IMHO.<br />
<br />
2.  Aura of Pain to the group<br />
<br />
SK is the only one that benefits from this particular aura.  The other two benefit the group, it should probably all work the same in that regard.<br />
<br />
3.  Brell's + Aura of the Crusader v. Cloak of Luclin<br />
<br />
The essentially 300 hp advantage that Paladins get built in because of their spell stacking is excessive.  I think its appropriate for Paladins to have more hps OR more AC but not more hps AND more AC.  The simplest fix to this would be to make Cloak of Luclin stack with Brell's.  We'd still have lower hps and lower AC, but the gap would be narrowed.<br />
<br />
If a new spell is required, then make &quot;Aura of the Dark Crusader&quot; a hp/ATK/mana regen buff rather than a AC/HP/mana regen buff.  Same stack pattern as Aura of the Crusader and Blessing of the Nine (i.e., you can have 9+7+Symbol+Cloak of Luclin or Virtue+7+Aura of the Dark Crusader+Cloak of Luclin).<br />
<br />
GoD Spell Issues <br />
<br />
My only real gripe is with the new spear.  Spears kinda suck.  No offense.  In Luclin they were good, because almost everything was vulnerable to DR spells.  In PoP they suck because too many things are DR resistant.<br />
<br />
The high recast times on these really prevent me from wanting to use them.<br />
<br />
I'd much prefer that you provide an upgrade to Asystole, such as Cessation of Corr.<br />
<br />
Or, an unbalanced lifetap, such as 400 DD + 800 Recourse.  Obviously, you have concerns about raising our dps too high, but I have a concern that my lifetaps -- even my best lifetap -- barely moves my health bar.  I've got to be able to use a lifetap to rescue me from a late heal.</div></div><hr />

I have a couple old spell issues, that I think would be useful to fix up.  Some honesltly appear to be oversights, while others are my hopefully balanced suggestions.<br />
<br />
2.  Aura of Darkness to the group<br />
<br />
SK is the only one that benefits from this particular aura.  The other two benefit the group, it should probably all work the same in that regard.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The recourse from Aura of Hate and Aura of Darkness benefit the group.  Aura of Pain only benefits the caster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, that's right.  I typed that up at work and so was a little distracted.<br />
<br />
Aura of Pain needs to affect the group, not just the caster.  Thanks for catching that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless it can be clicked off or in the SD box, Aura of Pain should not be group. Some of your other suggestions are good though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im pretty sure paladins on the most part DONT have it over us in AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, they do as a practical matter, because they use Virtue instead of Symbol to achieve maximum hps.  <br />
<br />
Ward of Gallantry = 54 AC<br />
Blessing of the 9  =  32 AC<br />
Total = 86 AC<br />
<br />
Hand of Virtue = 72 AC<br />
Aura of the Crusader = 30 AC<br />
Total = 102 AC<br />
<br />
Using these spells, Brell's Stallwart Sheild and Focus of the Seven, they achieve both an 16 AC advantage AND ~300 hps.  True, they sacrifice FT 5, but they also save a precious buff slot (7,HoV, AoC, BSS v. 7,9,WoG,Symbol, BSS).<br />
<br />
Of course I can get another 18AC by using Cloak of Luclin, but that means that I fall even further behind Warriors and Paladins in hps.<br />
<br />
The FT 5 they loose is more than balanced by saving a buff slot -- we are talking about raids here.  Basically, the first thing that goes when I need more buff slots is SD (FT9/Regen9) or Word of Gallantry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or you can use rathe just like Paladins.<br />
<br />
Aura of Pain is way to powerful to be made group, should stay self only (btw we do have more AC than Pallys, grats AoP!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aura of pain should remain Self only. Its what gives us the advantage in AC over paladins.<br />
<br />
also Im one of those people who still use's Virtue, I like to have the buff slots free, and dont have mana problems..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this is a nicely written post, and I agree with what is said.<br />
<br />
My issue with the new spells is:<br />
<br />
1.  we wanted a spell that combines HP and mana gain via a proc.<br />
<br />
2.  our ancient spell is too pathetic of an increase considering the probable rarity of it dropping.<br />
<br />
3.  DR for spear: same damn resists again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like aura of pain.  AC = good.   now just to get my AC to post-AoP levels s. AoP @_@</div></div><hr />
