<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>noobsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have CS3, CA3, ND3, CF1, PE, ID4, LR5, PD3, TOL1, RS3, Regen3.<br />
<br />
Since I am currently unguilded, I am thinking about grinding out all the &quot;must have&quot; aa's before I start looking for another guild.  The way I see it, aa's &gt; gear for the most part until you get to a certain point where your doing stat increasing aa's or aa's that dont offer much reward for the time spent, then your better of focusing on raiding for gear.  What are some of the aa's that are a &quot;must have&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">horse is fun, SCF3 is a definite must, pet hold is great, SCE is nice if you use clinging darkness/fear for agro, and if you're looking for guild desired AAs improved HT and unholy touch are liked.<br />
<br />
you can look at the 3rd post in the stickied AA info thread for more info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beyond what Window mentioned, the Soul Abrasion line is worth considering, especially with the new self buff procs from GoD. ToL 3 compliments SA nicely. Run 4 and 5 are also a good acquisition, as are the Weapon Affinity AAs.<br />
<br />
Your spell collection, how often you pull, and what procs your weapon has on it are all very relative to which of these matter most to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SCF, SA, ToL all maxxed is your next step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HT AAs next.<br />
<br />
SCF3, IHT, UT3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, what Menon said.  My guild wouldn't even look at you without the HT aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">without seeing your magelo i think it's hard to say if AA's &gt; gear. if your gear is very subpar for 65 that i think that is more likely to affect your ability to get into a guild than whether or not you can drop a 10k harm touch once an hour. sure that's a big deal but if your ac is under 1300 and your hp's under 4000 unbuffed then that's probably a bigger problem.<br />
<br />
i came back to the game after a long break and had to replace all my gear. it took some time but between raising plat and grinding out ldon you can improve it very quickly. the other thing i'd mention is you are going to be a great deal more attractive if you have your 65 spells , well at least ToI and AoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I could have my HT AA's back to do over, I'd get packrat before them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah just buy some decent bags.  We are a STR class no reason to ever be buying packrat.<br />
<br />
I would also go for the HT AA's.  This is your main role in a raid at the moment and the first thing people are going to ask you.<br />
<br />
MC1 is also worthwhile.  1 mana/tick may not be that much but how much effort do people put into getting a FT items?  I accept the fact that I am a greedy person and want all the mana I can get.</div></div><hr />
