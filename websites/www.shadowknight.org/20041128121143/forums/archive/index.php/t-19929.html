<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>evilmite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since it looks that we are getting hosed on AA's and spells in the new Gates expasnion...How about you guys at SoE gives us soem new abilities that will bring us back into the race... right now we are just sitting on the sidelines TRYING to snare anyone....but they all resists it heheheh....<br />
<br />
Since the new warrior argo managment upgrades you have hosed us over on argo control as well tanking...and witht he new proc upgrade aa we are even more hosed over...not to mention makes almost 2 lines of spells useless....warriors do not need voices line(or have to many buffs as it is...and not even close to us...I can self buff 15 without any outside help WTF!!!!) and with thier overly super argo, Our terror Line of spells is a WATSE OF MANA...... Is it just me or did we lose  2 lines of spells with ONE SIMPLE UPGRADE????<br />
<br />
To bring us back in line give us an ability at lvl 61, 63, 65 and make END an issue to us.......<br />
<br />
Lvl 61... Life's hate.... Cost 250 End. to use and 50Upgrade cost.....Effect is For every point of damage we deal(either melle or ALL DAMAAGE-spell-melle-pet-ds-whatever) Adds that same amount of ADDITIONAL HATE...this way if we Need or just Want to take argo like we used to we can... But limit it to only like a 30sec time limit but have it on a 3min reuse time, or last 30secs with reuse of 5min but less End. cost....This will give us our argo control back into our hands Like it used to be<br />
<br />
Lvl 63 ...Love!....Cost 100 End. Upkeep is 25 End. Last 2.5mins reuse time of 30mins. Effect..The target is consumed with so much hate,  that only the death of the SK is the Only way the Target will sense danger from any other person.... As it implies-we target a mob and the only way it peels off of us is 3 ways, it dies, we die or the time elapses...givig us total domination<br />
<br />
lvl 65 ... ARISE... NO COST NO UPKEEP...1 week(168 hours)Effect...The target is assulted with the dead of the past...An Endless wave of undead(skeletons, zombies, ghouls, vampires..Etc) explode from the ground and assult the target relentlessly....The mob either takes 5 percent health per tick for 3 ticks(15% total damage to the mob) or kills them outright. The Shadowknights concentration on controling the undead is so great that they may not preform any action while this ability is in effect....At the end of this ability the Undead's fury turns upon thier master...reaping his soul from his body killing him instantly and prevent even the gods from interfering with thier vengence(prevents anything from stoping it..HS, DAbeing cast on them, DI, and even prevents thier body from bening resed so that we take a XP loss..... To prevent this from being Exploted by 7 sk's soloing a God, make it where this can be used only once on any givin Mob) This would make us wanted for raids......I know it would not fly but we can always dream!!!!<br />
<br />
What do you think....we can at least push from some abilities that will bring us back in par or gives us a slight edge...<br />

<br />
Love! -&gt; yet again overpowering and not needed<br />
<br />
Arise -&gt; uhm yeah ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>evilmite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never played warcraft 3... I tried to played the first one but could never get into those games...first person shooters and eq..<br />
<br />
As for those Abilities... you have to start somewhere and you have to ask High to get somethign decent or you will get something crap after hours and hours of beggin....Like verant would every gives us any of them..but maybe just maybe if others started asking for new abilities then we might get something... Do you have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, quite content with the sk as it is. Maybe Stonewall, i would really love that ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can honestly say from reading this post that I can understand your reasoning .. though your methodology is flawed.<br />
<br />
First .. a SK is just that .. a SK ... not a warrior ... not a necro ... a combination of both classes in order to obtain a class that can tank for exp groups and smaller PvE encounters and a class that can survive on its own with little outside help.  While the SK isn't the king of the soloing world, or the tanking world for that matter, they are probably one of the more self sufficient classes in EQ for all aspects of the EQ arena.<br />
<br />
At the high end forum of the game as a SK you DON&quot;T want agro.  Agro should always remain on the MAIN TANK during a raid encounter.  Taking agro from the MT at any given moment would get you killed and more than likely blow the raid.  No,  a SK's roll at the high end game is definately NOT the roll of a Main Tank, leave that roll to the warriors.<br />
<br />
I also wish that the SK's role in the ' LARGE ' PvE arena were extended to give the SK a broader role on raids and such .. but SoE just doesn't see things that way.  We are forced to sit back behind a mob, watching a 11k hp warrior slash and hack away ... while the rogues next to us are stabbing for 1.5k ... the wizzies behind us are landing bombs for 5-7k ... rangers bowing away for 500's on nearly every arrow ... while we slowly tinker away with our 200's and 300's and watch nearly all of our spells being resisted.  Only to get the opportunity to push 1 button at the very end to release a 9k kilo-ton BOMB that we have to wait another 63 minutes to use again.<br />
<br />
Sure while spells like Zevfeers Bite and Aura of Hate / Darkness have their usefulness as well as Voice of T .... these aren't really all that instrumental in the final objectives that guilds are trying to reach toward the ' end game ' .  Especially when most of your Aura spells are resisted by the high end mobs you will encounter in the EP's and The Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
I always thought about an option of the SK getting a large ' mana feed ' type spell where a SK could ( for example ) feed 1000 pt of mana for a 2k mana cost.  Of course, this spell would have to have a HUGE refresh timer on it to keep things balanced and not take away from the content of the game either ( say like 60 minutes ).  <br />
<br />
This could also be spun into something like a reverse pact of hate ability where a SK could be given the ability to feed 1 pt of mana per every 4 pts of HP sacrificed by the SK but subsequently suffering a loss of life in the process ( no DI type spells can save you from this type of death lets just say for the sake of argument ). So in theory, a SK with 10k hp could give to a fellow cleric 2500 pts of mana ( like a giant ass mod rod ) but you loose your life in the process.  This would keep things even since you would subsequently loose the SK for the fight.  To keep this from being exploited you would have to put it on the same refresh timer as the Harm Touch so you couldnt just rez them back and let them run in and re-engage to use the Harm Touch 1 minute later.<br />
<br />
Another option would be something similiar to the Paladin's LoH but instead of a no cost CH ... it would be like a reverse manaburn ... to say like 1 hp per 3 pts of mana so in theory a SK with a 6k mana pool could heal someone for 2000pt of life and still having the detrimental effect of sacrificing all of the SK's mana for said heal sense everything about a SK is giving up something for something else.  This particular ability also having a large refresh timer much like the Harm Touch.<br />
<br />
I think you're undead ability would significantly over power the Shadowknight in both PvE and PvP.  I can understand you're frustration though.  Not being of significant use ( especially on a Blue server ) isn't much fun at all.  Good thing I play on a PvP server so my roll in PvP is very important and gives me a very active roll on that side of the EQ coin.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ghosteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the way i see it is, i am greatful for any extra ability i get. in the long run these new aas will make us better SK's, and ultimately that is what its worth.<br />
<br />
i do get a little miffed about seeing so many posts about how SK's suck, and these are from SK's themselves... you dont like the class then get the hell out and let the people who truely love the class with all its difficulties figure out how to work around our handicaps, which as i see it are few.</div></div><hr />
