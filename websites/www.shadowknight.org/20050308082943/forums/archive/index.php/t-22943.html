<br />
And no I haven't handed in the egg yet.<br />

PS. Just as an FYI although i did have cleric/chanter buffs when i zoned in I was still able to easily solo the Amy's + Steed's with only my own buffs + equip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
                          Could someone please post here what you do with teh annoying mobs that spawn every 30min in Growth and hunt you down wherever you are in zone? Also how do you find the Rolling Steeds? Do you bring a tracker? If you do and the Tracker is in your group and doesnt do anything during the battles will they loose faction with Tunare?<br />
<br />

<br />
If they don't touch the mobs or heal you while you have aggro, they're fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also in Fear, the ZI mobs swarm on you, how are you guys getting around this?<br />
<br />
Then don't stay at the zone in!!  :p <br />
<br />
My advice would be run to the Amy temple asap. You're an SK with 2 types of invis, FD, HS for emergencies and all the pulling/aggro knowledge that comes with playing the class. I'm sure you can get there fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uvaavu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How are u handling the POGS in growth -- killing or leaving em alone?<br />
<br />
Leave em alone in my case - the 2 min fd timer usually let them run off so far i had the next steed to 50% or less before they came back.<br />
<br />
With the amy knights and steeds are you kiting or just smacking them down as I wish to solo this bit as well.<br />
<br />
Just toe-to-toe. They're pretty gimp now tbh. Just beware the other mobs in the temple area (terror's + eye's) that dispel. That said however I resisted every single other spell cast on me in the hour i was in the zone with just my magelo listed resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Funky stuff can happen in PoG with the zone-wide aggro of the pogs. Another SK LDed and died to one a few days ago. The moment I dropped invis, the pog summoned me into a tree and i 20ked.<br />
<br />
Had 2 drop on the server reset today for the 2 SKs that were there. I almost missed mine due to the drop being near fucking invisible against the background of the loot window. It has that black whisker graphic.<br />
<br />
I estimate I killed about 45-50 horses before I got the drop though there's a chance I missed one due to the color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Atraxas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Several clearings of PoG horses and no hair yet :( boxed a druid last time to make sure i got them all too. (made life alot easier i must say)<br />
<br />
Fear was cleaned out so no eye yet...no drama though as it seems thats the easiest part to get..<br />
<br />
Only got to kill 2 horses in PoN before servers were going down...no hide /cry<br />
<br />
BTW..so many people saying they solo the PoN horses..well, im not to badly geared (9.5k hp 1900+ac), lvl 70, def aa etc.. yet id hardly call them easy...so if there is some strat i havent thought of id like to hear how everyone is doing them.<br />
<br />
Head to head tanking them is risky as they seem to get a few decent quads of 500's in. Its easy with HT sure..but thats a bitch of a downtime if your just waiting on refresh (yes i have max HT aa)..but if thats what it takes so be it..cant be worse than epic 1 camps back in the day of months of hate camping.<br />

Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How are u handling the POGS in growth -- killing or leaving em alone?<br />
<br />
This is the way I have been dealling with them. I sit up on the hill in the southwest corner (behind and to the left of zone in) From this spot the POGS port to the bottem of the hill and you can see them running towards you which gives you plenty of time to fd before they get close. Once they run off you have a good two or three minutes before they will come back. This gives you a good window to pull a steed or med til ya see them again and fd and repeat. I have also noticed that if you are in the middle of a fight with a steed and the POGS pop back to you, you can snare the steed and fd. The steed will just stand there and the POGS will run off for another couple minutes giving you time to finish kiling the steed. Doesnt hurt to cast Bond of Death on the steed while you are fd and get some hp back either. It's been slow going for me so far. I have only been able to kill 8 so far but since I cant seem to get anyone on Kane Bayle to go camp the Murkglider Breeder at least I can get some other part taken care of.<br />
<br />
That sig is fucking huge<br />
<br />
Its all better now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">anyone have some tips on hunting in PoFear? or links to tip locations?<br />
<br />
I find that people are really hesitant to go there and if I can solo the drops, I'd really like to. I am quite wary of all the pathing issues and death-touches from across the zone, so advice would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ttuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As far as PoF goes, all I did was:<br />
<br />
1) Set up in the NW corner and get a pet and park it right in the corner. Pet haste helps if you're not planning on killing all the dispellers.<br />
<br />
2) Then run along the N wall til you're right next to the fire wall and run through it.<br />
<br />
3) Try to F8 anything in the temple.<br />
<br />
4) Use any means neccesary to agro it. Arrows don't work well. <br />
<br />
5) Train it out through the fire just NW of the fire wall.<br />
<br />
6) Pick out an amy and snare it.<br />
<br />
7) Immediately FD.<br />
<br />
8) Wait for agro clear message, if you FD fast enough the snare fades right after agro is cleared. He then walks away slowly and you tag it off.<br />
<br />
They're very easy to straight up melee even w/o any buffs so just pull it back and have your way with it.<br />
<br />
Took me about 30 amy kills to get mine. Mine dropped off of a amy warrior if that helps, I had speculated they'd be knight only, just like our armor...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Belligeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Being a lazy bitch i had a full group for PoF and PoG both 2 days ago, after about 6 or 7 Amys the eye dropped.....after about the same amount of horses in PoG the hair dropped, its supposed to be random but i hear horror stories...<br />
<br />
Note that while the PoG drop is soloable, there are many many adds between the &quot;roaming&quot; steeds, and if the protectors are up they will aggro zone wide, and it doesnt matter if you are invis, those fawns are a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
The glooms in pon dropped it on the first mob lol, then we killed shade for the hell of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">PoGs don't aggro you when you're invis. However, they will aggro you as soon as invis drops; they have a zone wide aggro radius, but do not see invis. They repop in 20 some minutes too. I brought a cleric with me and was easily able to get the PoG drop in about an hour or so.<br />
<br />
First PoN horse dropped the hide for me; I used my pet to pull the horse down to me.<br />

I'm going to be attempting Fear solo. I'm hoping I can get my bard his drop too while I'm there.</div></div><hr />

Lucky for you, because you can only pull 1 horse from down below with a pet. At least that was my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoG - Yes got attacked by PoG's every 30 minutes we just killed htem they arnt tuff =P set up in the middle of the plain very little agro in that area just off the wall and pulled with AA horse till horse close to camp then snared and waited to loose agro had friends again so made it pretty easy cleared about 22 horsies in 2 days and go the hair =)<br />
<br />

Zone in Invis.  Find a horse.  Kill horse.  Loot and feign.  If your dps was even remotely decent, they wont have really been a threat.  Bring a friend if you cant invis yourself fast enough to invis you.  Then stand.  Go find another horse.  Make sure you've given the PoG's at least two minutes to walk back.  Kill horse.

But god, it saves time to just kill them.</div></div><hr />

Couldnt target pon horses to pull them down, so guess I need to run it.<br />
Fear, too many damn wanderers. Tried clearing them, but kept getting more. Finally tried to wander to graveyard area, and Dread found me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hahah Okami you are not alone. Beleive me I have had bad experiences with trying to explore fear with dting golems up. Already I have been Death Touched twice by Dread while passing through. First time a pumpkin argoed and transferred argo to Dread. The 2nd time somehow I got dted by dread when I was all the way in the Ne corner of the zone far enough away. <br />
<br />
I was trying to park Wraith of a Shissar in the area where the cubes and nightmares roam. I highly recommend that for those of you pulling the amy temple, Shissar corpse camps so that means you could potentially place her far away from the temple so that you can dark split the amys out. <br />
<br />
Just a warning for those of you who still need fear. Just don't lose your temper if dark splitting doesn't always work or if a mob or two somehow add while you are in the area north of the temple. I nearly cleared all of the temple yesterday but no eye dropped. On the bright side the amy whip dropped so a bard guildie will be happy. <br />
<br />
My final warning though is that the pathing can really suck up there. Sometimes the amys would run into the ring of fire and run back at you. I found that if you go right up to their face and smack them, they will run to you instead of running to the ring of fire and risk bringing adds.<br />

It's not worth your time running around and waiting 10-20 minutes for a spawn.  On most servers as far as I know, try 1PM to 4PM EST dur to the timing on the patches.  You'll want to try about 1-2 hours after your server last come up after a patch, since some SK zoned in a whiped all the horses out at that time. Also, don't harm the Protectors of Growth.  Just let them beat on you while you kill a horse, loot, FD, wait for aggro to clear, move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulling the steeds in PoG to zoneline to fight them without adds takes half a century since they only seem to cast all the time. More annoying than the Protectors imo.<br />
In PoFear the Shissar Enchanter epic 1 mob was up and slowing me down since its a corpsecamper for like 20 minutes before it leaves again for the temple. When its single on top of you being FD and you dont wanna wait, just train it to south with your steed, turn back up and leave it somewhere in the middle of the zone while feigning back up in the Northwest corner and waiting your 2 minutes.. No problems for another 20'ish minutes. other than that PoFear was the easiest part imo.<br />
BTW where is the fuckin zoneout in PoFear?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">POFear- The pain in the ass for me when doing the quest. Went in one time and nearly cleared the entire amy temple and got no eyes. Only 3 amys were up and I logged in disgust. Not to mention getting dted by dread twice and having to constantly move shissar away sucked.<br />
2nd trip to fear to kill amys, got it on the 1st amy warrior.<br />
<br />
PON- Got it on the 6th gloom nightmare. Just parked myself by the horses after my guild killed Vhaksiz the Shade. Got so angry for them not dropping it the 1st round that I killed the other 2. The 7th dropped a hide that rotted  :D <br />
<br />
POG- 3rd steed dropped the hair and it was the 2nd black one too. This was a pain in the ass due to the Protectors but thankfully there were lots of steeds up when I went. <br />

ponightmare - 1 Horse<br />
<br />
Fear was a bish, I was DTd once as well and also had to reposition the friggin Shissar fella twice.<br />
<br />
Growth wasn't bad, just had to time the kills and FDs so the pogs didn't get much time to beat on me.<br />
<br />
Nightmare was sheer luck, ran up, FDd off the cave aggro, killed a horse. Looted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Myth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">PoG- 6th kill<br />
PoH -Mistress dropped-1st kill<br />
PoF - 2nd Kill<br />
Total time camped in all three zones = MAYBE 4 hours<br />
Breeder seems to be the bitch, not that I have yet to attempt but in comparison to the rest. If it isn't a long spawn then the entire epic is no harder then the 1st Coldain shawl   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">PoFear       3rd amy droped eye<br />
PoGrowth   11th steed droped it <br />
PoNighmare16th Gloom droped it  <br />
PoHate      cleared PH's for Both overlord an Mistress for 9 hours got mistress to spawn once an she droped it overlord never spawned.<br />
<br />
All of these can be soloed i did some soloing an had some help from others but i did solo a few at each camp before help arived so all this can be obtained solo ..just have to use Sk tactics an be decently equiped an buffed.<br />
<br />
Will be going after the Breeder next i have the fragga drop already an once egg is obtained i will be on a down hill Dash twords completing my IV on Firona Vie Server... WooT :D</div></div><hr />
