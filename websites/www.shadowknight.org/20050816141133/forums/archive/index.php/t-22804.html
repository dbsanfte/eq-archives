I tried PoD but i kept getting adds, maybe i was at the wrong spot...<br />

<br />
so no, you can't solo in there.<br />
<br />
the best fear kite spot i know of at 59 would be PoD but the risk of adds will always be there. do yourself a favor and get a group in a 2nd tier zone - PoS / PoV. xp will go much faster.</div></div><hr />

What I did was park pet by wall, run down and darkness a mob, if I got an add, I'd FD, tell pet to calm. Worked great for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to always hear Ahkeva Ruins was the last stop for safe fear kite exp...PoD really is too damn messy to bother with.<br />
<br />
Velks was once full of ridiculous fear pathing bugs, I think they are all gone though...<br />
<br />
Get your pet a bunch of mage summoned weapons etc if you want this to go somewhat faster than a blue per hour...59 is a real whore of a level, a good preview of what 66-70 will be like later on...heh</div></div><hr />

    You should be able to solo tsetian flies easily in POD, go to island straight across from zoneline.  Park at shore on the right side, near the 3 trees, actually they are giant hair follicles, and guard pet there.   Pull 1st fly, with spear, run back to pet and fear kite.  There are at least 4 easy single fly pulls in this area.  This is a safe area with no adds, just very boring after a while.  <br />
    I have also soloed the prisoners in the begining of POJ,  just step in to the jail cells and engage them.  Just fight them straight up.  Only ones that are tough are the healers and the one iksars.  The healer dont put out much damage but are very annoying.  After 57, the rats and guards wont aggro on you, when you are in the cells.   The back jails cells can be done too, but they put out enough damage to me, to not make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Last thought, I had was Katta castellatum.  Not sure of the cons there, but there are some nice fear kiting areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem with aggro kiting the HGoJs (High Gaolers of Justice) or the Gaolers.....is that while the rats wont aggro you above about 57...they will aggro your pet....<br />
<br />
i have straight tanked the goalers for exp while bored at work...but did that at 65...whenever i have tried using pet....i have gotten adds...<br />
