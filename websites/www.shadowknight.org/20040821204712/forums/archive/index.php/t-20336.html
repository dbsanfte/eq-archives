<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im guessing it was a catheter... i was only 7 at the time and remember it as one of the worst experiences ever. of course just recently i had my tonsils removed at the age of 21.....im sure some of you have gone through that at an older age but that shit is absolutely horrible. Im 6'0 and weigh 145 lbs and i lost over 10lbs in 9 days. This could be a new diet fad.</div></div><hr />
