119 | 21.86 | 58 | 25 | 0677 | torrent of fatigue<br />
119 | 19.39 | 64 | 05 | 1578 | pact of hate<br />
150 | 15.07 | 64 | 05 | 0856 | pact of hate<br />
200 | 10.68 | 64 | 05 | 0618 | pact of hate<br />
200 | 11.99 | 65 | 20 | 0317 | conjure corpse<br />
280 | 05.83 | 64 | 05 | 0686 | pact of hate<br />
280 | 05.71 | 65 | 20 | 0876 | conjure corpse<br />
<br />
int = int<br />
fizzl = percentage of attempted casts fizzled<br />
lv = spell level<br />
fa = spell fizzle adjustment number<br />
cast = number of cast attempts<br />
spell = spell name<br />
<br />
these were all done as a 65 SK.<br />
what this shows:<br />
<br />
higher int significantly decreases fizzle rate.<br />
going from 119 int to 280 int decreased the number of spells fizzled from 19.39% to 5.83% on pact of hate.<br />
<br />
fizzles use about 40% of a spells casting cost in mana... so rough approximations of mana lost:<br />
<br />
20% fizzle rate: 9% mana wasted<br />
10% fizzle rate: 4% mana wasted<br />
5% fizzle rate: 2% mana wasted<br />
<br />
so... going from 120 int to 280 int would probably end up saving you more mana than mana preservation IV.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm not sure how the &quot;fizzle adjustment&quot; works. higher number increases fizzle rate, but i'm at a loss for a specific formula.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why did you not control for the spell cast?   In other words why vary the spell used in the test.   You are assuming that all spells are fizzle equally.  This may be true, however I really have noticed in the past that certain spells (e.g. Abduction of Strength) seem to fizzle more than others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, you can really divide my data in half and consider it two different tests. if you look, you'll see that i cast pact of hate at multiple different ints. this was the main test.<br />
<br />
i also cast varying other spells at 119 int to show how spell level and &quot;fizzle adjust&quot; play into the equation somewhat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi again,<br />
<br />
Now, I am not meaning to be an asshole about this or anything, but since I was a professional statistician for several years it is something I still tend to take seriously.  You have done a bunch of work here collecting data and, that is admirable.  I am only trying to suggest some things that would prevent spurious conclusions here.  <br />
<br />
Just a clue here.  I don’t want to tell people what to do and I would not be into doing all this analysis that people do on parses because I think it takes the mystery out of the game.  However, if you are interested in improving your analysis, the first step would be to look into the analysis of binomial trials, otherwise known as Bernoulli trials.  My cursory examination of your table lead me to believe that there is something other than intelligence involved in the fizzle rates depicted.  Now that is not to say that INT is not a significant or even the primary exogenous variable that influences fizzle rates.  I only say that it may not be.  <br />
<br />
As an example, you conducted 2,220 trials at the same INT level for nullify magic and shadow sight.  Even thought the INT level was the same you recorded a difference in fizzle rates of more than 9.5 percentage points.   On a cursory level this is an enormous difference and the difference would be exacerbated if you calculated the standard deviations of these trials.   What this means is, that there is something else that is extremely significant in the calculation for fizzle rates imbedded in the game.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would be glad to give you suggestions as I think your objective is an admirable one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if i had to guess i'd say this is how it is, there are 3 different factors that affect fizzle rate<br />
primary: level of spell compared to level of caster<br />
secondary: intelligence (or wisdom for wis based casters) of caster<br />
tertiary: fizzle adjustment (something that's put into spells individually and listed in the spdat)<br />
<br />
<br />
the (limited) data i have sampled seems to agree, but i know its by no means conclusive<br />
<br />
at 119 int:<br />
the low level spells had low fizzle rates, even gather shadows with a high fizzle adjustment value<br />
the level 49 spells had a low rate with 0 fizzle adjustment, and a medium rate with 25 fizzle adjustment<br />
the higher level spells all had higher fizzle rates</div></div><hr />

When the fuck did they say this? I have never seen such a statement? Got a link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ummm why is not one bringing up the casting skill for each spell?<br />
Was the casting skill = for each skill?<br />
Was casting skill = for each parse?<br />
Was casting skill maxxed (meaning no skill differences between each parse)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Considering it was Window doing the testing, and he's been 65 for quite some time, it's pretty safe to say that all the casting skills are maxed.  Heck, I haven't been 65 for all that long, and all of my casting skills have been capped damn near forever.  Well, except evocation, but that's just because I was lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah... all casting skills were at 235.<br />
and they were all done in the same session in the same zone.<br />
<br />
it is a good point though, i was going to edit my last post but never did. the casters ability in the used casting skill (which increases with level) matters, and the casters level itself probably does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That clears that up...<br />
<br />
Now is there a noticible difference in fizzle rate per casting skill?<br />
(i.e. Evoction vs. Abjuration so one skill might be more likely to fail?)  <br />
At work and can't double check the skills needed for the spells listed atm.</div></div><hr />
