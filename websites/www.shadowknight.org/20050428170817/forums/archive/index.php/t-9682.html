I stumbled upon this thread this morning, basically discussing the possibility of Froglocks being a playable race in the next expansion.<br />

On the downside... It's the old world, and gnolls would need a serious graphic upgrade because... crap, they look like some freakish schnauzer / weasel mutation right now. Whatever happened to the 7-foot hyenamen? Nooo, we get funky blue bipedal rats.<br />
<br />

On a side note, Groobash, how'd you get the kunark goblin model? I've seen PC corpses now and again in Frontier mountains that had that model...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cerena Gloomheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">As for the Vampires, it's not really a &quot;race&quot;, as it is a state of being, as they are raised from the dead.  For example:  A froglok zombie, a gnoll zombie, and a human zombie are still zombies, right?  Same thing applies to vampires.<br />
Lycanthropic (as in having a disease passed through others) beings also fit the bill here, like werewolves.<br />
<br />
And once again, I would like to see aviaks as a player race.  he different types would be different classes (Krags as paladins, Spirocs as rogues, SK aviaks as warriors, etc etc)  How cool would that be??</div></div><hr />

Remember the &quot;M project?&quot;  that was fun.  too bad it died as fast as it was brought to life.  The vampire models in Mistmoore would be cool to see as a player character.  Good thinking on that one.  Sarnacks might not be bad either for a playable.  /shurg</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all honesty, I am guessing that Sony may go for Frogloks or Sarnak.<br />
<br />
Frogloks do have Guk and that village in Swamp of No Hope (which is actually very cool.. too bad for the Frogloks that I usually just went through it like a Horseman of the Froglok Apocalypse and killed everything that hopped) and Sarnaks have Chardok and various ruined outposts throughout Kunark.<br />
<br />
There are at least 2 Froglok factions-- old world ones and the Frogloks of Kunark.  I think if they did make Frogloks playable that you would not see them amiable to both factions, although being able to use the Kunark Froglok Swamp City would be kinda cool (maybe even Sebilis?)<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that Coldain might be interesting too.  As far as other races though, Kobolds and Gnolls and Goblins are just sword fodder for me, so if I saw someone playing them I'd have to laugh and kill them.. ;)<br />
<br />
The one that I haven't seen mentioned much though is the Kedge as a playable race.. give them a way to breathe outside the water and you're set. :).. I don't think the Kedge has Shadowknights though, unless Phinny goes berserk and tells Prexus to stick it.. :)... <br />
<br />
(I watched a 61 Bard solo Phinny the other day btw...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, as I swear I've mentioned in this very thread, I am POSTIVE I remember there being a Live Froglok Necromancer I've killed in Upper Guk. Besides, It wouldn't be too hard to say that some of the Live Frogloks, convinced that the new order of the Ghouls is the true way, would convert to the Dark arts.<br />
<br />
Of course, all this is assuming Frogloks are implemented as a player race, which I sincerely doubt. I still say this Legacy of Ykesha thing is either gonna be an elaborate GM event on the level with Bloody Kithicor, or else a completely different game, for PDA or Palm Pilot or maybe even single-player computer. I don't see EQ1 getting a new expansion before EQ2, but that could just be me.<br />

Well, If you consider that Trolls and Iksar both seem to be Reptilian in nature and can travel in Everfrost and Velious (Despite being cold-blooded), And heck, for that matter, that humans can adventure in Velious without having to equip &quot;A Heavy Winter Jacket&quot; or something, why not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they stop supporting EQ1 then EQ2 will fail misserably. Alot of people I have talked to in game have said they will not go to EQ2 and will just stay in EQ1 and it dose seem to be a common trend amoung the web boards too when asked if people will migrate too / play EQ2.<br />
<br />
Even SOE has said they will continue to support and expand EQ1 as long as it shows a strong following.<br />
<br />
There is still alot of un explored content to EQ: the large continent on the other side of the world, the underground of Norrath can be expanded greatly, huge parts of the worlds oceans could be opened up, there is a second moon out there (Drinal) and all the &quot;missing&quot; zones from the maps / lore of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Continuing to expand EQ1 could also let them test new ideas / technology for implementation into EQ2 and SOE would be very foolish to pass that up.</div></div><hr />
