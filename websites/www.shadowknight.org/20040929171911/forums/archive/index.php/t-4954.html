<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello to all shadowknights who reads this post.  I have created a shadowknight after many days of trying to figure out which race to choose.  I tried ogre but didnt like the huge frame or the look.  I also felt the same way with trolls too.  I tried Iksar but after seeing the exp penalty they receive and the fact that they cannot wear certain plate armor I decided to pass on them as well.  Dark Elf was another choice but I see too many on my server (Solusek Ro) and I wanted to be just a little different.  Gnomes I was against at the beginning because I didnt want to be a short character.  Erudites have a huge mana pool but with such low str and sta I passed on them too (though they do make excellant necromancers).  So after going through all the choices, I decided to go with a human shadowknight.  Now dont get me wrong, I don't think one race is better than the other, I just wanted a choice of race that suited me the best.  I was just wanted to get other human shadowknights responses on how well they are in combat.  Have you ever been the MT in a group?  Can you hold your own with the large race shadowknights or warriors in a battle?  These were just a couple of things on my mind and wanted to get comments on them.  Thanks for all who read this and happy hunting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azieru Xionhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi, I am an Human Sk :rolleyes: And i think races won't affect ur SK life Big time. no matter what race u are, SK's will be mostly MT if there is no warr there. I myself have been MT for all my levels. And when u r not the MT, u be the puller or MA. And even if you r a human, and compare to an Troll Sk, all it matter is what gear u got and ur base stat does kinda help and majorly ur playing skills. SK's can hold their own depending what to u r fighting :)</div></div><hr />

I also play a Erudite Necro. <br />
Guess which one is more fun?<br />
HINT:  (the necro is lv 30 and has been made one year before the SK)</div></div><hr />

This is always the best choice.<br />

You should be able to MT just fine.  Work on getting your STA to 100 if it is not there already, and look to getting your AC and HP up, and you'll be on your way to more fun than you thought possible. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The guild leader of Legend of Marr on The Rathe is a 60 human SK, epic equipped. I think he has full Noctivagant too. He is quite the badass and I hear he can tank up there with the rest of the warriors. <br />

anyway, woohoo for SKs eh? :)</div></div><hr />
