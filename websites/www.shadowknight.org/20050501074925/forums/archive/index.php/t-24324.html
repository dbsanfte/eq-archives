<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have suggestions on which Evil missions might be easier for a 4 boxer to do?<br />
<br />
I box main 70SK (10k HP, 2k AC) with 70 Shammy, 68 Mage and 68 Druid...<br />
<br />
Have tried the one for thinning out the Drakes in Lavaspinner's...seemed pretty straightforward after figuring out the roamers and the false floor...but the drop rate on the drake claws/fangs ( have to get 15) was pretty low...so I ran out of time....(not mission time, but EQ time in RL) and had to abandon...suspect on a second pass i'd complete succesfully but also suspect this mission will be a bit of an inefficient time sink....<br />
<br />
From a capabilities perspective...I have farmed MPG Nameds with this set up....but am not terribly good at crowd control with this box set up...and tend to rely on getting or splitting single pulls with the SK pulling....<br />
<br />
so for example would probably give the Contagion mission a pass from what i have read...as splitting the 6 sets of unsnareable pumas' seems like a pain in the ass...and i would be challenged i think to box 2 at once...unless someone tells me that 66 mage pet could easily offtank one...<br />
<br />
any suggestions folks?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Artmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This mission is thee easier that i have found since it does not require splitting-pacification-mezzing at all you can single pull all this instance without any thinking really...just carefull of roamer.  In a 4 box set up it normally takes me 1h00 to 1h45 depending of thee drop rate. <br />
<br />
And i normally open all eggs for extra exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grounding the Drakes seems easiest so far. It's a collect 15 drake fangs... just watch out for the pit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll go out on a limb and possibly suggest 'Death Comes Swiftly' mission in the Ascent.  Disclaimer: I don't 4-box, so I don't know first-hand but have done ~20 of these missions grouped with others (w/my boxed dru or clr) so might have some helpful info/advice.<br />
<br />
First, it's an outdoor zone, so mounts do work here (along with FoE, etc.).  Secondly, and perhaps more significantly for your setup, because it's an outoor zone, your druid can harmony using the 67 Nature's Serenity which will allow your SK to single pull.  There is a 'boss' at the end of the mission which is triggered by killing 10 weaver spiders and 5 warder spiders.  This boss doesn't hit overly hard as boss mobs go, but has a nasty AE dot -- the problem possibly here being that it's the other group member's health that you have to watch.  Spirit of the Wood/Grove really helps here, as does Pureblood (LoY dru/clr quest spell but shm version is group -- shm will need to cast twice to cure entire group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do the 15 drake fang one 3boxed now.  Takes me about an hour-&gt;90min each time.  Not the fastest, but nice when I'm on my own and if a guild member is looking, easy to add them and it goes even quicker :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did most of the Throes one last night four boxing a cleric enchanter wizard SK with a bard added in.  The bard was convenient for pulling, but wasn't entirely necessary.  You will have to FD split the pumas, there's basically no other way.  They don't hit particularly hard, but they hit pretty darn fast.  I'd be pretty surprised if the mage could off tank one, but I wouldn't be surprised if the mage could single pull one if you're adept at pet pulling with a mage.<br />
<br />
<br />
We ended up failing due to wiping to a gater.  I'm not entirely positive what happened, we tried to add a sixth person for DPS and by the time we got back to the zone our corpses had popped and the task reset.  I'm not sure if it reset due to adding the person or due to being out of the zone, but it pissed me off pretty bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drake Eggs.  Duo it if you want once you have the mission.  /taskadd friends right before the turn in and ask them to give you the crystals.  Do it before it gets nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been doing Drake eggs already....sorry for not coming back to post...<br />
<br />
4k crystals and counting....<br />
<br />
expecting it to be nerfed wednesday....trying to take a day off of work before then....<br />
