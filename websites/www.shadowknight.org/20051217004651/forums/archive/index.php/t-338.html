Quick question probably a stupid one but what do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to cast Grim Aura or Scream of Death during a fight while getting beat on, or should one just wait until the end and have them up for the next fight?  Let me know what you think! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I normally don't worry about casting either of these during a fight, prefering to buff between fights and using slot for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonnyt</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree , <br />
<br />
I use grim aura and shield skin before the fight , then swap the spell slots for Shadow vortex or Shroud of pain.. something I can use during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well... ive never casted grim aura (always used an item), or scream of death (never been in a posistion where using it is beneficial), but with vampiric embrace and shroud of death, those are/were &quot;always memmed&quot; spells for me and i recast it even in a fight... its just 3 seconds and the benefit outweighs a slight loss in melee damage for a moment</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the advice guys, esp. brael, kind of what I'm trying to decide is if those spells cast during a fight outweigh the melee dmg lost.</div></div><hr />

since grim aura lasts longer i take it off after buffing and put on shieldskin<br />
scream of death lasts longer than vamp embrace and seems to proc more though i admit that's just my impression and my dex has improved with time so that may be all i'm seeing</div></div><hr />

<br />
 As for VE proc'ing it seems since the last patch I get 3 or 4 procs a fight now. Before I could go thru several engagements and not get a single proc with VE.</div></div><hr />

Hoping to get some BE Arms soon so I can use that slot fer sumthin else. :)</div></div><hr />
