<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(Welcome to last week, or what ever... I just got it in email, and wanted to share some ice cream with you.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The necromancer gets a huge scoop of vanilla and three large scoops of other flavors. The necromancer also gets nice fancy flavored toppings. The ice cream man reduces the vanilla scoop from huge to large. The necromancer throws a fit. Promises of more fancy toppings do not console him.The necromancer is not allowed to share his ice cream or sauce with anybody else. He cites that as proof he NEEDS more than anyone else.The other kids don't particularly like the necromancer, but who can blame them? <br />
The wizard is given a big scoop of what he believes to be the most popular flavor of ice cream. He is also given a little cart so he can show off his bowl to everyone else, whether they like it or not. He eventually realizes, that not only is the flavor not particularily popular, but neither is he. Other kids just use him to get a ride in his cart. To top it off, he has less ice cream than anybody else.<br />
<br />
The shaman get a normal size scoop of vanilla, and three big scoops of different flavors. One day the ice cream man changes one flavor to something slightly different. Some shamans like it, some do not. Shamans get a lot of sauces, too. Other kids think they don't get enough of the most important sauce. They are wrong.<br />
<br />
Druids (there is always more than one) are given four scoops, but they are all half-sized. Most never notice they have less ice cream than the shaman until until they are done eating and the shaman is still munching away. When the ice cream man swaps out one of their flavors, though, they all scream bitterly. Druids get some nice sauces, and they get the wizard's cart, too. Everyone hates druids.<br />
<br />
The magician gets a big scoop of vanilla, a normal scoop of one of the druid's flavors, one small scoop of the wizard's flavor and a ball of rice, but he doesn't complain despite no toppings of any kind. The magician doesn't really want the ball of rice, but is constantly begged by the necromancer and younger kids to share it. One day, the ice cream man decides this is unappealing, and gives the magician an even bigger ball of rice. The magician still doesn't complain. Eventually, the ice cream man gives the magician a topping and a larger scoop of vanilla. The magician gets to keep the enormous ball of rice.<br />
<br />
The enchanter gets his pick of ice cream and all but one of the most popular sauces. How many picks he gets to make is determined by an IQ test. In any case, he can only have a small scoop of vanilla, and to eat it he has to get a swat on the head first. If they stick with it long enough, enchanters get exclusive access to the most popular sauce. Almost everyone but warriors and older necromancers plead constantly for him to share the special sauce.<br />
<br />
Bards are given a small scoop of vanilla and up to six scoops of any one other flavor they choose, but they have to give away all but one of these special scoops. This makes them sort of popular, but if they give away too much of certain flavors the ice cream man beats them senseless.<br />
<br />
The warrior gets a huge scoop of vanilla. Its almost as big as any three normal scoops of ice cream. But the warrior doesn't understand that. He wants at least two scoops that size, and would still feel cheated because all the casters get at least three scoops. He also wants sauce and other flavors of ice cream too. The ice cream man makes his scoop a little bigger, and gives him some spinkles. The warrior is sullen.<br />
<br />
The ranger gets a big heaping mass of vanilla, but not quite as big as the warrior's. He also gets a nice selection of sauces, and some tiny spoonfulls of the druid flavors of ice cream. When new sauces are introduced, the ranger generally gets first dibs. He pretty much agrees with the warrior about how unjust the ice cream man is.<br />
<br />
The Paladin is given a smaller serving of vanilla than the ranger. He also gets a lot of the most popular sauce. He grumbles about the ice cream man more than anyone, because paladins are supposed to have the most ice cream AND sauce. Rangers and Paladins are both told to eat their ice cream from a bowl, but using a fork instead of a spoon.<br />
<br />
The Monk is given an enormous portion of vanilla, one of the largest servings of ice cream in the game. But its served to him in a cracked cone instead of a bowl. If he doesn't eat it just right, most of it will melt. He also gets sprinkles. Eventually, the ice cream man takes away half the sprinkles.<br />
<br />
The Shadowknight is given a slighly smaller vanilla scoop than the Paladin. He also gets one tiny nibbit of each of the necromancer's scoops. He is told that because he gets FIVE scoops, more than anyone else, he must eat his ice cream from a dog dish without any silverware. He gets no sauce. Shadowknights complain a lot, and everyone feels sorry for them.<br />
<br />
The rogue is given an enormous portion of chocolate ice cream. Like the monk, it is in a cone instead of a bowl. That's not what bothers the rogue. The rogue is ticked because he wanted milk chocolate, not chocolate ice cream. He usually throws his cone away.<br />
<br />
The cleric is given several tiny scoops of ice cream and lots and lots of a very popular sauce. He is expected to dish out this sauce to anyone who asks. If he tries to eat his ice cream, other kids yell that he doesn't know how to be a cleric. Clerics who want to eat ice cream instead of giving other kids their sauce have to eat alone. A lot of the other kids complain there are never any clerics around. They refuse offers from shamans and druids for the same sauce, because they think it tastes better when a cleric dishes it out.</div></div><hr />
