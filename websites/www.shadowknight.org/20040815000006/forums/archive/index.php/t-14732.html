<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chernabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if there's a minimum level limit to do the Malevolent armor quests?  I've heard you have to be at least 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No level restrictions on Velious armor.  Just faction requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty straightforward: If you talk to the mob and he/she gives out the Quest details you will receive the reward upon doing the necessary steps. If you are not sure run your alt/twink/whatever there and talk to the Quest mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruiser Bigins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought the level limit was 49 for all velious armor, but I never tested it.  if you want to test it just walk to the npc and see if he gives you the test.  also be careful, friend of mine lost a vindi head when tried to do the dr00d gloves quest with karana because she was too low level (45 or something and 50 was required or 53?)  the message she got was something like this &quot;I don't belive you are powerful enough to acquire this item by yourself, I will return it to the rightful owner.&quot; and failed the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I MQed some thurg armors with a sub 40 character alt, so I guess its the same for kael armor if you manage to get the faction.<br />
<br />
Dorfs in thurg also give the quest to my 45 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazug Thooll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My lvl 25 warrior has half a set of thurg armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harjon Baradda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All about faction. <br />
You need ally to (krom)zek (max zek faction, could not get better message). The quest mob is Valdurn (sp) Blackhammer.<br />
<br />
It's very easy to get to the quest hall, most stuff doesn't see invis along the way and only one Tormax giant in the room near the quest hall, hugging the wall will keep you outta aggro range, maybe (lower the level the bigger aggro bubble you have). I did this alot cause I got bored waitng for CoH mages and I wanted that armor! :)</div></div><hr />
