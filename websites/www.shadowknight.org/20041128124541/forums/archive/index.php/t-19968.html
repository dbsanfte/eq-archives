<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read alot of stuff about our pet, some people love him, some people hate him. Most recently, and especially with the flood of highly questionable pet centric AA's in GoD, there has been a growing desire among many in the community for the first sk-specific pet that is not a 20-level defunct necromancer hand-me-down.<br />
<br />
I agree with this. However, I also see the problems and concerns the developers may have about granting us a level-appropraite pet.<br />
<br />
As it stands, I see three main problems with our pets today:<br />
1. They are too low level to land their procs on anything we would be fighting.<br />
2. They disintegrate almost instantly if hit/riposted/damage-shielded/ae'd.<br />
3. Generally because of 1&amp;2 above, our pets are just not worth the expenditure of AA's to enhance them.<br />
<br />
There are several ways the above problems could be addressed, and I'm not going into them, however, I have a suggestion that I've not seen presented before.<br />
<br />
Rather than giving us just a higher level version of the existing pet, then tweaking down his damage, I suggest the following:<br />
<br />
A new SK-only level 65 pet spell based (loosely) on the new necro swarm pet.<br />
<br />
Summon Skeletal Archer.<br />
Class: Sk<br />
Level: 65<br />
Mana: 750<br />
Component: 1 Bonechip + 1 peridot (ala higher end necro pets)<br />
Effect:<br />
Summons a skeletal archer to aid the shadow knight in combat. The pet is perma-rooted in place, but can be summoned to the SK's side using Summon Companion. Rather than a lifetap proc, the Skeletal Archer pet will buff himself with Grim Aura and/or a version of Call of Darkness with the DoT aspect removed.<br />
Pet Level would 60, same as 61+ Necro pet spells.<br />
Pet would have 2500hp. (200 more than current pet, I believe)<br />
Pet would hit for 150 Max. (Before the screams, remember archer pet, no dual wield, no double attack, no bash or kick).<br />
<br />
<br />
The above pet, in my opinion, would not only solve virtually all issues we have with our current pets, but would do so in a creative way that would give us more options in gameplay. The above solution wouldn't just give us a better pet in all situations, but would force us to choose the best pet for a given situation. Certainly in the situation I've presented above, our current pet would be best suited for many situations, LDoN for example, or any else where your moving around alot.<br />
However, the archer pet would give us a viable pet in raid and other situations. Out of melee range, and with the ability to position him strategically with summon companion to avoid AE's.<br />
<br />
Additionally, while the archer's attack speed could be tuned to provide similar or only slightly higher DPS than our current pet, the subconscious satisfaction of seeing Jobaber crit for 270 instead of critting for 52 might tempt many more people into actually purchasing some currently worthless...I mean undervalued...AA's 8p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont know how anyone feels about the SK. I didnt even buy my SK PET spell after 29 till I got to 52. I just didnt want to bother with all that came with a SLOW, DUMB, WEEk pet at my side that would more times then ofter get me killed from the agro.<br />
<br />
Now Its stupid that they give us a pet that is that much lower in lvl to us. What they should do is just give us the same lvl pet that the necro does.  Hell if anything they should let us summon the corpse of the mob we just killed and screw the skelly.<br />
<br />
Lets face it..SK cant solo like a BST,NECRO,MAGE that all have great pets. <br />
<br />
We are a mix of 2 classes and that alone makes it hard. In my opinion just lose the pet and play like you would be a evil PALI cause thats all that we are anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know but thats my idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shakraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have the impression that most ppl who don't like the sk pets at all, are / were ubertwink alts from other classes (probably from pet classes).<br />
<br />
When I was lvl 9 (untwinked), my pet was almost half my dps (we both were wielding some rusted weapons or something, lol), Stattic. So that is quite nice, I think.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65 now I use my pet almost everytime; sometimes even when I MT on raids (ssra bosses, bot tower bosses, so not really uber high end, but still not that bad).<br />
<br />
I have turned my pet hits on in my combat spam window and like seeing some 50 quads from the little skelly occasionally. In case that you pet haters havn't noticed, eq is not like diablo. In contrast to diablo in eq the general rule is &quot;every little bit helps&quot;, and even if it is &quot;only&quot; like 20 - 30 dps (which is btw a lot if u compare it with the dps increases from other offensive aas).<br />

new swarm aa for nec is skeletal archers and boy do they suck. hard. i mean..a very poor joke. there's no push..but there's no dps either.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I agree the permaroot thing would frequently be a hassle, but I see a big problem with removing it. One, it would require much more coding of the pet's behavior to force him to stand back and shoot arrows but still be able to move around freely. With the pet rooted, his natural tendancy is going to be to shoot arrows at anything out of melee range, just like any mob that can shoot arrows, but also just like mobs, without additional coding he's just going to try and run up to the monster and start meleeing.<br />

<br />
Hmm, mabye. But the whole purpose of the archer-style pet is to keep him out of melee, and therefore out of harms way. If he's not taking damage he shouldn't need a lifetap proc. If people don't like the grim aura idea mabye we could come up with something else.<br />
OMG! What if he procced a Disease Resist Debuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After reading about the archer pet I think that is the Sweetest idea. Along with the pet being what it is you should be able to get a  spell /buff that allows your pet to cast/buff bows for specific situations. Life tap, root, snare, dot, slow etc...<br />
Or even you could give it a sweet bow and get it back in your inventory when your pet poofs!<br />
<br />
Permaroot is a cool idea becasue you can keep your pet away from the action.<br />
Hell let it collapse when it gets hit so that we dont lose the pet to much from it being out of the way.<br />
<br />
Anyway I think that is a great idea that will help our pets and our groups..<br />
Otherwise I just dont use the damn thing unless Im farming and need xtra Dps..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As long as the archer looks like one of the Shadowguards from the MM adventures. They're cool looking and I think would be a sweet pet graphic for SHADOWknights. <br />
<br />
It is a kick ass idea though. We can then make fun of the rangers and say &quot;Haven't you heard, our pets are getting AM3 and Trueshot disc&quot;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>evilmite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at about lvl 60 sk's become different from necro's in alot of ways... Instead of trying to give us soemthing that a Neco has or a perma rooted Archer pet, and to keep the game balanced they can do soemthgin alot better.<br />
 Since Most poeple think some of our new AA's are pointless..Improved Consumption of Soul or the Intensed Hatred why not take the ICoS and give us a AA pet BoosT ability.. 6 aa's to boost our pet up to lvl 60 or do it in step... 2, 4, 6, 8 aa's to boost him to lvl 60.... Or better yet the ability transform the skele into a Mummy or a Ghoul....Having increased hp's and higher lvl but doing the same damage or allow the mummy to hit Harder but alot slower...say up to 75damage but twice as slow.....this would even us out with pet haste and other items as well as buffs... They would be able to proc and live 10 seconds instead of 5 in a fight... eck even give them a chance to Parry, block, and even maybe repo so that they will last a little longer...I would spend a few more aa's to do that....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">we need a new pet, I have been saying it all along.  A smart SK always uses a pet in exp groups, to max DPS.  Our current greenie is pathetic, and it gives SOE a great opportunity to balance us a bit.<br />
<br />
I do not want a necro pet.  I want a SK-only newly designed pet.  The archer idea is a good one, but I do not see that they give it to us.<br />
<br />
Just let us have a level 58+ rogue pet, 3000 HP, and we would be happy.<br />
<br />
Unless this happens. I do not see a SK invest into pet AAs at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">aress how would a rogue pet have 3k hp? not even nec 63 rogue does. in fact the 61 level 60 nec war pet has something like 3250hp unfocused. the 65 nec war pet doesnt have much more; they added a weak DS to the pet so it'd stop losing out in duels to the level 61 pet to shut nec up :P<br />
<br />
i stand by my suggestion of 53 rogue pet bumped to level 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are so many ideas on this subject.<br />
<br />
Just give us a UNDEAD/MUMMY Ranger with a bow for one <br />
Then give us a UNDEAD/MUMMY wolf pet that will put out damage like a BST pet. Maybe not as much but lets face it all  pet classes have a HUGE pet.  WHy is it so week for a SK?<br />
POOR planning or is there a reason?<br />
<br />
It cant be because we would be so powerfull with a stronger pet. Hell in my opinion a very well equiped BST is the best class in the game for destuction ( WELL NEXT TO A SK OF COURSE hehe ) let alone the best over all class for any purpose. They are so well eqioped with there spell book its overkill, but they get it and we dont.<br />
<br />
To name a few, they can: sow,heal,dot,slow,regen HP+MANA, combat buffs,summon food+water, calm mobs, NUKE, HASTE..PLus there pet has Nukes,haste, BUffs and its own heal that is a huge heal in itself.<br />
<br />
Oh well I would love to be able to get out and do more with my SK other then just be a meat shield with a slow tard of a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Makkon, hence I said &quot;SK specific pet&quot;.  I don't want comparisons to necro pets :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">aress my point was something like..why would a child class get a better pet than their parent pet class?<br />
<br />
it'd be like pallies getting a faster casting cheal, or rangers getting bot9<br />
<br />
its not a matter of &quot;necros keeping sk down!&quot; - i have and play both classes pretty much daily. <br />
<br />
you see what im saying? i agree sk deserve a better pet, but not a better pet than their parent class.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt mind seeing the sk pet getting something crazy like a lifetap or manatap proc where the benefit goes to the owner..that might be fun</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
The parent class shit went out the window around the Velious era, Thank God. <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, Necromancers and SKs, despite sharing a spell pool, are two VERY different classes now, when you get down to it. We share some spell types, but are roles are different, how we contribute to groups is different, and how we contribute to raids is different. <br />
<br />
A Pet that is specifically tailored to our needs isn't such a bad idea. It's like how Beastlords, despite having a spell pool partially shared with Shamans, have a pet that far outstrips the Shaman's wolf. <br />
<br />
We don't need a Beastlord Caliber pet by any means, but I see nothing wrong with a pet that is specifically tailored to our special needs as a class with a different role than a Necromancer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love my SK and really think he owns a lot of other classes that we constantly bitch about being &quot;better&quot; at certain things than us. However, I am not high end so my opinions go out the window really. So to say as others say, we need balance, this is a perfect opportunity to do so. <br />
<br />
I don't know about you guys but I like being &quot;the cool guy&quot; in the group. I love being in skeleton form even though it's less mana for me (MC down, SoU up). I like wielding my Edge of Honor with a Skull shield in skelly form because I look wicked and evil, even though my dps is halved :D. I like having my pet up in almost every situation and giving him weapons that look nasty (Flamberge from Bruisers, MM Blood swords). I think he is cool looking and all, his cackles give me power! <br />
<br />
Now, if he could only damage something... Well I guess he does but really now, am I supposed to laugh ? Sure my pet can hit for 40 damage, if he ever lands it against a yellow con mob (which is probably dark dark dark red to our pet). <br />
<br />
Maybe the upgrade in level is all we need so our mob can actually land some hits. Keep the damage on the same table as it is now though, which will still increase it's dps due to landing more swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sandmann Dreamcatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i like the idea that our pet shout get a proc (lifetap) for his master and in fights it should shield us if we get under 25pct hp.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>xaraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i like the idea of a higher level pet, but thats all. with higher level the pet would have more hps and land more hits (inc.atk), as was stated above. keeping this in mind, the GoD pet abilities might become more attractive, yet it would not push us over the limits of a necro pet, nor unbalance our dps with other classes. <br />
<br />
i like my pet, i use him frequently in xp groups and on raids, even w/o pet hold. if you have patience and can control the pet its not a hassle, and its a little more dps. for all of you that sit around playing EQ for most of your life's time atm, that small fraction of time saved by pet damage on each kill adds up eventually, and we all want more levels and more aa, right? add one of those ever ignored dots or two per fight and you have even a little more dps, especially if you have some FT to keep recast up. dont have FT? do ldons, OH CHRIST!!--&gt;work for it a little bit. if im in a slow dps group in bot, i love to drop poison dot on a mob until its dead and use nukes. if you actually utilize each of your abilities every fight, you may find that the sk is a pretty badass class. dont believe me? download a dps parser and clock other members in your group.<br />
<br />
yeah the archer pet is a cool idea, and the lifetap/MC pet that boosts the master's red and blue bar is neat too, but to soe that's comparitively small beans in the bigger picture. the higher level idea is simple, straightforward, and easy to implement. it would be effective and most likely has the greatest possibility of happening. we could expect other classes to shout and bitch, but a little homework should make it obvious that this may better balance us in the dps arena without outstripping other classes.</div></div><hr />

We whould simply just place the pet in range of the mob we want to pull, hit FD, then hit &quot;pet attack&quot; on the mob.<br />
Unless they changed it the mob whould come solo. The reason &quot;pet pulling&quot; isn't good now, is b/c the pet has to run in and hit the mob, and actually survive a bit when we are hammering the &quot;pet back off&quot; button.<br />
<br />
My main concern in EQ right now isn't the pet tho. I'd really like to see a pally/sk tank the mobs in GoD w/o the cleric hammering Supernal Light all the time. Warriors = way exaggurated atm.</div></div><hr />

One thing still sucks though is its HP. Was in POV last night (puller/Tank) and my pet ( with VIRT) went after one mob for some reason and the mob didint bother to even stop to kill it. The fight was over in under a second. Is cool that it has some DPS while in a fight but................<br />

Dont get me wrong a pet that was more than a very mana efficient little dot and occational puller would be great, but I would rather give up my pet altogether and get some form of decent tanking mitigation than to have a boosted pet and stay where we are as far as tanking.<br />

My wish list goes something like this<br />
1) Tools to bring us into line with Paladins in tanking power (and Paladins should also be tweeked to bring them more in line (although still behind) warriors)<br />
2) FD not being broken by spells<br />
3) Faster casting, faster refresh FD<br />
4) Increased DSP (better pet could be a part of this, although increased weapons skills would be the major part)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it should be a squire.  It's abilities should logically be squirelike...but also useful in the game.  Somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">+++The explanation.<br />
<br />
Strewn across several different threads are ideas to somehow incorporate our pet into a DI-mitigation ability we may get, along with the pet being a solution to our severe lack of dps compared to the warrior class. My proposed idea would incorporate both, and be a &quot;nice&quot; way to give us (if you do, please, please, do) a DI-mitigation ability and a dps upgrade.<br />
<br />
I have been looking over the main arguements for why the pet should not be involved with any fixes we (hopefully) receive, and have taken these into deep consideration while mulling over this idea, so no, I'm not completely ignorant.<br />
<br />
First off, as a disclaimer, I would like to say that I realize the sk class is NOT a pet class, and nor do I want us to be a pet class, but if we are going to have one, lets make it a bit more interesting?<br />
<br />
+++Working this in with the current pet.<br />
<br />
This ability should not require the sk's original pet to be &quot;active&quot; at time of use, but should not &quot;kill&quot; the pet when used, either. I believe that, either, A) The summoned pet should pop up just as an additional pet, along with the original active pet, or B) replace the current pet while active, then upon the minion despawning, original pet comes back. I believe having the minion pop up as an additional pet is much more plausible, and easier to program; I do not see how this would be unbalancing (having two pets for a short period of time).<br />
<br />
+++The dps portion.<br />
<br />
A 120 second reuse ability that summons a &quot;minion of darkness&quot; to our side that contributes to some actual damage. There are a few ways I see that could this be done, and the two most A) realistic, and B) useful, are:<br />
<br />
+Idea A: Kamikaze pet. Minion is summoned, and &quot;throws&quot; itself at the intended target, doing an amount of damage proportional to the ShadowKnight's level.<br />
<br />
Let's say that at level 65, it does 2,000 damage. Used exactly as it popped, every single time (the ability), this would provide an additional effective 16.66 points of dps. I don't believe that would be overpowering, and would bring us up more where we need to be with our dps.<br />
<br />
+Idea B: Plain dps. Minion is summoned, and unleashes a death-like fury upon the target proportional to the level of the ShadowKnight using the ability.<br />
<br />
Let's say that at level 65, it stays alive for 10 seconds. The pet does 200dps. This would contribute an effective 16.66 extra points of dps to the ShadowKnight using this skill if he could use it every single time it refreshed.<br />
<br />
Now, I realize, that the animation for the pet &quot;throwing&quot; itself at the target would have to be a new one, and would require much more work than I assume you are willing to put in to this. However, I doubt any of the ShadowKnights would mind if it actually just spawned, took one slash at the target, and died with some nifty red particles flying out of it (perhaps Asystole's particle graphics) upon activation.<br />
<br />
+++The mitigation portion.<br />
<br />
Please note, that I think this could be used in conjunction with the dps portion (the timers on the dps portion would have to be reworked with the timers on the mitigation portion), or without it. Personally, I think it would be more useful to be used without it, on a seperate ability. Having these two on the same timer would be acceptable. That means we would have to choose between having the mitigation ability on the ready, or using the dps.<br />
<br />
Activate ability, said minion pops up next to you, and a certain % of the enemies damage is directed to the minion. Now, the longevity of the minion receiving said diverted damage can be determined two ways. A) A defined hp pool for the pet. Personally, i think this would be bad, simply for the sheer lack of scalability. B) An indefinite HP pool, but a timer-limited lifespan.<br />
<br />
Because I think idea A is not a particularly good one, I'm going to focus my arguement on idea B.<br />
<br />
Using Slein Jinn's times for his proposed &quot;knight-defensive&quot; I think it would be fair if the pet lasted for 72 seconds, and refreshed every 270 seconds (4 and a half minutes), and mitigated 35% of the DI and provided 15% SpellShield (the mitigation and spellshield percentages are not of Sleinn Jinn's).<br />
<br />
+++The disclaimer and other additions.<br />
<br />
First off, as a disclaimer, I would like to say that I realize the sk class is NOT a pet class, and nor do I want us to be a pet class, and this will not make us a pet class any more so than we already are. Also, I do, firmly, believe that our tanking needs to be fixed BEFORE all else - including dps. This does not mean our dps can not be fixed also. And lastly, all numbers are easily tweaked, and nothing is final to me, they are simple suggestions, as is everything here, from a humble SK. Lastly, this is NOT meant as a fix for the paladin - sk imbalance, but as a fix for the knight - warrior imbalance.<br />
<br />
Pet graphic: This could be something so simple as the exact same model for the summoned pet from &quot;Opalescent two-handed Sword&quot;. Our elemental pet weapon.<br />
<br />
Distributing this to Paladins as a fix to their tanking abilities in concern with warriors:<br />
<br />
This can be achieved quite easily, with some slight variations of my proposed idea(s). Their &quot;pet&quot; could be a summoned flaming sword or some such, and effectively do the same thing with mitigation. And perhaps instead of my proposed dps idea - they could have some type of pet that &quot;kamikaze's&quot; its life (proportional to the Paladin's level) to the rest of the group in a nice, new, group heal ability. However, I make NO concrete idea for the Paladin's abilities in this matter, and speak my idea only in regards to the SK class, as I have no place regarding paladins. The above ideas are nothing more than suggestions in regards to paladins.<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
+Parts of this could be tricky to code, and probably not worth doing compared to a simple slap-down discipline (in developer's eyes).<br />
<br />
+The summoned pet's &quot;push&quot; or knockback abilities on raids.<br />
<br />
+The summoned pet being large, obstrusive, a distraction, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Benefits:<br />
+This would effectively solve BOTH our tanking concerns, and our DPS woes.<br />
<br />
+It would give us something that isn't exactly a copy-paste of warrior abilities.<br />
<br />
+It would be a CREATIVE solution, not just a 5-second solution someone thought of using 3 of their braincells.<br />
<br />
+It would cause less (I believe) outrage from other class communities.<br />
<br />
+It would be easily distributed to both the knight classes.<br />
<br />
+It would put a (much needed) gap between Knight's and the other non-tanking classes that seem to now be so good at it.<br />
<br />
Thats just some bullshit I posted on EQLive boards, feel free to critiscize the shit out of it.</div></div><hr />

I thought it would shut up the cry about us just blurring shit and becoming the same as warriors by getting &quot;a defensive disc&quot; if we got it that way. So yes, essentially the exact same thing, a little more difficult to code. No real purpose.<br />
<br />
I was bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Stop calling it knight-defensive and call it a &quot;DI-mitigation disc&quot; or a &quot;burst mitigation disc&quot; and the more stupid among the warriors don't bitch as much... they're the ones most vocal about us being perfectly fine and dandy as-is anyway.</div></div><hr />
