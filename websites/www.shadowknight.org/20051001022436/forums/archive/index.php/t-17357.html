48.9 DPS. I used my Greater Stormwatcher Horn. Had grim aura / aura of battle for atk buffs. Had ench haste, and druid / bard ds song playing. With my gear, was just wondering if this was average DPS or sucky, or what.<br />
<br />
I parsed it without ench haste and with only cloak of luclin / banshee aura, same atk buffs, and my DPS came out to be 34.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that the longer you parse over a period of time the more accurate, and when parsing on raid mobs your dps will be much lower also.<br />

Since DPS figures can vary greatly between mobs 49DPS might be exceptional on something with high AC or sub par on something with low AC.<br />
<br />
I should be picking up a greater stormwatchers horn in the near future, just waiting on the bozo to drop it for me, let me know where you're parsing and I'll give it a whirl and see what I get after I get a horn.  If it's some super secret mob that you don't want  posted in open forums just PM me.</div></div><hr />

Seriously,  a 65 SK with haste and at least over 1200 atk should be getting 70 - 80 ish with a decent weapon like the Stormwatcher Horn.   Hell, I used to parse 60 ish with my Epic before I got any offensive AAs at 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyortsed</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds really low for dps in BoT using the Greater Stormwatcher Horn.  Are you hand calculating your dps?  Or using a program such as 'Yalp'?  If it is the former,  I would definately re-check your calculations.  If you only parsed a couple of fights,  it is possible that you just had bad 'rolls'.</div></div><hr />

That's including dot/spear dmg and procs.<br />
<br />
Damn, and I thought I was pretty decently equipped. &gt;:P<br />
<br />
Oh, and if anyone bothers to look at my Magelo, it's basically up to date... I think the only thing that has changed is I dinged 53. And those parses were with combinations of pitchfork and tae ew 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">were you also includeing any spell damage in the parce that may have been aplicable?<br />
<br />
I have logged myself up to 160 DPS in single mob encounters useing alot of burst spell damage but not includeing harm touch. and usaly get around 85 DPS on an avrage 4 hour grind with much less coustly gear than yours. <br />
<br />
Now if your only talking about melee DPS then i would say aye i prolly get about the same.<br />
<br />
I use yalp<br />
<br />
I only parce on outer camp in PoV i think its a standered happy mediom for mobs and thats why i chose it.<br />
<br />
My raid DPS almost always is pittiful tho im never tanking so i dont get the binifit of reposits and lag kills me some days. on raids from Vindi and up i get closer to 30 DPS<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry if this post is not readable im drunk and cany type<br />
<br />
Warscout<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. hey what camp in BoT were you in? if it was the brown spikey giants in south regend then you got to remember that they are like 110% disease resistant and your not gonna stick the first spear or shit even harm touch on em. go back and use a heavy dot line up, and dont be afraid to over lap yur dots.<br />
<br />
festering off the pull 50 dmg<br />
ignight blood 56 dmg<br />
boil blood 24 dmg<br />
heat blood befor it reaches camp 17 dmg<br />
blood of pain and 30 dmg<br />
blood of hate between swings of yur sword 160 dmg<br />
                             = 337 dmg per tick <br />
thats like a whole nother free swing every 6 seconds its worth it. It will never miss never be dodged you can do it even while stunned Exc....<br />
<br />
have cloak of luclin and a shaman damage shield potion up<br />
be sure to use life tap spell prock not mental curption <br />
use call of darkness (+75 attack Ldon spell)<br />
grim aura<br />
and remember that if ferine avatar is avalible it stacks with your 65th lvl 130 attack tap but ferosity does not<br />
and finaly pull out your stinking pet, invoke death in the BoT will parce for 10 DPS EASY all on his own<br />
<br />
so 337 per tick = 56 DPS and mr bones = 10 DPS = 66.16 DPS from just spell damage bro a bit less when you count in cast time and when they go off and must be replaced but still i think you shouldnt discount spell damage from your DPS equasion.<br />
<br />
all this may seem mana intensive but i can brake even dowing all this in BoT with just a shaman buddy behind me and liching so im sure you could in a full group with c5 and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solan</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warscout, what you are describing is not a sustained DPS, no way anyone can sustain that non stop on an exp grind. From my understanding Xerro was wondering about DPS in exp groups, not what you can possibly burst out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i switch between a primal axe and wmbs and i normally parse from 70-90 tanking xerro just melee on tier2-3 mobs so seems kinda low bro. Though i normally have 1450atk to 1600 atk though so maybe thats why. None tanking i shoot between 100 and 120.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warscout</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can sustain that level of intensity for 4 or 5 fights in BoT at MS camp with mana reduction 3 and usring 64 lich on horseback and with flowing thought 6. I have about a 3k mana pool wich is somewhat lack luster. and after 5 fights in MS my partner usaly calls for a halt to med anyway. in that light it is sustainable. Even if you have to cut back to less mana useage the point was not to discount your mana pool in DPS. useing just blood of hate festering darkness ingnight blood and a pet you would still almost x2 your DPS count from melee alone. Partnered with a good shaman in MS i kill a critter every 120 seconds or so useing the my previously stated method. and the giants yield between 2.5 and 6% a kill depending on the type of giant kiggers for instance are 6% but i try not to screw with them they have insain damage spikes and own me 1/2 the time i try them. that 65 shaman torpor wont keep up with a duble attack for 850 and a 1500 point DD prock.<br />

That sounds really low for dps in BoT using the Greater Stormwatcher Horn.  Are you hand calculating your dps?  Or using a program such as 'Yalp'?  If it is the former,  I would definately re-check your calculations.  If you only parsed a couple of fights,  it is possible that you just had bad 'rolls'.  <br />
<br />
Yes, hand calculating... anybody know the site to DL yalp or something?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">use a log of all fights to determine your DPS, log an entire LDoN adventure. otherwise your going to get spikes high and low in a single fight. you need a large sample size to get a statistical average you can use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways I came out to about 48 dps using the 2 hander in my magelo with SoV on.<br />
<br />
This was over 2 LDON adventures and some time spent in PoV at the caves.</div></div><hr />

Looking at my log now and the only spell info showing is from Banshee Aura.<br />

Nothing at all from CD, Spears, HT, etc.<br />
It's too bad that I can't get an accurate assessment of my DPS but I still like YALP alot, otherwise.</div></div><hr />
