<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ethycus Shadowborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for somone that has done this quest, before they re-vamped Droga until now. I am stuck on the key turn. I saw some earlier post that Argest has moved out to FM. I found an enslaved iksar, with gold loin clothe. I turned in the bone key, stone key, and bone necklace to him. He ate 2 of the keys and did a rude gesture to me. I did not recieve the wire needed. The enslaved iksar was in the Goby caves where the keys drop. Is there another area were he might spawn? I want to finish this part and recieve my Lord of Pains Khukri. I have spent enough time doing this part and I am very eager to work on the next part witch is the Greenmist itself. I would also like to know if they have changed the keys that you give to him. Any help in this would be most appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Argest is now in the FM caves - same room you get the Keys from after revamp. There is a thread a little bit below with pictures of what he looks like.  From what I remember he is on Resident's faction, by the way. <br />
<br />
No there is no change in the keys, the only difference is that you don't really need the bronze key. You can get into the jail in Droga by shrinking and squeezing through bars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ethycus Shadowborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok here is what I was doing. While farming the spectral couriers in CoM, I picked up a stone key. I am sure it leads somwhere in the back. Anyways, I was trying to turn that sone key in Argest, not the one he wanted. I didn't figure this out till he gave me the key back and said that was not our agreement. I wipped out my Silvery Mask, ID the stone key I had. It ID something Ghiousk, witch I remember from my Canni2 quest with my Shamy, as being frm CoM. I could kick myself in the rear for doing this. I appreciate your help, and I hope no one else makes the same mistake I did.<br />
<br />
   I also wanted to point out, that &quot;an iksar slave&quot; (Argest)is in the FM tunnels, kinda SW from BW zone. The goblins that drop the keys spawn in the same room with Argest, and &quot;an iksar slave&quot; witch I am lead to believe is for a Monk quest. If you can't remember witch one needs the keys, just remember the slave in the Yellow/ Gold sash.<br />
