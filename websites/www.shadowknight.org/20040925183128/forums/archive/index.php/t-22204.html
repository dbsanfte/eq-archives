<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VykusSoulsdrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What about giving us a melee ability, useable by hot key, similar to bash, but it could be called disease strike, or something similar. It weakens the Mob so that it can only deal out half damage on all hits for 5-7 secs, repop every 60-90 secs.  The idea being SKs have the ablility to weaken their foes through disease. Anyone think this is a viable option to balance out the pally stun/mitigation issue ? sorry if it sux, flame on....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its defensive(in a stacking form, let warrior tank while we do this), for 5-7 seconds, in a debuff form.<br />
<br />
we'd be delegated to make chain disease strike chains on raid mobs.<br />

Well SKs don't even have a raid roll right now.  This ability would make SKs desireable on raids and allow us to continue in a dps roll since we'd (presumably) have to be in melee range to use this.  Besides, if it only refreshes once every 60 seconds, you would be doing normal dps most of the time.<br />
<br />
Warriors are always going to be preferred as main raid tanks.  SKs might get to offtank but not every encounter has adds to offtank and even when they do, we are competing with every warrior except one for that roll, plus every paly.<br />
<br />
I don't know that this suggestion is necessarily the right way to go but I haven't heard too many ideas for giving us a tanking related raid roll without stepping on warriors' toes.<br />
<br />
Besides, this ability would increase SK offtanking and group tanking ability too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i can think of other ways to do it that wouldn't make warriors even better tanks than they already are.<br />
<br />
some sort of rune(no diamondskin, real rune that would do shit... no reagent, balanced around one/all of the following: mana cost(how often it can be used)/recast time(places minimum refresh time on it... not preferable cause wipes etc cause timer to start over.. not an issue if its a rune in the form of a disc)/cast time(decide if its supposed to be used during battles or simply as a initial thing to help us get through debuffin/etc)<br />
<br />
come to think of it, some big ass rune(10k), with a long cast time(10~30 seconds), moderate mana cost(500-1ketc)  would be nice... problem with it is it doesnt scale. make it like a vie type rune, that has a huge total damage absorbed, change it to like 25~60% mitigation(again depending on what it would be tuned for, shorter duration, higher mitigation would be nice to give us somethin to actually make us BETTER off tanks than warriors).<br />
<br />
blablabla</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our current pet is too low level to land a stun on anything outside of Lower Guk.<br />
<br />
They would have to make this not stack with defensive or make it not decrease the damage dealt by the mob to anyone but the Shadow Knight that cast it to make this balanced.  I do like the idea though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know that this suggestion is necessarily the right way to go but I haven't heard too many ideas for giving us a tanking related raid roll without stepping on warriors' toes.<br />

I don't know about you, but every now and them I'm tempted to go get some combat boots, and not just step on warriors toes, but crush the entire damn foot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">honestly wouldn't mind to see some major changes in the healing/tanking departments.<br />
<br />
16 classes 1 real healer 1 real tank = retarded kkthxbye<br />
<br />
but i'm a pussy and will settle for the role i had before, off-tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I fail to see how helping a warrior tank better is a bad thing.  If you are standing next to a warrior then 99/100 you are raiding.  As fun as it is to lose all the time wouldn't you prefer that your ability not only help you when you are tanking but also help the raid when the warrior is tanking so that your chances for a win are that much better.  Chances are something like this would be flagged just like stun and the boss would be immune anyway so it could only be used on trash mobs.  Trash mobs are easy enough so really unless you were off tanking you would never use the ability anyway, so your actual chance of this benefitting a warrior is no more or less than the Pally stunning.  I say let it help the warriors....because if it helps the warriors it helps everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just make it a huge taunt as well.  Then it is only useful if you are the MT.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more with you.  I'm sick of warriors bitching every time an SK asks for some kind of tanking disc that we desperately need and saying, &quot;you're not supposed to be able to tank as well as warriors, quit trying to&quot; or &quot;you can't have any kind of defensive because that's a warrior class-defining ability&quot;.  Warriors &quot;toes&quot; are getting a little too big and it seems like everything we ask for is perceived as stepping on them.</div></div><hr />

Instant aggro? Bad idea.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but if we come up with a suggestion that makes us better single group tanks, better offtanks, and allows us to make a significant raid contribution whether we are main tank or not, all while avoiding another retarded ass warrior sit-in, how is that a bad thing?<br />
<br />
Something along the lines of what Vykus is suggesting might actually get us MORE raw tanking power than whatever gimped version of defensive the devs might allow us as a compromise with the warriors.  Plus, only one toon gets to be MT on a raid so giving us defensive doesn't give the non-MT SKs a roll.  This suggestion does though.</div></div><hr />

I never said it was a bad thing.  I was referring to Sesshou's quote and saying that I'm tired of warriors standing in the way of Knights being balanced.  We should figure out solutions and present them and if they do step on the warriors' oh-so-sensitive toes then we'll deal with that when the time comes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  I couldn't care less about warriors.  I don't raid and I play in the same group every night, I never even see a warrior.  They could nerf warriors to the mitigation of orc pawns and I wouldn't even notice.<br />
<br />
However, I do know that a large portion of the playerbase is warriors and that they all seem to have a special talent for bitching.  So if we're going to have any chance of getting real tanking upgrades, we're probably going to have to do it in a way that doesn't piss off too many warriors.  SoE only cares about pleasing the majority and unfortunately, SKs are not the majority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scal4u</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd like to see them to give spears a resist mod, lower the recast to maybe 18 seconds and toss in a 4 second stun component on them.  This would give us something to compete with 12 second recast paladin stuns.  It would base the stuns on a different resist than paladins.  It would solve aggro woes, (Could use something else to break mez naturally) all while keeping a shadowknight theme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like that idea.  Add a stun effect and resist mod to the spears and they'll be worth using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If we were able to cut the damage dealt in half for any amount of time, that would be like a stacking defensive if used for a warrior.  If they put something like that in for us, and we used it in &quot;rotations&quot; on mobs, they would have to retune a large part of the game to balance it.  It just wouldn't work.  Sure, it would make us &quot;required&quot;, but it wouldn't help our gameplay at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What is this constant retardation about asking for us to be able to stun?  Seriously, people, that is goddamn moronic.  If you want to stun, make a paladin.  The SECOND we get a stun, paladins will have a precedent to ask for something of our's that is considered &quot;class defining.&quot;  Is it really that important to pretend stuns are a form of Almighty Mitigation in current content that it would be worth giving paladin's the biggest, mightiest, most kerosene-soaked log to fire up their whine engines?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Spelling.  Fuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1)  This isn't a stun<br />
2)  what are pallies gonna ask for that is a 'class defining ability' anyways?  The can out heal us... they aren't gonna get large DD's or dots... they aren't gonna get lifetaps... they aren't gonna get HT, and they aren't gonna get FD.  What's left that they don't have as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>DeakRadpuhn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No prob with you guys getting some form of stopping a mob for a few seconds. Personlly I'd not want it called a stun in either effect or name, cause that would start a bunch of paladins off.<br />
<br />
One warrior posted something on Pon once about a proposed spell for sk's that would increase the mobs miss rate. Rather then that how bout making the mob far less likely to triple or quad hit you? Then make certain mobs immune, mainly raid mobs. Ideas?</div></div><hr />

&quot;The stun...this made our list of top 10 issues? Really? wow....<br />
 All the warriors trolling these boards should take a deep breath (especially Frodlin, he gets worked up ya know).<br />
 <br />
Stuns are perennially in danger of breaking the game entirely. Like Macci stated they are an absolute. Unfortunately, game mechanics has placed paladin survival capabilities firmly upon the ability to short term -pause ( read stun)- mobs while awaiting the next heal.<br />
 <br />
 At best this was poor planning, stuns and defensive/ weaponshield are in serious danger of breaking the game. How so you might ask? Well...<br />
 <br />
 The stun has always been used as a paladin pause button for mobs, desperate for another heal due to their lower hp and cleric desire to use the infernal complete heal spell, and is their chief means for survival in the game.<br />
 SoE decided to make content harder by making mob dps go up... everything that could block/reduce mob dps became powerful to the integer that mob dps was raised by. A mob previously hitting for 600 now hitting for 1200 made all these abilities some 200% more powerful ( a guess) and these powers scaled horrendously.<br />
 <br />
 A stun is absolutely needed for yellows and red cons in single combat in Tipt/Vexed/ Yxxta/ Kod Taz/ Ikkinz single group trials. That is for paladins entering GoD to be able to compete for single group opportunities with the new agro enhanced warrior who is coming into that content from (a war can do it in Vex Thal gear probably) VT/ elementals or potime. Without the ability to mitigate the majority of paladins will not have the patience to try to advance through Gates of discord and will quit the game as many have already done <br />
 <br />
 The Ikkinz raid trials must immediately have their resists reworked entirely, sorry guys but its very bad and I am honest.  Ikkinz raid trials trash mobs are a joke and paladins are gods during the raids, hell we have pulls where mobs no longer injure the tanks. The old risk was if a paladin got resisted the agro from the stun was huge but people complained about stuns being too high agro ( /wave warriors) so what happened was some paladins learned they could start stunning raid mobs without the extra risk of gaining agro from the tanks, with warrior agro improvements this made it even easier. Now paladins can stun and warriors can hold agro.....now multiple paladins can stun and warriors can hold agro... now in the Ikkinz raid trials warriors never go down below 75% while clearing trash, lots of times they do not drop below 100% meaning they arent even hit.... warriors are happy with this and want us to be stun bots, personally I help the raid anyway that I can but I did not sign on to be a living Bulwark of Vie buff. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I have seen that the pally's in my guild have started chain stunning during Ikkiniz trials giving them another raid role of reducing damage on the MA.<br />
Thats one more benefit of recuriting paladins and one less for the SK's</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pallies only have one stun that will land on mobs over 65 right now, and that's Divine Stun, which lasts for all of a single second.  As an AA ability, it has substantially lower aggro than normal stuns.</div></div><hr />
