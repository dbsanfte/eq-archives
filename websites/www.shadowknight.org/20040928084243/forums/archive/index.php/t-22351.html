<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One issue I've seen brought up a lot lately is that Paladin's can mitigate a lot of damage with stun and we lack a similar method of mitigation.<br />
<br />
What if we got a new spell that was sort of a blend of our darkness and fear lines:<br />
<br />
Fear of Darkness<br />
Effects: Fear, Decrease Movement by 60%<br />
Duration: 6 seconds<br />
Recast: 24 seconds<br />
Cast time: 1 second<br />
Mana: 200<br />
<br />
This would work on mobs up to level 70.  I'm not 100% sure on the numbers, I'll leave those up for discussion.  I'm also not sure about the resist modifier although I think something similar to the resists on stuns would be fair.<br />
<br />
I think this could be very useful though for &quot;fear kiting&quot; in a group situation.  The short duration would mean we could use it in dungeons without worrying about the mob taking off into other rooms.  It is also very in line with our class description and builds off existing spell lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mmm, I really don't think a fear, even with a significan snare, woudl be a good idea.  A lot of times placement of a mob is an important factor, not to mention the annoyance of dealing with moving mobs as well as the high number of snare immune monsters now.  In fact this idea has been proposed before.<br />
<br />
I shudder to think of the potential adds in a zone like KT or would be like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I shudder to think of the potential adds in a zone like KT or would be like.<br />
<br />
Would suck even down in Droga/Nura or Caverns of Exile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still don't know whats wrong with a fear that freezes a mob in place.  It fits with our class description.  Fear is one of our defining abilities below 55 then all of the sudden its gone. <br />
<br />
Shouldn't an SK strike fear into our prey?  I don't see whats wrong with a fear that freezes a mob in place for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So, why would this not be a slow instead of a darkness?<br />
<br />
Otherwise why is festering followed by fear a better choice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slow is a stupid idea for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
1)  unless it stacked with shammy slow, it's pointless.<br />
2)  A whole heck of a lot of mobs mitigate slow past a certain point anyways, making it useless.<br />
3)  Unless it's a rather large slow (which won't happen) it won't make much of a difference anyways.<br />
<br />
Fear isn't a whole lot better, primarily due to mob positioning (the mob turning around isn't good), and due to the fact a great many mobs are snare immune.  We'd more likely than not have groups and raids begging us not to use this ability than it actually doing us any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, why would this not be a slow instead of a darkness?<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow makes SK's a debuff bitch not a tank.<br />
The fear idea is more towards tanking.<br />
Rogues would hate it (as even if they didn't move it would turn the mob around).  Mob Placement and push is very important in many one group encounters as well as raids.  Even itty bitty knockbacks of pet weapons and pet push are not allowed on many raids, this would seem to have similair issues..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A powerful SK debuff would not make an SK a &quot;debuff bitch&quot; anymore than stun has made a paladin a &quot;stun bitch&quot;.  I haven't experienced any situation where paladins were brought along just to stun mobs that a warrior was tanking, have you?  If it does happen, how often does it happen?  Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, level 55+ raid mobs are going to resist the fear anyway and many resist snare.  So, its an aggro spell against them.  So, as far as I can tell its only useful as a festering replacement because its faster.  Many GoD mobs run so need a real snare applied to them, not one that lasts for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
As for making this work (the fear bit) on mobs up to level 70, get real.  Put 6 - 8 SKs in a raid and things suddenly are a lot easier.  So, this will be resisted by raid mobs.  If you are saying make this effect work on group mobs to level 70, whole lots of things are going to be fear proof.  I wasn't assuming the fear worked to level 70, just the snare.  I assumed the fear was put in for aggro reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What I am talking about would have to be coded to work on mobs up to level 70 like the pally stuns.  It does not have to turn the mobs.  Why can't it freeze the mobs in place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">fear that dont move the mobs is just a  stun which makes us  pallys hehe<br />
<br />
i would like upgrades to fear and invoke fear spells though, it was so great to use befor pop for exp stuff. i dont want it for primary abiltiy but to be able to fear stuff again like back in the day would be so sweat.</div></div><hr />

==========<br />
<br />
I am sorry am I missing something, were in PoP or higher <br />
zones would fear be used that wouldnt cause a train<br />
or be used in a beneficial manner?  Would rather have<br />
something that immobizes,stun(like)s, or unresistable<br />
snare effect than Fear.  Or something that cause a large<br />
amount of aggro without doing any damage to it.  <br />
Kinda like the Terror line but something that actually<br />
works.  Or perhaps have the terror line strike fear<br />
in the mob making them experience a stun like effect<br />
in addition to aggro it could do.  As it is now Terror<br />
line blows chunks, doesnt do jack except good for<br />
pulling when snare isnt a good idea for the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vasto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We get things like mana Tap procs, and the pallies don't... we get snare, the pallies don't.. as far as I know, we get DoT's and the pallies don't...<br />
<br />
We are different classes, we work differently, I say we get over that! :)<br />
<br />
A better argument would be to say &quot;Necro's get _____, lets find a way that we can work that into the Sk Class.&quot; For instance, they have a spell called what, Screaming Terror? As far as I know that's a stun, maybe it's undead only, I don't know.. but it's a stun. Now, maybe if we could get a similar version only 983948 levels later like all of our necro spells. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Paladins get innate buff procs as well.<br />
<br />
Paladins do not get snare, they get root.<br />
<br />
Paladins have other tools in the place of DoTs ( which our's are near useless anyway )<br />
<br />
We want a tool that will bring our tanking up to par with Paladins due to stuns. That's it. That's all. We don't want to be Paladins, we just want to be equal as it should be. Fear2 ( fear / stun type of spell ) is what I'm gunning for personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You could up the snare to 90% as has been suggested before. This gives the &quot;stun&quot; an SK flavour and isn't a cut and paste Paladin spell. Yes, it would move around a little, I'd be willing to accept that as a small downside vs the Paladin version. As someone who used Fear back in Guk to mitigate damage as the mob was in its last 20% of life (Flee speed was zero, and he wouldn't hit back, saving the healer considerable damage) I would very much like to see this type of spell implemented. We really do need an alternative to Paladin stuns, this is a creative way to achieve that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most of the mini boss mobs I am fighting are SNARE IMMUNE.  Why do people keep talking about darkness based solutions?<br />
<br />
FEAR is an SK/NECRO ability.  To scare a mob so bad that it can't move is not the same thing as a paladin stun.  A paladin stun is a cleric ability it involves the use of a sudden force to stun the mob.<br />
<br />
Now we cannot fear mobs above level 55 so that this spell will need to be specially coded to work.<br />
<br />
As far as I know sceaming terror is a mez type spell which kind of makes it useless for us to use and it only works up to level 55 also.<br />
<br />
Paladins don't lose their ability to stun at level 55 why should we lose our ability to fear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tumple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I fully agree!  I was reading the thread, and it looked as tough your posts wer egetting ignored =/   I think the method of keeping a mob terrified in it's place would be a great solution to help rais SK's tanking closer to paladins with their stuns!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PokenHopen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you want to look at it that way, there are different levels of fear, so afraid you can move(dear in head lights) aka fear2 which is already in game(a stun).<br />
<br />
so afraid you just cut tail and run away(regular fear).  since fear2 is actually just a stun with the name fear it could be coded to work up to level 70 and have different level spells for it as well, but would give us pally stuns, perhaps it should be shorter duration stuns then pallies since we have lifetaps or something, what ever.<br />
<br />
the if the first fear reccomendation where to work if mobs where snare immune the whole spell would have to not take effect some how, but that would require recoding fear to work on higher mobs and thats just inviting all kinds of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tumple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, would it be more even for SK's and Pallies if we got a fear stun which did 0 dmg?<br />
<br />
Would dmg of their stuns make it even with our lifetap procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Most of the mini boss mobs I am fighting are SNARE IMMUNE.  Why do people keep talking about darkness based solutions?<br />

<br />
Now we cannot fear mobs above level 55 so that this spell will need to be specially coded to work.<br />
If the spell has to be specially coded to work, is there any reason it couldn't be coded to work on &quot;snare immune mobs&quot;?  If this spell lasts only 6 seconds and isn't chainable, it couldn't be exploited for kiting purposes, which is why some mobs are snare immune i believe.  Making it a 90% snare would eliminate much of the problem with positioning in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Rogues being annoyed would be a trade off we would have to deal with.  I have a rogue as part of my 3box team and I know I wouldn't mind having the mob turn once every 24 seconds or something.  For one thing, the rogue could just wait until the end of the 6 seconds to BS.  Also, rogues get an AA called chaotic stab, which allows minimum backstab damage from all sides...this would make that AA (and possibly a future upgrade to that AA) more worth buying for rogues.<br />
<br />
That said, I also like the idea of scaring a mob so bad it freezes in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Between the Fear cap and the many mobs that are immune to changes in their run speed...this will never happen. I don't think that the Fear/Snare immunity tags on mobs would be something that the Devs want to try to code around just to add a SK spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Between the Fear cap and the many mobs that are immune to changes in their run speed...this will never happen. I don't think that the Fear/Snare immunity tags on mobs would be something that the Devs want to try to code around just to add a SK spell...<br />
And I think it's bullshit that Fear is a central part of our class description and a class defining ability that suddenly disappears when we stop fighting mobs below level 55.  There's no reason at all that that can't increase the fear cap, especially with level 70 coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Fear-kiting stuff over L 55 and beyond would screw up so many encounters in PoP/GoD and open up a ton of stupid exploits and pathing bugs.<br />
<br />
I'd also hate to lose my best non-damage aggro spell, especially seeing how big the kite/add-control role of SKs has become.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Fear-kiting stuff over L 55 and beyond would screw up so many encounters in PoP/GoD and open up a ton of stupid exploits and pathing bugs.<br />
A 6 second fear would hardly allow for enough kiting to screw things up.  If other spells in the game (pacify for instance) can have a variety of caps depending on which spell in the line is being used or what the level of the caster is, then I don't see why they can't do that for fear.  Old, long duration fear caps at 55.  New, 6 second fear caps at 70.  Maybe they could add a level 70 long duration fear that caps on 63ish mobs or something as well.<br />
<br />
I'd also hate to lose my best non-damage aggro spell, especially seeing how big the kite/add-control role of SKs has become.<br />
If they fixed terrors, this wouldn't matter.  Fear as a non-damage agro spell is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If they fixed terrors, this wouldn't matter.<br />
<br />
That would be a big &quot;if&quot; since it appears the devs don't think terrors are broken or even underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I like Inferna's suggestion, call it Frozen Fear or Grip of Terror or something.</div></div><hr />

What if we got something like Inferna is suggesting, which feared the mob in place, but as a proc self buff?  That would make it even more SK-like.  As long as the proc rate and fear duration were tuned appropriately, it would work very well for damage mitigation purposes.<br />
<br />
It would also give the spell a trade-off component.  Use MC when you are low on mana, a lifetap proc buff when you are a non-tank in an AE situation, and use the fear proc for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would rather have SOE fix terror line first before changing a spell I have to use for agro.  Having a spell that momentarily &quot;stuns&quot; a mob is a good idea, so why not add it into a terror retool?  The idea being they are so overcome with terror they freeze in place for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

One more note about my fear proc idea.  It would give us something to compete with the mitigation that Paladins get from their stuns but it wouldn't compete with their ability to use their stuns to interrupt casters.  I think this trade off might make SOE more agreeable to the idea.</div></div><hr />

Would it be out of line for us to put one of these solutions, or a list saying we would like one of the above, on our class top ten list?  I realize we have some generic statements on there about closing the tanking gap but maybe a solid idea or three on how to fix it might jump start the SOE devs.  Our best bet for a near-term solution is to get something in OOW and beta is starting soon so there isn't much time.

Make it simple and it is more likely we will get it and more likely to get it faster(well simple and balanced)</div></div><hr />

Noctix, the first step to closing the tanking gap for you should probably be getting your defensive AAs...you need to actually encounter the tanking gap before you complain about it, let alone solve it.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, I didn't know that warriors getting defensive and paladins getting stuns while SKs get nothing similar only applied to fully AAed tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want an innate mitigation change to help you compete with Paladin stuns? You want an SK only innate advantage or one for all Knights? In which case Paladins would have the innate mitigation boost AND be able to further stun mobs? If its SK only you're smoking some good stuff that we would ever get such an always on Stun compensation package.<br />
<br />
This is part of the reason we never get anything. We can't decide amongst ourselves what we want, how are the devs going to give it to us?</div></div><hr />

This has been discussed before but I think this might be more realistic if it were distributed to all group members.  This would be similar to the cleric DA ability, only on a per-hit basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Can you just imagine what the mobs would hit for if they implemented a &quot;share damage&quot; ability?  Would be interesting to see something meleeing for 20k a pop the first time, and it would be nice to have something unique to be desired for.  I can see it now, &quot;raid cancelled because we didn't have any shadow knights show up.&quot;  That would be a first.<br />
<br />
And it would be hilarious if it got resisted, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Zobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">What if we got something like Inferna is suggesting, which feared the mob in place, but as a proc self buff?  That would make it even more SK-like.  As long as the proc rate and fear duration were tuned appropriately, it would work very well for damage mitigation purposes.<br />
<br />
It would also give the spell a trade-off component.  Use MC when you are low on mana, a lifetap proc buff when you are a non-tank in an AE situation, and use the fear proc for tanking.<br />
<br />
Given the choice I would much rather have the ability to control this when I want and not some random proc. I would also rather keep Black Shroud up AND be able to cast a mitigation spell. Besides, with WA5, adding a proc to my line up is not efficient.<br />
<br />
As far as Terrors go, while Id like to see them fixed and have a stun component, SOE most likely would make it a 0.0 stun to appease the Pallys. If they gave us comparable stuns plus static hate generation, Pallys would be in an uproar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">You want an innate mitigation change to help you compete with Paladin stuns? You want an SK only innate advantage or one for all Knights? In which case Paladins would have the innate mitigation boost AND be able to further stun mobs? If its SK only you're smoking some good stuff that we would ever get such an always on Stun compensation package.<br />
<br />
This is part of the reason we never get anything. We can't decide amongst ourselves what we want, how are the devs going to give it to us?<br />
<br />
I suggested solutions to two of the things on our top 10 list, I don't think that is contributes to the confusion you think we seem to have.  <br />
<br />
And yes innate 5% for knight classes to put is back as an off tank role or tanking alternative.  Warriors got 10% without even asking over two patches,  having the knight classes get  a 5% now isn't unreasonable.   <br />
<br />
As for the stun mitigation issue I would rather have SOE working on fixing a spell line that is suppose to be my agro generation spells BEFORE screwing up fear as a bandaid for stun mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Calliav or Fear 2, either way we need one of them.<br />
<br />
I'd vote for a short recast Calliav, and an ending to the Fear nerfs that have always been in our &quot;class description&quot;. But then again, &quot;Class definition documents&quot; are coming out soon, and with it the hope they'd change our class for the better finally and realize things are rather out of balance. Funny thing is, I could see the document for SKs looking like:<br />
<br />
SKs are a plate tank that has various forms of dealing extra damage to monsters, making them very fearsome in combat.<br />
<br />
Horribly vague and laden with flawed concepts.</div></div><hr />

but I very much fear it will.</div></div><hr />
