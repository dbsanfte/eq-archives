<br />
Why doesn't he mention on how most of the Subway establishments are so disgustingly below the Health and Food Regulations, that most Subway Stockholder/Owners, pay off health inspectors to let their business go on without being looked at,until someone finds a *prize* in their oh so delicious fucking sandwich<br />
<br />
Feel better now<br />
<br />
Hopes Jared chokes on one those fucking heroes, he tries to pawn off on us so much, he probably lost so much weight from Food Poisoning,Virus, that's why he's their &quot;Mascot&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared: I got sick from eating your nasty ass sandwiches, i puke on a constant basis from morning to evening, and yet i can't stop ordering that honey teriyaki custom sub sandwich, which makes me sick<br />
<br />
Subway Representive: you be our poster boy and we will continue to supply you with your cravings and we both get what we want,<br />
<br />
Jared: Wo0T! i teh winnah!<br />
<br />
<br />
done ranting, i feel slightly better<br />

Shit another subway commercial!..........</div></div><hr />

I live in NYC,but it's not just the cleanlines of the restuarant, it's just fucking annoying to see that handpuppet every 10-15mins between each channel i flick to<br />

I live in Louisiana and I would imagine you have way more sandwich places up north.  We really only have Subway and Qiznos for sandwich shops outside of mom and pop places.<br />
<br />
Hence why I guess I like it... Plus its one of the few places around here you have lunch for under like 800 calories...<br />

Same as the gas stations.  Out here, locals run them, clean places for the most part.  Towards town, immigrant owned/operated, nasty as fucking hell.<br />

<br />
Dude have you been to NY, which is right next to NJ ?, once you see those fucking snotheads without gloves,your appetite is already gone and you ask for a soda, and hope to god they didnt drop on the floor and just dust em off<br />
<br />
<br />
second thing, it's a guessing game with the subway establishments in NYC because you can tel the immigrant owned ones from the corporate ones by their canopy sign colors, if it isn't the same as the commericial don't even walk in the door,i do have to admit for NJ, they have alot of clean places, but then again you don't have a immigrant looking to make a cheap buck off your health<br />
<br />
(Apu)Thank you come again! and ear our germ infested sandwiches that is handled by our employees who dont wear gloves and use the bathroom and come back step on a tissue and pull it off the bottom of their shoe and then turn to you and ask what would you like to order today sir ?<br />
<br />
Me: I'd like to order the number to the Health and Food adminstration, and a cup of Diet Cherry coke from the tap because your cups look like theyve been their for ages,and i see a couple of cobwebs on them ^_~;</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 or 15 years ago there was a sign in each subway telling you that you could ask the &quot;sandwich&quot; artist to wear gloves preparing your sandwich.<br />
<br />
Then they always had to wear gloves and the condiment containers got little covers.<br />
<br />
Never had an issue here with Subway, Cousins, Quiznos, Costello's, etc.</div></div><hr />

But once Quiznos came to town it was all over. Their food is an order of magnitude better than anything Subway ever imagined. Somehow that short trip through the oven makes a huge difference. <br />
<br />
Plus the girl that makes the sandwiches at my local Quizzies is hawt. And I love those disgusting little creatures in their ads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about a gas station, but I know what you mean.  The northeast has awesome food compared to most areas from what I've seen.  If I want a sub I'm sure as HELL not going to drive up to a fucking Subway.  I'm walking four doors down where I can see some guy in the window hand tossing fresh pizza dough.  Oh, and he's Italian, too!  *gasp*  Living in Phoenix, it didn't matter what type of food you wanted:  fast food, chinese, mexican, thai, etc etc etc.  They always had mexicans in the kitchen (except some sushi places that had students from Japan working in them).  Surprised the hell out of me since up north I knew the owners of damn near every Chinese or Italian place I ever went to and they were all chinese or italian.  That's not to say that they can't cook, but wouldn't it be weird to walk into a mexican restaurant and see a kitchen full of redheads from Boston?<br />
<br />
<br />
Err... back on topic:<br />
<br />
Screw Subway.  I didn't eat it for over 2 years after my roommate tossed a sub up into a blue plastic bag while driving through rushour in St Louis (was moving out to AZ at the time).  I've never been a huge fan of Subway.  If I have to I'll choke down a pizza sub, but only if I'm dying of hunger... and out of town and don't know anywhere to eat...<br />
<br />
McD's tastes like ass, but as mentioned all their shit is frozen and then microwaved to death anyway, so at least I probably won't die from eating it. Why does this chicken select taste like it's been microwaved and then set on a warm tray for 2 hrs?  Oh... nevermind, don't answer that.  They have to be the worst fast food right now, not to mention I hate their advertising campaign MORE than Subway's!  How is that possible?  Fuck if I know, but &quot;Ich liebe es!&quot;  At least, that's what they want me to think.</div></div><hr />

First time I ordered pizza out here I got two larges (1 pep, and 1 cheese), these cost me 48 fucking dollars and taste like spaghetti sauce on a sub roll.  I guess the lack of good pizza is 'cause all the italians live on the east coast&lt;shrug&gt;.<br />
<br />
As for subs out here - My first &quot;italian&quot; sub came with bologna and guacamole...it had no mayonaise and/or oil.  Next sub I got, turkey, came with butter instead of mayo...these people have no clue how to make a fucking sandwich.  Now I'm stuck going to quiznos for a half-way decent sub, but their subs are no where near as good as the local chains back east.  (I'ld give my right nut for a &quot;bobby&quot; right now *real turkey meat with stuffing, cranberry sauce, provologne and mayo*)</div></div><hr />

what?  are you retarded?  If a pizza boy demanded 50 bucks for TWO pizzas I would have not stopped raping his eyesockets until he was dead.<br />

<br />
My wife thought she didn't like Milwaukee pizza because she had been spoiled by the great pizza in Chicago all her life (note: pizza in Chicago rocks, and usually the thin or pan is even better than the deep dish).<br />
<br />
Then I had the chance to serve her pizza from a little white trash bar in the Northwoods while we were traveling to vacation last year, and she realized that she wasn't biased against non-Chicago pizza and that Milwaukee pizza is just mediocre.  <br />
<br />
And mediocre pizza is not acceptable. (and comes with neither a jimmy slam nor man-onaise)</div></div><hr />
