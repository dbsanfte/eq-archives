I was just wondering if there is a great spot for soloing at around level 53. SoL is out of the question cause my computer couldn't take it and since I am a 1team dark on Tallon Zek, other spots will be ruled out as well. Currently, I'm killing shades on the 6th floor of ToFS. All are light blue to blue at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I found a nice little spot up at like 2000, -1000 to pull to.  Nice little place where no adds come in, and the pathing is, erm, convenient.<br />
<br />
Lots of blues, many of which are undead.  When I used to solo there, I had no jboots, so I'd pull with engulfing from my BE gloves, doom them when they got back to the kill spot, send the pet in, and fear.<br />
<br />
You'll have to watch out for the Gullerbacks, as they're immune to snare and fear.  Greater Warbones, Tatterback Gorrillas, and Sciorae Hornets should also be skipped at your level.<br />

Luclin would open up many options, but more often than not you'd have to fight for them.</div></div><hr />
