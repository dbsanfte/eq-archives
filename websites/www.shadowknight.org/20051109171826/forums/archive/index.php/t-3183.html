<br />
A couple of people have mentioned that they were thinking of asking a GM to do this, and I'm just curious if anyone has had any luck with it.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, we're stuck until HOPEFULLY the next patch when they put it back into place in some form.<br />
<br />
Just sitting here ready to spawn and kill the Golem, but I don't have the shard, so it's not urgent.  If I find a shard for sale or get down there for it, though, it would be nice to know if I can progress on Greenmist through a /petition, or whether I'm stuck for a while.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input from those of you who've quested for this since the last patch.<br />

Maybe he's popping on all servers, but he's on the &quot;watch&quot; list for guides/GM's to come depop him, rather than them perma-killing him until he's fixed.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, Darkbaine, he was apparently removed because the quest sequence allows you to get repeated exp from him.  Verant doesn't like that &quot;Free Exp&quot; thing very much. :)<br />

<br />
I've seen him before I'm pretty sure, but as a Troll I only recently got into Cabalis to work on the Greenmist, so perhaps I'm off on where he is.  Just to be clear on his location (but I DID walk the entire place looking for him), he SHOULD be on the first floor as you walk in, just slightly off-center to the left, right?  If the room were a clock, with the door you enter being 6, he'd be around 11, with his back to the wall, right?<br />
<br />
There's just dead space there on Xegony.  Librarian Zimor is upstairs, as are all the other NPC's I've already talked with, but that spot is vacant.<br />
<br />
Still wondering if anyone with him DOWN on your server has successfully petitioned to have him spawned just for the Tynnonium turn-in.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Subject: RE: XXXXXXX account <br />
I am not stupid, this is debatable. First prove to me what macro I was <br />
using. It was never proved. The GM assumed, even in the court of law <br />
assuming is dismissal. Every thing that was done was in no way of <br />
violating the eula. your programmer/designer of the quest was well <br />
aware of the turning it in. If he wasn't then there is a problem. The <br />
designer and whoever checks up on his work is the one responsible not <br />
me. <br />
<br />
Since the stealth nerf of Hierophant Oynx, you will obviously need the <br />
old one to do this.<br />
<br />
In one resolution 1024x768, you can turn it in, then when it switches <br />
to 640x420 it ould have the mouse curser on the give button. Now if i <br />
have my entire enventory filled the item would return to the curser. <br />
Your designers had to be aware and made it to be this way. <br />
<br />
As for being &quot;non responsive&quot;, this tells me you do not view your logs <br />
very well, I just turned level 12 I think and bought new spells. I then <br />
scribed the spells when the GM summoned me you must of known I was <br />
scribing spells if you did look at the logs, your logs must also show <br />
the scribing spells. Also for being non responsive, the GM did not try <br />
to contact me. She Just summoned me. Locked my keyboard down to where I <br />
was only able to type. Since being confused in what was going on. I was <br />
trying to figure out what went wrong with my keyboard. I was unable to <br />
alt tab out, use the esc key and unable to use the backspace. With the <br />
backspace key disabled typing was difficult. I had numerous tells, and <br />
with the backspace key disabled correcting my text was not possible. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion If I was turning it in multiple times using the <br />
process I explained. There is no exploit since the quest allowed you to <br />
turn it in multiple times. With the way the interface is working. Your <br />
bosses approved it the way it is working. It has worked that way since <br />
the last update to the approved working interface on live servers.<br />
<br />
If you do not agree I would like to talk to you or your supervisor via <br />
phone.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Hello,<br />
&gt; Thank you for verifying this information. The emails you received are<br />
&gt; correct. Your account was suspended, and the banned, for exploiting <br />
a quest<br />
&gt; and then using a macro to continuously exploit it. Our records show <br />
over<br />
&gt; 38,000 turn-ins of the same item, spanning a few days. Each turn in <br />
was<br />
&gt; within seconds of the previous turn-in. When the GM attempted to <br />
contact<br />
&gt; you, they found another of your characters standing in front of <br />
another<br />
&gt; quest NPC, being nonresponsive.<br />
&gt; I'm afraid that this banning will stand and is not debatable.<br />

&gt; Greetings,<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment. I am known as GM<br />
&gt; Zelorixa. While reviewing your logs, I saw that the item in question <br />
was<br />
&gt; returned to you on the 18th. Additionally, this same item was turned <br />
in to<br />
&gt; the Hierophant over 38,000 times between June 14 and 16. No breaks <br />
were<br />
&gt; taken during this time period and your character rose from level 51 <br />
to 54.<br />
&gt; After the return of the item, you turned it in another 1800 times. <br />
Due to<br />
&gt; the fact that the item was usually turned in at the rate of twice per<br />
&gt; second, non-stop for two days, it must be assumed that you were using <br />
a<br />
&gt; macro program. Such activity is a violation of our User Agreement and<br />

Am I right in my previous assumption:  Oxyn is on the ground floor of the SK/Shaman/BL(?) hall, against the wall in the back, at about the 11 o'clock position as you enter the door (which is at 6 o'clock)?<br />

Oxyn is not the only missing mob in E.Cab, the BST trainer has a spawning issue as well.  A few brief talks with the &quot;new&quot; wandering, but useless server GMs informed me that the mobs simply moved and I had not looked hard enough.

<br />
I think Rukog is right, when this guy realized that he was in deep doo, he scrambled furiously and grasped at whatever straw he could find.  Thus we get the old &quot;shifting resolutions&quot; exploit, and yeah, he managed to do this 38,000 times.  Hell, he was apparently two-boxing at the time.  No wonder he couldn't respond to the GM!  LOL!<br />
<br />
It is kind of funny to see these people with the excuse that &quot;it's the programmer's fault&quot;.  He went from level 51 to 54 by repeatedly turning in a lump of rock, and he felt he was entitled to this because of a programmer's oversight.  He took exploiting to a whole new level (both literally and figuratively, I suppose), and yet is indignant when action is taken.<br />

I still feel that it takes a very large, erm, ego to actually blame the programmers and designers for this one, heh.</div></div><hr />
