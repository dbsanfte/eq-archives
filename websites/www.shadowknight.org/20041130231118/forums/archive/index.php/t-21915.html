<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading a lot of these threads about SK's and Pallies getting defensive. Although there is merit in us having that discipline, with it comes a lot consequenses, both in content and inter-class balance.<br />
<br />
What I wanted to do is not to reject the defensive idea, but offer to you all a different vision of what knights' role might be.<br />
<br />
First a little history, like a lot of SK's I have played through every expansion and grouped or raided pretty much everything in the game multiple times, so I want to bring the perspective of not just the end-game raider but also the more casual player still doing the Temple of Veeshan or LDoN. Although our raid role has been modified slightly over the years, it basically has boiled down to three things:<br />
<br />
1. Off tank<br />
2. Puller<br />
3. DPS<br />
<br />
(For some roles two and three may be reversed).<br />
<br />
As the guilds I have been in were pushing the limits of what we were capable of, I have never been the raid tank, nor has any other knight I have been associated with, on anything but trivial raid bosses. Warriors own that role hands down (and rightfully so), and defensive has been a large part of that success.<br />
<br />
I thought I would take a fresh perspective and try suggest some ideas that would on the one hand improve the thing we do as our primary role as (off tank), while at the same time have those improvements impact us positively in our group tank role when not in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
The first idea is a new discipline, available to both shadow knights and paladins. This would replace the Fearless discipline line (which has been made obsolete by AA's anyway):<br />
<br />
Champion's Strength <br />
Instanly triggered.<br />
Duration 12 seconds.<br />
Reuse 3 mins.<br />
Effect 50% melee damage reduction, stun immunity, 75% channleing modification, 100% fizzle rate reduction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next would be a series of spells to both help us off tank and tank:<br />
<br />
Fear2 Line:<br />
Cast 1.0<br />
Recast 5.0<br />
Mana cost scaling from 75 for the lowest spell to 200 for the highest.<br />
Effect stun 3.0 seconds.<br />
The line would follow the levels of Terror, giving access to both low and high level SK's. <br />
Mob effectiveness ranges from 55 to 70 (our Ancient spell for Omens).<br />
<br />
In exchange, Paladins would receive a group buff of 50 AC that would have similar cast time restrictions and durations to our Aura of Pain.<br />
<br />
Next would be a game mechanics change that allowed the FD classes (SK, Necro and Monk) to not have FD break if you resist the spell cast on you.<br />
<br />
These three improvements would be complimented by two sets of AA's:<br />
<br />
Stonewall and Improved Stonewall (let's us not have FD broken by a mob successfully casting on us).<br />
<br />
Death Peace on a hot Key. Same cast and recast time as the spell, but without the chance to fizzle.<br />
<br />
<br />
If these changes were implemented, it would go a long way toward making us balanced while not taking the role of another class. It would carve out our own nitch as off tank on raids, while at the same time helping to imporve us as pullers and group tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ninaelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">champions strength is way too weak to make even a marginal difference in either offtanking or single group content, 12 seconds of 50% melee mitigation is only slightly better then the fearless it would replace. As far as offtanking how many mobs are offtanked for 12 seconds or less? For group content that's even worse leechcurse is prolly better then that given the duration. For a partial mitigation discipline to retain any value it will have to last for at the very least 1 minute. Giving pally a group ac buff line? what purpose does that play in class balancing exactly? Unless your planning on making AoP a group type spell I don't see the value in that. This just doesn't seem all that well thought out to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">24 second duration on champion's I think would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally i would like to see the fd hotkey be something that didnt require channeling, something that cant be stopped with stun or just melee push.  A monk can be fully stunned and still fd.  Im not asking for rapid feign, but maybe a 5 second recycle time on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like I said regarding Brael's idea (which would be *more* powerful at 12secs/72secs and 65% instead of 50), it would certainly help, and I can easily see what its intended to do, but to me it just doesn't address the root of the problem, and in the case of yours specifically, I don't think it goes far enough.  <br />
<br />
Stuns are the root of all of the knight classes' problems.  Yes, SK's too, even though we don't have them.  SK's and pallys tend to get improvements collectively, so the power/problems of the paladin is holding us back too.  <br />
<br />
Stuns are overwhelmingly powerful against blue stunnable mobs.  The higher level the mob, the fewer stuns can be used (thus the lower their impact).  They are useless against unstunnable mobs.  They are of limited use against very hard hitting mobs - they reduce the DPS without reducing the spike potential.  <br />
<br />
Stuns collectively need to be reworked to lift this albatross of inconsistancy off the necks of the knight classes and allow for meaningful upgrades.  We do not recieve upgrades because of the ungodly potential for power against some content, leaving us gimped against other content.  Paladins need their reliance on stuns to be reduced greatly and shadowknights need a spell to parallel their (reduced) power.  The knights can then collectively recieve a needed upgrade.  <br />
<br />
PoN has suggested having stuns leave a buff on a mob to prevent chaining them; I personally favor replacing the Quellious line (see my thread) and linking the force line so that only one stun can be used at a time.  In all honesty though, they both achieve the same result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Champion's Strength <br />
Instanly triggered.<br />

<br />
<br />
I think the idea is good, but 50% melee damage reduction does not seem to fit it (unsure if you meant damage taken or output, but either way it doesn't make much sense to me). I am assuming the idea behind this disc would be to allow us to cast spells while tanking, in which case make it a guarenteed channel through all spells, and stun immunity with 100% fizzle reduction, along with some kind of spell haste. Also, the name should be more like &quot;Casting Fool&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stonewall and Improved Stonewall (let's us not have FD broken by a mob successfully casting on us).<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they should fix the whole game so landing a spell on an FDed person never breaks FD. FD already has an innate chance to fail as it is, making an extra check in certain situations just pisses monks/necros/SKs off more than it does balance anything.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After reading your messages over again, I am now thinking you meant the 50% melee damage reduction to be our version of a defensive discipline. That being the case, I don't really have comment on that, though the way I proposed it, I think it would be a fun disc on its own. I have never wished for a defensive discipline for myself, but then again I've never tanked a PoP level raid boss mob before, since I'm mostly an LDON casual player, and the only mobs I tank don't hit for more than 1k per swing, which is pretty rough on me, but bearable, though I realize my gear doesn't compare to most SKs on this board.<br />

PS. No, I don't have a magelo in my sig, but let's just say my gear ranges between Blood Lord's and Tak armor.</div></div><hr />
