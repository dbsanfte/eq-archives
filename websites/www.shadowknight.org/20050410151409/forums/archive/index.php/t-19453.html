<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone any useful information about Korocust? He's th boss of Chardok B aka Halls of Betrayal. <br />
What raidforce, if any do i need for him? any advises on Tactis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Korucust has low HPs.  Doesn't flurry but does enrage.  Is slowable but I'm pretty sure he mitigates.  He has two AoEs.  One is disease based and one magic based.  One is is a spell slow+dot the other is a mana drain+dot.  Both are considered curses and if both land they will eat up your raid force pretty quickly (Over 500+ a tic if both are on you).  Bard songs are really great for resisting it but I've done him without the benefits of a bard.<br />
<br />
One of the nifty things about Korucust is that he shapeshifts three or four (I think it's four, but not sure now) times during the fight.  He shapeshifts once around 80 to 70%, to whoever has agro at the time of the shift.  Always interesting to see this big nasty, ugly sarnak (He does have his own unique model which is very wicked, imo.) suddenly morph into a shrunk Troll wielding a GBoS and a PoI hammer.  The other two shifts happen much lower around 50 and 30 to 20% I think.  Then around 10% he shifts back to his normal form.  The other two shifts seem to be totally random.  I've seen him change into anything from a SG siren model, to a mage earth pet, to a brown bear, and more.  Since he shapeshifts we did him in the center of the floor above the steps.  Since corner tanking might lead to problems when he shapeshifts form.  Make sure people know to expect the shapeshifts and to not be surprised by them.<br />
<br />
About the AoEs, one AoE is totally blocked by being downstairs on the level below where the your melee should be fighting at (I believe the spell slow one, again I can't recall exactly).  The other will still be able to land, unfortunately.  We just normally went for killing him quick and then curing all the curses fast after Korucust was dead.  One MGB of Paragon and patch heals was generally enough to keep everyone up.  Especially with bard songs.  He also seems to have a 1k+ nuke/lifetap that is either a proc or spell.  I know it hit me at least once.  I normally did not tank much so I'm not too sure on this.  His DPS output once slowed isn't very much at all.<br />
<br />
Up to Korucust in his room are 6guards.  Every single one is surprisingly single pullable even the ones directly next to Korucust.  I pet pulled the first couple of times just to be safe because the guards are so close to him but when I grew more bold and just agroed them they each came easily single.  Makes pulling and set up very easy.<br />
<br />
In summary, have bard resists, slow him fast, keep up everyone with a mass heal if needed, kill him quick and then cure up the curses.  I think the least we ever did him with was around 25 or so.  Nothing better than BoT/low end Ssra gear.  I'm sure he could be done with considerably less.  He's an easy mob that yields great loot for the progression level of people able to kill him.  He drops exactly 2 loots everytime and possibly one level 60 RoK era spell.<br />
<br />
On a side note, clearing to and killing Korucust is great +Chardok A faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a lot !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some of my friends and I tried to take him out about a month ago, and we got creamed. The MT was an EP level SK (not me, sadly), the rest of us ranged from level 55-65, in pre-VT armor, most being 65. There were only 12 of us, but we did manage to get him down to 45%. I think we could have killed him pretty well if we just had more healing power. We only had two clerics, if I recall, and one of them was level 56 I think. Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i Lead the first pickup raid against kor when the pocket zone just came on on TM. <br />
<br />
In that time i had about 6k hp buffed, so i was quite a bit more gimped then now. Also didnt have defensive ability's or max HT.<br />
<br />
He procs a 1k nuke, and procs it quite fast. His ae is seriously deadly to a unprepared raid *we didnt know what to expect* <br />
<br />
Also, it might be me, but the healers told me they healed me for much less then they should have...kinda like balance of zeb.<br />
<br />
His melee dps isnt huge. Just his ae's are inmensly messed up. Kill him quickly or be eaten, thats the best advice. Fight should not last more then 2 mins. Use SL instead of CH.</div></div><hr />
