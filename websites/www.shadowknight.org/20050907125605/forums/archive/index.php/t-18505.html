New to the boards..<br />

<br />

<br />
All other handicaps/differences will even out in the end game, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Also, read the rest of this board. Just about every topic on Race Discussion deals with this question to some degree, with a similar answer in every case.</div></div><hr />

Not matter how many times we tell you this you will find this out in your own way. I suggest hitting Iksar. Why? Well, it may be a little tougher in the beginning BUT once you hit about 20 or so thats when you start getting up there. The armor penalty isn't THAT big of a deal and you will only REALLY REALLY notice your experiance penalty in Dreadlands if you go there. You will want to pull your eyes out of your face for about three weeks but you'll get through it, bud. And remember to Roleplay! =)</div></div><hr />

If you're not playing a toon you think is cool you'll never make it there.<br />
Iksar is cool and more unique than DE, but DE is popular for a reason, people like it.<br />
Choose what you think you can get into and never look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard one to say.  My iksar sk is my main and don't let anyone tell you that armor isn't a big deal to find.  If you don't have someone feeding your toon cash you will spend alot of time farming for pp.  At 55 I just got rid of a velium geode bracer, ac 5 sta 9 dex 9 for a silver chitin wristband.  LDoN dungeons help out with armor at pretty cheap ap prices.  150 for some nice stuff in MM.  But without being guilded you might have some problems with getting armor.  I stopped leveling at 55 just so I could work on aa and farm pp and have only now started leveling again.  My ac is now mid 1100 and just over 3khp at mid 55.  And that is actually not very good compared to most knights I see at my level.  Remember groups will want you as MT because you can hold aggro so you will be getting beat on alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHA Bastard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have two SKs one Troll for those times I want to be left alone, because what female really plays a troll? And the Dark Elf... Because Dark Elves just have a certain look to them they truely are the better race.<br />
<br />
<br />
(And, for the record, the Dark Elf was twinked, and the troll played in what ever gear dropped off what ever mob... Less down time, quicker kills, and leveled faster because of it. even holding a *short sword.  Could be the same for the lizard. Shouldn't let people choose what race would be best for you...Just go with what will work best with your play style.)</div></div><hr />

 DE's are a bunch of panty-wearing pillow biters.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Leave my pillow outta this!<br />
<br />
And I like panties, thank you very much, the black lacy kind ride up while fighting, which makes me fight even harder and faster just to unwedge them.</div></div><hr />
