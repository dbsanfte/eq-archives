<br />
A skilled fighter with a shield can simply avoid being hit if they want to concentrate on defensive positioning and proper reactions to feignts and body movements.<br />
<br />
A parry modifier would make alot of sense :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The way shields are coded right now, they're an offhand weapon that can't be hasted and has no auto attack.  Thats all.  They have severe limitations on the damage cap and zero aggro generation.  They should remain unhasteable/activated only but the damage cap needs removed and the ac bonus needs to provide more than just the ac thats listed (check my shield aa suggestions in the aa thread)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think they should do this to shields:<br />
1)  Immune to riposte when held.<br />
2)  For dual wielders it should be considered an offhand weapon with DMG/Delay just like all other weapons.  Dmg should scale with AC and delay should be fixed with all shields.<br />
<br />
edit:  Brael, I like that idea you mentioned on shields, along with other stuffs.  wishful thinking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And let haste affect the bash timer........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's a thought I can get behind.  Letting Haste affect the bash timer.  Haste affects bows.  <br />
<br />
Haste, a parry modifier, the removal of the damage cap, and the addition of the ability to block would make shields much more useful to the full range of classes that can equip shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm, I've never tested it but I'm sure I bash faster with haste, and slower when fighting mobs with AE slows for example.<br />
<br />
Be nice if knights gained some ability to increase the damage on bash... maybe increase the limiter on it by 15 per 3aa level of a new skill?<br />
<br />
Still like to see those upgrades they mentioned a while ago too, innate block etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bash shouldn't be affected haste.  If you give it haste it becomes too good without lowering its potential damage (remember it's not supposed to do great damage compared to dual weild).  Once again for those who haven't seen it.  If you want to make shields viable do this.<br />
<br />
Shield Mastery: <br />
Three Levels. Gives you a shielding mod equivalent to the shields AC/10 while wearing a shield at level 1. Gives you an increase to your parry skill equal to the shields AC at level two. Gives Parry the success rate of Block and a 2nd success check if the first parry check fails at level three. Also for Warriors only add half the AC of the shield to the damage bonus of their main hand weapon at level 1 of the ability. War/Shd/Pal. <br />
<br />
Strengthened Bash: <br />
Increases the damage bash can do while having a shield equipped. Three levels of the AA each removes the cap by 1/3, so for example if you have a 55 AC shield with no AA your bash uses 25 AC for damage check, with level 1 1/3 of that ac over the cap would be added giving you 35 AC for damage check (10 or 1/3), level 2 would be 45 AC (20 or 2/3), and level 3 would allow you the full AC of the shield for damage. War/Pal/Shd only, prereq of shield mastery level 3 for knights, no prereq for Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OOO i like!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Strengthened Bash idea was pretty much exactly what i meant :)<br />
<br />
Only downside is the amount of damage it could then do... with Shield of Strife for example you'd be bashing with an 85 damage weapon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">true that..........we don't want a massive change from all tanks using shields. 2 handers gotta remain another option. i currently use a skull shield like 23 ac but excellent mr resists and stamina and dex bonus to augment my procs. i hit a bash on average around 50-60ish or in the 100s for crits.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind shields AT LEAST getting their parry bonus at least. There is no way that mob is gonna hit a SK with a shield the same amount or as often as one with a 2 hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Since warriors seem to be getting yet another increase to mitigation, imo when using shields knights should be moved up to warrior mitigation tables, after all when using a shield our melee dps is just crappy, and warriors still have their cheezy disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RandomKayan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How about when a warrior actually wears a shield his /shield discipline lasts twice (or thrice or whatever) as long ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 60 delay that you can't haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But still...<br />
<br />
Max damage bash (without +bash dmg mods) is 124 with a 25+ac shield as far as I know.<br />
<br />
If 25=124 max.  Double it = 50 doing 248 max...<br />
Another 25 = 75, doing 372 max... and that's still 10ac under Shield of Strife, and remember theres a +30ac aug around...<br />
<br />
Not saying I'd mind being able to bash for 400+... I just doubt it'll happen.<br />
<br />
P.S. My maths is horrible so if that working out is incorrect, please correct me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How long until you have a 1h weapon that hits harder than a shield (25+ damage 1h)?  GEA is it.  124 is a crit correct?  its still 60 delay, divide that number by 10 for dps.  It's doing 1/8 the damage of mainhand, while adding a respectable amount of aggro and actually scaling up instead of being gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nope 124 is the max non-crit bash while using a shield.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried to work it out (dunno the formulas for working out dps etc) but assuming you bashed for around 400 (don't know what the exact value would be assuming the cap was removed) at 60 delay... would be decent dps.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to work it out... ~400 max hit, 60 delay, without any haste calcs =p<br />
<br />
(Taking shield of strife as the example here since it's the best shield available currently).<br />
<br />
Still I'd like to see something like that go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">True, that would be a bit high.  But not all that high, because its not going to hit for 400 every single time, factor in that 50% miss rate and mob mitigation, you would be averaging 130 or so per bash, thats a bit under 22 dps (13 dps increase from now).  Can't find anything showing the dps of an EoE or Hammer offhand for a Warrior, the goal was to be about half of offhand dps though with decent aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm thinking of it from that angle - as long as the DPS was less than an equal-level offhand weapon, it would work just fine.<br />
<br />
Example, as long as Shield of Strife couldn't do similar dps to EoE or Hammer of the Timeweaver etc etc, it'd be well balanced.<br />
<br />
On another thought: What about a Knight AA skill that for a duration lowers our dps but increases Parry rate by say 50-75% bonus (maybe less if that was way overbalanced).  Kind of like the &quot;Defense&quot; position that Footmen in Warcraft 3 can use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like that AA idea.  Increase the Parry % and perhaps include a boost to the Block %.  However, I think it would end up being an Archetype skill, but perhaps adding a Knight class skill that would decrease the bash timer.  That way, they make shields more useful to all the melees as well as giving us Knights something that would balance us up with the dual wielders as far as dps is concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Isn't parrying difficult with a shield?  I'd say a shield would have more chance of blocking an attack rather than parrying it.  Just a question of vocab - I could be wrong.<br />
Maybe give shields the ability to block line of sight spells, or even rain spells (yes, you can hold a shield over your head!).<br />
Maybe bash skill should reduce the bash timer, since you're obviously more skilled at bashing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well it depends on the shield if you're talking realistically...<br />
<br />
With a tiny shield like a Buckler, it's lightweight and sits on your forearm, so you could easily swing it around to parry blows.  On the other hand, a Tower shield provides better defense against arrows for example, since it's huge, but you can't move it to parry as easily.<br />
<br />
In EQ you're limited, you don't get the choice of what size shield you want... there's no &quot;Basalt Buckler&quot; or &quot;Tower Shield of Strife&quot; etc.  The shield is what it is, like it or not.<br />
<br />
An AA like the one I suggested would basically just mean you shift your fighting style so you're aiming more to block the enemies attacks with your shield instead of hit them.  Hiding behind a Tower shield or parrying with a buckler, either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I want a shield chance block a la Daoc, that would make me consider using a shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever fought with these shields?<br />
<br />
From personal experience, NOTHING is as protective as a tower shield. When i go full defensive when sparring with a tower shield/sword combo, the enemy needs to open himself a LOT to your attacks if he wants to get past your tower shield. Saying you cannot use it to parry is ridicalous. When you are fighting someone, you can EASILY use your shield to avoid his sword strikes. Using your arm to shift it left, or up dramatically increases your defense. Your right side is protected by your sword arm, and gives you the option to parry. You can simply turn to meet your attacker when he tries to manouver past you. <br />
<br />
*nothing* is as defensive as a tower shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That's true, but equally with a tower shield you're not as mobile.  It's the difference between &quot;parrying&quot; and &quot;blocking&quot; ... with a Tower shield you're blocking, with a buckler you're parrying.<br />
<br />
(If I remember right, a full Parry is where you deflect the enemies weapon using either your sword or shield, attempting to open them up to attack, whereas a block is simply to stop their weapon from hitting you).<br />
<br />
I agree about a Tower shield being the best defense-wise though.  What I'm saying is that a knight who wants to fight more on the offensive side would use a smaller shield so they could attack more, where a knight who wanted to go all-out defensive would use a bigger shield.  Unfortunately in EQ any size of sheild gives the same benefit (other than stats).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Shield Bash cannot be allowed to do more than mildly increased damage in the hands of knights.  Our one-hander ratios is the way it is to help make up for our lack of dual-wield.  Incease Bash damage, and the reasons to use a 2hander fall away VERY rapidly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">1 handers do shit damage compared to 2 handers at the moment though, regardless of their high ratios.<br />
<br />
Low damage bonus means they're crap on anything with any ac at all.  Couple 2 handed aa's, and they aren't even close.  They'd have to make bash do a TON of damage to come close to challenging 2 hander dps.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't think 1hs+shield should be about damage, it should be about the protection a shield offers... and currently it does nothing to improve protection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm surprised that none of you mentioned about wishing to increase bash skill of 200 to 240 or 250. That is what I *REALLY* want to see that it happens. Why rangers archery cap at 240 instead of 200 and warrior archery cap at 250 while we get bash cap of 200 vs warriors bash of 240 or 250 I can't remember.. <br />
<br />
I know that rangers *WANT* to increase archery cap to 250. Let them have it and we should get bash cap increased to 250 from 200 cuz we spent time to master shields over time cuz we can't dual wield. :)<br />
<br />
My wishlist:<br />
1. Increase bash cap (that would lead to interrupt casters better cuz increased hit rate)<br />
2. Brael's suggestions<br />
3. Riposte immunity.<br />
4. Add modifer to all shields such as parry.<br />
<br />
My real wish is to see real improvement in defense side for using shield while maintaining current dps. Basically, if you want more dps, switch to 2h.. If you need more defense, switch to 1h/shield. <br />
<br />
Right now, 1h/shield combo is FLAWED!! You get little more damage intake by simply using 1h/shield while tanking than using 2h due to increased ripostes AND you get reduced dps to boot. To fix that, add riposte immunity *WILL* make you to reduce some more damage done to you by using shield instead of 2h. <br />
<br />
I am pro 1h/shield knight since EQ's release and STILL using 1h/shield due to RP character set-up that I already determined to design before EQ came. I had passed on rolls on all 2h so far so they can go to my guildie knights cuz they all use 2h. They are after power and there are plenty of aaxps and 2h loot available to them while there are NO aaxps for 1h/shield combo. It pisses me off and it even disappoints me even more when I don't see a damn thing about 1h/shield combo for aaxps in coming expansion. :(<br />
<br />
I wondered about weapon affinity? I hope it would be similar to D&amp;D 4th edition about weapon speciality. It would be great if we could specialize in weapon or any combo that we chose and it will reflect our true character. For example, if I decide to specialize in 1hs/shield combo, I would be very good at it than other knight who specialize in 2h. If  shield or 1hs dropped, it should go to me than that other knight cuz he would never get good at it cuz he would be stuck to 2h for rest of his life cuz he chose to specialize in it in first place. I am more than ready to be stuck to 1h/shield for rest of my life but, in exchange, I should be able to specialize in it to improve it further than normal knights could. <br />
<br />
Same for Drizzt, he specialize in scimitars; therefore, he's hot damn skilled in scimitars than any other weapon types period and he would continue using scimitars for rest of his life cuz he chose to specialize in scimitars long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I like the ideas for making shields more useful, but I have to disagree with the Riposte immunity.<br />
<br />
How about a blocking % for possible incoming ripostes, not a 100% immunity to ripostes. The later seems unrealistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I wondered about weapon affinity?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, from what I've heard, Weapon Affinity is a new disc for pure melee's which increases their proc rate for 24ish seconds... =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In addition to Nocifer's and Brael's list of suggestions, perhaps an Innate mitigation advantage similar to warrior's 5% innate would make a lot of sense.  It would be a great AA .  Maybe like 2/5/10% innate Damage Interval modifier (on the classical 2/4/6AA scheme) when shield is equipped.  Most SK's are already sacrificing more than 10% DPS when 1 hander is equipped.<br />
<br />
As for dual wielders, either add part of the AC bonus on shields onto mainhand wpn damage, or make a shield an actual secondary hand weapon with independent damage/delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Give me an added ability to block shots with the shield based on Parry, with a %modifier = shield AC.<br />
 <br />
So say I have an AC 25 shield. I now have 125% my normal Parry. Have this bonus ignore normal caps.<br />
<br />
Take the frickin cap off of Bash damage too. It's an unhasteable offhand weapon in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">another viewpoint on shields...my idea<br />
<br />
I want a quest to get a shield augment...at the moment I will call it Shield Spikes.<br />
<br />
This augment would attach to any shield and would do something like the following...<br />
<br />
1) Increase Bash Damage by 5<br />
2) Increase AC by 10<br />
3) Add +2 to damage shield<br />
4) Be available for SKs and Pallies<br />
<br />
You can make the numbers greater by developing a AA for improved spikes.<br />
