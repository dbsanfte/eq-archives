<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miinin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys just wanted some feedback on where to head w/ 55 SK and 65 Cleric, finding it tough with no slow, Have tried PoN, PoD, PoI, just takes too damn long to kill shit. Have also tried some Kunark zones and old world but the exp just isnt flowing fast enough for my taste. Any suggestion would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Droyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you have the healing power and simply are lacking with DPS.<br />
<br />
Have the cleric cast his pet for a little extra damage and to spice things up have the cleric try to keep the pet alive for multiple fights (the trick is that the cleric has to get hit by the second mob while you're still killing the first one).  Make sure the cleric has kei and have him/her use nukes when there's a surplus of mana.  At 65 that cleric could have his last proccing hammer.  With Yaulp and standing mana regen that cleric's DPS will really show.<br />
<br />
Use your pet with the pet buff to raise its DPS a little.  Get kei and cast spears and dots to raise your DPS.  Finally there's the whole issue of getting AAs versus getting levels.  If it were me I'd get level 65 to max your tanking and damage output abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a couple of notes.<br />
<br />
1 - Cleric pet is bugged, if its cast on non-greens it poofs.  Generally a good idea.  More DPS however, cast MoR on the mobs as unslowed they will actually do a lot of damage to themselves.<br />
<br />
2 - For 2 boxing I have a 61SK/61Cleric, up till 60ish both the zoneline of Veksar and the hidden zoneline (temple) of Nadox are not horrible xp.<br />
<br />
3 - From a DPS standpoint, I agree a pets the thing.  I generally don't get KEI as I use Mental Corruption and a Soul Defiler.  Spears and Dots are the most mana efficient DPS.  You should be able to have your cleric melee as well.<br />
<br />
Now that I have hit 61, I think the days of 2 boxing with my cleric are over.  If I find someplace to hunt I will post it.<br />

You can try burning that Nebraska Univ. stuff you got laying around the house and pick up some 'Sooner' gear. No telling how much of an xp gain you will get just getting rid of that stuff =p.<br />
<br />
Seriously, we need to try Droga. I think if we hit the Casters hard and keep those SOB's from gating and snare the non casting mobs we will be ok. Great exp down there. Some good loot as well.</div></div><hr />
