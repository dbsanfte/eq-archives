<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoganHex</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all.<br />
<br />
I am starting this thread for faction advice. I have read the other threads here and they have all told me what I have already read elsewhere. I know what to kill to gain faction (goblins, sarnaks and explorers for Legion of Cabilis and outcast Iksar for Legion of Cabilis and Brood of Kotiz). I know what to hand in for better faction hits (explorer knives and bone chips).<br />
<br />
Here is my problem. I have spent the last four days in the Lake of Ill Omen killing explorers (I am level thirty). I now have over one hundred knives but still cannot do the turn ins because I am conning at scowling.<br />
<br />
My question is how long should getting to dubious with the Troopers take? Almost all of my positive faction hits have come off of the explorers (I take a hit here and there off of the occassional wandering goblin and sarnak). Should I try killing something else? Perhaps the explorer hits are just not that high?<br />
<br />
I guess what I am really asking for is someone to tell me that there is in fact light at the end of the tunnel. I do not mind spending a ton of hours working on my faction so long as I know it is not going to take me months to get into Cabilis.<br />
<br />
So are there any strategies out there?<br />
<br />
I have recently thought about hiring an enchanter to cast the Iksar illusion spell on me in the hopes that this would bring me to dubious so I could do the turn ins. I am already a follower of Cazic-Thule (erudite shadow knight here) which I thought would make this easier but I guess not. Do you think that trick would work?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated (especially from those who have done the faction work already). <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It took me 4 stacks of explorers to get to dubiously and then I turned them in and fot amiable. This is how I did it. Buy 3 steel weapons like Ch'Nak or something. they have wierd names like that and there is a iksar at the end of the lake who is indiff to all and gives you faction for turning in 3. Its about 200pp for all 3 to buy off venders i didnt try bazaar. You get a huge faction hit and its great. You get eh steel weapons in Veksar but you aint ready for that yet =P<br />
<br />
   Thats what I did. I havnt played Kug in awhile because of school but I am still amiable to guards and threatening to everyone else so I am on the right track here. When I decide to get back on I'll be sure to check bazaar cuz th cheaper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabbuk</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest way to get the faction started is to kill sarnak in OT.  This'll accomplish a few different things.<br />
<br />
1, you'll get xp.  Woohoo.<br />
<br />
2, You'll get braids to turn in for VS faction to get the Gate Hammer (not sure if Erudites can do this or not, you'll have to check that).<br />
<br />
3, You'll get good warrior guild faction in killing sarnak.  Once you've gotten yourself non-kos, THEN do the explorer knives.  With 100 knives, you've likely got enough now to make a giant dent in factions.<br />
<br />
Also, you might wanna take a look into killing in Warsliks Woods- it's been awhile, but I'm pretty sure you get warrior guild faction on the forsaken iksar there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunawhite</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're CT-worshipping erudite SK, no faction work needed.<br />
When you use iksar illusion potion or get a project illusion from chanter, your faction goes right up to amiable with SK guild and indifferent with necro/shamman guild. So you don't need to do the boring faction work. I did all the turn-ins in this way. It works. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrMobius</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree and disagree with Jabbuk.  Killing Sarnak's in OT is good for the war braids so you can get in the outpost for the hammer, BUT this can be done later.  I am a DE SK, I got from really bad Cab faction to starting the quests in a week, here's how:<br />
<br />
1.  Kill the Sarnak's in the Sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen.  I was 34 when I did this, I would have gotten stomped so I brought along my friend who was a 53 Pally.  We were grouped so I wasn't getting XP, but faction came quickly.  In order to complete the Greenmist you need the mirror from Howling Stones...to get that you need the key...to get that you'll need the Jade Chodakai prod from Chancellor Of Di`Zok who happens to be in the Sarnak fort.  The Weaponmaster who drops the hammer of 1406 (also needed for Greenmist) hangs out in this fort too, so you're killing three birds with one stone, so to speak.  After clearing the Sarnak fort about 6 times, including the chancellor and weaponmaster, my faction with the Guard who you turn the knifes in to (on Legion of Cab faction) was at dubious.<br />
<br />
2.  Turn in ~100 explorer knifes to that lone Guard in Lake of Ill Omen.  This got Legion of Cabilis to Amiable.<br />
<br />
3.  Head to Kurns and buy bone chips off the newbies there for 2 - 5pp a stack, massive genocide of skeletons.  2500 chips later my Crusader faction was at dubious.  A note on the crusaders, there's a crusader named crusader d-something who's faction is one higher than the other crusaders.  When you con him he'll show as dubious when the others are still threatingly...make sure you con all of them to be safe.  Also, you'll want to turn in chips as fast as possible and hang towards the corner so if a crusader creeps out he won't attack you (hopefully).  ;)<br />
<br />
4.  Invis yourself and run through the goblin caves from Lake of Ill Omen to zone into Warsliks Woods.  You'll be in the tunnels with the outcast Iksars, kill kill kill!  This is the most tedious part, getting the Brood of Ko`tiz (necro faction) up to dubious.  I cleared these tunnels probably about 100 times, maybe more.  I spent about 4 hours a day for 3 days.<br />
<br />
After doing all that you should be able to start the quests.  Should take a week of 4 hours a day + 10 hours on Sat &amp; Sun.  Pain in the butt, but having the newbie Iksars stare and follow you around Cabilis confused is worth it.  :D</div></div><hr />

LOL - That is how I felt as an Iksar Shadow Knight when I got both my factions with Grobb and Firiona Vie up so I could walk around those cities...freaked people out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoganHex</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies everyone.<br />
<br />
I have discovered a few things and have a couple of further questions that I would like to ask.<br />
<br />
First of all wolf form most definitely does not affect faction with the Iksar. Tried that out this afternoon to no avail.<br />
<br />
Feign death is also worthless as far as the turn in is concerned. I know another poster already mentioned that but I was hoping that perhaps Trooper Vaurk may have just been bugged in his case. He was not. The Trooper will tell you that he is busy if you try to do the turn in while feigning.<br />
<br />
I spoke with a high level enchanter this afternoon pertaining to projectile illusions. This is what he told me. Only certain illusions can be projected and apparently Iksar is not one of them. I am unable to confirm this but that is what I was told.<br />
<br />
Now on to the questions.<br />
<br />
About the Overthere. Oddly enough I can walk right into the Outpost without a problem. I have never done any faction work there but am dubious at worst to some of the Outpost and apprehensive to most.<br />
<br />
About the hammer. Who gives the quest? Is the hammer itself a decent weapon or is it only useful for processing? At what faction level do you have to be to do the quest?<br />
<br />
About the Iksar tunnels in Warsliks Woods. Any idea what the location to the tunnel entrance is?<br />
<br />
About the Veksar turn ins. Any idea what the exact name of the weapons are (difficult to find them in the bazaar without the name). Who do you turn them into and where is he located?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of the information you have given me so far and thanks in advance for any follow ups.<br />
<br />
In addition if any of you are on Maelin Starpyre and would be willing to assist me in gaining faction I would be willing to pay for your services. I would be looking for a higher level character who could just annihilate everything in either the Sarnak fortress or the Iksar tunnel. I would just want to group with you for the faction hits. At level thirty I do not really have a lot of cash but I could pay one hundred platinum pieces for every hour of work you are willing to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrMobius</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Iksar tunnel is the tunnel you take to zone into Lake of Ill Omen. <br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/warslikswoodsmap.html = Location B<br />
The mobs here are level 18 or so, killed easily solo at 30.  You'll need help for the Sarnak fortress, but not here.<br />
<br />
Here's a cheesy illustration (done while on the phone at work :p) that shows the best path to clear the Iksar tunnels:<br />
http://www.drmobius.com/images/map.jpg<br />
Start at the green dot and follow the dark blue line all the way around back to the camp, then follow the light blue line up, around, and bafk to the camp.  The mobs are static spawns except for one wonderer who you'll usually find along the light blue path.  Once you kill the fist mob glance at the clock, they respawn exactly 12 minutes later.  If you follow that path it should only take about 4 minutes to clear the tunnel, so camp on the green dot for the remaining 8 minutes.  Soon as the first one pops kill it and follow the same path again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunawhite</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, read my post above. You really don't need to do all the faction hunting. Just buy some iksar illusion potion in bazaar or take a high lvl chanter who has project illusion AA* with you. (I took my friend's chanter with me)<br />
<br />
It seems that the combination of your deity to Cazic-Thule and your form of iksar (illusioned) make them to think you not different to themselves. <br />
I DID all the hand ins, walked around in east/west Cabilis and used bank and vendors. I never did any faction work of course but had no problem with this simple illusion.<br />
<br />
Chanters are still kos to some of them even with illusion cause they're not worshiping CT that's the difference.<br />
<br />
One bad thing of this trick is that you need illusion everytime you meet a quest NPC including the tracker in FV, enslaved iksar in FM, the alchemist in OT etc. So you'll need at least 9 illusion potion if you plan well (100pp each on my server) or a good chanter who is willing to help you all the way around. :)<br />
<br />
*Project illusion AA :  with this ability, a chanter can project all his self-only illusions to group member.<br />

<br />
Illusions will only fix your RACIAL faction. That is, if your God is hated among the race you're trying to infiltrate, then you will still be KoS.<br />
<br />
 This is why an evil Erudite can Illusion to an Iksar and infiltrate Cabilis unharmed, amiable, at that, and also why an Iksar can do the same to Paineel if he's turned into an Erudite -- They both follow Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
Other than that I don't know much about faction, since all I play is Iksar anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabbuk</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer the question about the OT hammer, it's a MUST have for any SK.<br />
<br />
The hammer is worthless as a weapon, not only because of very very shitty stats but because of the proc.  When you equip the hammer and proc, you are ported to the Outpost in OT.  Very useful for getting out of raids, annoying far away zones, an emergency port when you're about to die (although you better have made some big offereings to the luck gods here...), and if you are in a PoP encounter where an NPC ports you (a la PoN Maze event) and it's bugged, you can /duel a gate class caster and port yourself.<br />
<br />
To do the quest you must be Amiable faction (if memory serves) with the Venril Sathir faction of OT outpost.  Simply turn in the braids to Rottgrime to raise the faction, 4 at a time.  Then, once you're high enough faction take a single Jade over to 'An Undead Foreman' by the beached ships in the Outpost and give it to him.  He'll give you the hammer.  You can then proceed to screw up your VS faction, just understand you'll be KoS in Outpost and have to run pretty fast when you gate.</div></div><hr />

How do YOU accomplish this you ask? Oh its quite easy, just hunt in Karnor's for levels 45-49 yup that does it real good. Looks like I got some work to do...at least I'm still dubious and I can kill the sarnaks and still hand them in....I hope</div></div><hr />

Just a question on how you do it. It seems to me like if you have some half and someone has something you need and you hand it in at the same time you get the stuff right? Is that how it works?</div></div><hr />

I went to con Trooper Vaurk just a moment ago and he was glaring at me threateningly. I could have sworn that before he was scowling at me and ready to attack. Have a managed to raise my faction just a bit or are the two synonymous with each other?</div></div><hr />
