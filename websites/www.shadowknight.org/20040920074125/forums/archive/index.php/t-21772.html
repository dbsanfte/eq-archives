<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, looking at this class thing a different way today. (someday you guys are going to ban me for coming up with goofy ideas but...). I am looking at the hybrid classes (Ranger, Beastlord, Paladin, Shadowknight) and determining what are the defining characteristics of that class.<br />
<br />
I will leave out heals since all 4 classes can heal (the arguement of how well they are balanced can be argued somewhere else).<br />
<br />
Also, I am leaving out buffs since we all have some kind of buff (brells, cloacks, Tunare, vigor). Again we can argue some are better then others, but we all get some.<br />
<br />
Finally, I am looking at this post level 55 since we lose fear at that point and paladins loose lull abilities and leaving out disciplines.<br />
<br />
Also, 2 hybrids are tank classes (Paladin, Shadowknight) and two are DPS (Beastlord, Ranger)<br />
<br />
Rangers - Tracking, Archery<br />
Beastlords - Slow, Powerful pet<br />
Paladins - Stun, ??<br />
Shadowknights - Auras (kinda) , ??<br />
<br />
It appears to me that the knight classes are lacking in characteristics that define their class. While the Paladin Stun if a very powerful tool, they only have one characteristic, and shadowknights have none.<br />
<br />
So what should a defining characteristic of shadowknights be?  I thought we were supposed to be the feared dark lords of pain? were we not? How about we expand upon this.<br />
<br />
We have an aura of pain (AC tap)  and an aura of hate ( Attack Tap) which drain approx 100+ points from either stat and last about 1 minute. (I know my numbers are not exact). Also we have a terror line (seems dumb to me that we have spells that incite hate but do nothing else).<br />
<br />
I was thinking maybe an overhaul to our aura's. Also, while thinking about this  I was contemplating our ability to tank better. What if we Made our Aura of Pain Tap somewhere around 300 AC and gave us 200. Make our Aura of Hate Tap around 300 Attack and give us 200? Also, ditch the the terror line of spells and add a heavy aggro modifier to our auras?<br />
<br />
This would incite pain and hate into our enemies, drain them of their &quot;lifeforce&quot; and give it to the dark knight, improve our tanking / DPS abilities a little better, and reduce the power of the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I am supposed to be mowing the lawn right now so discuss. Good idea or just dumb?</div></div><hr />

Auras dont drain shit~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">palidins are stuns and group heals<br />
<br />
shadowknights were agro at all costs and lifetaps.<br />
<br />
<br />
auras make us some kinda bard hybrid --- no thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kalendrox, if you don't want to contribute to a discussion, simply SKIP IT. No need to throw around pointless insults just because your feeling like it. After all, that's what the rant forum is for.<br />
<br />
And: Atleast Croaakk IS thinking about class balance, and sharing his thoughts. If you have such great and perfect ideas, post them here and explain why yours are just sooo amazing ... or just not reply to this thread at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Croaakk: I don't play high-end stuff, but from what I've seen, aggro and AC aren't really considered to be the main problems. The problems are that<br />
<br />
a) SKs don't have a insta-mini-defensive version<br />
b) SKs and Pallies can't tank the high-end stuff that they are supposed to / want to, because only Warriors can do it (most of the time)<br />
<br />
Not going to go deeper into this kind of discussion, as I am nowhere near where those problems are, but since aggro control is no longer our main role, we really need a new &quot;uniqueness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Auras dont drain shit~ <br />
<br />
Maybe they should. Maybe they should be stackable as well. Tapping down a boss mob of AC and Attack might make us raid useful. /shrug<br />
<br />
Or maybe don't make em stack. Give us 3 taps. One that does avoidance, one that does mitigation, and one that does attack. Something that taps a significant and noticeable amount. Short duration like we have now, non cascading tho. Hell make em powerful enough that they need to share the same recast timer. This might even encourage multiple SKs on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe zzo and then hear the other classes bitch about sk's taking their debuff slots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is why it would have to be a significant tap ;)<br />
<br />
Something that says, the SKs have arrived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Characteristics of hybrids (although the entire concept of considering a class a hybrid is flawed at this point, archetypes for classes need changed from melee/hybrid to tank/dps desperatley), atleast this is what they should be, not what they currently are.<br />
<br />
Offensive hybrids:<br />
Rangers - Moderate non spell ranged damage, Above baseline melee damage, Tracking, Druid utility, poor tanking.<br />
Beastlords - Above baseline melee damage, best pets, slow, slightly below Shaman utility, poor tanking.<br />
<br />
Defensive hybrids:<br />
Paladins - Strong tanking ability, mob posistioning, emergency heals, the ability to almost guarantee mob interrupts, below baseline melee damage (slightly above on undead), Cleric type utility.<br />
Shadowknights - Strong tanking ability, below baseline melee damage, pulling, capable burst damage, slightly below Necro type utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hybrids also = deathtouch bitches as well. Used to be the ranger's job. SK's fill that role now.</div></div><hr />

Mobs still death touch?~ Other than Shei Vintas (and possibly some ssra or Vt shit I skipped) i dont think anything past kunark death touches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stuff in GoD &quot;death touches.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Commonly known as &quot;a good round&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think I did not do a very good job expressing why dream when I posted this, and I was thinking about aggro and auras when I did...<br />
<br />
My issue...<br />
1) Terror spells...it seems dumb to me that terror spells generate aggro but do nothing else. No Stun, No Damage, no buff/ debuff, etc<br />
<br />
2) Auras - I like the idea of auras and sucking power out of my opponent. Also, where I hunt they are &quot;fairly&quot; effective but are not that impressive for those of you who hunt in the higher level zones.<br />
<br />
...wouldn't it be cool if they combined them and increased the value of the aura?<br />
<br />
1) Include the hate modifier into the aura spell. That way I don't need to have another spell memmed just for aggro. Plus I could finally retire Clinging Darkness or my old Fear spell.<br />
<br />
2) Our Auras (new aggro spells) could do something besides just generate hate. They would debuff/ buff.<br />
<br />
So increase the hate generated on our aura's and make them a little more effective. Just throwing out random numbers, I am sure they should be &quot;tweaked&quot;<br />
<br />
Aura of Pain<br />
600 Hate<br />
Debuff 300 AC<br />
Buff 150 AC<br />
<br />
Aura of Hate<br />
800 Hate<br />
Debuff 300 Attack<br />
Buff 150 Attack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Debuffs from same line of spells do not stack. Inroducing debuff component to auras you risking that some SKs would not be able to get recourse running on raid because of &quot;spell did not take hold&quot; problem.<br />
<br />
I prefer to make aggro only when I need to make aggro. Instead of combining terrors with auras I'd rather combine all auras in one that uses only one spell slot and only one buff slot. That way I would have one spell that make aggro when I need to make aggro and one spell that tap stats when I need to tap stats. Much better alternative to four or five of our spells that tap various stats atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Problem with that, most of our taps are group taps.  Many times casting Aura of Hate for example is bad because you don't want to cost your entire group a buff slot, if buffing yourself with AC starts getting them atk when they dont need it, that can be detrimental.  Costing your group a buff slot for you to tank better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I do NOT want aura of pain to become a group spell in any shape or form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ayeshala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't think in terms of characteristics or abilities; think in term of what role the class should fill and once that is done everything will come together very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Currently there are three key roles in EQ - Tank, Healer and Slower, and one less crucial - Crowd Control. Rest of classes have optional roles of DPS or Mana Battery.<br />
SKs are tanks. Only problem that SKs are third rate tanks atm.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for tap recourse problem, that's problem of design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Your forgot &quot;charmer&quot; which in gates most people (on fennin anyway) wont go without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What if they upgrade our group taps, and had a seperate &quot;buff box&quot; that was for SK taps, kinda like the song box.  This way it wouldn't take up one of the 15 precious slots, of course the number of icons that would be allowed into that box would be limited.  <br />
<br />
While I like this idea, I also wanted to write the word &quot;box&quot; as many times as I could, without just writing box, box, box, over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd like that idea Utmost.  However, the chances of them actually doing something like that are about zip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, there are &quot;song box&quot;, which was originally intended for most, if not all, &quot;short duration&quot; buffs: bard songs, tap recourses, heals over time, you name it. For some funny reason it ended up being for thouse 18 sec duration songs only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">id really really love for those auras to be moved to the short duration buff box,  I am tired of getting Ninja Blih'd or some other corny shaman buff and getting tells from clerics cause i just used AoP and a hot wont land...</div></div><hr />
