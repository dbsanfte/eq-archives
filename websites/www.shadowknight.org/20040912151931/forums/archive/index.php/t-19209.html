Sounds easy, just need a click-stick cleric to clean up the corpses at the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Lhranc is definitely soloable, if you bind on top of him and bind rush HT him.  His regen is pathetic.  Probably only cost you 3, 4 deaths tops.<br />
<br />
Terror, in Fear, does not DT like the other two golems do.  Not sure if he's soloable or not though, it'd be tough.  Fear is definitely breakable solo and I'm sure you could clear enough solo to pull Terror.<br />
<br />
Never tried soloing in Hate, probably slow but doable.<br />
<br />
Sky should be doable.<br />
<br />
Stuff in the Hole should be soloable as well, but tough.<br />
<br />
You'd have to be extremely well geared and you'd almost definitely need outside buffs.  The time investment would be phenominal as well, since you'd be facing several hour solo plane clearings with low chance of epic drops.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I think it's Terror that doesn't DT.  Whichever of the 3 is the most northern one, does not DT.  Has a vox style cold AE instead.</div></div><hr />

I am lvl 55 atm with 39 AA and not looking to start epic till I 65 will probably have have maxed 55, 59, 61,62 AAs by then and since that probably an expansion or two away I think it will actually be pretty easy if it is even remotely possible now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlikely.  It would be a monumental effort for a full PoTime equiped 65th SK with ~200AA now.  The only chance you'd have of successfully soloing all steps of the epic, would be if you had absolutely no need for it.  Unless the next couple expansions introduce game breaking power increases, I don't think the term easy will every be used to describe soloing the SK epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lhranc...yeah, maybe bind zerging him, but expect numerous corpses/deaths.   People are reporting that after turn-in Lhranc is now red to 65.<br />
<br />
Fear...DT Golems, not to mention possible adds doing them.  Either that, or only killing the non-DT one, and hoping he drops it.  Then camping him again after he doesn't.<br />
<br />
Hours in Hate killing drakes...Hope you have a 2 box wiz for ports (to PoA, too) and cr's.<br />
<br />
Hell, even the Hole could be nasty.<br />
<br />
It's your $13 bucks a month.  Do what you want.  But soloing IC would probably be the definitative &quot;Everquest.&quot;<br />
<br />
To me, it seems as if trying to solo it would leave you looking like Gollum...obsessed and deformed, in search of your &quot;Precious.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've typed several responses.  I'll just be nice, and say good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's always been 70th, but he's still got under 32k HP, so definitely bind zergable.  Probably the easiest of all the hard mobs, since you can bind right on him.</div></div><hr />

I'll update you on terror next time i catch him up was plannin on trying to solo him heh i'll tell you how that goes.  As far as mummy and lhrac go...i'm not even going to atempt a solo lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No ones every completed soloing it, however I'm currently attempting it.  So far I've soloed a Blade of Abgoration, Soul Leech, and Decrepit Hide.  That gets most of the hard parts out of the way, beyond that it's just finding the mobs up.  Although beleive it or not my efforts have been halted recently due to the lack of epic using darkforge pieces in the bazaar, I may have to breakdown and just slaughter for those too.<br />
<br />
To be honest I'm glad I read this thread, suppose my RotD will have a use again, I can bind myself right on top of him and chain HT.  Since I'm max exp the deaths won't be a problem hopefully (it takes 17 unressed deaths in a row for me to hit 64).  Lhranc has been my main concern with it, I can just barely solo VS (only because of discipline changes) due to his insane regen, and no before you say it, it's regen not his lifetap that I mean.  I was assuming Lhranc would require more or less the same damage to kill but with his higher melee I wasn't sure I would be capable of doing it.  I suppose chain HT's would work although I view that as gimping the spawn, and that isn't my first choice of tactics to beat him.<br />

<br />
Half asleep right now, so I believe this was all referring to Terror.  First of all you're correct he is the one that doesn't DT instead he has a rather weak AE which is 400 damage and 1 slot dispell.  This is fairly easy to counter/resist so isn't a true concern.  The main problem is his resists, the only spells you can land on him are dr spells and Touch of Inno, this severely limits the amount of healing you can recieve (less of an issue with unlinked discs now). and cuts down on dps a bit as well.  The time commitment however is incorrect, for any SK capable of soloing Terror the mob's in fear are beyond trivial, and even if a Soul Leech doesn't drop you can get an iksar child for shaman epic which gets you enough plat to adequetly compensate you for the 90 minutes it took.  Watching newbie shaman zone in and try to reach my camp without dying is always fun though.  Also, when I did it, it was without outside buffs.<br />
<br />
One final comment, Lhranc was the highest level mob in the game up until Velious when Tunare was put in so I would believe he was always level 70, although I remember being told 75 before.</div></div><hr />

Second is soloable to, I've done it :)  Oh 3rd is a pain in the ass because of AE dispells, I did get myself a Dark Cloak of the Sky out of it though to make all the Rangers cry and no I cant click it.  Spirocs can be soloed to aside from the Lord.</div></div><hr />

HT zerg &gt; all.  <br />
<br />
What he hit for?  I believe the chardok ring and shammy 33 pts DS stack for 58 pts (62 with tunare belt?).  If he only has 32k can you match DPS with him?  <br />
<br />
Also is he undead?  lvl 59 disc and super HT and undead nuke gives a lot of healing even before taps.<br />
<br />
Full lvl 65 undead nuke line up is <br />
880+560+364=1804/30sec<br />
600+400+260+130=1390/45 sec<br />
<br />
over 1.5 min thats 4212+2780=6992*1.25=8740<br />
<br />
So if you can last 6min you win.  Hmm how often he summon?  Can you FD and pop back up every 30 sec?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He quads for 385 at an insanely low delay and procs an unresistable 500 DD on approximately every other swing.<br />
<br />
He's not undead and you wouldn't live 10 seconds... hell, I doubt I'd last 30.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My HT's were resisted from 50 to 100%.  Touch of Inny and Volt took.  Lhranc resisted 100% of my spears.<br />
<br />
A parse of my epic fight shows that Lhranc dished out between 225 and 434 DPS depending on whether I had aggro or not.  That's just DPS on me, others fighting where getting comparible DPS dished out to them also.<br />
<br />
It is a fun fight.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeap - I had one of teh main Time equipt Pallies on my server turn up to help me with the hand in - he made a HUGE joke of my asking him for help on a &quot;Kunark era mob - hah not even a Dragon&quot;<br />
<br />
Now we are talking a 9-10 k tank here, buffed.<br />
I figure the estimated time of death of the pally was about 30 sec after engagement.<br />
I died (about 7k) about 20 sec later<br />
<br />
He is one mean MOFO - make NO mistake.<br />
Best tactic in retrospect is have a ranger tank him because of that weapon shield disc that they get.<br />
The ranger grabs his attention then everyone else nukes the crap out of him.<br />
Other wise get a Warrior to tank using whatever that ripost disc is - do NOT get them to go defensive other wise they will eat DD until they fall over which is about 20 hits ie about 40 secs .:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm. Not looking good for me.  Guild is strong, but would have to have everyone 50+ turn out (only have 4 lvl 65 atm, but over 50pple 50+ ).  maybe get the casters to all Cast nukes at same time.  Serious lag would result if the server suported it, but attacking when Lhanc at 10% or less with the HT's thrown in is perferable to trying to melee him it appears.  Never thought to do that before, but sounds like a plan unless someone here knows why it can't be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well got my first atempt at soloing terror today. When i went to pull him he summoned me while i was out of agro range and somehow instantly got me to 50% life upon summoning me (he was at 100% health).   Well i poped off HT and started lifetapping like mad i only managed to get him to 20% solo.   Can't wait untill i get shot number 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It is soloable, with some conditions. If you don't have the faction, you will need two invis vs. undead cast on you for turn ins.<br />
<br />
From other posts, it seems all of the mobs but Lhranc and the Mummy of Gholnor have been soloed, so won't reitterate those.<br />
<br />
Just finished my epic and tried the Mummy solo. Self buffed he was not hard, think he has 10k hps. The part of the fight that was not solo was getting an invis vs. undead for the ghost turn in, and the necro I was with messed an add (which I think could have been handled).<br />
<br />
Was going to try Lhranc solo, but was running late for a Time raid so just had a few people I was with take him down fast. In looking at the fight, there is no question he can be soloed with HT zerg.<br />
<br />
Finished Epic and got an auged 65/38 Vanazir all in the same night, happy happy SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">well i'd say you can solo everything except the fear part, and the last fight because i know that the last fight lhranc took me down quick w.o healing haha<br />
everything else can be soloed~!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>ghosteater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">so is bind harm touching on lhranc actually feasable? i have 2 of the 3 HT damage aa's so i can HT for 3.5-4.5k norm and using disc anywhere from 6-7.5k. im just wondering if it has been tinkered with by sony so its balanced fairly, i.e. no brilliant strategy like soloing a final epic mob. whats his resist on it if you have the irresistable Ht which you need to take the added dam aas anyhow? and what happens if you fail at killing him? can you reattempt raid like fayd?<br />

just posing some questions about this, might prefer to saves some guildies lives and show the actual might of a sk...</div></div><hr />
