<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently have been getting awesome exp at the Dillo camp in PoS. Everyone hates doing it but make your own groups it seems to me most people i invite are uneasy about the idea till they get there. This has been my first experience hunting there but i get the impression the zone was recently revamped. Easy to single and not to many resists. I started tanking there at 57 but the healer (cleric or druid) wasted a lot of mana on me. Went from 57 to 59 in 2 days with nonstop pulls. Dont play with giants or frogs till much later stick with cactus and dillos. everything summons use dark and fear on pull you will never loose aggro.<br />
<br />
PS first post so no flames but constructive criticism is welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds good, I've just been now getting into Tier 2.  I don't really know the camp.  How's xp in PoS versus WW in PoV?  How much ac and hps did you have at 57?  Maybe post your magelo, so others can get an idea of what kind of items it takes to camp there.  What kind of group makeup is needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find it odd that it's posted as having a Higher ZEM then the Elemental Planes themselves.  When I used to kill Giants there for BoT key pieces the exp didn't seem that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was 57 i had about 3k hp and 1050 ac un buffed. Exp was far betterthan PoV because the kill to mana ratio meant virtually no down time with constant pulls. Keep in mind i always formed the group. I would always go for a higher level tank. till i hit 58. I tried to fill the group so i was the lowest. Now that i look back i would get a cleric of 55 because the exp is so good for 55 they will stay longer. Many that were hooked on LDoN said exp wasclose ifnot better in PoS. Im not magelo friendlybut wouldget one if i knew how lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sorry forgot to say your gear looks fine to me. Also if you pull an add just run away dont let anyone assist you they will give up fast. Cacti are so easily outran its annoying. If you are on nameless server ican leadyou to it or get you in a group if im there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm on lanys, but thanks for the info.  I'll try it out soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Funny that this got posted.  I just made my way over there for the first time last night.<br />
<br />
Great place, fairly safe to get to if you avoid giants from what I can tell.  Mobs hit pretty hard but dont seem as nasty as golems in PoV.  I think im going to follow in T's footsteps and start a group there tonight.  I dinged 59 there last night.  We had a lvl 56 cleric, 56 shammy, 58sk, 58sk, 59 Necro. Never got an add and pulls were fairly constant.  The cactus are gimp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont know how exp is once you ding 59 my puter broke on me so i havent gotten a chance to run back out there yet. I have heard many of the people in the group over 59 say the exp was slow. When asked what is better they said the castle in PoD was excellent. Keep in mind i have never hunted there yet but will soon as my computer is fixed but i looked at the bestiary on illia and there seem to be some ok drops but from the levels of the stuff listed and the conversations held there I would imagine any competent group could handle it. I do remember trying to pull from the castle one time to a group camping the bonewall and i was promptly rooted nuked and a$$ raped by a couple of casters. That was at 55 though. I was told it was a spot that many 60+ players fought over quite often but not really sure where they migrated to and dont know if i would follow them I try to go to under used zones because of fewer loot whores trains and ignorant ooc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do you mean lightcrawlers/bugs around castle or inside the castle.  The bugs around the castle are good xp, light crawlers are easy.  The umberbulk model bugs are seriously Line of Sight aggro buggs, need to be very very carefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not much I can add on this, as I have yet to touch PoS, but as far as the PoD courtyard goes....PoS is bound to be better.  I was MT for courtyard at 55 with no issues.  Pulling can be iffy, but if you use invis and are patient, adds are nothing to worry about.  I think at 57 I was there to tank and with mid 50's group with me as highest we broke the spawns so much for LCY that I started pulling around the front of the castle and from RCY.  In all likelihood, stay in PoS or hit PoV.<br />
<br />
If you are right on cacti being gimp, PoS would be my vote, Golems in PoV at WW hit like trucks (at least at 57/58) and actually hit harder than mobs I fight in kite groups in Halls of Honor.  On the plus side to PoV fighting at WW, is if you get the spider brain off the Luminii Crawler, you have 1/3rd of the alternate quest into HoH.  (Keep in mind that the Mephit heart from PoN is a pain to get)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah the CY is good for low mid 50's but where there is a courtyard there is a castle ;) My computer is broken so i wont be able to go inside the castle to verify this and you will prolly be 65 before it is fixed. If you are surious about where the entrance is, head stright in from the bone wall you will see a door, i know these 2 are casters and very hard to split so a good chanter is req, once you clear the outside of the door all thats left is inside. Hopefully my puter will be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If I get a chance today (ie. my 65 chanter friend is on) I may try the castle.  Heh, hard to beat HoH experience for me though, and yeah I'll be 65 pretty shortly at current rate :p .  If I learn anything I'll post it and if you see me on drop a line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well....<br />
<br />
Did not make it into castle yesterday.  Chanter wasn't on till about midnight my time, and had to go help with an epic kill, so I spent all day yesterday exp'ing elsewhere.  I'm still gonna try when I get a chance, but it probably won't be till next week, at which point I hope to be 62 anyway.  Will be busy this weekend on making plat for my Rule #1, so probably won't have time to try castle then.  See you in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hmm i read a post about Rule #1 and they did not clear it up lol so tell me what is Rule #1 and why are people so pissed about it.<br />
&lt;begins thinking of the firm and feels like tom cruz&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ok so i have heard the rule mentioned in the past and being new to the board i am of course curious as to what that is. News from the store i &quot;should get comp back on the 11th of Nov not to far but still not soon lol, anyway good luck on pp i hear AC is great with a cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ack sorry for double or semi double post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe it is ok to mention the actual item name of Rule #1 so long as strategies with it aren't mentioned, but just in case, I'm not gonna say much, just look at the Forum Rules and it is the first rule listed.  If nothing else, when you get back online,  shoot me a tell and I'll link it and explain why we don't talk about it.<br />
<br />
On that note, would one of you veterans out there mind sending me a PM or an e-mail to terlewis@bulloch.com on some of the techniques used with Rule #1....I know a couple from reading between the lines here on board and from passing comments made by shadowknights I've run into, but I was kind of hoping for a little more explanation :) .  And for the search Nazis, I can't exactly search for this info :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kahrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Honestly, I don't think alot of SK's know this, but POS has got to be some of the best solo exp. I can aggro kite a frog with my pet and get 7% a kill. It's slow unless you pile on the dots but it's very cool to see your exp bar jump :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>pentarum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">HoH graveyard ... Festering,Blood of Hate,Pet, Few clinging darkness to make sure pet doesnt pull agro when you run to the other side. 6% of a AA per kill. Very easy. Almost never get hit. If you have the AA horse even easier. Good waiting for group xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finally got my computer up and running still only 59 so HoH is to high for me but was hoping someone would have some ideas about the PoD castle. Any ideas would be great since dillos are getting slow. My ac is about 1100 unbuffed &lt;a little less&gt; hp 3k + a little. I know PoV is good exp per kill but you cant kill them that fast all the time;) I just want 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vandarette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Loroks in forest or zone in frogs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm dont know about loruks but I was told by someone that had more exp then I did that the oz frogs and everything around them were social plus killing them would give faction hits (the non kos frogs) There are frogs in a cave next to dillo pond they give good exp but takes a good group to break them.</div></div><hr />
