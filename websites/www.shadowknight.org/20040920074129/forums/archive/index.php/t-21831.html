In particular, I liked it better when the different sub-forums were displayed on the same page.  So I could see &quot;The Arena&quot;, &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot;, and &quot;The Armory&quot; all on one page.<br />
<br />
It's a lot of extra clicking around to surf between sub-forums with the new format.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other issues that people have noticed but this one is bugging me the most right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's very bleh</div></div><hr />

If you click on EverQuest (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=32)  instead of Main, or Evil Beginnings, or whatever else, you get everything on one page.  This new change didn't change that...the change from a few months ago did.</div></div><hr />

Thank you much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry Board Admins - but old look &amp; layout was much better ...<br />
<br />
*votes for changing it back*<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying though, I think.<br />
<br />
Fally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The format is very very similar to the old one. The view your seeing is only temporary tho. It has looked this way for probably over 6 months now. Click on either Everquest or Everquest 2 titles for the views your used to. The main page will be up in the next few days and it will link into the forums as usual. we called it a night at about 5:30am this morning tho so I could re-index the site and get the search features up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just realized that something has returned that caused quite a stir a while back.<br />
not gonna point it out, though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not sure about the others, but I already was / I am already used to the subcategory views. What I don't like about the current (temporary) look though is:<br />
<br />
*) The &quot;post reply&quot; button being on the bottom left side<br />
*) Those fat black lines being seen everywhere now (looks special perhaps - but not cool imo)<br />
*) The &quot;Reply to Topic&quot; layout page is totally &quot;overhauled&quot; - looks rather disorganized now<br />
*) User names seeming much larger now<br />
*) Why are the postcount subtitles gone? (Reaver, Revenant,...)<br />
<br />
Oh well, I simply hate changes - but I'll probably get used to it anyways in a few days ;) <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Fally...</div></div><hr />

Fun, I know what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Oh hey look at that, post counts are back! (I didn't think you were talking about that.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm metathesiophobic... change it back. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">New smilies suck :mad: ...like newtank<br />
<br />
did I miss the avatar using window when it was open?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zaim Nae'blis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not digging it.</div></div><hr />

lousy contrarian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">no, they are talking about post count showing below ur name</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I got the impression they weren't talking about that.  I also don't remember that being a huge issue, I do remember the giving and avatar to a friend causing huge rumbles.  who the frick cares about post count anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">DIE POST COUNTS DIE<br />
yeah, I did point it out  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>^UGARK^</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">one word.<br />
yuck.<br />
<br />
Ps .. up the word/letter count in signatures :P used to be higher ... now I cant change it as it says its too long :) ... yet it still remains incorrect tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">word counts in signatures need to be smaller =D<br />
<br />
btw the username is hella big other then that i dont care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SoulVoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Post counts will be going away, I hate all the new images actually and am in the middle of renaming the old ones to work. Email alerts and such are also now available along with the report links in theory. Username will also be made smaller soon, but functionality is higher on the list than minor cosmetic changes. A lot less translated during the upgrade than expected so Brael and I had to pretty much recreate format and colors from archieves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am viewing at 1152 x 864<br />
<br />
Looking at this page is like I am viewing at 640 x 480 or 800 x 600. Shit is fucked up bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">At least the problem with the forum jump GO button is finally fixed.  All the cosmetic stuff is just that, cosmetic.  SV and Brael will get to it when they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Now that the user names are smaller it's much better.  Postcounts don't matter to me, but I agree that it's better that they've been removed, since people wind up bitching about them.  If you visit enough message boards a relatively minor change in format isn't a big deal.  It'll be nice to have the old smilies back, though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">thanks for removing post counts and most titles.<br />
hopefully the overall quality of posts will improve  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">IMO, it looks better today than it did yesterday. Steps in the right direction. The huge names on the left had to go, people who walked by my computer saw that and said it was ugly.<br />
<br />
Why not put post count on there? I don't care either way, but if people get worked up over someone having more posts than them on a message board, then maybe they should do something more constructive with their day. Like, trying to see how long the Puree setting on their blender would take to liquify their hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm ?  :confused: <br />
<br />
The problem with post counts is that it leads some retards to spam useless stuff, or stuff that has been said over and over, just to raise their post count.<br />
And because of this it's harder to find the good posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Why not put post count on there?<br />
Apart from what Askeer said, it tends to 'matter' to way too many people.  They whine about it too often and then people start complaining about the whining, ad infinitum.<br />
<br />
Without post count totals, you rely on your reputation and not a number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You can still find out anyone's post count with an additional 5 seconds of work. <br />
Click the username, go to profile. Then search by all posts from this user.<br />
<br />
Edit: new board layout, you actually just scroll down on profile page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Could always see post counts that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I know, so whats the big deal if you have it right on the left taskpane thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Most people are either too lazy to check, or don't know about it.  So they don't complain when it isn't under your name and easy to see.</div></div><hr />
