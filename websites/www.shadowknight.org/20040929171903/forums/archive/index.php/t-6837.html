<br />
My first SK was an Erudite (at the time I made him cause I thought they looked cool in leather (sort of ninja like)) but when he reached 34 I found him very lacking and died several times fear kiting in OT (through LD and other reasons).  At that time, I remade him as a Dark elf.  When he reached 34 he seemed a LOT more capable and didnt die half the amount of times.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, some of the strongest SKs around are Erudites, maybe if I'd kept playing my old one he would have been even stronger than Drakonn is now... but I'm happy with the position I'm in right now.<br />

Ill say again: No race is superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never been a big fan of guilds do, having the ability to beat the odds and be better equiped then alot of lvl 60's is always fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kagek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Doesn't every race/diety combo have good cultural armor? I know Troll/Ogre Cazic Thule believers use the same cultural armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gnasha Blaktusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have played  both DE and Troll as SK. I started playing DE first and after about a year I changed servers, well i wanted a little change of pace so I thought i might try Troll as regen, str and hp might make it less of a struggle to lvl up. However after having played both i would say in my opinion the DE leveled much faster than my troll has and as you get farther along into the game it seems to be MUCH less difficult to find plate class armor with STR stats than it is to find plate class armor with INT stats. While it may seem that STR and STA are a big advantage at first, I kinda wish i had stuck with better starting INT . Just my two coper worth .......Yer pal, Da Gnasha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd say stats can help, as not everyone can just plvl to 60 and get a primal weapon.  But even what stats are most important can be a tought decision and varies from person to person.<br />
<br />
For example while a troll may tank better on average, but say if you're lvling with a couple friends and you botch a pull and get a whole lotta mobs and you got no chanter/bard, the erudite can straight fear most of them because they have a better reserve of mana, and can use lifetaps to help ease up on the caster while killing faster, and although without KEI you may not have the mana to do that all the time, if you can turn a bad pull into a lot of xp, well that's worth plenty of time tanking a bit better.<br />
<br />
Other things to consider is what you want to do, raid? Just lvl with friends? Level to 60 fast? Camp dificult spots? For example, if you want to raid an ogre will have the highest raw hp thus making any cheals on you more effective.  Also though if you are in a raid you may be able to get sufficient buffs to get your stats up as a weaker race, go gear choices come into play. If you are just leveling with friends, maybe you have a shammy healing, or a druid and they can't fill you up no matter what race you are, so the added hp is only a buffer for bad pulls in the same way mana can be a buffer.<br />
<br />
So stats are really hard to judge in my opinion, but there are other aspects to a race, important ones, such as size, faction, xp penalties, ac bonus, regen, vision, not being stunned form the front, and the often forgotten resist modifiers.<br />
<br />
Trolls have good str/sta and regen, but they are cumbersome, have an xp penalty, and a huge hit to their fire resist.<br />
<br />
Ogres have the best str/sta of any race, so they can focus more on raw hp, and stats they are lacking in. They cannot be stunned from the front, however they are huge, their hometown seems a bit out of the way though there are other options for banking etc. and I believe they have a xp penalty, though I've heard it's less than iksar/trolls<br />
<br />
Dark elves have high int, and ultra vision.<br />
<br />
Humans I believe have good faction, but have no night vision what so ever.<br />
<br />
Erudites have the highest int, have increased magic resist, but decreased poison/disease. they have somewhat weak melee stats, not even starting with 75 agi.<br />
<br />
Iksar have regen, and AC bonus, decently rounded stats, high points I think in dex or agi, can't remember which. They have good fire resist and poor cold, or maybe it was other way around... They have the worst faction being able to bank without faction work only in cabilis, shadowhaven/bazaar, and thurgadin.  They also have armor restrictions.<br />
<br />
Gnomes should not exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
So of course there is no best race, it's all a matter of what you want,  and what you will give up. I originally chose iksar because I wanted regen, I figured the AC bonus would let me wear more resist gear. I first ctually played a troll, found that I could not stand the size as it made it hard to pvp, and promptly moved to the only other regening race.<br />
<br />
Now I have started an erudite, partly because I wanted the raised MR for pvp, partly I wanted to try a high int race.  I also chose erudite because me and 2 RL friends decided to level characters together and the classes we chose only fit on two tallon zek teams, shorts and humans, I refuse to play a short so we went human, that left me only two choices, erudite or human.  I now have an iksar BP that I wear most of the time, so regen isn't a big a deal to me (although I wore it on my iksar and loved the combined regen) and although I lost my AC bonus I can now wear armor I couldn't before, and I do.  And I lost my xp penalty which was a nice addition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every race has a lot to look at, beyond stats there are the odd perks such as regen, and beyond that, some races just look damn good, and that's quite a selling point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now you have so much tradeable gear available to you that it shouldn't be too hard to fix some of the stats yer having problems with.<br />
<br />
Before I quit, the raids I was doing I had within 600 hps of the best warrriors around me...before they started getting rediculously nice doze quest items =p.<br />

Gnome<br />
Big Advantage: there just aint too many of them<br />
<br />
Some servers put a big stock in reputation. If you are looking for notoriety/infamy/reputation then the best race class combos are the ones that don't get played that often. I pick my race class combos based on how rare they happen to be on my server.<br />
<br />
I also usually chose a female toon for the same reason.<br />
<br />
On Firiona Vie:<br />
Male troll/ogre/dark elf shadowknights are a dime a dozen... folks aint gonna remember your name cause you are just common trash.<br />
<br />
Iskar SKs aren't as common, but still common enough that they dont raise an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Poxy is the *ONLY* female gnome shadowknight on FV.  When someone in the bazar says &quot;Heey, look at that little female SK  that just ran by&quot; you can bet that *someone* is going to be sayin &quot;Yeah, that there is Poxy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frankly, despite their good looks, the only reason I can see to prefer playing a DE male is that you will be so forgetably common you will be able to get away with griefing and still not ruin your reputation.<br />
/rude to the players who do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>drew1964</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">so far my troll sk rules i dont know maybe its the added slam which works with bash or its the large hp pool or str. it could be im using my lvl 52 stuff but its the same stuff i had for 30 lvls so its not to tweenked. its senti armour and a throneblade 2hs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the #1 reason I choose Erudite.<br />
<br />
<br />
That and I've played everything from a troll SK up through 35 lvl's before the exp penalties were removed from class's and played an Iksar to 34, troll is now 51. At lvl 50 when I got my troll's quest spell, I can cast it and only be able to cast it twice...<br />
<br />
<br />
He wears full Noct gear with a few Int bonus's and all... solo's quite well, the lack of int makes mana regen look insane too =). <br />
<br />
<br />
But I made the switch to Erudite because I wanted to be unique... there are no solid Erudite Gravelords on Druzzil Ro, I would like to run with a slightly smaller crowd (which I am making a big push for 60, but I won't even tell ya how far away I am, it'll just sound dumb ;p )... so Erudite works for me. There WAS a gnome Gravelord on our server, but he was quite short lived and quit already, not like gnome was an option, but I want to look cool dernit... can't deny, Erudites look awesome ;p.</div></div><hr />

The only racial ability that cannot be overcome with gear or AA is the Ogre ability of not being stunned from the front.  This one skill gives the Ogre an advantage not shared by any other race.  Since this is indeed fact then the Ogre is the best SK race from a pure end game stand point. <br />
I still find that ability to be completely over-rated.<br />
<br />
If you're tanking, it is more important to be able to absorb damage than deal it, so being stunned a few times shouldn't be a problem.  As it is, most times when I tank I don't get stunned very often anyway.<br />
<br />
If you are not tanking, then you're not going to be stunned by melee.<br />
<br />
If you're pulling, you're running from the mobs to lead them back to the group, and if you get hit it'll be from the back, so there's an equal chance of being stunned no matter who you are.<br />
<br />
If you're soloing and not fear-kiting, being stunned may present a minor inconvenience, especially if you get an add or two.  Of course, in that case you're probably dead regardless of whether or not you avoid being stunned.<br />
<br />
'Unstunnable from the front' looks good as a bullet-list item to me, but in the end it is not something I would use as a determining factor when choosing a race for an SK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Lunaticfringesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Regardless of what any analysis is done when comparing race to race, one of the first and most important aspects to focus on is the xp penalty.<br />
<br />
That is the great equalizer amongst all the races.  <br />
<br />
If all races leveled at the same pace, you'd be a fool to pick any race other than an Ogre, Troll, or Iksar, as those races are clearly superior to the remaining races due to special abilities (save for those who prefer certain intangibles, like looks, rollplay, cyber advantage, etc.).<br />
<br />
That is why I will always chuckle when an &quot;intelligent&quot; race focuses on the fact that they have more intelligence as an advantage, yet get dwarfed in overall stats.  Its foolish.  To attempt to win the argument that one stat (in this case, intelligence) is inheritly better than another (say strength or stamina) is almost impossible to win.  <br />
<br />
For instance, an Ogre dominates a Dark Elf in terms of overall stats.  To say, however, that the Dark Elf is better because he has higher intelligence is just silly.<br />
<br />
To also argue that gear in the end game balances out all the stats is also foolish.  I dont know of a single person that has maxed out all stats unbuffed.  There is always room for improvement.  At the end of the day, more points has to be superior to fewer points.<br />
<br />
The point of this is that the primary benefit of playing a small race, say a Dark Elf, lies in the fact that they level faster then there large and / or Iksar counterparts.  That is the primary benefit.  It has little, if anything, to do in the fact that they are more intelligent.<br />
<br />
For example, all things equal, a Dark Elf will always be higher level than an Orge.  Now your choice between races becomes rather interesting.  Would you rather have a race that will, in theory, be a higher level, but lack certain special abilities (i.e. regen, stats, stun, etc.) or get those advantages, but be lower level?  Makes for an interesting decision.<br />
<br />
Exception:  In the very end game say, when a Dark Elf has to spend aa points on getting the ability to 2H bash, which an Ogre already has, the races almost balance out, except the Ogre still has a few advantages.  Interpret as you wish....<br />
<br />
So, when analyzing races, one of the primary questions should be, who levels faster.  You'll find that, in general, the races that level faster are inferior, as they dont have certain special abilities.  The fact that they level faster, however, is Verants way of balancing them out.  <br />

I dunno.  Even if ogres and trolls leveled faster then the other races, I wouldn't play them cause I absolutley hate their newbie zone.  And I play an iksar so its not like I'm just an angry dark elf or anything.<br />
<br />
Going off on a tangent here, but I think the iksar exp penalty should be lowered.  We have regen which is sweet, but we're also cursed with that AC 'bonus' that is nothing but a complete pain in the ass up until the end game.</div></div><hr />

Here's why:<br />
<br />
1) Not too many of them<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind that I solo almost exclusively and have limited play time...<br />
<br />
2) This is a twink character, so I can make up for some of the disadvantages through equipment.<br />
<br />
3) No XP penalty<br />
<br />
4)  Clockwork armor; specifically the vambraces that bestow 40% spell haste after level 20.  When stacked on a COCW...well, 76% soloing haste is awesome.<br />

----------------------------------------------------------<br />
lets not forget to mention that Monk epic is 40% song haste so the arms give us the same advantage they have.. just not for free. (but i love not having to mash that damn epic hotkey every 9 secs)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'd like to add that even tho there are charges on the armors they are fairly cheap to recharge.. like 35-40pp for 10 charges.<br />
<br />
Another plus dealing with Clockwork armor: Greaves cast sow speed buff for 45pp / 10 charges  .. beats the hell outta sow potions<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh so for soloing and being a twink i'd say gnome is hard to beat which i why i went with one.. Fungi, CoCW, Noct, Windblade, etc, etc.. in the end all is good no matter the race, its just gnome have the most utility and fun getting there.<br />

I made mine so I would get free gear. At 43 I still get freebies. Except for the top-heavy bit, she doesn't look horrid in armor (like some guys do), and the stats rock.

The only one I've take over 30 and stuck with is the Ogre.  Being stunned is just very nice after experiencing 61 levels of being stunned on occasion with my (shaman).  Race always comes down to personal preference.  Less than 3% of the entire SK population will ever have all necessary stats maxed with gear and buffs.  The rest of us will just have to live with it and like it.  <br />
<br />
Being immune to stun doesn't mean you can't be interrupted casting spells.  It just means as long as you face a mob you cannot get teh stun message.  Also, you can still be pushed back by npcs and spells.<br />

<br />
Go to Magelo, make one char that is of the dumber races (ogre/troll/human/iksar) and one smarter one (erud/gno/DE).  Take the best overall equipment you can find for each of them in terms of ratio,  atk, ac, hp, resists, stats.  I can guarentee that it'll be MUCH easier to get all of those really high for the int races then it is to max out for the dumb ones.  <br />
<br />
But you say, &quot;But Ogre's are unstunnable!!&quot;  Well, that seems useful, and it is, if you're a warrior and MT or ST...  for and SK who will only be tanking for small moments on a raid its nothing that special.  Regen, yes, its great, but in high lvl encounters you'll find that even that 18 hp per tick regen doesn't make much difference, you'll still die just as fast if you aren't in a CH rotation.  But being able to keep you mana up superhigh, and thus be able to focus almost entirely on HP/AC/Resists/ATK is a huge bonus, and in the endgame is very important =]<br />
<br />
Plus, and this is #1, NO XP PENALTY!!!, you will especially be feeling that extra hard up in the 60's when you're trying to get that last yellow, or that 1 AA point, cus it will take you sometimes twice as long to get it...</div></div><hr />

There is no penalty for AAxp.  And I dont see how even a 20% exp bonus equals twice as long to level.  As far as I know, it would take a 50% penalty or more to equal 'twice as long'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Darksiege</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well, I've played my Erudite SK to 39 so far.  Most of that has been via soloing.  I don't really have any gear that is 'Int Focused' and still have an Int of 140 and that's proven plenty for fear kiting in OT.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, when I see my fellow Iksar, Ogre and Troll SK's in action; I feel kinda insignificant damage output wise.  When it comes to pure melee, those races OWN mobs.  I've even questioned my own choice in race cause of all the debates about 'what race is better'.  I can tell you this; for having an 'Int' based race with 70 stats in agil, sta and dex; I hold my own so far.<br />
<br />
I believe the 'Race Debate' is a very divisive and has negative impact on one's psyche.  I view these posts every day and often find myself wondering what I'm doing wrong when in all actuality, I'm not.<br />
<br />
Every race has its good and bad.  As an Erudite SK in a group, I am low maintenance (less heals) and put out decent damage (not OWNing damage like Ikkys, Ogres and Trolls).  I get compliments from many a Clerics about how I am low maintenance and how I time my 'aggro' spells to help save the MA's life when the Cleric was low on mana.<br />
<br />
It's how you want to play really.  As an Ikky or Ogre/Troll, you get the option of looking your enemy in face as you deliver the final blow.  As an Erudite/DE, you get to make them wet their pantaloons as they run from you while you skin them alive.<br />
<br />
Well, that's enough of my input for now.  Just thought I'd share my opinions :)</div></div><hr />

Keep your offensive skills up, and work to increase your STR, and you'll output as much damage as any of those other classes.  Once you get to levels 46+ and start raiding, you'll get a good number of STR/ATK buffs which will help in this area.<br />
<br />
As is often said- in the long run, the races tend to even out as equipment starts to make up for the inherent deficits that you have.  Even in the event that you don't manage to get certain stats as high as that of other people, your overall effectiveness will depend more on your abilities as a player than on having your statistics max'ed.</div></div><hr />

Blind as a bat is about it. But thats easily remedied.<br />

I never regret going with a human. Even though it was my first character ever, knew nothing of the game I still wouldn't ever change it.  <br />
<br />
/CHEER Moongarm i tried every possible race for sk my human is the only one i kept past lvl 35 a) non-kos or easier to become non-kos in almost every city (note almost every city still workin on cabilis) b) none of these attempts were twinked all had newbie quest gear till around mid 20s and human was just most enjoyable for me (yes i agree 100% with race is personal preference this is mine) c) NO OTHER sk race leveled anywhere near as quick (Dondi is 45 with 145 or better in every trade skill except tailoring and of course the shammy only alchemy and still only 16 days old playtime). <br />
OK thats my 2cp worth on that and btw gnomes try bein a human sk sometime we arent exactly anybody's favorite either but if ya ask me you dont like me you can bite me you want some come get some at 45 i eat any other melee class alive that wants to try me in a duel ill go up to 6 lvls above or below me i just dont care regardless of the race you choose SK&gt;all  thats the 1 thing we all need to remember everyone here is an sk and we own norrath period. Dondi has been just him and my RL wifes DE cleric from birth and we own we take out mobs with us 2 alone that we seen eat a group of 3 lvl 60's (Renaldok the named flyin vamp on 2nd floor of the TM vamp castle to be precise about the mob) my wife rezzed them all in a corner and they sat and watched us eat him alive totally in shock then offered us 20k for the katar he dropped an sk of any race totally owns with a cleric we need nothing else cause we are that damned good.<br />

Let me tell you all one thing, the exp penalty and faction &quot;problems&quot; really don't exist.  How many of us hunt the old world still?  Since you start with the same velious/luclin/pop factions as just about every other SK (humans may not be kos in katta, dunno) why even consider it as a potential problem?  Exp penalty I noticed a bit more on my SK than my necro, mostly being my necro just ate through anything that aggroed him reguardless if he was grouped or not.<br />
<br />
That being said, I love my Iksar SK.  Damn good series of quests in the khurki series, decient quest armor (dreadscale, looks cool too), some of the best exp places really close to your home town (Kurns, Dalnir, Kaesora), the ability to not really give a damn and hunt Kaesora, Howling Stones (still fun before you can really do anything in pop).  All in all, Iksar was just naturally more fun to me.  Reduced downtimes from the regen, better starting AC though this is negated at higher levels a bit, no slam, but how many SK's really use 2hs as their primary form of damage?  Resists can be worked around with chosing the gear carefully, but PoP seems to use more poison/disease based spells to me based on what I fight.  Not having to cast a level 9 spell to see at night, being able to hunt virtually anything and not worry about factions, short of Iksar guards, it's all a possibility to me.</div></div><hr />

I might be in the minority on this one, but Greenmist isnt even worth it to me.  Im like 95% of the way there too, but I have little motivation to complete it, as the DPS just isnt that good (save for fighting Shissar, then its decent).<br />

&quot;decient quest armor (dreadscale, looks cool too),&quot;<br />

Agree!  I recently saw a IKS SK in full Dreadscale; it cracked a smile.  Looks really cool and not insanely difficult to get.  Its pale, however, in comparison to even Thurg armor, to say nothing about SS/Kael or better armor.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;no slam, but how many SK's really use 2hs as their primary form of damage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh.  Im certain that many SKs will disagree strongly with this comment.  And if there truly is a softcap at whatever (~1250 is it?), then once you get over that, its hard to not wield a 2H because you will, in general, have a higher DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
At present, however, I sturggle as to why someone would choose an IKS SK over a Troll SK (not counting if someone put heavy weight into certain intangibles, like roleplay, looks, etc.).  When you really boil it down, the only advantage a IKS has on the Troll is the AC bonus, but that is highly debatable as to if it truly generates any significant benefit at higher levels.<br />

Gonna have to disagree with you on this one.  Troll stats are much better overall.  If the IKS put all his points into say stamina and the troll put all his into say intelligence (and both of those bonus point allocations are extremely reasonable), its pretty obvious who's in much better shape statwise.<br />

Yeah, I agree, but levels 1 - 50 literally fly as compared to 51-65, getting a bunch of AAs, and raiding.  Im just not sure that the amount of time you spend in these zones is worth all that much.

Is this referring to the comment regarding IKS SK and how much they get stunned (even at level 65)?<br />
<br />
If so, I can assure you that it is absolutely accurate.  While I cant speak intelligently about other races, as I dont play any other tank classes (all the other classes I bot are &quot;casters&quot;), all of my discussions with my friends, without exception (unless they are ogre), have all had the same issue (get stunned from the front anywhere from 2-5 times per mob in PoV or PoS).  That leads me to believe that it isnt just related to IKS SK, but all non-ogre SK.<br />

Second, we can start letters to mennix with &quot;sghort tasty thing that should be on a stick...&quot;<br />

Seriously though, go to Fohguild.org. Click on members. Click on the SKs. Look at the base stats. Factor in all buffs. Look at another races. Factor in buffs. Thats what I thought--No difference at all, all maxed. <br />

Immunity to stunning is nice, but I dont tank too much. Like natural AC and regen a bit more.<br />

I just have a lot more fun playing him. He is evil, but in a silly Gnomish way which fits with my play style, plus, it got me into the Midget Brigade and they are a great bunch of people!</div></div><hr />

This is not a flame, so dont interpret this incorrectly, but I guess my question would be what good are you then?  SKs are not a high DPS class and our greatest attribute lies in the fact that we can tank and many people will expect you to tank, as an SK should be able to take the pounding.  If we relegate ourselves to being a DPS class, then we become expendable.<br />
<br />
Fir instance, in most PoP zones, you generally want to have 3 main class types in a group:  1. Tank, 2. Healer, 3. Slower.  Ive had many cleric friends complain that they couldnt find a good tank and that frequently that was a sticking point for them to get a good group going.  An SK fits the bill of a tank type.  Further, at the end of the day, all other classes are expendable; one class type, say a ranger for example, can easily be replaced with say a wizard and the group can keep motoring along.  You lose one of the big 3, however, and the group frequently comes to a stop while they try and find a replacement.<br />
<br />
An SK is a tank and our greatest ability lies in the fact that we can absorb damage and play that tank role.  You are one of the big 3---hold your head high.<br />

Oh, just to clarify, ogres are immune to stun from the front only.  They can and are stunned from behind.<br />
