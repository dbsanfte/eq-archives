<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haha &quot;suffered&quot; abuse.<br />
<br />
WTF do they think this is....oh wait they are such pussies that they can't stand being called a cockmongering cumchugger.....too bad for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy is only going to get another made up nick name, and made up phone number, made up address. That's what I used to subscribe to Yahoo with.<br />
<br />
My name on yahoo, matches the email address, not my real name, and my birthdate states that I am over 100 years old, and the city I live in is &quot;City&quot; and it's zipcode is 55555...<br />
<br />
So what exactly does this guy think, everyone is like him and gives their real information to a message board?<br />
<br />
Unless he thinks these people just barely started up with yahoo, which now requires a credit card to confirm age.... <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think everyone that “abused” him should show up at his firm and kick the crap out of him. They can more than likely find him cowering under his desk in a wet diaper, clutching his teddy bear, sucking his thumb and chanting: Hold my calls… I want my mommy!<br />
Men with no balls make me sick.<br />

<br />
No love for the nullos?<br />
<br />
Also trying to firgure out the most likely on this board to try to sue for being abused.  I had a few names.<br />
<br />
Then I realized they'd probably try to sue Yantis claiming as he owns the board that he is responsible for the content, and the list grew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somebody called him a name and he sues to get the person's private info given to him?!<br />
In most cases a company will not divulge that information to an individual based on privacy policies.  The company would just inform the person that they will look into it and then take appropriate action.<br />
<br />
An example:<br />
If someone gets harrassing phone calls and complains to the phone company, the phone co won't tell you who is doing it but will take whatever steps they take to make it stop, investigate, whatever.<br />
<br />
Personal info is nobody else's fucking business.<br />
I hope he gets face cancer and dies in a fire; what a loser.<br />
<br />
/em runs off to gather evidence of flames towards her so she can take action against the evil enterprise of Yantis, et al.<br />
<br />
Some of you are in TROOOUUUUUBLLLLLLLLLLE!</div></div><hr />

They should at least claim to be virgins.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm going to take a stab at the fact that Vilesoul is single in real life.<br />
<br />
How do I make that assumption?<br />
<br />
A married man would have asked for his weekly supply of whores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So what does that make you, keevel, with your demands for a daily supply of nullo's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye single....for some reason geeks without money don't seem to be a highly popular type amongst the females of my ageset.<br />
<br />
On the other hand....well....no comment.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EQ=TehDev1l! is BAD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">wow... some lame ass was probably talking shit on the porno forum and some 12 year old blasted him with cuss words.... lol........ our universe just gets better and better</div></div><hr />

<br />
Virgins are the worst lay you can get, but you probably wouldn't know any better...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">seriously, whats fun about hearing ow that hurts, stop, slow down ? broken in sluts are way more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah but that is the joy of anal sex  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So what does that make you, keevel, with your demands for a daily supply of nullo's?<br />
<br />
They're delicious AND nutritious?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">seriously, whats fun about hearing ow that hurts, stop, slow down ? broken in sluts are way more fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes there is fun in that though...It's called virgin bedroom rodeo....when you experience it, all shall be clear.  Then you have virgin bedroom admiral...this one is great...<br />
<br />
...you just have to be a raging asshole to figure out the fun that can  be had.  Experienced women will probably kick your ass the second you try to pull a bedroom admiral on them...for some reason women dont like having a guy steer them with his hips....I  can't figure out why though  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Is that the one where in the middle of it your friends jump out of the closests and start videotaping, while you try to stay mounted as long as possible? I like that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not true. Its the molding of a virgin that is the real fun. Teaching her the ropes. Trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">see i think its more fun when the girl wants you to fuck her hard and pull her hair, maybe even smack her a few times....... virgins want none of that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not true. Its the molding of a virgin that is the real fun. Teaching her the ropes. Trust me.<br />
<br />
So you are basicly saying that you never have had good sex before. Takes a lot of guts to say that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Orofear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What a petty petty thing to sue over, so his feelings got hurt, so fucking what?  Does that give lisence for preschools to sue people for calling them a &quot;doo-doo head&quot;? :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bedroom Admiral is where your doing her form behind while standing....now you bend her over at her hips, so her face is forward, like a ship's bow.  Now without using your hands you thrust forward while walking, forcing her to walk or fall over.  You contiunue to do this as fast as you can and try to actually steer her around the room and or house.  This can get quite amusing really fast.  If you got a fiesty one, and know it in advance, you may wish to abstain from this, since it's very easy for a girl to willingly do a face plant...and if she manages to hit that right angle while your all the way in  :eek:</div></div><hr />

I want to try that, but that would mean getting a GF, which would require effort and money that I don't want to spend....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ah, just go pick up some random barfly...just make sure to triple-wrap it, just to be safe.</div></div><hr />
