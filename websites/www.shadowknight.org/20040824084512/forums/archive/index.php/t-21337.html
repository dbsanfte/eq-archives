<br />
You don't actually think that the people that wrote that (a year ago) actually thought they had the clairvoyance to know that SoE would never put an Epic 2.0 in any future expansion, do you?</div></div><hr />

Far better than this damned rat-race into the hundresds of AAs, lvl 65, and elementals....<br />
<br />
Too many rat-races, we need more quests.  Things to just sit back and chill with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, you pull up a picture from a year ago, when there was no Epic 2.0, and try to make me feel bad or something about doing that? Ehh. Nice try, dude... I guess. If I gave a shit, I might be ticked off, but it just makes you look like a whiner.<br />
<br />
http://members.aol.com/magusvader/epic2.jpg <br />
<br />
Notice where it says &quot;There Ain't No Epic&quot;, not &quot;There Will Never Be an Epic&quot;. Which, a year ago, was 100% true.. just as it is right now. I'm sure you can spend a whole day or two going through the posts here to see that what someone said a year or more ago was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So If a fat ugly man was required to to tell us there was not Epic 2.0<br />
<br />
Who's gonna make the pic of the ethnic hottie that says &quot;I've got your Epic 2.0 right here sweetheart&quot;?<br />
<br />
SFW please = )</div></div><hr />
