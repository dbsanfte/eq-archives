<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kekekeke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I have already postedon the hunting guide forum and got loads of helpful tips as to where to hunt! Thanks guys!<br />
<br />
I am playing on the Stromm server, have a gnome shadow knight who will ding 13 very soon! I am duoing with my boyfriends gnome cleric of the same level.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is if there are any quests we could do? Mainly for shadow knights since we already have done quite a couple of his cleric quests. I am now wearing full set of newbie armor, so the only item slots I have anything in are those that render as something on your character, so no jewelry, cloaks, mask etc. I have a bronze two handed sword.<br />
<br />
So if any of you know of any quests that can be done to get some stuff, they dont have to be super quests at all, just something to do, wich preferably is doable between our level and around level 20.<br />
<br />
Well, off to do stuff around the house whlie they patch, have a nice day guys! And thank you all in advance for help and tips!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moreeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try Allakhazam. Should be able to track down plenty of Shadow Knight specific quests. Also try the Shadow Knight Den, he has a fairly decent list of quests for most all of the SK levels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Moreeta has the idea, go to allakazam, check under quests by zone go to Ak`anon and look for quests for gnome SK's and such very helpful, they have nearly every uqest, I wouldn't surprised if they had all oldworld quests w/ walkthroughs</div></div><hr />
