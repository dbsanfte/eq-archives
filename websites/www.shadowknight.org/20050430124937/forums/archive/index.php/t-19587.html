<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>evilspawndark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was goofing around on my beastlord alt at lvl 40 in Tenebrous mountains.  I could easly solo in the caves there.<br />
<br />
Exp was descent and they dropped gems worth 10-180p as well as acrylia.<br />
<br />
The bats and dogs where blue also, easy kills. I didnt try the aliens.<br />
<br />
I think they lowered the hp's on the Grimlings when they changed the zone because they have NO hp's.<br />
<br />
You just have to be carefull of the caster mob's they chain nuke you, but my pet would take the nukes and they would go down fast.  So,  as a SK would just have to be cautious of these.</div></div><hr />
