<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xxion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought of some changes I would like to see for the game while working.  Just bored and thought of some things I would like to have input on.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights...  Give us slay living, nix SA.  While I like our agro with 15 lvl spells, fix terrors and do away with the hate with lower level mobs vs, higher mobs.  Sucks but if I were a mob why would I care a person was casting a spell that would barely effect me.  <br />
<br />
Pallies... Give them a decent nuke for living creatures, same damage as our Scythe of Innoruuk.  Increase thier lay on hands, work it like our HT does, use same amount of aa's to get it too.  Increase undead ratio for eq zones to make thier slay undead halfway useful.<br />
<br />
Monks.... give them a kick worth using, more to the effect of 600- 700 area at a backstab rate.<br />
<br />
Rest of the classes seem pretty well balanced, and with the advent of the new opening system it would seem that the hybrids, mostly knights are being left behind on improvements and balancing to the point of making knights less useful than what they have been.<br />

You sure you not a pally undercover???<br />
<br />
top 65 Pallys with everything fully up before combat has on the order of 25,000 hp(9k+9k lay+6k heals) available to them and do massive damge against undead while stunning for reduced damage.  Lets add nukes to their healing spells so they can have spell offense too.</div></div><hr />

our HT is topping 9k+. If you are talking about PVP I doubt all that healing is useful when he is down 70% of his health....<br />

Yes I see alot of undead in high level zones....(sarcasim)<br />

I like it but I would give it up for Slay living for added dps.  Group wise I see it go off 2 to 3 times frankily, though in raids I see it go off more I really don't need the heals as much with the regen, procs and healing I already do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DragonKnight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh well honestly you guys all sound like paladins mostly but i just believe that since the paladins have a slay undead. We should have like a slay holy or something. Just a thought don't flame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Newtank, next time when you are quoting something, don't quote the entire freaking post when it is freakin right above you. Quoting his entire post did nothing in making the message closer to your post. Besides, you also don't have to quote the entire message.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you are getting the beatdown, because I see it everywhere on this board and everywhere on other EQ boards. It just gets annoying.<br />
<br />
And my whole thoughts on this is that it is just a game. Your changes sound like they are just for balance (they need a little work, but I couldn't do much better so don't take it personally) rather than roleplaying. Hell, no one roleplays, but a roleplaying change is alot better than a balancing change as long as the classes remain different from eachother. Sure, there is the tank, dps, buff, and cleric division, but each class should retain its own versitality. Like monk for instace, needs an improved kick, but not by 600-700 &quot;like backstab.&quot; Monks are decent dps but that's not really what they do. Just because there is alot of one class in the game, doesn't mean that they needed to be compensated as dps. Just like necros, they are great, but instead of giving necros lots of DDs to compensate for non-stackable DoTs with other necros, they gave them mana feed. I propose giving monks the most and most versitile combat openings because of their training.<br />

That's all for now.</div></div><hr />
