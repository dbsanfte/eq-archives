<br />
Currently applying for server transfer off Vallon Zek server and been hanging out relaxing in Ldon normals 3boxing with my sk, bst, cleric grinding aa's and ldon points to get away from all the griefing and such till my transfer goes through. Im enjoying my time ldoning and such and when i started up 3boxing again recently i did it more so because i wanted to be able to leadership grinding by myself. Also my cleric needed aa's. Anyways I aa'd my cleric and bst and worked on them and grinded LDON points i got some leadership aa under my belt and enjoying them. <br />
<br />
Since i started grinding these leadership aa i stopped spending my AA (though i bought B&amp;M when natural regen3 was removed) now i've got 15 saved and should in a few days have 20 saved i was saving those aa's to get pet affinity. Since our recourses aren't landing on mobs and im not even using said recourses much anymore (not using aura of hate and having cleric heal pet so zbite not big deal) im wondering if pet affinity is still a good idea for me? I most 3box my sk, cleric , bst with my 65 wiz wife we sometimes grab a friend or 2 for the ldon but not often and never bards... Only benefits i see for getting pet affinity atm is to have a Spiritual Vigor land on the pet and to have pet get free HoV's rather then me having to cast virtue on it with my cleric... since i dont raid often (might on my new server not sure though raiding on VZ made me sick) mgb heals wont matter much...<br />
<br />
Im debating maybe getting 30aa for OoW then dropping points into WA3-5 as i hit the 30 aa mark but i've never liked to do that idea i always beleived that if i have the points i should spend them not save them for later... more power now you know... anyways would like some advise on what i should do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you use your pet, it's a great AA to get. In addition to the group spells you mentioned, bards songs can land on him, as well as your own Zevfeer's Bite and Aura of Hate.<br />
<br />
That being said, I would make sure that you have 30 AA's saved for Omens. Also, the WA line can be very good (depending on the proc your weapon has). If you think you can crank out some AA's in the next month, it's worth getting Pet Affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well... if all you do is 3 box and never group with bards, and you don't use aura of hate, then there really isn't much benefit in getting pet affinity. spiritual vigor, the random focus, and zevfeer's on your pet aren't really worth 20aa.<br />
you could always spend those AA on a permanent +30 mr and +10 FR/CR or whatever.</div></div><hr />
