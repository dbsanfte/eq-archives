So if we have a pet that double attack and duel weilds 50+ AA should be pretty easy just killing some Light Blue's correct?.

<br />
Another question... at level 61 i hear that the con system changes alot.. so what i have heard is to get 60.9 and put the rest into AA until your satisfied, then move on... is that true? Is that the fastest and most efficient way to get AA?<br />

Hi<br />
<br />
if so can you answer a question.....<br />
Sure, but somehow i have the feeling that will be much more than one.<br />
<br />
So if we have a pet that double attack and duel weilds 50+ AA should be pretty easy just killing some Light Blue's correct?.<br />
Easy, yes.<br />
Extremely slow, yes.<br />
<br />
I mean if an AAxp is a level 51 level then killing a light blue at level 60 should be about even to a level 51?<br />
If a lvl 51 player kill a lvl 44 mob, this lvl 51 player get full xp off that mob (its dark blue to him). A lvl 60 player however would only get the light blue xp from that mob (like 25-50% or something of the xp this mob would give if it was dark blue : theres a huge penality on light blue xp).<br />
<br />
.. if so our pets should ownerize the mob quick...<br />
The pet we get at lvl 58 is a lvl 37 warrior. Its still weaker than a light blue mob, but yeah, it would deal its fair share of damage.<br />
<br />
Another question... at level 61 i hear that the con system changes alot.. so what i have heard is to get 60.9 and put the rest into AA until your satisfied, then move on... is that true?<br />
When you hit lvl 61, i believe the only dark blue mobs are the lvl 50-60 (at lvl 60, the dark blue being lvl 45-59). Once at lvl 65, the dark blue are lvl 55-64.<br />
<br />
Is that the fastest and most efficient way to get AA?<br />
The fastest and most efficient way to get AA is to hit lvl65 asap then get in good groups to get those AA.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60, two boxing with an enchanter (the enchanter being groupless, only there for the slow, haste, c3 and bedlam, so i was basicly pwr lvl'ing myself), i would get an aa every 2h-2.5h.<br />
<br />
At lvl 65, in a regular group, i can get an AA every hour or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An aa every hour or so with a regular group? :-p  Where are you exp'in at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoF, yellow/red cons area.<br />

More like an hour and half that a straight hour mind you, but still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not gonna use quotes, but I should be able to answer your question(s).<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm 64 Iksar working on 65.<br />
<br />
Your pet, no matter how high level you are (64 pet is very nice), it will never be able to solo a mob that can get you experience. Not even your FIRST pet. Your pet after the 20s is green to you, right? (I've been 50+ for over a year now, I can't remember). So, it's the 'same' as a warrior, but it's green. So it's not going to be able to kill anything on it's own that is even lt blue.<br />
<br />
About the 61+ arena. I don't know how much level experience it takes to get one AA point. What I do know is that mobs that con dark blue to you in 61 (that you can solo ie flies near the entrance of PoD) will con lt blue to you at 62. The REALLY bad thing is that the amount of XP you get from it GREATLY diminishes. At 61, I was getting 2-3% AA from each kill (solo). At 62, I was getting 1% or less (that's with 100% AA). That's a pretty big difference for just one level.<br />
<br />
So, you think &quot;I'll just stay at 60 and rack up the AAs!&quot; But, this is not the best way to get powerful. First thing is that the higher level you are, the better you are at tanking, resisting (such as AoE spells), hitting, and you get more and more powerful spells as you level. AAs give you nifty things like criticals and mana regen. These all have their place, but levels will always be more powerful than any AAs.<br />
<br />
Second thing is that it will be hard for you to get to the Teir 2 planes being level 60. It's not impossible, but it will be MUCH easier for your group to flag you if you are above 61, the higher the better. Once you get to Teir 2, the XP is MUCH easier better. I solo the GY frogs in PoS all the time. I get 1-2% per kill (and it's  about 9% AA I've heard). It takes me about 15 minutes to kill a frog, but it's better than sitting in PoV shouting &quot;64SK LFG&quot; for an hour. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you in deciding how you want to allocate your XP :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Overall best exp would be in POE except for the Buggy pathing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The pet at 60 is the level 58 pet spell and its the same spell necro's got at level 44.  It summons a ~40 level pet so no it won't be able to tank light blue mobs at 60.  Also the pets never have the same ATK and AC as a same level player so even the stuff they fight has to be light blue to the pets level.  <br />
<br />
Now as for you idea I am sure you were thinking of parking yourself somewhere that light blues are and let the pet loose.  Well this is already nerfed too.  If you just stand there with your pet your gonna get hit eventually,  you can't sit either that just makes you higher agro than your pet.  And finally if you bring up a pet and feign this will only work for a few mins before the pet will poof.  Necro's use to pull this trick a couple years back so its been a long time nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm glad to see it's taking someone else 15 minutes to solo a frog, i heard people sayin like 8 and was like how in the hell... Pet's are to be considered a DoT btw, they can't take a hit even the higher ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My pet (the 58 one, should be level 38 i believe) was PWNED by a level 33 BST in duel. Just to let you see how bad they tank.<br />
<br />
However when i am tanking it still adds 7-15dps when buffed up good (speed of vallon :p)<br />
<br />
Now at 60, i still need to parse him with our new uba pet buff, but i notice an increase in his dps :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Random mobs in HoH now summon, to stop bards from swarm-kiting there.  Yeah, you can still solo there, but its a pain in the ass.   Used to be nice to just take the 2 guards at zonein and kite them through the graveyard, but as soon as one of them spawns that summons, you gotta move somewhere else or just solo 1 mob every 30 mins or so till that second one spawns as a summoning mob.</div></div><hr />
