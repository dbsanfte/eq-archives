<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a DSL line with a Linksys router.  My machine is up to date with 2 gigs of ram.  Two weekends ago everthing was fine.  I could duo on machine and have a 3rd character on my laptop.   Now I am being disconnected from both machines within 5 minutes after my characters come up.  I have not made any major changes.   Both machines have up to date drivers and the latest direct X.  Earthlink is my ISP.  I can surf the web fine.  Anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is 2 things i can think of and which i always experienced.<br />
<br />
1) Patch your EQ, if ur using WINEQ or some other program, they don't run the patch, so you have to open ur original EQ file, patch, close, wineq and so on...<br />
<br />
2) You or other computer in your network (with router) are downloading stuff. My case is that even im downloading something else under 5kb/s, my EQ still disconnect (i know, that sucked). I am using cable modem though, donno if it's the same case as DSL. If you aren't downloading anything, try kill some spyware program, it might have affect with network traffic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">download and install teh firmware update for your router.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a Linksys router for about a month, and after messing with all the settings, the firmware, and everything else, i couldn't get that bastard to work with EQ. Pissed me the hell off.<br />
<br />
I returned it and got a router with the same functions, but from Netgear, and haven't looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">port triggering, ports 1024 to  700, app name Everquest.<br />
<br />
Read your manual to learn how to use port triggering.<br />
<br />
I've had two linksys routers, and this worked on both of them.<br />
<br />
BTW..this is all due to how linksys routers firewalls work...namely they treat any incoming traffic froma IP/port that was not started internally, it blocks it.<br />
<br />
How that works is Sony sends a special &quot;ping&quot; to you, and if you get that ping, you send backa special &quot;pong&quot;.  What's happening is the router is blocking that ping, so the server never gets your pong, therefore it  assumes your LD, and cuts your connection....therefore making you LD.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that Netgear routers don't have this issue though, if that is of any relevance whatsoever here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're looking to buy a router, Here's my advice:<br />
<br />
-Netgear is good for the most part.  I only have minor issues with them.<br />
-My friend who uses linksys is having all sorts of problems and had to call in a guy from his ISP to get everything to work.<br />
-For wired networking my Netgear RP114 is cheap and never resets, can leave it on 24/7 and not get dropped.  Fabulous piece of hardware.<br />
-For wireless I got a netgear WGT624 but I got shafted with V1 of the hardware, which resets itself every 6 hours or so, no big deal.  I hear version 2 fixes this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had this Linksys BEFSR81 for years and haven't had any issues with it.<br />
Have zero entries in Port Forwarding or Triggering and Firmware hasn't been flashed since I got it.<br />
<br />
If everything was working fine a couple weeks ago and now it's not, obviously something got changed somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bulack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi when did you update your video driver?<br />
<br />
I was having the same problem after I updated my driver. I have a Nivda video card and after updating to newest driver  that was put out on the 24th I had messed up facial graphics and tons of LD's. <br />
<br />
I just reinstalled my old driver and works great not one LD all night.</div></div><hr />

i have the Netgear FM114P, which is a slightly higher end model, awesome peice of hardware.  The firewall works right, all the time, even stops that damn windows messenger spam bullshit, the wireless is strong and fast, the integrated printserver uses unix print services, so it works on all operating systems and has the lowest latency of any printserver I have seen outside of an actual rackmount unit.  Heck It even has DMZ support,  so I can run an MP3 server so I have decent music to listen to at work.....all for $180....two years ago.</div></div><hr />
