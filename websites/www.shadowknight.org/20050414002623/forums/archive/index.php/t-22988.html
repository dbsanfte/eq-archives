<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olkhen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i cant find posts about this.<br />
<br />
as far as i know HT is magic based.<br />
is Imp.Ht magic based or disiese? and curse leech?<br />
<br />
and second question: what items with improve damage are good for sk? so far im using war crested ring. but stats sucks on this ring, i want something better. and which is more useful for sk increase magic damage (lifetaps) or disiese damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Improved harm touch is unresistable, and as such will not work with disease-based focuses, magic-based focuses, or any other focus except for ID1-4, or the Solusek line (all spell damage). Even using disc + IHT, it's still unresistable.<br />
<br />
As for focuses, can't really tell you what to go for, as I have no idea what stage of the game you're at. Personally, I have a magic focus, and a War Crested Ring that I switch in for 3 seconds while I blow HT, then pop it back out. There is a mask from RZ with a solusek focus on it, as well as a few pieces in Time I think. There are a couple in GoD, it all depends on where you are and what (if) you raid.</div></div><hr />
