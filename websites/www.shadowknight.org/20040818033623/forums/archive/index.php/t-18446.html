<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pbenedetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone I am new to this site and am very impressed with the info posted here.  I was curious if anyone here knows of any good midlevel quests for a 41 level Shadowknight. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hya, from the top of my head the only quest i c u can do or start at mid level (around 30), are :<br />
<br />
* Darkforge<br />
* Soulfiend lance<br />
* Greenmist (1st steps anyway)<br />
* electrum ring (LoY quest in gunthak)<br />
* Luclin twilligth armor<br />
* sarnak braids in OT (faction and XP)<br />
<br />
i might be missing a few, but thats about the major ones.<br />
<br />
- Luclin armor is not thats good u can buy better in bazaar IF u have the money OR the time to farm for cash.<br />
<br />
- Sarnak braids is very nice for raising VS faction although now with luclin and pop its not very important anymore (exept to get the TPing hammer &quot;worker sledge hammer&quot;)<br />
<br />
- Darkforge is nice and cheap armor and some parts r requierd for the Epic (helm, BP and legs)<br />
<br />
- the electrum ring is well worth the effort (in my opinion) AC, STR DEW HP and SvMagic for free ...<br />
<br />
- Greenmist is pretty good but u need to work on your faction<br />
<br />
- The soulfiend lance is a nice weapon (procs DOT lifetap) i did solo at 35 but with the old CT. i m sure some will say u can buy better in bazaar, and they would be right, but questing the weapon yourself brings a nice feeling when u wield it after. (and u can always sell it later) but u will need to raise paineel faction for it.<br />
<br />
I did not get into the details, because u can find them pretty easily in allakhazam or by using the search  feature .<br />
<br />
Good questin to u...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I assume that there's a lizard on the Tae Ew island that drops the lance needed for the Soulfiend.  I just wish I could remember which lizard to look for, since I had camped once, before they revamped CT into a 50+ zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wwxc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its the spiritualist by the obelisk on the island. I think thats his name, anyway, he spawns by that pillar thing on the point of the island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good.  I remember that when he was in CT, he dropped the lance and decaying armor pieces.  I hope he still drops those armor pieces.  It's time to get the right decaying leg plate and decaying pieces for the helm and boots.  I want to boots stuff, since I have a bit of faerie dust in the bank that I want to use up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is the spiritualist who drops the lance for the beginning of the soulfiend quest.  From what I remember, he dropped it almost every time I killed him.  If you want a complete walkthrough of the Darkforge, you can do a search on this board for a thread I wrote about it at the time, it should have all the information you need for that quest, and much of what you need for the soulfiend lance quest.<br />
<br />
Note though, that unless you are dead set against seal running for faction, you don't really absolutely need the darkforge armor for the epic.</div></div><hr />
