<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just recently managed to acquire a Royal Attendant Helm of Sand (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44301), and while I am very pleased with the stats and such, much to my disappointment I discovered that it displays as a &quot;cloth&quot; (or &quot;no graphic&quot;) item.<br />
<br />
If I were any other race but erudite, this would probably please me.  As it is, it is a huge bummer.  For those of you who might not have noticed, erudites wear this absurd looking purple robe when we aren't wearing a piece of head armor.  When we're completely unequipped it doesn't look so bad, but when we're wearing a breastplate, it looks absolutely silly.  Erudites are the only race as far as I'm aware that wear anything on their heads when they're naked (aside from little cosmetic /face things like circlets and eyepatches).<br />
<br />
Even worse, browsing lucy, I see that ornate (not that ornate would be an upgrade) and elemental SK helms (and I presume cleric/paladin helms) also are &quot;cloth&quot; graphics.  Horrible.  I don't know if this aesthetic theme carries over into GoD/OoW, but I doubt I will be getting upgrades from those expansions any time soon.<br />
<br />
This really bugs me, as appearance is the primary reason I chose erudite as the race for my SK.  Mind you, I chose the race before the release of Luclin and the huge foreheads and keyring helms--both of which I could tolerate, because otherwise it made our characters look even better--with this one glaring exception.  I find it really galling that my character looks the way he does now. :(<br />
<br />
Anybody agree?  Got any paladin or cleric erudite pals who agree?  Maybe have them e-mail Sony and /feedback.  I know that there is an erudite Luclin model for the head which doesn't include the hood--I used to be able to get it to display (from my point of view at least) when I switched out my armor in the right order, but I can't seem to get that to work anymore.  But in any event, it wouldn't mean any extra design work for Sony--all they'd have to do is make it so when an erudite is wearing a cloth head item, it displays the hoodless model.<br />
<br />
Not Top 10 material, granted, but something that's pretty irritating nonetheless for those of us who are vain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Senelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, honestly I think Erudites look silly no matter what armor they have on, that forehead is extreme. But I understand caring about the way your character looks. If you really want your helm to show up as plate, equip the plate helm graphic, cast lich, while liched put on the helm with better stats, click off lich. You retain the plate graphic on the helm. It's a big pain in the ass to have to do every time you zone though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Diseased Skull case gave a non towel head graphic on Erudites at one point (saw someone with no helm nor towel and had to ask), that was 6months - 1 year agoish, not sure if that is still the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hm, thanks, I'll try that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Diseased Skullcase still has no hood graphic. I used to have one on my Magelo, but I changed it since I changed guilds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crynus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the lich trick also works with putting on a robe graphic while wearing a plate BP $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vogar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right now I am wearing that rock helm from the Hole.  Not the greatest out there but it also has no graphic but I dont get the robe either.  Not lookin forward to upgrading it if I get the robe hood back.  Might have to complain to sony about, oh wait this is sony we are talking about  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zefan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BUMP - Does anyoen know of any other helms that have this effect. Not the no helm but the no helm and no robe effect? I think that would look sweet on my AWESOME Erudite Shadow Knight! Go Erudites!</div></div><hr />
