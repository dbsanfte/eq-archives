<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got this browser hijack that keeps pointing my homepage to about:blank and loading up some search engine as my home page with all sorts of links to buy their wonderful anti-spyware program, assholes. Anyway, spybot and ad aware aren't cutting it, suggestions?<br />
<br />
Edit: www.spykiller.com seems to be where it wants me to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel your pain.  Ad-Aware, Spybot, SpySweeper etc. are ok-ish but full of holes which stuff like Coolweb goes right through.<br />
<br />
I won't insult you by asking if you've clicked the &quot;check for updates now&quot; link or suggesting you wait till they update their data files to detect it, because without going into details, that probably won't help.<br />
<br />
You have 2 options:<br />
<br />
1)  Report it on the tech support forums of http://www.lavasoftsupport.com/ (read their advice for making full logs first).<br />
<br />
Almost invariably they'll immediately tell you to download Hijackthis and what to edit to fix your problem.  (After they've moaned a little about not posting your log with the correct scan options etc.)<br />
<br />
2)  Download Hijackthis and edit it out yourself.  Quickest solution if you're a pro technician heavily into the details of registry / DLL / BHO setups but otherwise will cause much more harm than good.<br />
<br />
Luck with it - hope they get you sorted out soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sadly, I don't really remember what I did to get rid of it :/ I  tried a ton of shit, I know I ran adaware and spybot S&amp;D a bunch, updated the definitions on both, but not sure what else I did..<br />
<br />
sorry, but believe me, I know exactly how you feel and wish I could be more helpful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Macafee virus scan has a spyware portion. We had the exact same problem and we had Norton Antivirus, which did dick. Bought Macafee and it took care of it, well seemingly anyway. I normally wouldn't care much but unchecked it got to the point that it slowed EQ, and that friends, is intolerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go download Hijack This, run it, make a log, post the result here.<br />
Also look for CWShredder, run that first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, run Hijack This and google every single entry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rackasaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could install RegCleaner <br />
<br />
http://www.worldstart.com/weekly-download/archives/reg-cleaner4.3.htm<br />
<br />
Then , you can easily see what programs are loading on startup - find the one that is screwing you over and remove it.<br />
<br />
-=Rackasaur=-<br />
<br />
p.s. dont screw with your regisrty much if you dont know what you're doing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i had a really annoying browser hijack. i ran CWS, Spybot, and adaware with no results. then i needed to reinstall Dietk and that actually detected and cleaned it, along with a few other things the others didnt find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wouldn't use the registry cleaner. Does more harm than good alot of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xorrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You could also download a new browser, i would recommend Mozilla- firefox. you can download it at www.Mozilla.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scaramanga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just had the same problems on one of my computers, fixed it by running the CWShredder first:<br />
<br />
http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/cwschronicles.html<br />
<br />
Then get HijackThis and run the scan.  Instead of googling every entry (it will work, but takes too long), go to this site for links to all the things HijackThis finds:<br />

Good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks guys, wil try this stuff when I get home, gonna be away until next Thursday. Normally I leave my machines on turned em off this time though for fear of what might happen with this crap left unchecked. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stinger<br />
Spyware Blaster<br />
Spybot Search and Destroy<br />
IM Secure<br />
AVG <br />
<br />
I run AVG and spyware blaster all the time <br />
and every few days I run spybot  and stinger  and I get absolutely no pop ups....none of that shit ever..<br />
<br />
 I also switched to Mozilla firefox browser and Im liking it alot better ...sorry Im too lazy to put links but all of the aforementioned is common FREE products.<br />
 Good Luck</div></div><hr />

My most recent incursion with spyware took over my browser (IE) start page, locking it to a search, added a popup, blocked every popular anti-spyware sight,  and would NOT be removed with Spybot 1.3, Adaware 1.6 (I think the version is correct), nor Norton's Anti-virus 2004 (updated).  Norton's does check for spyware and removes it.  The spyware additionally did not allow Mozilla to be run (it installed fine).  :)  Joy.<br />
<br />
I fixed it by reinstalling XP over the current version.  No fdisk or format, just change boot to CD and use the recovery disk and choose install over current version.  This won't remove any directories except what's under &quot;windows&quot;.  Then all you need is your drivers.  Some programs needed to be reinstalled (not eq thank god), but generally you can just put shortcuts back on your start menu/desktop.<br />
<br />
This destructive misuse of my bandwidth should be against the law.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try starting in safe mode and just deleting/uninstalling it outright. You may have to find out the name of the .exe program first, usually it is different than what icon/end product that ends up on your desktop though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had the same problem awhile back.  Mine started with the ncase virus and spiraled from there.  What I would suggest is that you use a little of everyone's suggestions.  I used the hijack one, the ad-aware one, cwshredder, etc.  Each picked up a little that others didn't.  Also, I did a search for ncase and found a couple of threads on the internet that gave good instructions on which files to delete from your registry.  The key is deleting the files from your registry, as the files you delete in other areas are triggered by master files in your registry and despite deleting the file, it will replace itself when you restart your computer.<br />
<br />
  Hope some of this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">it will replace itself when you restart your computer. <br />
<br />
Exactly, and it will probably be running and no tlet you delete it because it's in use, which is why it's best to start to safe mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fheyaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I too just got this nasty browser hijack yesterday.  The replys you have received are all good suggestions, but they need to be done in the proper order to remove this nasty bugger.<br />
<br />
1) Download Hijack This! (http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/files/hijackthis.zip) and CWS Shredder (http://209.133.47.12/~merijn/files/CWShredder.exe)<br />
2) If using XP turn off system restore<br />
3) Boot into safe mode<br />
4) Run Hijack this and remove any lines that look similar to the following:<br />
     a)    R1 - HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Search,SearchAssistant = file://C:\DOCUME~1\Username\LOCALS~1\Temp\sp.html<br />
     b)   R0 - HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Search,SearchAssistant = file://C:\DOCUME~1\Username\LOCALS~1\Temp\sp.html<br />
     c)  R1 - HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main,HomeOldSP = about:blank<br />
     d) and any .dll in the Hijack This! log (not the dir) that is not associated with a known program and is showing up directly in the path X:\WINDOWS\system32\xxxxx.dll  (the dll is randomly named by the malware)<br />
<br />
 ***Username above will be the currently logged on user and substitute the appropriate drive letter for X above ***<br />
<br />
5) Delete the appropriate .dll from the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory.<br />
6) Run CWS (CWS found that the hijack  had actually modified my Windows Media Player and I had to remove it and reinstall it)<br />
7) Reboot into Windows normal and make sure browser loads normally<br />
8) Run a virus scan<br />
9) Re-enable System Restore<br />
<br />
This should get rid of the hijack for you.<br />
<br />
If you are still having problems  though  head to the Broadband Reports security forum (http://www.dslreports.com/forum/security) and I am sure they can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, between Spybot, Adaware, Hijackthis and some laziness (waited for an adaware update) I think I got the worst of this crap gone. Still hammering at the few remaining annoyances. Thanks guys</div></div><hr />
