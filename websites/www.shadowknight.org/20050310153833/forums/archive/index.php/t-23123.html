<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, has anyone obtained this piece yet?<br />
<br />
Moreover, has anyone gotten into Anguish for any info? Currently only 3 signets away, but having trouble in RS and getting people to go into catacombs / sewers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i finished signet quest like 1 week ago, and anyway isnt access its just a perma protection againt the rapeass ae that supposed to be in anguish.<br />
<br />
for anguish access as far u need all the 6 runes ( wich u obtain  by doing trials ), but since no one beat all 6 atm , that is still another supposition ( even tho its liek 99% true ).<br />
<br />
Maybe u need also the single group version added to the raids one , since on the single group u get ''trials of mata muram '' aa wich raise ur resist and no runes ). well we gonna see it soon.</div></div><hr />

Rumor has it the trials are &quot;broken&quot;, which is supposedly to keep people from accessing CoA before SOE wants them to/ is done with the zone. The same suspiscion surrounded the Tacvi bugs that were supposedly fixed not too long ago. Can anyone confirm/deny this?</div></div><hr />

funny rumour<br />
<br />
single trials are broken as in u dont keep the reward  of ''trial of muramites '' wich enhanced ur resist cap ( tho no one knows for sure if they are needed for anguish ).<br />
<br />
raid trials arent broken at all  5/6 trial been beaten only hate missing , and that cuz is hard ( and this oenare supposed to grant ya access to anguish ,but since  no one finished yet  its not 100% sure ).<br />
<br />
Signet quest is somethign u need to  get to be in anguish and it works np ( at least i did it and got the  message vs ae  ).</div></div><hr />

english Mother Fucker, Do You Speak It???<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally, I'd prefer a simpler/nicer way of saying it but... yeah... damn... that took 4-5 readings and I have a GENERAL clue, but I'm still not really sure what the hell he said....</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe ok assholes not my fault if u have no clue at all of what  trials are  ill give a a glimpse.<br />
<br />
there are  six  trials in MPG ,  both can be done in raid ( 54 ppl max) or in group.<br />
Raid  trials on victory gives you a rune,  wich is supposed to be part of the key  to CoA. <br />
Endurance,Corruption,Foresight,Specialization, Adaption and Hate( since u too dumb to understand that those are the names of the trials ) and all of those been beaten beside Hate ( so they not broken ).<br />
<br />
Single group trials, are broken . When you win you  get a new aa skill open , called  ''Trials of mata muram''  wich raise your resist cap by 8 point x trial , but u loose that AA after 1 day or so.<br />
<br />
Better now stupid fucker ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I understood the trials part, I think we were both referring to your horrid treatment of the English language. The grammar, spelling, and sentence structure of the post rendered it nearly incomprehensible. In other words: What did the English language ever do to you.<br />
<br />
Now, speak like a normal goddamn being. The biggest complaint being &quot;u&quot;... it's THREE LETTERS, all of which sit in a four letter line on your keyboard. Does it REALLY save you that much time?<br />
<br />
Edit: Further edit, a qoute to prove the point, I believe:<br />
<br />
 and that cuz is hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ya that is gimp talk ( slang call it  how uwant ) i use to write fast , and no english isnt my main language , but at least im able to speak  and understand more than just 1 language.<br />
<br />
grammar wise, ya  that's  fucked up ( at times &gt;&lt; ) more or less cause i dont pay much attention when i have to answer  gimps  question ( or im stoned ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
aye 6 guild in anguish atm , mine included, didnt  try to raid yet as 80% lack the signets quest , tho i heard  there are some ''voices'' about removing it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heck leave the signet quest in the game.  Or make it so one completed quest protects the whole group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aye i agree too, atm tho if you dont have signet , cant even zone in ( dunno if that is wanted, or a bug , as taromani said it was to get a permanent protection against zone ae ).<br />
<br />
Anyway is kinda easy  to get it done fast even for gimps groups ( well maybe beside ruined city instances ) with multi phs each zone etc , so well it isnt much of a filter .</div></div><hr />
