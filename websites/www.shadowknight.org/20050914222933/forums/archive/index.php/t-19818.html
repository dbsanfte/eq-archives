<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blargon</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have enough hp/ac to tank a hard LDON easily enough, but I was grouping with my bst friend who usually does normals with me, and he made the group, but didn't think to include a puller.  The assumption was that I'd plow (i.e., tank AND pull for same adventure).  That would be okay on normal, but I felt fester + feign would be woefully inadequate to split the repeated 4 mob trains that hits for 1k apiece and then get up to tank quick enough to get through the adventure in 90 minutes (preferably half that or less).  I felt a bit stupid but ended up having a ranger pull and also kite the adds.   Here's where I have to tip my hat to paladins, they're so much better suited to this than us.  Root + pacify = frequently no need for mez, and definitely no need to stay pinned on their ass for minutes waiting for the split to happen.  So I can understand what my beastlord friend was thinking, probably having done lots of hards with paladins in my guild plowing through hards (one in particular, who's #1 on the server in hard wins), all the while being kind of oblivious as to why they can.  So my question is this:  are we that much worse off than paladins for hard plowing?  Or do other sk's fester/feign their way through or find some better approach to plowing through hards efficiently?  Any suggestions?  Or just always recruit a bard...</div></div><hr />

Hell there was a cleric who tanked last night with a slower and nukers as the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Can Sk's be effective pulling hards? Sure, no doubt about it. Might just take a little practice for you to get a rythm. Point is so can other classes, lots of them, many who aren't viewed as traditional pullers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blargon</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not really the pulling in and of itself... I know I could do that, but I was tanking also.  Most likely if I was pulling, I'd spend a lot of time on my ass and telling people to tag.  But when I'm the tank, that doesn't work so well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer will be subjective on gear and the make up of the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
In most cases just pull, you will get 1-3, occasionally 4 or more, but in that case just split them. With 1-3 per pull anyone on CC should be able to handle it, be it a messer or rooter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my shaman I got addicted to hard adventures, and I love having an SK puller.  They cast  run towards group fd half way there, I wait for the unsnared ones to get out of agro range a bit and slow pull the snared one.  Sk gets ups and takes agro well before I get hit.  <br />
<br />
It takes some timing and a little practice but might work with your bl friend too, though I'd practice a bit before putting a leather wearing class in the position to get beat on.<br />
<br />
edit: Works best in MM adv other places mobs are packed a bit tight.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I could tank and pull quick enough to win.  Whenever I've tanked, its been a bard or monk pulling.  Paci is resisted just too often and that brings far too many mobs at once.<br />
<br />
Pet pulling seems like you would just lose too many pets, but I haven't tried pet pulling during a hard adventure.<br />
<br />
Easiest dungeon to pull seems to be Rujarkian (EC)...nice long hallways, few casters.  Also not many enrage or have DS.</div></div><hr />

and i agree nro sucks, my fav to pull in is BB (for obvious reasons)</div></div><hr />

Those doors fucked me over once, but we still won w/ like 30 mins.  And this was using the traditional fd spliting technic.  I think it may have something to do w/ the dungeon, and adv.  We only had to do a 20 collect with minimal death so, but my group was made up of enc, sham, pal, sk, cleric, and ranger, with me pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as an SK, it's much easier to either be puller or tank in hard adventures... if you have to be both, try to do MM or ruj adventures, as there's less splitting involved</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried a hard for the FIRST time last night in Rujarkian Hills; and as everyone said, it's quite a step up from normals.  All of us (except for one person who had tagged along on an uber-guild's hard adv before) were as nervous as all heck.<br />
<br />
End result was a win with no deaths, but I thought we were in deep kaka when the very first mob had me down to 40% hp in about 5 seconds (I have ~5600 hp / 1500 ac).  Every hit on me seemed to have that bone-crunching sound, the sound you hear when you are dangerously low on hp (must be a max hit sound I guess).  Only had about 15 mins to spare on a 29 collect, only killed 35 mobs.  So I guess a slaughter is not the way to go for us, based on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vezax</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive tanked one Ruj adv.  Let just say if your in the buffed 7700 hp 1450 ac LR4 ID 3, mob still beat on you pretty rough.  I had 2 ch land not as CH, one landing at 138 hp, the other at 200ish (this happened when I had more then 1 pull with 2 or more mobs beating on me unslowed.)  It was a wake up call =P.  <br />
<br />
With that said, I went in with a group where all but 2 people didnt have any experience with hard adv, and one of the 2 who did only had hard experience with his wizzy (he was playing the chanter for this adv.)<br />
<br />
Some of the pulling things which made thing s go easier.  I had the chanter /assist me for a target to mezz, then I got a target for each extra add to be rooted by other group members.  Its slow, but it made a lot of pulls easier.  Did a collect 21, used about 10-15 min in over time to finish.  Could probably do it, but the first run through we were being extra careful.<br />
<br />
Id really suggest being about 7500 hp 1400 ac (buffed) and at least maxed archtype defensive AA before you try one, or nab a great puller who only gets singles quickly. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vincente</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, I thought a paladin's max pacifying mob level was 55.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=45&amp;source=Live Thats their last pacify spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frotty</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pulling, feigning having someone not tank tag, then you get up and tank is risky at best depending on the levels of your group. IMO if your group is strong enough to do this method efficiently you could just pull 2, have one kited / pet mezzed / rooted, etc and take the other one. <br />
<br />
In EF the pulls weren't bad for me, and we could have done it if we hadn't wiped in the beginning on an unsplittable mob that wouldn't root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nambkab</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, all you folks talking about 7k+ hp and 1400+ac to tank hards are being too cautious.  Had a group a few nights ago that wanted to do a hard, and with my 6.6k buffed hp (beastlord buffs instead of shammy) and 1351ac before AoP, I was pretty concerned.  I informed them of my hp/ac, and my aa status (ca2, cs2 being the relevant stuff), and the cleric said I'd be fine, so we went ahead and tried it.  We won a collect 23 with 10 minutes to spare.  I died 3 times, but first time was when the cleric clicked the zone out, second time the cleric was busy looting and didn't time the cheal properly, and third time was my fault when I missed the rage message while clicking off haste.  So with a solid group that isn't rushing things, you can do a hard with much less than what everyone is claiming :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynxal</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Winning a collect 23 with 10 minutes left doesnt mean anything.....what was the kill count.  We have finished collect 20s in 25 minutes killing 30 mobs and we have finished collect 20s in just shy of 2 hours for partial points with most of the dungeon cleared and 1.5AA to show for it.  <br />
<br />
If you go slow and take your time and have multiple deaths like you did......you won't win more than 50% of those hards.  So until you get to the point of 7k+HPs and 1400+AC you probably are better off sticking to normals and cranking through wins every 40 minutes.  It's not being too cautious it's being practical.  I am sure the Hard was a fun challenge for you but when you lose your next 3 in a row I would guess your group will start to get a little frustrated and the Hards won't seem as entertaining (unless you are also getting lucky with a named in the first 30 mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elkar</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me the key to winning in hards is not to wipe.  Having the MT die 3 times would certainly slow the group down to the point where winning would not be reliable at all.<br />
<br />
So although doable at your HP/AC, and probably exciting/fun, it just isn't practical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nambkab</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point was that barring that, we would have won in approx 40 minutes.  Our kill count was around 1 per minute other than the mass death from the cleric zoning out, and then my other two deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynxal</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our point is just that you can't say...&quot;barring that&quot;.  It's a pretty important &quot;that.&quot;  If you did not die you would have finished in 40 minutes.....but you did die and chances are you will always die because you are statistically under-geared for that content.  <br />
<br />
So, you can't use your example of HP and AC as a positive standard when you were lucky you had a collect with such a high drop count to make-up for the deaths and delays.  Most likely those deaths will add up to a lot of Hard losses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nambkab</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point taken Lynxal, hadn't really thought about it all the way through from the other side of the argument.  Ah well, back to the grind!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we dp DoN hard ones without a &quot;puller&quot; we use a BL to drop sslows on all the mobs and split tank.<br />
<br />
In our case we went in w/ both a Shaman and a BL backing me up(we also had a rog, a wizard, and a mage.<br />
<br />
We would often have 3 mobs at any given time, me and the rog on one, the BL on another and the mage &amp; BL pet on the 3rd  if there ever was a forth he would get root parked.<br />
<br />
I find myself plowing quite frequently, its just a matter of having the right backup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">britannia</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We won our first LDoN hard (Rujark collect) w/ me pulling/tanking with all of 5 min to spare.  Managed to get 3 nameds, all of which dropped huge upgrades for us bazaar players. I pet pulled everything, despite Jobaber essentially suiciding about 1/3 pulls.  Only got an add twice, both times my fault for when I tagged too close to a mob in aggro range.<br />
<br />
Wizard eye + pet pull = singles forever.  Is this the most efficient? No, but w/ our gear we get raped unless an add is mezzed immediately.  I'm looking for a way to speed up pulling, but until anything is as safe as pet pulling, I guess we'll stick w/ that.<br />
<br />
My magelo is in profile- fully buffed I hit 6300 hps and roughly 1450 AC w/ CA3, CS1 and PE.  By the time we got to the last named, virtue had been dispelled (no cleric in the ldons we do) and I was tanking a mob that mitigated slow and was doubling me for 1k, which was a blast w/ my 4800 hps.<br />
<br />
Both my friend and I were 2 boxing (me a shaman, him a wizard/enchanter) and it was np.  He also charmed which added serious dps.  I can't wait to do more of these, the gear for our level of play is phenomenal and it's the most fun I've ever had playing EQ.<br />
<br />
I look forward to reading more comments on others and the experiences they've had.</div></div><hr />

You really want to do LDoN hards for the first time, I suggest doing Rujarkian with snare pulling.<br />
<br />
Most are singles dotted along the nice long corridors.  If there is a double, there's plenty of room to snare one and run away, FD and let second reset.  Leave the firght early enough and you can bring singles all day long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rujark is incredibly easy to pull for us (or probably any other class).  There are very few rooms/tunnels that have bad mob placement for a feign split.  The last one I did, I died once on a named (as puller), received a battle rez about 20% into the mob (got a clean tag off of it when I died anyway, so was a successful pull), had regeared and received the necessary buffs before mob was down to 40% and was back out pulling the next.</div></div><hr />

Actually the mana is no big deal, mobs die so fast and mana regen is never an issue.  It's just the time it takes to resummon. I resorted to resummoning Jobaber as soon as the mob turned to run, that seemed to help a bit. Jobaber also has indoor sow, which is handy for faster pulls.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind we have no cleric- an add usually equals death, esp if the chanter is charming and cannot cc safely.  My biggest complaint is that pet pulling is slow.  My favorite pulls are while I'm FD, simply hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blargon</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I guess there are plenty of ways of getting by.  That's cool.  The main thing that I was thinking of that's so useful to pallies to pull hards is root, I'm no pally expert, but yeah you're probably right that their pacify is useless on mobs &gt; 55.  Root is like, one of the best ways to not pull an entire room when you're lacking mez, and it's your sole form of crowd control then anyway.  It's just such a quick and dirty thing to do, compared to what we have to go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found it difficult to FD split in LDoN.  I can do it, but it just isn't as efficient as paci pulling IMO.  Also, I find that FD works much less often in LDoN's with a lot of casters.  Once an add has me targeted and is a caster my FD almost never works, plus roots dont work on casters either unless you can root them out of casting range.....just my two-cents.</div></div><hr />

The diferance is that usually I am highest lvl in group with the lowest around three lvls below.  So though the mobs are white to red to the lower lvl they rarely exceed white to me.  I don't have uber gear all buffed I have around 5.4khp and 1300ac.  My favorite is to get a pally to heal little boner between pulls or even tag one if I have to FD.  The xp is much beter then normal and with a decent group well worth the drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elkar</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, paci on a 65 hard is a death wish.  We use it when there is no other option, but rarely.  Its resisted too often.  And when you get agro on a room full of mobs, its a dead chanter at the very least, and sometimes more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal... if I pull, it's not that common for me to even feign.  With my normal group makeup, it's only necessary with 5+.  Or the time when the only healer LD's for most the duration of the ldon.... and yeah, we won that one too =p.</div></div><hr />
