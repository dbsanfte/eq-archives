<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok was in Kael working on Coldain and COV faction with some peeps from my guild and an ally guild.  We had 18 and were on the right side of the arena pulling everything we could but vindi.  We had been in this spot for well over 5 hours and were having a great time.  A gentleman from another guild comes up and asks if we are doing Vindi and I told him no.  So about 30 to 40 mins later he pulls a giant into our midst and asks if we would like it.  Sure, we kill it no biggie.  We are sitting there an about 1 min later Vindi comes waltzing through our camp after this monk.  Monk heads towards the ramp and vindi paths back towards us like he ALWAYS does if your pulling from the arena.  Well once he got close to our group he starts whacking on everyone.  Just then in OOC I see.  &quot;Pulling Vindi&quot; nice of them  to say so AFTER he is killing my party.  Anyway we were able to hold argo long enough to keep vindi off the cleric to camp (we only had one cleric).  So we are all at zone in and this other guild is giving us crap about agroing their pull of vindi.  I guess it is beyond this guilds knowledge that you cannot damage vindi when you pull him or he summons.  Since you really have not established agro he will attack anyone you drag him near.  The only thing going through my mind is why the fuck they are pulling over us when the other ramp is clear.  So we bitch they bitch the usual stuff bs not nice stuff.  Our cleric camps back in rezzes the main group to handle the spawn in the corner and med for more rezzes.  Once again Vindi comes over and wipes out our party.  I FD and they get vindi down the ramp and eventually dead.  So in the end they come up and rez everyone with their clicker...how fucking nice.  It turns out that their dumbass of a puller failed to mention to the rest of their guild that another party of people was up that ramp.  So my rant is fucking pullers that don't know what the hell they are doing and guilds that let them pull. /boggle This moron is probalby telling all his buddies how he pulled Vindi last night and how ubbah he really is. /sigh Anyway to all those that have been pulled over by a fucktard I salute you.  I just hope that the guild that screwed you was as nice about it afterwards as this guild was.  Then again its amazing how nice people are after they get their loot and have nothing better to do then click 15 times.<br />

Dark, do you ever stop talking? It seems like every third post here is yours. Which wouldn't be such a bad thing if you didn't blather about nonsense. Honestly, did whats-his-face who made this post even say he was on Xegony, or even ask if any of you were in said guild, or even remotely hint that he was curious if you had your vindi boots? no.<br />
<br />
Next time you're about to post, just stop and think for a second.  <br />
<br />
[Begin Thinking] Does what I'm about to say have any correlation to what i'm responding to, or am I just writing this to listen to myself speak and bump my post count. [End Thinking]<br />
<br />
If the answer is No, hell even if the answer is Maybe, do us all (or at least me) a favor and hit the 'back' button on your browser instead of the 'reply' button.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

&quot;read Aaooga's fucking signature you halfwitted jacktard&quot;<br />

Yup, that i didn't do, I actually stopped reading the original post at about the second sentance, since it is a common and reoccuring story on every server. I was just browsing through the thread to see what people's responses here would be to the situation and stumbled upon dark's blabberfest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow someone took their self righteous pills when they woke up this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, not really. I just take offense to reading things that could make a person's IQ actually drop.<br />

&quot;I know mine doesn't matter, but hey, I don't need to cry and complain about people that frequently post simply because I think my shit doesn't stink.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think this is called a Rant forum, not a Spam forum, which is all I can see Dark doing. So I ranted a bit about it, it was in the proper place and I believe within the rules. So if it offended you, please accept my most humble I-don't-give-a-fuck.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

(yes sarcasm, but believe me, I'm not saying dark doesn't have every right to post in every thread as much as he wants. he most certainly does if it's within the rules. what I am saying, is that it pisses me off. and I have every right to bitch and moan as much as i like because of it)<br />

&quot;Grimiz - Out of 2 million wiggly tails you were the best one?&quot;<br />

Nice logic. Every child born with a birth defect must have been better than the other 2 million sperm that didn't happen to make it to the egg. Granted, I'm not a biologist or whatever, and defects probably come about during gestation as far as I know. But, it was a good attempt at a flame. no, not really.</div></div><hr />

Man how does anyone get that worked up over a message board?  Of course this is a rant section so bravo.  You have picked a respected member of the board and decided to make him your target.  Of course you don't care, you just decided to take on 6 or 7 people on at once.  The fact that you get angry that you see Dark posting on every topic here shows that you have some serious personality flaws.<br />
<br />
The pharmacutical industry has made some wonderful strides in recent years and may be able to help you out.  I am sure you can make an appointment and discuss these options with your physician.  Maybe you can get a referral to a psychiatrist.  <br />

Here is a prescription for a nice dose of Shut the fuck up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neato.<br />
<br />
You make me out to be some sort of raving psycho, foaming at the mouth.  My posts have been short, concise, and to the god damned point. Just because I use words like fuck, or pissed does not mean I'm angry at the world and hate my life. You seem to have first hand knowledge about self-help and drugs. Hope you got your life ironed out.<br />

<br />
All in all, think what you want of me.  If you don't like me posting lots, rant about it, doesn't hurt my feelings.... But realize, in the process, you squeezed another 3 posts out of me, so you've just been fuelling the fire you seek to put out  :p<br />
<br />
I'm at work, bored, and trying to keep myself busy with something I enjoy (like checking these message boards) so the time passes faster, and the day doesn't drag out to feel like an eternity.... If you wish to crucify me because of it, set me on ignore then.  May have to do the same for a good number of people as well... I don't think I'm the only who runs around these boards at work, looking for something to do</div></div><hr />

You said it angered you that Darkenesis makes a lot of post.  To become angered over such a trivial matter would indicate to me that you have some problems. <br />

Any jackass with a television realizes that there are more mood enhancing drugs than you really want to think about.  As for my state of mind, I am flaming people on a message board.  I think the nuts factor is implied.</div></div><hr />
