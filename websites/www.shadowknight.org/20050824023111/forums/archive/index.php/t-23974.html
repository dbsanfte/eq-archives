<br />
I am doing a 'semi' comeback to EQ after more than 1 year away.. from the little I see on the boards it seems many things have changed, no small thing being the reduced amount of players on the servers.<br />
<br />
As the reason for my leaving EQ in the first place was the lack of time I had to be in raids and such still holds I am wondering if anyone can give advice on places to solo at 61 or get into exp groups for short periods of time (1-3 hours). I had/have decent gear by the standards of a year and a half ago but it's probably crap now, although I did keep quite a bit of cash on my toon before quitting so I could buy gear in case of a comeback :)<br />
<br />
The last expansion I have is PoP.. I would buy another expansion of the 4 I am missing if it is worthwhile.. again any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thankee and much slaughtering :P<br />

<br />
LoY would be soloable, give exp and probably have upgrades to 1.5 year old gear.  That's the expansion I'd suggest<br />
<br />
LDoN is dying, skip it. GoD and OoW wouldn't have much content for a 62 w/ 1.5 year old gear (so save buying those until you gear/level up)<br />
<br />
Part of where I'd tell you to go would be based on gear needs.  Post a magelo in the armory - FOLLOW THE STICKIED RULES FOR POSTING<br />
<br />
Droga (it's revamped to be a 50-60+ zone) always has mages, necros and shaman on my server, see if you could pair up (upgrades there possibly to).<br />
<br />
People like Grieg's End (not me but some people do)<br />
<br />
Umbral planes is a HoT zone now - hot zones are zones that have been given a very high Zone Experience Modifier (ZEM).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad.<br />
<br />
With the revamping of lower level dungeons, LDoN is soon to be one of the better places to hunt from 20-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aphyon D'Veldrin</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go and solo in Veksar one my most favorite zones, can single there,nice xp ok pp per monsters 6-10pp,depending on the weapon you are using,3-5min fights, with 4-6mobs in each camp, you can kill goblins in the courtyard till the 2nd camproom in there,going beyond that is at your own risk,depending on your gear<br />
<br />
*Warning*Hunting in this zone constantly non-stop without a change of scenery will cause dementia,vomiting,diaherea,and homo-erotic desires*Warning*<br />
Griegs End, the Courtyard after the 3 room you invis through is a good place as well they hit very low dmg,give ok dmg for the time  you spend there, good aa, and good pp, no loot,really nothing you can use that is useful,from what ive killed,if you went deeper,towards a big gate that it's in the center of the zone with a dps class or priest based class you'd do even better,really everything you fight in there will give you good exp, you can work yourself around just clearing stuff<br />
<br />
Bloodfields (Oow Expansion if you have it) good zone from 58-61, chance at some runes,some other loot i can't recall there is good, and a good chance at soloing if you find a safe spot away from the main path where mobs roam youre good<br />
<br />
Velketor's Labryinth (The Top Camp or the Village) Those 2 camps are mostly trivialized now, the spiders at top are still  to db at 61 will turn lb at 62, the village everything still db at 62(have to be careful when you get prophets they CH like mad, but i think at 61 you would be able to single pull)<br />
<br />
Sebillis-if you arent scared of the possiblity of dying from bugged pathing this place is good to solo,and get some a nice PP bank going here *Tip* when the froglock wizards are nuking you run and fd,most likely the AoE rain they are hitting you with is gathering up for a train to you,NG camp is good a stable place to hunt entrance is ok but dangerous still,NG has you near the exit past the iksar golems<br />
<br />
PoN-Reverse Kiting with every high lvl dot you can use that stacks with a little mix of DD'ing the shit out the mob while it's snared<br />
<br />
POI-You could try this zone, they hit less for how much ac you got,if you havent broken 1100+ac at 61, it's not worth the mana here because you will only be Tapping mostly,to make up for the starter dmg the mob gets when you being the encounter<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye-Easy zone to solo in, especially the Coterie,dont fuck with the 4 armed guys or the skeletons, the Xi's are ok if they arent clerics or necro/sk,nice belt in the Ruins across from the entrance stairway if you can handle them(but then again i said not to fuck with the 4 armed guys so forget it) lol<br />
<br />
Mandatory: Use your pet,or Innoruuk will Castrate you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaedan</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback folks, I did look at the sticky on hunting grounds but thought it may be a bit outdated and too 'general'.<br />
<br />
My gear is SS quest armour plus a few better items in certain slots, Windblade/Greenmist as weaps, plunder eyepatch for extra haste and a Shroud of Dar Brood as regular haste item (34% I think), plus good (droppable) fingers and ears. Stonewood comp. bow in range and CoS (pre nerf).<br />
<br />
I also have around 150k pp in bank to chuck away on tradeable upgrades (I bet all my hard earned quest armor is dated now -not all of it was that good in any case).<br />
<br />
Sorry no Magelo, I never bothered when I was a regular player not going to start now heh.<br />
<br />
I am not going to do AA atm (got 12 or 13) so is buying a horse worthwhile?<br />
<br />
Last question, I have most of my cash from selling an amulet of necropotence before 'retiring'.. what is the going price nowadays? I always did like it :)<br />
<br />
Thankee again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moudis</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't see the point of getting another Amulet since you'd be able to lich for the same as KEI in a few more levels (64 - Pact of Hate) and get that illusion.  Same on the horse, it's mostly only good for traveling.  Pain in the ass to fight on, could spend that cash better on armor.<br />
<br />
As for xp, the above suggestions are pretty good.  Only decent thing to kite at 61 in Nightmare is gargoyles though, they can get messy.  Could kite PoStorms frogs as well on the north wall of the zone.  Would take awhile, but should still be worth a percent or two regular xp at 61.  For grouping, Valor and then BoT once you hit 62 would work alright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amulet of Necropetence, i remember still going for 15-25k, but you have to find someone to hussle it up to the full 25k,so it would take you a week or more in bazaar to pawn that puppy also post that youre selling it on your server MB and taking best offers<br />
<br />
As for a magelo, it's like a resume,so start messing around with it, it's not hard,run the magelo program while running EQ and it will mark down every item you have you just down the items buy item# in each slot listed in magelo looks exactly like your Inventory in-game<br />
<br />
As for AA's, you will find you need them alot more then you think in current game set,i would say hit 62,then go for all your aa's that you need IMO i go in this order Defense/Hps/Stat Enhancing/Planes AA's<br />
Defense will help alot since it will cut down the amount of time you will get hit by the mobs you are soloing, once you get the ones you need youre gonna wonder how the hell did i tank/solo without them<br />
<br />
Have fun and for weapon upgrades and armor and such look around in the armory great database for anything youre looking for</div></div><hr />

It takes 5 minutes and would help us answer your question.   Otherwise we've given all the answers we can.  Make a magelo, it's not any inconvinience to you and would help us.</div></div><hr />

Being 61 and only going up to PoP myself id say BEST xp bet for you is to grab a shaman and duo PoV caves... amazing XP, the pulls come so fast, you can keep yourself healed and all the shaman has to do is slow... just keep swinging and use your windblade, you wont need a shield for these guys. Good luck and dont ever get Stat AA's.</div></div><hr />

'cause, if so, OoW would still be a good invesment for the dropable loot alone.  Also, XP post 60 is gonna be best in PoP (particularly the highest tier zone you can get in to)</div></div><hr />

Kk, never really checked as I've always bought the xpansions upon release....would prolly follow what keev said and hold off on OoW then (and don't bother with GoD even if you are decently equiped unless you have a solid regular group/raid to utilize it).</div></div><hr />

Even if you are going for end game etc, if youre soloing those stat enhancing aa's will help out Sk's alot,it just sounds stupid to me, i would have ranted against the guy but he made my head hurt.. :(</div></div><hr />

No, stat AA's are gay for SK's....now if ya got 700 aa's and nothing left to use them on then go for it, but stat AA's should be a last resort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm talking about str/sta/agi/dex plus the planar aa's,class aa PE,those are gay ? those got good ratings in the AA report card<br />
<br />
What does PE have to do with your stat AA's?  PE is a mit/avoid % increase (which is good)....And why the fuck would you get dex even if the stats did matter?  Also, with buffs, the other stats can be maxed with ease (maxing them with gear really isn't that hard either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aphyon D'Veldrin</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked about PE because even though it is a mitigation booster it still boosts your Planar Durabilty percentage up as well<br />
<br />
Dex imo you can never have too much of to help with Soul Abrasion/Proc Spells and Melee Crits,imo with stat aa that raises your base stats by 5 points each lvl,it would help if you can't find any buffs when you go out to solo,sometimes if you put a gimp group together your base stats are what you have to deal with if you are just with a cleric/necro<br />
<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself about it's not hard maxing stats out with gear,for me it's hard cause im casual/social player, so i do minimum amount of Ldons/Quests/Instanced Zones etc so AA is my Tuner for my sk stats,it makes me a tolerable tank even though im gimped out (magelo is old,ive upgraded but still im gimped)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keevel</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While stat AA's are not completely useless on an sk, they will give less reward for the time spent then most other AA's.  <br />
<br />
so until you have circa 750+ aa's I'd avoid them.  I'd probably avoid them after that too as they are a very low return for the aa's spent.</div></div><hr />
