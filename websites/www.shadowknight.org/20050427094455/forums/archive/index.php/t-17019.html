<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, after much debate, I created a Iksar Shadowknight on Cazic Thule named *ta da* Aethir. I'd spent a bit of time before hand gathering some really good weapons to start with and set off on my first adventure.<br />
<br />
I literally leveled 7 levels in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I was coming out of Cabalis into the Field of bone when an eerie message appeared about an ancient evil settling over the swamp of no hope.<br />
<br />
So, I decided to check it out and lo and behold a group of people were gathering to take on Ithaosaur the Fallen (sp?), a Level 65 dragon hanging out in the caves to TT. So I walk in to grab some pictures and suddenly, I am invited on the raid! Me, a little level 7 joining up with a very big group of people to take on a level 65 dragon and his 2 level 58 dark ravagers!<br />
<br />
I swear, I'm tell you the truth!<br />
<br />
So, they buff the bejesus out of me, and my task along was to assist on the dark ravagers. Ok, so I jump in and I live! Mind you I only did about 10 damage to each but it was kinda cool. Then they pull the Dragon, I got one pic, charged hit him for 1pt of damage then he AoE'd me for 1200.<br />
<br />
Ouch...enough to kil me 3x times over and then some.<br />
<br />
So, I'm sitting at the Field of Bone thinking how much fun that was, when I get a rez. So, I accept and get brought back into the aftermath of the battle, where everyone was parading over the corpse of the Dragon. So, I go and loot the Dark Ravagers and one of them has a pair of Deathwing Leggings on it. 9ac +2sta, +2agi, +10hp, +15mana, and +8 vs. poison leather legs. Since I'm low man on the totem pole, I ask if anyone wants them, everyone kinda laughs because they're all level 58+ and tell me to take them. So I do, nice little souvenir I think. :D<br />
<br />
Congrats to Sservant the Necro, he got a necro only belt which was the only loot on the dragon.<br />
<br />
So I ask what's next and it is then I find out that this one was a warm up, now we had to fight his spirit; Ithaosaur the Black. Now this sucker was viscious. The whole group from before tackled him and he wiped us out. I had no chance as, he summoned me then AoE'd before I knew what was going on.<br />
<br />
That was then end of it for me and the rading party as we lost most of our healers and we didn't do too much damage to him. So we called it a night and everyone was getting a laugh out of me, since this was my first raid experience and at level 7 no less!<br />
<br />
So I thought I'd share that with everyone for a chuckle as I found it to be one of my funnest moments as an SK and in my total time in EQ for that matter. So I hope you enjoyed this little except.<br />
