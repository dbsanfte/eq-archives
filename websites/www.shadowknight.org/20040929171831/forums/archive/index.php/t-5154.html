<br />
I started a Ogre SK the other day and relocated to Neriak at level 5. I have been diligently saving my money and would like to buy some leather armor. Does anyone know if Large leather is available for sale in Neriak? If not, perhaps someone could tell me what level I could try to solo the ogre guards in Najena?<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maelmordha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That would be great if they did. So far none of the large races have received their new quests, Barbarians, Ogres and Trolls. Maybe we will get something! Good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fycellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought the ogre guards in Najena dropped large bronze armor.  At least the guard captain does. He is the highest level ogre in Najena, I think in the upper 20's. The Ogre guards are in the low 20's I think and the Ogre Officers are in between the two.  Very hard to solo in Najena because of all the adds, but you should be able to start with the skeles in the beginning of Najena. Don't try pulling the first ogre that you see sitting near the fire because he has about 6 skeles sitting around him. Its a great place to go as a newb, lots of fun there.</div></div><hr />
