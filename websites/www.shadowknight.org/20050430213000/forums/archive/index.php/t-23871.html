<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rynix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In Sol B after u zone in, take the 1st left, go up the ramp and take the 1st path to your left from there, follow follow follow, you'll get to a room.  Set up camp there.  Shammy or greater kobold will spawn in the room, and something will also spawn in the enterance to the room too.  I'm not super twinked or anything, but with Temp on I can handle two at once, toe to toe.  You do not want to fear kite here, too much can happen.  I usally then head up to the window room and pull there and the next room, head up the central ramp and pull.  By then with regen/medding, room will pop again.  Also, if you get too much, just head up the central ramp and will lead to Sol A zone-in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh sorry man, for fear kiting I think you should give Dreadlands a shot, kite near the Karnor castle wall or by the Burning Woods zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm......<br />
I think when I was level 43, I did this:<br />
<br />
Fear Kite Hoppers in DSP - Hard, but can be done, make sure you have Shammy buffs and HoV or Temp.<br />
OR<br />
Get a Group. (2-4  is okay [Can still fearkite then, but with Shammy, mob be slowed])<br />
<br />
If you don't care for Faction, go into KC, and get a group there, I think the exp. is alright, just also, a big risk for getting swarmed with 15 mobs by some n00b  :eek: (Group with atleast 5-6, IMO)<br />
<br />
Thurg. Dwarves - Fear Kite, have FD memmed. (Solo)<br />
<br />
Frost Giants - Get a Clr/Shammy/Druid to group with in GD and you can take on about 1-2 at a time at 40, besides, sometimes (From what I remember) you can easily get a group of 6 ppl with Monks, Beasts, Wars, Clrs, etc. (Group with atleast 2 or more)<br />
<br />
Hoppers in DSP are alright, sometimes hard to get a camp there with everyone trying to get $ (bastards... :P) and you can easily get yourself trained with about 2-4 hoppers if you're not careful. - Fear Kite with atleast a group of 2 or more.<br />
<br />
GD was the last resort place I went too, but I found it very nice  :D .<br />
If you are a group of 2, exp is amazing, but try to get a Healer of some sort, even a 41 bst would be great heh.<br />
<br />
Well, help that helps, I was geared with some pretty nice stuff at 40 having the Argent Protector (Was the uberest non-ND 2hs weapon almost b4 PoP).<br />
<br />
I strongly recommed GD though most of all heh, the other places are great exp., but you can easily get wiped if not grouped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if in DL, might check out the skellies in the pyramids in the hidden valley or yeti caves. tons of places to hunt at 43. think i would start with rynix's advice first, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Might want to try to fear kite the beetles in the secret side of echo caverns.  I think I was a little higher when I started there,but you can probably do it.   You have guards and zoneline nearby, just in case.</div></div><hr />
