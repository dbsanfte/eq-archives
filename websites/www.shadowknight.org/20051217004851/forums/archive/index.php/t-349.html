<br />
Looking over the post, there were 3 large sig files, 120k, 70k, and 90k.  One was a flash animation and the other two were just images.<br />
<br />
While I know it's very nice to have a large, detailed picture of your character on your posts, I think we need to come up with a compromise between the people with slower hardware/connections, and the people with gratuitous sigs.<br />
<br />
We don't have the traffic of the safehouse, so I don't want to be as limited as them.  For the record, they allow a max 15kb sig file.<br />
<br />
For starters, I would suggest no Java applets (the ripple water thing that is soooo old) or flash animations, and keep the sigs under 50kb, and of reasonable dimensions.  This means no 400 pixel tall sigs.  Keep them horizontally minded to save screen space.<br />
<br />
Please discuss and let's come with a reasonable compromise.</div></div><hr />

If you make it display smaller it still loads the 70k image, but if you edit the image to make it smaller it will only load the 30-40k or so.</div></div><hr />

I dislike more when they take a huge place on my screen (ie sig bigger than post by itself :D).<br />
I like visual sigs or avatars cause it allows to identify peoples faster whithout having to memorize names, when they look nice its even better. :)<br />
<br />
Wouldnt it be possible to add an option in board profil to disable images in sigs for those who have slow load times?</div></div><hr />

People at the safehouse have to have 15k and banner size and are capable of having great sigs, much better than some monstrous pos with music and java and flash and all that crap.<br />

i don't have problems myself, but those two usually cause people the most grief on slower connections<br />
<br />
maybe limit size so it doesn't distort posts <br />
<br />
maybe add an option to allow one sig per post <br />
<br />
safehouse rules are insane, but without rules their bandwith consumption would be huge---causing higher costs<br />

i like seeing sk sigs myself---can't comment on hearing music on any sigs as i view at work and don't have sound</div></div><hr />

Graznoth I believe was the one reported specifically to me by a user that was having problems.<br />

This is still open for debate because we aren't dictators here, but by the end of the week we'll be implementing some sort of policy that I hope is reasonable to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't true.  Safehouse doesn't serve the image files, people have these hosted somewhere else.  They have no impact on safehouse bandwith consumption, just the amount of data readers are going to have to download.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a hack that makes it so a sig is only displayed once per page. On my other Interealms sites, I used the specifications of 250 pixels wide by 100 high, no more than 25K. However, I did allow for wider sigs if you were still under 25K. <br />
<br />
The problem is those giant sigs here take up a ton of space and make it so you have to scroll forever just to see a message.<br />
<br />
Regardless, making a limit and also enabling the sig hack I spoke of will make things a lot nicer for your modem users.</div></div><hr />

They should never excede the lines of someones post. Its annoying to have to scroll a whole screen everytime someone with a HUGE fricking worthless sig post. People seem to have this idea that size matters for sigs. I personally prefer text only sigs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigs larger than the content of an average post are silly.<br />
<br />
Ideally:<br />
<br />
-Uinform size &quot;custom avatars&quot; for everyone in the left hand colum. No images within posts and no image sigs.<br />
<br />
Preferable:<br />
<br />
-No larger than 240x120<br />
-25k or less in size.<br />
-Animation by GIF only.<br />
<br />
An option to turn sigs on/off would work just as well. However, you'd have to disable images outside of vBull sig configurations.</div></div><hr />

I'm &quot;only&quot; on a geforce 2 and and never had any lag with this sig, I love it, it looks real cool and I would find it sad if he had to remove it :/<br />

<br />
Yeah but the moderators of The Safehouse are facist pigs too.<br />
<br />
I can see banning Flash, Java, and sound.<br />
<br />
Even when I was still on dial up I never had problems with any sigs what were just jpgs or gifs regardless of the size.<br />
<br />
I do have to voice my opinion of limiting a sig to be attached only once per thread.  That basically defeats the purpose of the sig.  Like Mystina said, custom sigs are a great way for easy identification of a poster without having to memorize names.  It allows to people to be creative and original too.  Ever read a message board that doesnt allow custom sigs?  Talk about dull and boring.<br />
<br />
As long as sigs are kept resonable there is no reason they cant be attached to every post.</div></div><hr />
