<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After I saw lot of problems in this SK forum and other class forums complaining about certain AA that are detrimental to them after some changes in EQ and they were stuck to those AA without any control over it.<br />
<br />
That led to the suggestion of toggle of certain AAs.<br />
<br />
I think the best solution for everything related to AA is to implement AA Removal System.  If you happened not to like AA anymore, you can just erase AA back to its 0 skill and you won't get point for it but, at the end, you are free from it for good.  For example, if you don't like SCS anymore, you can go to AA window and click on SCS and click ERASE and you get confirmation box saying, &quot;ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?&quot; then click yes. VOILA! SCS 3 levels went back to ZERO level. You won't get 12 AA back but you have nice control over it now. It is very similar to spell specialization erase system in case you made a wrong choice. You would have to regain skill back via practice. Same for AA, you would just have to earn more AA to buy other skills as usual but you have much more in control to remove that became detrinmental to your cause.<br />
<br />
That way, SOE won't have to worry about fixing certain AA every time they became detrimental every major changes. I think its very easy to implement with new back-end AA system and I know SOE will LOVE this cuz it won't refund players AA to buy other AA skill immediately. SOE lose nothing and players actually benefit from this by eliminating any detrimental AAs with their full control without involving SOE to do it anymore. This would be useful feature for the future sake of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This would be a customer service nightmare. So an account gets hacked and someone goes in and deletes all the AA's. Good luck to Customer Service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Asheron's Call implemented a Skill Sellback quest a year ago or so. It should not be hard for EQ to implement something along the same lines. Sell back and you get the AA points back. No more, no less. It went over very well in AC. They implemented some time limits for the quest to keep it from going rampant. <br />
<br />
Personally I would love to see this happen in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, didn't know that A.C. has it even with full refund. Thanks for the info. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Knowing SOE, they'd expect us to grind out &quot;removal AAs&quot; to remove unwanted AAs  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe funny Noctix..<br />
<br />
<br />
Gah! Should have thought of that system during my brainstormng session with Juwel (along with our ideas on corpse drag radius, aug removals, pet zoning, and some others that I forgot already) while our regular grouping sessions on every tues/thurs and have her tell to the summit with that simple feature. I get the feeling that it would be already implemented by then cuz its one of easy fixes along with back-end AA system implementation. Well too late for that. SCS issue will never show up if it happened. ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would still be an issue, just not as big an issue.  Having an AA that makes you WORSE by purchasing it is still fucked up whether you can delete it if you're unfortunate enough to have purchased it or not and should be changed either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, problem is that SOE can't predict EVERY AA effect on every changes they made to EQ.  AA removal system is good way to give players control to bypass unforeseen effect on some AAs. <br />
<br />
Do you rather to be stuck to defective AA FULLY and try to fight SOE for a year or so to get it fixed OR erase AA IMMEDIATELY and fight for SOE for a year or so to fix it? I prefer the latter.<br />
<br />
My main point here is more player control over their own AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree that SCS should be on a toggle. An AA sellback ability would help out in those instances where you buy an AA that is messed up/does not seem to really do anything, so you sell it back for refund to use elsewhere until it is fixed (or not, or you have so many AA that it does not matter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rartawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">having a remove AA function that refunded the AAs would be the same thing as a toggle really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warrl Kyrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is one problem I could see happening with an AA removal system. Most especially if the points were refunded.<br />
<br />
That being AA that are deemed to be prerequisites for more advanced AA skills. How would this be handled? If you had the advanced version and took away the prerequisite AA, should that advanced AA still work?<br />
<br />
Another scenario would be, what would happen if a player either by design, or by accident, went below the 12 AA required in Archetype, would that player then loose access to all of the class AA they had purchased?<br />
<br />
Also, how would you handle all future AA purchases? Still count that the player at one point had the prereqs and allow them to purchase the more advanced AA or would the player have to rebuy those prereq AA again to have access to the advanced AA?<br />
<br />
If points were refunded this could lead to some blatant abuse of the system. If not then there could still be problems with the way the prereq AA are handled. Makes the idea a whole lot more complicated in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">having a remove AA function that refunded the AAs would be the same thing as a toggle really<br />
Not really.  If you have the AAs refunded you can spend them on something else entirely right then.  If it's just a toggle, all you gain is the ability to turn it on and off.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to toggle SCS on when tanking and off when not.<br />
What I don't fully understand is why some people bitch about SCS after having purchased it knowing full-well what it's definition was.<br />
<br />
If they were to implement a toggle for AAs, what other AAs would we want it for?  I can only think of the one off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*Gasp* I agree with Nocifer. Good idea and should be easy to implement.<br />
<br />
To get around the hacking issue, make the removal have a 12-24 hour limit per AA removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the simple solution to that would be to refund ALL of your AA to be re allocated. Pain in the ass? Yes. But I really don't see many people doing this sort of thing all of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Call me conservative or something, but the idea of a complete AA refund just seems very unEQlike. AAs have a very strong sense of permanency to them, and even a one time complete refund would let a lot of people &quot;switch&quot; AAs just because. Seems kinda cheap to me. Also there's nothing to stop people from winding up buying SCS again and liking it until OoW or something.<br />
<br />
Individual AA refunds are fine, like Manaburn refund when that was nerfed, or the regen AA refund when regen was fiddled with. I don't know if I'd expect SCS to be refunded - it hasn't changed any, and still has situations where it's beneficial. A toggle would definitely be the way to go, and a whole lot of people want it. Not even just us, as that one recent post showed. It's not a new problem either, hell I remember part of me not liking when tash aggro was reduced back when I played my enc, cause in exp groups I couldn't get aggro as fast off a cleric or whatever. :P Extending this to AAs, there will almost always be situations where an complete loss of some of your aggro is a bad thing.. for almost every class.<br />
<br />
Maybe a 5 point AA Spell Casting Subtlety Control or something to add the toggle.. wouldn't be bad. Give it to every class that can get SCS... maybe not clerics, since their's isn't the Archtype version I believe?</div></div><hr />

.<br />
<br />
what I was getting at was that this AA removal idea seems to come as an lesser alternative to having a toggle. But if it was implemted with a refund it would be more powerful than a toggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Knowing SoE, they will implement it with some kind of medication you need to buy that costs a shitload of plat, and lets you forget the AAs so you need to regrind them and not get em refunded. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Give a full AA refund, then make it like Planetside where there is a delay (An hour, a day, a week?) between when you remove the AA and can re-spend it.<br />
<br />
No AA hotswapping, no CS nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To the guy that was asking about removing prereq's...<br />
<br />
Just make it so you need to remove the latest version first.  IE, if you have your double riposte and flash of steel, you'd get a message saying something like &quot;This AA is being used by another, remove that first.&quot;<br />
<br />
And no, just because you 'used' to have it, doesn't mean you'd be able to buy the AA.  You would need the prereq's.<br />
<br />
That's my look on it anyways :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Precedent for Refunding an AA due to inaccurate wording in the description  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22891)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Keevel, they dont refund aa's to sks ever.<br />
<br />
1.  IHT and LT nerfed so they are no longer on same timer as HT.  ie they dont refresh on death.  Refresh on death was about the only thing that made LT worth having.  No point refund.<br />
<br />
2.  They dropped prereqs for mind and body.  No refund on prereqs.  Glad i had to pay 17 aa's for ft 1, while people now only have to pay 5.<br />
<br />
3.  Soul Abrasion got a little bit crappier when you could add more procs to a weapon, and even alittle more crappier with weapon affinity.  If i could get SA points back id get a second proc for my weapon and purchase WA.  No refund.<br />
<br />
4.  SCS, while it had market value at one time and doesnt now, doesnt mean it wont have market value in the future.  Problem is ya cant undo it when its sucking to have it.  No refund.<br />
<br />
It seems that other classes just need complain that something doesnt meet their expectations and the refunds come rolling in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Must be really old then, because my IHT never refreshed on death and i bought it some months after it went live. No clue about LT, never bought this as it was same timer than HT.</div></div><hr />
