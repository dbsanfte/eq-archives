Leechcurse Discipline<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Lifetap from Weapon Damage <br />
2:  Increase Chance to Hit by 200%<br />
<br />
<br />
Wasnt previously aware of the &quot;Chance to Hit&quot; part of this...definitely makes sense given how often SKs are able to miss...<br />
<br />
It also means that there is a decent bump in our DPS when this disc is activated, albeit for a very short time.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to last week  <br />
Welcome to being an asshole.  So Dyrkk posted the info, big deal.  No reason to be a prick about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from search results it seems the thread has long since disappeared, but it's nothing new that leechcurse increases our chance to hit.  Lejina posted detailed parses of the change when it first occured well over a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've browsed through the leechcurse posts and its still a bit murky for me. Does this mean that for 4ticks after the disc is enabled that whatever weapon damage I do, that I will be healed for it? Meaning that if I do 4k melee damage I  will be healed for 4khp?<br />
<br />
Edit: The ONLY disc that I've used before is /unholy so I don't know the answer to this either.....Are they all on seperate timers? If I use unholy will leechcurse be grey'd out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes Yes Yes No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep the only win on the new discs is that you can use unholy and leechcurse now (that it, the timers aren't linked).  I leechcurse pretty much every time it pops up.  It scares people.<br />
<br />
resistant and fearless are still linked.  Not that you care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're 65 and you've only ever tried one disc to see what it does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">he's on a pvp server :P though leachcurse is now quite benefitial in pvp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Leechcurse is still kinda worthless if ya spend half the disc stunned.  Would be nice if they made sks immune to stun while this is up or at the very least reduced the chanse of getting stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh actually I did use leechcurse once thinking that it made my HT heal me for that amount.....HT and no heal....hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lol...sorry that I was posting stale stuff, but it struck me that the hit % modifier was as large as it is and also that it was a direct modification rather than an increase in atk rating or something...<br />
<br />
It'd be cool to get an offensive discipline that used this effect by itself on a shorter reuse timer, we have some empty spots on the combat bar that it'd be nice to fill in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm confused on Leechcurse.  I just dinged 60 and used it for the first time on dorf guards near the pok stone.  I thought that every hit I did healed me.  But I looked at the log a couple times and low and behold I was healed for the amount that the dorf hit me.  Is this wrong?  I was hitting for 183 and him mid 60's and I would be healed for whatever he hit me.  I thought it was the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, other way around.  What you hit mob for you are healed in return.  Good for that &quot;oh crap, the 4 boxing cleric is sleeping on heals again&quot; lol.</div></div><hr />

dont be so mean to handicapped ppl without arms /point sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Winkles - were you at full health when you engaged, and full health after every LC heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep as a matter of fact I was at full health when I started and finished.  Now I'm gonna have to go try it again lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Winkles, think about it...<br />
<br />
If you were full health, every time LC healed you, you'd be healing whatever the guard damaged you for.  He hits you for 53, then you whack him for 160 - Net result?  You get healed for 53.  Spam would look, if you kept trading hits back and forth, like LC is healing you every time he hits you for what he hit you for.  <br />
<br />
The messages for tap-healing only appear when you're actually able to heal yourself, and it only displays the amount necessary to raise you to 100%.  In other words, if you're at 4500/5000 hps and LC, once you hit 5000/5000 hps, it'll look like the disc shut itself off.  If you get pinged for 1 damage, you'll see a message saying you got healed for one damage (not the amount of your swing) as soon as you hit something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to toss in here that the 200% chance to hit fucken rocks in duels.  Its fun to stand toe to toe with a monk and not get pwnd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Savoline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">200%?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Might not be as good as a Melee disc, but it's actually noticable that you're landing more hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is the discussion that I was hoping to generate from the original post...the chance to hit multiplier is pretty sizeable. I'm assuming that it affects only our hit/miss odds, and riposte/parry/dodge avoidance by the target are not affected.<br />
<br />
It also seems to me that during the duration of the AA, other weapon procs dont go off, which would make sense if the leech curse effect was viewed as essentially a lifetap weapon proc. Too bad there isnt a mana version...</div></div><hr />
