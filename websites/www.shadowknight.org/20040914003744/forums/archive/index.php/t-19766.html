<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deathfighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Take Death's Fury, Pet Affinity, Improved CoS  and suspend minion and toss them back into the pool... We don't want that crap. Let us have Fury of Magic, Stonewall, and Strikethrough.<br />
<br />
Don't gimme DP hotkey cause that will only give Monks more to bitch about. WTF monks need Strikethrough for? If there lame enough to melee the MOB from the front they deserve to die. <br />
<br />
We are the offensive tank while pallies are the defensive tank. We follow the path of the necro while they follow the path of the cleric. You consider giving them RC and now all they will do is stand back in a raid to cure and debuff negative effects on a warrior while we work our asses off to drop that beast.<br />
So give me Fury of Magic because it make sense. It just makes sense.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the rant, but its simple logic.<br />
<br />
Don't gimme no damn group buffs cause I dont want to follow /tell all night. I think SK the way they are with there offensive spell dmg and self buffs.<br />
<br />
Is it 45 AA for 15 dmg shield ? That better be wrong !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah!  Speak for yourself Deathfighter, but one of the AAs I've really been looking forward to is suspend minion.  I do a heck of a lot of pet pulling and that AA will be one of my favorites.  I went from never using a pet before getting Pet Discipline to alway using one.  I can't even tell you how many times I've got a pet summoned and buffed up, and then wanted to go check to see if some mob was up that required me to be invis.  Well, since I didn't want to lose pet, I had to sit there and send someone else to do it.  Well, I won't bore you with the huge list of reasons why I want it, but you are dead wrong when you say &quot;we&quot; don't want them.  It's more like &quot;YOU&quot; don't want them.  The rest of us tend to be more flexible.  If you don't want the AAs, don't get them, but it's stupid to say they should be done away with when many of us will find creative and interesting ways of using them.</div></div><hr />
