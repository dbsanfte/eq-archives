Yo can try DoTting him and siccing your pet on him, but with Elemental gear, good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that I don't have much experience duelling bards, but they never seemed all that hard to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chain lifetap before he drains all your mana.  Make sure you have 4 Clickies that are easily accessable, and some sort of DoT or Pact of Hate up ( very low on your buff slots ).  Once you get him to 70, AA HT him. Dead Bard.<br />
<br />
I really can't think of a way to beat a Bard without using HT.  Their Mana drain is insane, and once you're oom you can't really damage him.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Boil Blood / Ignite blood / Touch of Inny will probably be the only spells that land.  Don't bother using anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bards who know their shit, will *never* die in a duel.<br />
<br />
A elemental geared bard is nigh on untouchable. nearly all our non resistadjusted spells wont land. lifetap might, albeit when i tried it against a elemental warrior it was flat out resisted. The bard will strip you of buffs,mana, and then will proceed to annoy you to death.<br />
<br />
There is no effective way to deal with a bard in a duel. The overpoweredness of the bard in pvp is insane :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meriboh</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Bard is too overpowered to kill effectively one on one.<br />
I just use dirty tricks like plucking a few guards or nearby mobs with arrows and bring them close enough to agro the Bard then feign death. Dispell him/her constantly as they are running around and hopefully you’ll eventually get to their sellos. A Bard without sellos is pretty much useless.<br />
If the Bard is training, like they do in the planes, make sure to have feign death up.<br />
To annoy them, Shadow Step around and spear, tap and dispel…sure they can track, but that’s another thing they have to try to do while twisting songs.<br />
Don’t overlook our DoTs either, they may be small damage, but it’s still damage.<br />
The key is to have many different things going on so he/she has to try to twist songs, keep away from guard/mobs, track, dipell dots and kill you.<br />
You more than likely won’t kill him, but you can make him run and zone.<br />

Line up depends on the gear of the bard, if his resists are low id keep him on his toes with an occasional spear or 2, that way he is forced to twist resists song, if ur spears land constantly use em, other wise taps all the way, the idea is to burn him down b4 he runs u OOM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, but the question is a Bard in full Elemental Gear.  He'll resist spears even without Resist Songs up.</div></div><hr />

what lifetap? toi is -500 check bards could resist it with their song up but it'd be pretty incredible to see anyone else running around unbuffed 500mr or greater  <br />
<br />
Elemental resists+bard resist song=resisted lifetap. resisted everything in fact. dispelling his selo's means shit, he can bring that up again and STILL twist songs on your ass.<br />
<br />
As I said. A bard that knows his shit wont die in a duel. period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: oh, and btw. what mana do you have for that lifetap sir?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinistersader</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, depends on what kinda of gear you have, which spells you have and what kinda gear the bard has.  In any case, If your up against a bard who just totally out classes you in gear and aaxp, your pretty much screwed.  <br />
First 2 things any smart bard will do to you is - ancient mez, then or mana drain your mana ~ debuff (dispel) dot then whoop your ass.    Best thing to do, dump your mana, the level 65 tap is your best bet, dump it because if you don't, well.. your just gonna lose it anyways, goal is get the bard low enough to use your unholy aura dis and ht and hope that they fall.  Now if you win, you can do a lil dance and be all happy.  However if you don't kill the bard, ~/unholy steed ~ HS and run like hell cause your screwed.  Thats how i remember pvping bards that just totally out classed me =p<br />
If you get annoyed with a bard &lt; constantly &quot;ancient mezzin you&quot;, get 3-4 instant click items up, have the first 3-4 slots buffed with instant clicks, and use Pact Of Hate after the instant click slots, stack it in the back and mez will only last for a second</div></div><hr />

<br />
what lifetap? toi is -500 check bards could resist it with their song up but it'd be pretty incredible to see anyone else running around unbuffed 500mr or greater note the &quot;bards could resist it&quot; and the &quot;it'd be pretty incredible to see anyone else&quot;. You said<br />
<br />
lifetap might, albeit when i tried it against a elemental warrior it was flat out resisted. the warrior is what my question about what lifetap you were using was in reference to. i have yet to see an unbuffed &gt; 500MR warrior profile. and i agree high end elemental bards are pretty much unstoppable. but i was talking about the warrior you claimed resisted toi</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am of the belief that PoH is the way to counter a class (ie. chanter / bard) that mezzes you.  Get that buff set-up behind as many buffs as you can and mezzes can be dealt with to some extent.<br />
<br />
ToI is probably the best bet you got for a spell to land and will probably be your best friend for the duration--BoH has an off-chance, but most spells will be a *have fun and see if it lands* type of thing.<br />
<br />
I pretty much only duel in an arena, so you can land spells on him wherever he goes.  Similar to Drak, I just tap over and over--crits at this time are really helpful.<br />
<br />
There also comes a time, frequently, when the bard will stand toe-to-toe just to see if they are studly or something.  Rangers do the same thing it seems.  :)   Stay frosty for this--they all seem to want to stand directly in front of us, if only for a few seconds, for nothing more then ego.  Don't get caught sleeping like I once was with the attack button...<br />

PoH, on the other hand, seems to work well for breaking mez.<br />

<br />
I asked a chanter the same question and they said any DoT will break mez, even if you're out-regenning it.<br />
<br />
Either way Pact of Hate is much better than something like Disease Cloud, for 2 main reasons: DC is too hard to land on yourself normally... Pact of Hate includes mana regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of good and valid points here imo. The new LDoN hp for atk buff is good to cancel ancient mez. I still prefer the good ol crimson pot tho. Horses are our friends. <br />
<br />
Other then landing a lucky snare and watching a bard die to his own train, I've only been able to kill them with DT. I have no problem admiting I probably couldnt kill a bard w/o using it.<br />

Bards cheat. End of story.<br />

<br />
Worn regen will not override dmg from potions or DoTs. <br />
<br />
However spell regen will. So cancel your SHM regen buffs before fighting bards / chanters.</div></div><hr />

and bard=run from the phag ( unless u can dark em )..&lt;&lt;==unlikely..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzan</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you didnt have SPELL regen (as in a shamman buff)  that was MORE regen then your DOT damage. Get it? Got it? Good. :)</div></div><hr />

You do see Bards from PoTime guilds ( Forsaken Relms ones are the most common ) &quot; running &quot; around the arena every once in a while as well.  <br />
<br />
I was fighting my guild's Bard yesterday as a matter of fact, I had HT down from the prior nights raid, but I tried anyway to see how good I could do.  I could only land Ignite blood and ToI, seems he resisted 2 of the 3 ToVs I threw at him, and Boil Blood.  I got him down to 24 when all was said and done.   Had him down to 70 before I went oom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you have a regen BUFF/SPELL that is regening you at a rate for more then the dot / crimson pot is doing &quot;dmg&quot; to you. If the buff is, then your dot will NOT break mez.<br />
<br />
Worn regen, ei: Fungi, Arua even if more then the dot/potion will not override the dot and mez will break.<br />
<br />
Not a hard concept to grasp really. Or is it?</div></div><hr />
