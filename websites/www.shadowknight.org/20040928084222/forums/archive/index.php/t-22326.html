<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seriously, I know it seems like a vague question, it's something I've been thinking about. <br />
<br />
IMO I think there's lack of creativity on Sony's part. There was a time when a dru/shammy/cleric could all perform their function, as well as sk/war/pal. I honestly think SoL was a great expansion, not because of all the farming involved, it was more tactics oriented. The boss mobs didn't hit too hard but they had creative procs and or abilities, and an assload of HP that made you have to use different tactics.<br />
<br />
PoP had more scripted events that made it interesting. Again, it went away from the &quot;marathon&quot; fights like in SoL, but you still had to sometimes think on your feet.<br />
<br />
Now fast-forward to the state of the game today. Are mobs that quad for ungodly numbers the way to make it harder as we grow in power? To me it seems very noncreative. There has to be other ways (none that I can think of off hand), to make things harder w/o  just making the mobs hit harder and faster. Things are going to be eventually too watered down. We all picked our class based on the style we wanted to play, but since there are 3 classes that are supposed to tank, 3 classes that are supposed to heal, it seems to be the only way to balance the current game is to make all the classes so close to each other there will be no &quot;class defining&quot; abilities.<br />
<br />
I don't know, I've been playing since 99, and I hate the path this game is taking. I'm just looking to see what you all think, and if anyone shares the same feeling on this. If so, what would you do to fix things w/o making the game a &quot;watered-down&quot; product of what it once was.<br />
<br />
-Sorry for the legnth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're talking about recent encounters like you have not even fought them once.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but even simple encounters like Keeper of the Altar or Vrex Barxt Qukrat require more tactics than say, Aten Ha Ra or Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
And for some GoD encounters I had to write a few 50 lines strats for my guild to read, learn and execute.<br />
<br />
So as far as I'm concerned, your rant about tactics is 100% unjustified.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with you when you say that all 3 healer classes should heal well and all 3 tank classes should tank well. But this has nothing to do with the encounters themselves, or tactics. It has do with good old class balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It wasn't a rant; it was voicing my concern. Nowhere was I bitching, I was stating my opinion. That being said, I haven't seen too much of GoD honestly. I've been to the sewers, and fought random yard trash, and random named. I never claimed to be an expert in GoD on or any expansion for that fact. What I was trying to say (unsuccessfully I guess) was that what is going to happen in the next expansion after OOW? The mobs are going to hit harder, faster, as it seems to be the direction it goes. There seems to be a huge power curve from one expansion to the next, from one tank class to another, from one healing class to another. I was just seeing if there was a way where we could all do our &quot;jobs&quot; without making all the different classes identical. With the current direction of the game, that seems where it is headed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is why I don't post about stuff like this.  Like you, I haven't seen enough of GoD.  From the sounds of it, you're still in a place where all 3 tanks can do a fine job, just like all 3 healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is why I don't post about stuff like this.  Like you, I haven't seen enough of GoD.

<br />
I understand what you're saying, and I guess the flames will come a rolling in, oh well. <br />
<br />
I posted it because my guild is pushing to be where some peeps here are at, and I have concerns. That's it nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Raid encounters are extremel complex, and very difficult.  The key to raiding successfuly is not numbers or gear but organization and having everyone stick to the plan.<br />
<br />
You cannot zerg through GoD.  Every one of the gateway encounters (on a raid level) has been more complex than Rallos Zek in Tactics (IMHO the most complicated PoP encounter) and many have been more complicated and required more working parts than the Emperor of Ssra (before the lvl 65 increase, now you can just mezz all the guards).<br />
<br />
I feel that the biggest problem with GoD has been the lack of progress on a character and class basis.  In GoD, our toons have basically treaded water, and unfortunately, it appears that all classes are now &quot;wizarding out&quot; on spells and ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It must be your lack of experience with new content because Gates encounters are VERY creative, more so than any other expansion, with LDoN raid content being second.<br />
<br />
This expansion is hard. Sometimes really hard. And guess what? That's what makes it fun!<br />
<br />
If your guild is having trouble in Gates, there is nothing wrong with going  back to one of the previous expansions and gearing up until you are ready. Don't get frustrated, keep pushing your guild forward, it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, One thing I *REALLY* hate and still get annoyed by GoD today is its worst zone naming concept. It is randomized by name generation and churned out before deadline. Looks like SOE rushed GoD within deadline and had to just use computer to spit out BS zone names.. I hope that OOW will have attractive zone names like other expansions other than GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't have much of a problem with the names of the Gates zones if they had used the second part of the name as the zone name.  Lair of the Elite sounds cool.  Tacvi does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks guys, maybe the negativity lately by some, and my own unsuccessfulness in GoD had me worried. I haven't been to any of the &quot;good&quot; zones yet, but you guys have renewed my faith. I guess it's kinda hard to judge things from what you hear by a select few, and by the few zones I've been in. Every time I'm tried to do shit in GoD it's been pretty much a cluster-fuck.I guess what I was doing was kinda like judging the Kunark expansion by just seeing FoB and Illomen. Thanks again for the insightful helpful responses.<br />
<br />
Siilvir you're probably right, we are probably undergeared for GoD right now. I guess we have some work to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The people who created GoD encounters in general did a REALLY good job on them, every single mob feels different from another mob.  Even the fights themselves vary so much it takes awhile for them to get boring (with the exception of some of Ikkinz all feeling the same).  Raids in GoD are just amazing, the expansions downfall is for the non hardcore exp'ing crowd and even then thats more due to class balance than the content itself.  LDoN and GoD just have some really creative encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tell you, beating Barxt after all those weeks was the most fun I had in EQ for quite some time. I imagine it will be the same after Noquifiel stops kicking our ass.<br />
<br />
This expansion has added lots of things and twists to raids - riddles, deathtouches, and ae effects to keep you guessing.  Sometimes it's not how much mobs are hitting you for, but how many are hitting you, heh.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure if all these mobs would have been dragons instead and had better zone names, people would have thought it was the best exp of all time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Barxt was great to beat, a real rush.  Noq was pure relief.  High Preist in Txevu was bad, but alot of that was the hours of clearing to get to him.  Zun was interesting fight, but our solution was kind of ... silly.<br />
<br />
We haven't figured any of Tacvi out yet, other than the fact that the first boss is a beast.<br />
<br />
It is the single group content that was Fucked up in GoD, and that is because CLASS BALANCE is fucked up, not because the CONTENT was poorly designed.<br />
<br />
The fact that Time Knights could not do (except for Top 20 on EQ Rankings) what Bazaar Warriors COULD do, should have alerted them to the fact that they had a big class balance problem, but they are impervious to evidence and argument it appears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">---I'm pretty sure if all these mobs would have been dragons instead and had better zone names, people would have thought it was the best exp of all time.-- <br />
almost hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
the problem with god is its really only for raiders. ya theres some lower end stuff, but not much.<br />
<br />
the main problem is becuase the story is sooooo off the main EQ path that its an easy target, and folks just lump it all in a trash heap. shame really, GOD has the best encounters yet (though they had to be MAJORLY retuned). im glad its not a pin the mob in a corner and DPS the shit out of it one like luclin was.<br />
<br />
I still want a GOD like expansion with a &quot;velious&quot; depth and flavor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm guessing that there were seperate devs (even teams) assigned to each facet of this expansion, so you can see who did their job well and who didn't.<br />
<br />
Some of the mob models, when I saw them for the first time, were really cool.  Cragbeasts and kyvs especially.  But it's extremly disappointing that there were no identifiable boss models.  I really enjoyed that about PoP and was disappointed to not see that happen in GoD.<br />
<br />
PoP had a lot of different graphics for weapons.  GoD doesn't.  I thought all of PoP's were cool or creative, I hate every single GoD one I've seen.  The shields were pretty cool, though, and I hate PoP shields.<br />
<br />
I hated PoP encounters.  Bloated numbers, huge spawn races, ability to blow spawns and 'cockblock,' endless backflagging, throwing 150 people at bosses...  GoD stuff is definately hard, and I bang my head against the wall *a lot* but I feel a lot more reward when we get past something than I ever did with PoP encounters.<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint about GoD is the quest(s).  There's really only one, and it sucks so bad.   Too many bottlenecks, too many requirements for a raid force.  And it's set up in a way that other people doing the same quest are in direct competition for a small amount of raid-force drops, and that is bad for our team.<br />
<br />
The lore is lacking.  I have trouble following it, and I can't get into it at all.  It's all very alien to me.  Everyone understands dwarves, giants, and dragons.  And while the upset and restoration of the gods may not be very engrossing, it's intelligble.  GoD's lore is neither.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, there weren't enough spell upgrades, they are too hard to get, and the AAs are far too costly for their utility.  Did I mention elf shoes are ugly and recylcing graphics from LDoN, Luclin, and PoP is just as bad?  Oh, and our class-only armor itemization sucks...<br />
<br />
I guess the bottom line is that I don't like this expansion much either (not finished by any means, but what I've seen of it so far), but I still manage to have fun in it.  Hopefully they'll try harder in Omens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But it's extremly disappointing that there were no identifiable boss models. I really enjoyed that about PoP and was disappointed to not see that happen in GoD.<br />
<br />
Actually there are a couple of boss only models. The Zun Muram model is used once in Ferubi, once in Txevu, and a few times in Tacvi, that's it. Bosses everytime.<br />
And of course the Tunat`Muram model is used only once, for Cuu Vauax.<br />
But I agree that at least Keeper of the Altar, Barxt &amp; Noqufiel should have unique models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the creativity of the various boss encounters in GoD. Mob models and zone textures get repetitive after a while, even though many zones are quite beatiful with their temples and gardens. It seems they put a lot of creativity (or time)  into the event scripts but not so much into the graphics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After level 70 Gates will be farm status for every guild that is stuck in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For every guild that is stuck in Natimbi I think you mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">except for Tacvi I think.<br />
tacvi is designed for lvl 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">main problem with god is itemization, clearing and only 8 chr modles hehe<br />
<br />
small rant on god items- really there is none till ya get to kt hehe. then it just so bad. 1st problem is  to many of the ranger swords and chain bps. think lot of the class specific stuff from the ikks needs to be moved to the lesser mobs of all the trials, not just Bps, and ranger swords:). ikk 3  just really bad on this, it like drops a class defining item for rogues yet between the rotting sk weaps and endurance augs at the end, it just not something to do just for one class even if it is a vary great item for them.</div></div><hr />
