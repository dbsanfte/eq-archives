The guy to look for is in Stonebrunt Mountains in the tents east of the zone into to Gunthak. Below is the text for my turn in. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Cedric Trallus' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'Hello Knayil, chancing a journey to Brokenskull are you? Many have ventured there, but few have returned. I was favored by the will of Thule to return here in one piece, although I would not call my [journey] exactly successful.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what journey' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'Our spies in Erudin were able to learn that a voyage of Deepwater knights was setting sail in search of Brokenskull Island. Our priests in Paineel had received several visions from the lord Cazic telling of great powers that might be found on this island. Our group was instructed to follow their ship across the waters and explore the island should we find it. Find it they did, and more then they ever bargained for on that [cursed isle].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what cursed isle' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'Just as the Deepwater knights were about to drop anchor near a small cove on the island, we attacked them. The magic cloaks we had placed over our ship did their job all too well. We took them by surprise and our forces easily overpowered them, but our battle was joined by a [third force].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what third force' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'A group of strange creatures crawled up the side of the boats and began to attack everyone on both sides. They cut through many of us before we were able to retreat our forces back to our ship and turn our sails away from the island. Several of the creatures pursued us through the water with amazing speed. We fought them off and we forced them back into the sea. We were able to slay one of them, or so we thought. We brought the [body] back to Paineel for the priests to study.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what body' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'When we docked here in Paineel we were carrying the body off of the ship when suddenly the creature came to life. It threw several of our knights into the water and then jumped in himself and swam off into the ocean. We suspect that it used some form of magic to fool us into believing it was actually dead. The necromancers of Paineel are not easily fooled in matters of life and death. We greatly desire to study the [organs] of these creatures to learn the secret of this new magic.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what organs' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus says 'Bring me two samples of these creatures internal organs for our priests to study and we may share the secret of their magic with you. Something tells me you won't come back alive though.' <br />
<br />
Hand him two Luggald organs (not parts, which are a different item for a different quest). You can get these in Dulak. after zoning in from Gunthak to the left is a &quot;wooden wall&quot; or ship. This hides a secret entrance into some tunnels. In these tunnels is a 3-way bridge, and this is where the organs dropped. <br />
<br />
Necromancers receive the spell &quot;Auspice.&quot; Shadowknights receive the spell &quot;Blood of Pain.&quot; <br />
<br />
You gain experience!! <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus takes the organs from you and lays them down on the ground before him. He begins to slice and separate the organs from one another with a wicked looking dagger. Dark blue blood stains his robe as he probes the strange flesh. Finally after several minutes he smiles and pulls a parchment from a bag at this side and begins to draw several runes using the dark blue blood. 'Take this, I have discovered the secret of their magic, or so I believe. Of course it might not work and you'll end up actually dead, but we'll never know till you try will we?' <br />
<br />
As you take the scroll from him you notice a sickly burning odor in the air. You glance down at Cedric's robes and notice several holes beginning to form where the blood touches his [robes]. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what robes' <br />
<br />
Cedric Trallus glances at the burns in his robes inquisitively. 'It seems an aspect of the luggald's system is acidic in nature. Perhaps we have yet to find the secret of their comatose state. I'll need more samples to continue my research. This time bring me purified samples of their bile, blood, and saliva and I will study them.' <br />
<br />
These are random drops off various luggalds. Handing in the three items results in a &quot;Glowing dark blue potion&quot; with the effect &quot;Luggald Blood.&quot; Drinking the potion causes you 300 damage and summons a copy of the spell Comatose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You don't need to go to the bridge to get the organs.  The first room on the right after you go through the secret wall has them.<br />
<br />
It has better spots to set up camp with no wanderers.<br />
<br />
You may or may not need a friend to do this, your gear looks pretty good.  If your skills are good, you could solo it.  Splitting the 3 spawns might be kinda tricky with casters.<br />
<br />
When I did it, we knocked it out in about an hour.  The drop rate isn't too terrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there is a wanderer in the room ramgar mentions fyi. set up all the way at the back and mostly to your right and wait for the wanderer. he walks a long path but will eventually come almost all the way to the back of that room .<br />
<br />
if you fear kite from there with DD + short fear you can run him back and forth without aggroing anything else. once he's out of the way you can split up the camps and kill using the same fear path.<br />
<br />
i think i was in my mid 50's when i did this alone and it was not trivial, KEI made a huge difference. keeping up with the spawns to not have to split them again was the challenge. if you are only in your 40's you'll certainly need a group. also for me the drop rate on the organs was horrific but that may have been me. <br />
<br />
i spent probably 6 hours doing this to get 2 organs. not really that long a camp i guess but long enough to be irritating.</div></div><hr />
