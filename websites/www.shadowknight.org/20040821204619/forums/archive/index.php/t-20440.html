Howard Stern was THE best thing on radio since radio began.<br />
<br />
Mancow (from Chicago) was real good too, but after I moved could only get Stern.<br />
<br />
Seriously makes me wish you could PVP the IRL box.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howard Stern was taken off of exactly SIX Stations.<br />
<br />
That's right SIX. Out of HUNDREDS of stations, most of which his show is STILL heard on.<br />
<br />
And he was taken off by Clearchannel Stations, a PRIVATE Corporation. NOT the Government. <br />
<br />
Also, /agree John Denver<br />
<br />
Stop being Weakass Chicken Littles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He was taken off by ClearChannel but they happen to own a shit load of the market in the radio business..... They are pretty much monopolizing that shit. Even better since the FCC changed the laws a while back its totally legal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Clear Channel owns approximately 1,225 stations. <br />
<br />
There are approximately 10,304 Radio stations in the USA.<br />
<br />
Clear Channel barely breaks owning 10% of the radio market. Hardly a big freakin Juggernaut like everyone says.<br />
<br />
That, and it only owned SIX stations that played Howard Stern. I reiterate, SIX. Less than 1% of 1% of the number of stations it has overall.<br />
<br />
I say again, Stop making mountains out of molehills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Clear Channel was just covering its ass, because for some reason the FCC feels the need to crack down on radio for bullshit that happens on television.<br />
<br />
Most likely Stern's show was not doing well in the ratings on the stations he was removed from anyway.<br />
<br />
Of course the whole idea that the government &quot;owns&quot; the &quot;public&quot; airwaves is utter bullshit anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;i&gt;Most likely Stern's show was not doing well in the ratings on the stations he was removed from anyway.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
he was number 1 in a few of those markets he was removed from.  He was also JUSt renewed by clear channel prior to this.  I just think it's ironic how he starts speaking out against bush and his religious agenda (stem cell research, fag marriages ect..) and now he's off...he was making tons of money for these guys..<br />
<br />
stern claims that he'll be forced off the air in the remaining markets due to pressure from the government within the month.  if it happens, you know there's something to this conspiracy theory b/c mel karmizan (head of cbs) LOVES this guy and he's been there for 15 years.  His show hasnt' changed 1 bit and he's  number 1 in NY, philly and many more cities...<br />
<br />
we'll see..</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there's at least 100 million idiots in this country and I bet at least 19 percent of them listen to Howard Stern.<br />
<br />
Howard Stern is an unfunny crybaby who needs to start shutting the fuck up. I hope I never have to see his mongoloid face or hear his dumbass voice ever again.<br />

<br />
Yeah, that's logical. Because Howard Stern is the only person who has ever spoken out against George Bush's policies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I liked his movie, would rather listen to music than talk though (and mp3s rather than the radio, at that) and so am not really into his radio show.  A private corporation can do whatever they want, it's not surprsing that a conservative one might pull him; especially now that Bush knows reelection isn't looking good (dumbass thinks he has a chance :p), he might even be calling in favors or outright paying for them to do this.  There are idiots in all walks of life; liking something doesn't mean someone's stupid unless it's WWF wrestling, country music, soap operas, or LARP.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LOL Bush doesn't have a shot at re-election?  Ya, Kerrys really going to win... please.  How many of you are going to vote for a presidental canidate countries that are our enemies endorse?  Not too mention the fact that hes trying to keep his most liberal senator image which really makes him look like an idiot, plus since its a 2 party system unfortunatley its between those two.  Bush is easily the better choice there although I won't vote for either, rather throw my vote away on Nader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bush is seen as stupid...  He's not (really) of course, but once that image gets burned in the public opinion there isn't much to be done about it.  Dan Quayle wasn't stupid either, but is the butt of jokes to this day because of a few common-sense blunders.  He can't overcome that, no way.  I'd bet real cash on Kerry )  But ya, I'll be voting for Nader as well... just being realistic.</div></div><hr />

I don't even know what that word means.  How the hell did I use it in a sentence?<br />
<br />
And read this story it's funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Corporations. Corporations. Nothing but big corporations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheney shut off the T.V. &quot;Nader has entered the race.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I've never heard someone say 'corporations' so many times in one minute,&quot; Bush remarked, &quot;and he says it like it's a swear word. What happened to him? Did a corporation pick on him when he was a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's just a sick, twisted individual,&quot; Cheney answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And perhaps the key to your reelection,&quot; said the hooded figure of Karl Rove as he emerged from the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does my presidency always rely on sick, twisted individuals?&quot; Bush exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He tipped the scales in your favor in 2000,&quot; Rove said, &quot;and he could do so again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's like a Perot,&quot; Bush said, &quot;but working for me instead of against me like in 1992. I'm still stinging from that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your father!&quot; Cheney exclaimed angrily.<br />
<br />
Bush thought for a moment. &quot;Oh yeah. I get us confused because we have the same name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheney slapped Bush upside the head. &quot;Do you have to do that?&quot; Bush asked angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. It's part of my job as VP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bush rubbed the back of his head. &quot;One of these days I'm going to read the Constitution and check that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we focus?&quot; Rove demanded angrily, the room growing darker as he spoke, &quot;We must make sure that the one called Nader gains support from the liberals. The only way to do that is to make them think that there are few differences between the Democrats and Republicans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Democrats are different!&quot; Bush objected, &quot;They smell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we going to talk about war at any point in this meeting?&quot; Rumsfeld demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all about reelection strategy,&quot; Cheney answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm going to my office and punch holes in my wall,&quot; Rumsfeld said as he got up, &quot;You girls call me when we're back to talking about useful things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Less distractions,&quot; Rove uttered, &quot;Now, we need to have people infiltrate a meeting of liberals and convince them to become grassroots support for Nader. Then they will pull in others and no one will be able to stop us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But everyone is too busy with government functions to do stupid crap like that,&quot; Cheney said, &quot;Well... except for Bush; I'm not sure if he does anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right!&quot; Bush said, &quot;I don't do anything! I'll do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it is decided,&quot; Rove uttered, before fading back into the shadows.<br />
<br />
* * * *<br />
<br />
&quot;Just set it on fire,&quot; Bush said into his cell phone, &quot;Whenever I don't understand anything, I set it on fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Scott McClellan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just giving my daughter Barbara advice,&quot; Bush answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenna!&quot; Jenna shouted through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I get you two confused; you're twins,&quot; Bush said.<br />
<br />
There was an audible groan through the phone and then a dial tone. &quot;She hung up,&quot; Bush stated as he put the phone away. &quot;So do I look like a hippy? I have the tie dye t-shirt and fruity colored glasses and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wearing khakis,&quot; Scott pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always said I should have paid more attention to what kind of pants hippies wear,&quot; Bush said, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this rainbow dye going to wash out of my hair,&quot; Scott asked while scratching his scalp.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I? A hairatoligist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I do have useful things to be doing,&quot; Scott stated angrily, &quot;If you just appreciated how hard those press conference are to give, you wouldn't be taking me on your misadventures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, until something goes wrong, this is just an adventure,&quot; Bush corrected him, &quot;Second, I have a great replacement for you today to do the press conference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott rolled his eyes. &quot;Who is it this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a who,&quot; Bush said, &quot;but I got one of the smartest animals that isn't a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * *<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that dolphin going to die if someone doesn't put him back in a tank,&quot; a reporter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, he's weak and weary,&quot; answered another reporter, rubbing his hands together greedily, &quot;Maybe we can trick a straight answer out of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * *<br />
<br />
&quot;So what meeting are we infiltrating?&quot; Scott asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nader is speaking at a group who protests world trade and corporate expansion,&quot; Bush told him, &quot;They're called &quot;Progressives Against Progress&quot;. Now let's get inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both entered the auditorium and were soon inundated with the pungent smell of hippies. &quot;If you need to vomit,&quot; Bush whispered to Scott, &quot;Cover it up by saying you had some bad weed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about this Nader,&quot; said one hippy to another, &quot;He's just going to make Bush win again, and Bush is bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Democrats are just like me, dudes,&quot; Bush interjected, and then Scott nudged him. &quot;I mean like Bush... dudes. Both Kerry and Edwards voted for the war like Bush, and they like oil same as Bush and... uh... they wear ties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make some great points,&quot; one of the hippies stated, &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... uh... Moonshine,&quot; Bush answered, &quot;and my friend here is... uh... T-Bone... wait, that's a gansta name, not a hippy name... I mean his name is Tubby McGee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tubby McGee!&quot; Scott exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Tubby are two smart dudes,&quot; said another hippy.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is true,&quot; Bush answered, &quot;We smoke lots of things that make us smart. Right, Tubby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Lots of smoking,&quot; Scott answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell all your buddies that Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans and to vote for Nader,&quot; Bush stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do, Moonshine!&quot; the hippies answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Scott whispered, &quot;I'm amazed to find people dumber than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is amazing!&quot; Bush exclaimed, &quot;And I'm playing them all for saps!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon everyone hushed up as Nader came on the stage. &quot;Corporations!&quot; he yelled, &quot;The Democrats and Republicans are owned by corporations! Bush is nothing but a living, breathing corporation!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Preach it, brother!&quot; Bush shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Corporations!&quot; Nader shouted, &quot;I went into a McDonalds the other day... ends up it was a corporation!&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, all this talk about corporations is reminding me I need to check on my stock portfolio,&quot; Bush said to Scott as he took out his cell phone, &quot;I'm glad I got that stock market working again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, cell phones are made by corporations!&quot; Nader shouted as he pointed at Bush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet!&quot; Bush answered, &quot;I'm checking my stocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stocks are tools of corporations!&quot; Nader shouted. He then looked more closely at Bush. &quot;You look familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
A hippy pulled the fruity colored glasses off of Bush. &quot;It's Bush!&quot; they all shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Corporations in disguise!&quot; Nader shouted as he pointed at Bush and Scott. &quot;Get them before they corporate!&quot;<br />
<br />
The hippies surrounded Bush and Scott. &quot;You'll never catch me with my corporation made jetpack!&quot; Bush laughed as he blasted off through the skylight. “Muh ha ha ha!”<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't get a jetpack,&quot; Scott said as he watched Bush fly away. He then saw all the angry hippies around him and began to cower. After a moment of thought, though, he asked, &quot;Wait? What do angry hippies do? Throw tofu at me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hommus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eep.&quot;</div></div><hr />

If Gore couldn't beat Bush, there's no way Kerry will be able to. Gore had incumbency on his side and was just a much more electable candidate all around. I bet Bush wins by a landslide. <br />
<br />
&quot;The candidates are an interesting group, with diverse opinions: For tax cuts, and against them, for NAFTA, and against NAFTA, for the Patriot Act, and against the Patriot Act, in favor of liberating Iraq, and opposed to it. And that's just one senator from Massachusetts.&quot; - George W. Bush<br />

Kerry is a moron who just goes with whatever is popular among politics at the time, his integrity is pure shit.<br />

What's popular at the time is all most people care about.  I don't expect it to be a landslide, but Bush is hardly a strong opponent.. and Kerry's a better politician than Gore imo; Gore isn't charismatic at all.  People are really simple creatures, probably 90% of voters either dogmatically stick with their chosen party at the polls or vote for whoever has the nicest smile.  Gore might as well be a statue.  Since party lines are fairly evenly divided, charisma is big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, but that could work against Kerry if Bush decides to go negative with his campaign.  Kerry flip-flops left and right so much that it gives Bush plenty of ammo to work with.  And Bush, despite his many faults, can at least be called consistent.</div></div><hr />

whatever, if you don't like stern, that's fine...but how come these measures weren't taken against him until he starting blasting bush for all his religious bullshit policies against stem cell research and fag marriages?  Bush is basing these policies on his religious beliefs and that to me is very fucking dangerous...look at all these islamic countries...<br />
<br />
again, clear channel JUST renewed his contract prior to taking him off in 6 markets for a caller saying nigger.  that word is used over and over again by callers and had been used for years...it's just a bullshit excuse.  Very coincidental.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Believe it or not, issues do matter to people. The Bush campaign will easily be able to turn Kerry's lack of consistency against him. Just look how easily they turned the tide against Gore, the favorite, with just that &quot;I invented the internet&quot; thing. And he didn't even say that.<br />
<br />
If Kerry ever tries to talk bad about the war in Iraq, all Bush has to say &quot;dude... you voted for the war in Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Kerry ever wants to talk bad about the Patriot Act, all Bush has to say is &quot;dude... you voted for the Patriot Act.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically, the only issues Kerry can run on are the environment and other liberal issues or he can just pull a Dean and run completely on the fact that he wants Bush out of office with no real substance to his actual campaign. <br />
<br />
And I don't know if you've ever seen Kerry speak in public, but he has even less charisma than Gore. <br />
<br />
The only way he can even hope to win this election is if he gets Edwards to run as his VP and even then there is only a small chance that he could win.</div></div><hr />

Hell, conservatives hated Gore with a passion. Don't you remember Rush Limbaugh and those folks tearing at the man for years? And he had to overcome the association with Clinton, no easy feat.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I think this is going to be closer than most folks think. Bush has a lot going for him, but folks are starting to look back on Democrat &quot;rule&quot; with a certain nostalgia, as a time when there was no worries about terrorism, war, the economy.....<br />
<br />
Not that Bush did or did not cause this shit, that's pretty irrelevant to the mob, but just that at gut-level people associate his tenure with all of this conflict.</div></div><hr />

<br />
regardless, the fact remains that bush uses his religious beliefs to form his policies on stem cell research and fag marriages.  When asked about fag marriages and why he thinks they shouldn't be allowed bush says &quot;it's to protect the sanctity of marriage&quot;  Are you fucking kidding me?  i guess the 60% divorce rate protects the sanctity of marriage right George?  LOL.  When pressed further he was asked how do you know fags getting married is not protecting the sanctity of marriage, George replies &quot;i just know&quot;.<br />
<br />
he's crossing the line with religion and state.  Who the fuck is he to instill his christian morals on the rest of us?  There are also US senators living in a 1 million dollar house subsidized by a religious group called &quot;the fellowship&quot;...<br />

i know what you mean.  I really don't care if gays get married, it's just the principle of it.  I realize that some of this info is from howard, but i've thought that bush has had a religious agenda long before i heard this stuff on the radio,if this stuff is true about the fellowship,and i can't imagine he would say it on the air if it wasn't (law suits and what not), it just adds to the notion that bush and some of his republican buddies are treading the line as far as religion and govnmt are concerned and that is a serious issue IMO...</div></div><hr />

again, clear channel JUST renewed his contract prior to taking him off in 6 markets for a caller saying nigger.  that word is used over and over again by callers and had been used for years...it's just a bullshit excuse.  Very coincidental.  <br />
<br />
Actually, Clear Channel had just been hit by a massive FCC fine cuz one of thier talk show hosts, Bubba the Love Sponge, had described masturbatory experiences in great detail on the air. We're talking multi-million dollar fine here if I remember right. So ClearChannel, to avoid getting dinged again, had just implemented a new on-air decency policy which I'm sure Howard Stern was informed of.<br />

That was the CIA's fault. It was due to inept intelligence gathering. The director of the CIA has already accepted the blame. And most of the CIA staff has been around since the Clinton era and beyond so you can't blame Bush for that. And even if there was no WMDs the war is still justified. If you think the people of Iraq were better off under Saddam than they are now... well then I feel sorry for you.<br />

<br />
So we have a rating system for tyrants now? Go figure.<br />
The fact is that because of the pressure we have put on nations in the Middle East we are now actually making some progress. Iran, Syria, Jordan and Egypt are all in negotiations for cooperation with the US to promote peace and Saudi Arabia has now pledged to start cracking down on terrorist groups in the country when prior to the war they were quite obviously turning the other cheek and in some cases actually helping the terrorists.<br />
And believe it or not we are progressing in Iraq. The treaty to set up Iraq's government will soon be signed. http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20040308/wl_nm/iraq_dc&amp;cid=574&amp;ncid=1480<br />
Even Kerry agrees with Bush's stance in Iraq. According to his platform, the only thing he would change is that he would get more UN/international support. Other than that, he would do exactly the same as Bush is doing.<br />
<br />
I find it amusing that people are quick to jump on Bush for the war in Iraq, a war that was approved by Congress almost unanimously and was supported by a large coalition of dozens of nations. But they are quick to forget that Clinton bombed the fuck out of Iraq for three days straight without getting any kind of approval from Congress and without even mentioning it to the UN at all.<br />

The president has little to do with the economy. And any economist will tell you that the reason for the recession was the crash of the dotcom market in the late 90s. And then 9/11 just sent it spiraling into oblivion even further. Neither of these events had anything to do with the president. And in case you didn't notice, the economy is actually improving. Consumer spending is way on the rise and its only a matter of time before we get up to the level of economic prosperity we saw in the mid-90s.</div></div><hr />

Wrong... sorta.  Clinton did little more than give the countries that harbored terrorists a slap on the wrist after attacks on the WTC, embassies,military.  When there aren't strong negative consequences for attacking us then they do more attacks, atleast bush stands up instead of a slight response to keep the public happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but the president didn't directly cause 9/11.<br />
My point was just to show that the president doesn't really effect the economy and that Bush didn't have anything at all to do with recession.<br />

<br />
The recession is a result of the bursting tech bubble in 2000, which it so happens happened during Clintons stay in the office.  Not that it matters; the President doesn't have much say in how the stock market works anyway.  But, lets assume for a moment that you are correct and the President is the one pulling all the economic strings in this country.  I guess that means that Clinton saw fit to keep the economy booming during his administration, and then decided to fuck it up on purpose right before he left.</div></div><hr />

 <br />

<br />
I consider myself a reasonable individual, along with the majority of the people I know - I know 2 people who support Kerry over Bush.  Bush suffers from a stigma of being a dumb oil boy or whatever thanks to SNL, MadTV, etc., but he's easily as intelligent as most presidents.  (Note - I have nothing against SNL or the other programs, but you can't deny that their clear exaggerations sway public perception.)  I'm not particularly comfortable with the religion in politics idea either, but being agnostic myself, I still value morality and have had no major quarrel with most of the said decisions.  <br />
<br />
One should note that many of the arguments against his decision on stem cell research were released after he made his decision.  At the time, it was thought that we had around 60 viable stem cell lines, and the idea of [temporarily] haulting federal funding to establish new lines seemed reasonable.  Many people have a problem with creating human embryos to be destroyed for research - it's a fundamental question of when do you consider the pre-natal homosapien to be &quot;human&quot; more than a religious issue.  Since then, it has been discovered that only a handful of those 60 stem cell lines are actually viable for therapudic cloning.  <br />
<br />
With that in mind, his decision looks less sound, but that is still dependent on your position on the concept of therapudic cloning in general.  He didn't have the benefit of this information, however... &quot;Hindsight is always 20/20.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Note: There are two types of cloning - therapudic and reproductive.  Reproductive cloning is intended to create living individuals which are exact replicas of another individual, though there is a possiblity for genetic alteration to create so-called &quot;designer children&quot;.  Therapudic cloning is intended to stimulate stem cells to develop into a specific tissue for transplant to resolve a particular medical issue.  <br />
<br />
On stem cells: Embryonic stem cells are &quot;todipotent&quot; - all genes in them are &quot;turned on&quot;.  These cells have the potential to develop into any type of human cell.  Current research is attempting to control which genes are turned off as the cells reproduce in order to force the cell to develop into a certain tissue.  This would virtually eliminate waiting lists for certain transplants, and potentially solve nerve damage and other such injuries that are currently largely untreatable.  There are also adult stem cells, which are found in bone marrow, but these cells are already partially differentiated - they can only become certain types of stells.  They are still much less specialized than normal cells, but they would have limited uses in medicine.  <br />
 <br />
I don't know about you, but have you see any of those nice WMD's Bush spent billions of dollars and 100s of US lives to protect us from? Heck, that's what he stated in the declaration of war.<br />
<br />
You fail to mention all the Iraqi's that fled to Syria... what makes you think they didn't take any WMD's with them?  Honestly, Syria is about as bad as Iraq, they simply lack a well known dictator like Houssein.  We shouldn't have stopped with Iraq; we should have kept right on rolling over the border and into Syria.  Not that we lack other justifications, but we could justify it simply enough on the grounds that they are harboring members of Saddam's regime/terrorists/etc.  <br />
<br />
That said, Bush doesn't gather the intelligance - the CIA does.  If someone made a mistake on the existance of WMD's, it wasn't Bush... &quot;Don't shoot the messenger.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Yay for making examples out of third-rate tyrants. Now maybe he can go carpet-bomb some African country for good measure, just to continue to ruin American relations with the world's governments.<br />
<br />
Saddam was hardly a third-rate tyrant.  He killed untold numbers of Iraqi's.  He gassed his own people.  He drained marshes for the sole purpose of uprooting the lifestyles of the &quot;marsh arabs&quot; - a very unoffending group of people.  I fault Bush Sr. for not finishing the job the first time around.  He pledged to not relent until the entire Houssein regime was ousted and the whole of the Republican Guard (the best-of-the-best of the Iraqi army; still utterly inferior to the US Army first infantry division in a tank battle, though...).  He did neither under the pressure of the liberal forces.  <br />
<br />
Trying to liken the war with Iraq to carpet-bombing a random African country is pathetic.  <br />
<br />
Let's also talk about the wonderful recession and crawling recovery fueled by productivity increases and barely generating new jobs to replace the horde he managed to put out of work since Clinton left office.<br />
 <br />
9/11 hurt the economy hugely.  You can't blame that on Bush.  The economy has a repeated pattern of recession and growth that has nothing to do with who's president.  Clinton benefited from this pattern; Bush was harmed by it.  <br />
<br />
Sure, Bush is a good for this country. He's good for nothing in this country. Please, spend more time trying to rewrite the Constitution Mr. President!  <br />
<br />
I don't think Bush is the ideal president by any means.  He's got his shortcommings - we all do.  He is, however, a much better president than most people in this country give him credit for.  The liberal media in this nation (all of the major networks, along with CNN, are strongly skewed in favor of Liberals - Fox is generally more or less impartial) has been detrimental to him.  He started out with remarkably high approval ratings, but that has dwindled greatly and alot of it is not his doing.  During the war in Iraq, the Liberal press worked hard to degrade the image of the war - they were sure to cover every death &amp; every setback while overlooking every success.  They painted a grim picture of the war in which the US was having little success; a picture that was largely false.  These things have hurt Bush's image greatly in conjunction with the portrayal of him as ignorant (even blatently stupid) and concerned only with oil at the hands of SNL and other such programs.  <br />
<br />
I don't support everything Bush does by any means.  I do, however, agree with Brael that he's clearly the lesser of the two evils; Kerry's shorcommings have been covered well enough already.  I don't have anything against SNL for their portrayal of him - I've been amused by it on numerous occasions, but that doesn't change the fact that it clearly effects the public's view of him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bush's policy doesn't favor the &quot;top 5%&quot; (most anti-Bush folks prefer to use the top 1%, but whatever) - it simply fails to favor the other 95% and that pisses the have-nots off.  The wealthiest few % already pay a substantially greater portion of their income to the government than the lower to upper-middle class folks.  People who fit the government standards for poverty pay no income tax.  The wealthy also generally pay more property tax, more sales tax, etc.  <br />
<br />
The weathy people in this nation contribute infintely more than the others on a per-capita basis.  People who opposed Bush's tax cut as favoring the top 1% and similar things essentially wanted to further punish this group for their success (thought we were supposed to be capitalist?) in order to help those lower down on the economic ladder... Robinhood and capitalism don't mix.  The policy did not favor the upper crust of American wealth; they simply received their fair share (well, arguably less to be honest).  <br />
<br />
Opponents essentially argued that they don't need their money as much, so we should give it to someone else instead.  Hello communism?  Perhaps it is true that they don't need more money as badly as someone else, but in a capitolist society, they deserve to reap the rewards of their success - they were doing no more than that.</div></div><hr />

If you think the people of Iraq were better off under Saddam than they are now... well then I feel sorry for you. <br />
You know that iraqi's are dying at a greater rate now then they were under Saddam right?  <br />
<br />
Fuck the war anyway. You want to know why we really invaded Iraq? Read up on Saddam switching the Oil-for-Food UN programm from US dollars to Euros. Think 9-11 was bad? Read what having Oil switched from a dollar standard to a euro could have done to the US economy. THAT was why we went to war. <br />
<br />
Hell, read about the amount of forgien inventment the US needs to say solvent (fun fact - it's BILLIONS daily). Read about how since 2000 we've lost 20% of the value of the dollar. <br />
<br />
<br />
 We shouldn't have stopped with Iraq; we should have kept right on rolling over the border and into Syria. Yeah there you go! Warmongering cockslot.<br />
<br />
The wealthiest few % already pay a substantially greater portion of their income to the government than the lower to upper-middle class folks. Bullshit they do. Payroll taxes stop at $90k a year. Anything over that is untaxed. How is that fair? You know who REALLY pays taxes? Lower to middle class. They can't afford the tax advise and loopholes that the wealthy do. Rich people and business have a huge % of the wealth in this country -- like 99%. They should pay 99% of the taxes. <br />
<br />
You want to know something else? The government gives more money to rich people than to poor people. Much more. But don't believe me... Go read the fed budget sometime. It's all there. But you're too stupid and lazy to read it aren't you? You'll just agree with the lie that poor people are poor because they don't work. The lie that hard work pays off.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure that we'll be ok though.. the bushies say we'll be getting more jobs right soon now. Look at this chart! Pay no attention to the changes that bush is pushing for overtime pay. I'm sure the corperations won't abuse that at all. <br />

<br />
The economy has a repeated pattern of recession and growth that has nothing to do with who's president.  OMG WTF LOL... we're broke but the way to fix it is run up the largest deficit EVAR and give all that money away as tax cuts to rich people and fight a war we didn't have to? BRILLIANT!<br />
<br />
The Bush campaign will easily be able to turn Kerry's lack of consistency against him. Just look how easily they turned the tide against Gore, the favorite, with just that &quot;I invented the internet&quot; thing. And he didn't even say that. So you're voting for the party of lies and dishonesty? That's refreshingly honest I might say. <br />
<br />
That said, Bush doesn't gather the intelligance - the CIA does. If someone made a mistake on the existance of WMD's, it wasn't Bush... &quot;Don't shoot the messenger.&quot; This is the single most ignorant thing I've seen yet. YOU ARE A STUPID FUCKSTICK.

 Bush's policy doesn't favor the &quot;top 5%&quot; (most anti-Bush folks prefer to use the top 1%, but whatever) - it simply fails to favor the other 95% and that pisses the have-nots off.

The best example of Bush's favoring the rich are the tax cuts that hes been trying to force through congress.   For 60% of America the average tax break was $307.  If you made more than $1 million you got $112,925 back. If you think thats the way things should be then you need to stop eating paint chips.</div></div><hr />

Compared someone with a gross income of 25k to someone with a gross income of 250k. The person making 25k under bush's tax plan saves 1.83%, or $50. The person making 250k saves 6.02%, or $4,387. Ignore the dollar amounts and focus on the percentages. The 250k guy is getting 4.19% more in tax savings than the guy making 25k.

FYI if you made 25k a year YOU PAY NO FEDERAL TAX. This was a federal tax break, therfore you must make over 30k a year (i think) to even see the tax cut. Brael hit it right on the $ with this<br />
<br />
$112,925 is 4.5 people making 24k a year more that can be hired increasing employment and generating more money for business owners making them want to hire the people, also increasing commerce. <br />

I dont think it could be any more obvious that the tax breaks were to help the whole economy not just the so called rich.<br />

Bear in mind that the person making 250k is also generally going to be paying more in other taxes (property tax, sales tax, etc.) too - not just income tax.  <br />

Simple fact is liberals can get away with more than conservativese because the media from which most americans receive their news has a liberal slant.  He wouldn't be able to cater to al queda and similar groups making an active effort to assult the US, but governments like that of syria could certainly be given alot of leeway they shouldn't have and most americans wouldn't know enough to object.  <br />
<br />
To whoever called me a war mongour...<br />
Most Americans supported the war in Iraq, especially initially.  If you were one of them, you have no reason not to support a war on Syria.  They are guilty of many of the same atrocities as Iraq, as well as harboring the Iraqi's against which Operation Iraqi Freedom was aimed.  Their government is similarly oppressive to its people and supportive of anti-American terrorism; it lacks a well-known figurehead the American people can associate with its oppression (i.e. Saddam Houssein).<br />
<br />
I don't like war, but I'm not a pacifist.  I don't support war for the sake of making war, but I don't oppose it when it's justified.  War against Syria would be equally as justified as was war against Iraq.</div></div><hr />

I would be more worried about my president pandering to pinko liberal organizations like ACLU, Greenpeace, PETA, etc. than I would religious organizations. I don't hate God, but I do hate hippies. I checked Kerry's voting record and he got a 98% for voting in favor of the ADA. The ADA is a political lobby that stands for everything I hate. So fuck Kerry and his &quot;backers.&quot; I'd take any religious organization over the trash that Kerry has behind him any day.<br />
<br />
A lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum are divided about those issues. Kerry doesn't support gay marriages either. And there are lots of conservatives who support stem cell research and lots of liberals that don't.<br />

Morals were being put into law long before Bush took office.  That's why you can't walk down the street naked (legally).

Remember, that the just like a right to privacy, the separation of church and state is no where to be found in the Constitution.<br />
<br />
Neither is the inalieable rights in the constitution, it's in the Declaration of Independance.<br />

That has nothing to do with using religion as part of the basis for making a decision.</div></div><hr />

The Bush tax plan is not a flat tax cut. It is based on one's assets and one's taxable income. The rich person probably gets a higher percentage from the tax cut because he has a higher percentage of taxable income, i.e. he owns a lot more property, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
now there is legislation being passed that increases the fine for &quot;indecency&quot; from 27k to 500k..this fine is not applicable to the station but rather the offender himself...<br />
<br />
whaddya think of that?  some unelected office of bureaucrats (FCC) decide what's decent and what's not decent, and if they think it's indecent, they slap your ass with a 500k fine..<br />

<br />
Stern was removed from 6 stations, true, but keep in mind thats 6 markets.  6 decently large markets, (San Diego, Pittsburgh, Rochester, Louisville, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando)<br />
<br />
The removal of Stern was much more political than a move against indecency.  The indecency issue was only an outward justification to show the masses, not the driving force behind the removal of Stern.   Stern recently took away his support of Bush because he pissed him off (the reason escpapes me atm).  Stern was a very loud proponent of GWB prior to this, especially after 9/11.  When he took his support away from Bush, Bush's friends fought back...<br />
<br />
Friends:<br />
<br />
Chairman of the FCC:  Michael K. Powell (guess whose son he is)<br />
<br />
Vice Chairman of Clear Channell:  Tom Hicks (owner of the Texas Rangers.. guess who he bought the Rangers from?)<br />
<br />
Tom Hicks made Bush a millionaire 15 times over when he bought the Texas Rangers in 99<br />
<br />
Why does the Bush administration/friends/co-conspirators care so much?<br />
<br />
It's all about the 6 shutdown markets:<br />
<br />
San Diego pop 1,223,400<br />
Pittsburgh pop 334,563<br />
Rochester NY pop 219,773<br />
Louisville KY 256,231<br />
Fort Lauderdale 152,397<br />
Orlando 185,951<br />
<br />
These numbers are from the 2000 census, and include kids and old people, so the actual listening audience is smaller.<br />
 <br />
Bush called Florida crucial to his re-election (you know, the state in which his brother is governor..I wont even bring up the fallacy of Florida's 2000 election).<br />
 <br />
Bush is presently actively seeking the Hispanic vote.  I used to live in San Diego... a whole lot of Hispanics there.<br />
 <br />
Regardless, I wanted to bring to light some details about why Stern was removed from these stations.  The fines that have been levelled against Clear Channel pale in comparison to the revenue he brings in.  The huge fine that CC had to pay recently was because of Bubba the Love Sponge, not Stern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">good solid points<br />
<br />
glad to see someone else here who thinks this is bullshit that howard is getting the boot...<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Stern recently took away his support of Bush because he pissed him off (the reason escpapes me atm).&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
b/c he was taken off the 6 stations that's why.  the janet jackson boob thing was the excuse bush's right wing religous freak backers took to pressure him into pressuring clear channel to remove stern...these fucks have been waiting a loooong time to get stern off and they figured this was their best shot and the best excuse they could use to do it.<br />
<br />
his show has been the same for 20 years, toned down even and NOW he's &quot;indecent&quot; and needs to be off the air?  please..</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not, issues do matter to people. The Bush campaign will easily be able to turn Kerry's lack of consistency against him. Just look how easily they turned the tide against Gore, the favorite, with just that &quot;I invented the internet&quot; thing. And he didn't even say that.<br />
<br />
If Kerry ever tries to talk bad about the war in Iraq, all Bush has to say &quot;dude... you voted for the war in Iraq.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Kerry ever wants to talk bad about the Patriot Act, all Bush has to say is &quot;dude... you voted for the Patriot Act.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically, the only issues Kerry can run on are the environment and other liberal issues or he can just pull a Dean and run completely on the fact that he wants Bush out of office with no real substance to his actual campaign. <br />
<br />
And I don't know if you've ever seen Kerry speak in public, but he has even less charisma than Gore. <br />
<br />
The only way he can even hope to win this election is if he gets Edwards to run as his VP and even then there is only a small chance that he could win.  <br />
<br />
Issues matter....So pick Bush???<br />
Do the numbers...<br />
<br />
Bush won (disputed)  florida by &lt;500 votes.<br />
He lost the national popular vote by 100,000+<br />
Several other states were within 20,000 votes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;5 Million people lost their job at some point in the last 4 years when they would have preferred not to.<br />
<br />
What do you figure are the odds that 501+ of them live in florida?\<br />
<br />
Which segment of Gore voters do you expect to vote for Bush over Kerry?<br />
<br />
I expect more fiscal conservatives in the republican party to not vote for Bush over the budget.  Kerry has already made speeches claiming to be the fiscal conservative in the race.<br />
<br />
I expect some of Howard Sterns young white republican listeners to not vote for Bush over sensorship.<br />
<br />
I expect some the foreign policy aware republicans to vote against bush based on his turning an amazing amount of good will to bad will in 4 years over the pre-emptive strike doctrine.  The fact that most world leaders want him to lose is not lost on many republicans.<br />
<br />
I expect his showing among gays and muslims to be worse that last time.  There are gay and muslim republicans btw.<br />
<br />
I expect Mexican-Americans who Bush courted in the last election over immigration to not vote for him as much as last time.<br />
<br />
I expect the middle undecided who didn't realize how much more conservative than the typical republican bush is to change their minds this time around.<br />
<br />
I expect NADER to get far fewer votes among the far left.<br />
<br />
I expect that soldiers in Iraq are not happy about the complete lack of planning for what to do after the bullets stopped.  Many of them will not vote for Bush and the relatives of the injured or killed likewise.  Bush has not improved his standing with veterns and Kerry has much more standing with them than Gore did.<br />
<br />
I have given you 8 sources of votes were Bush needs to be afraid.<br />
Look for Condelesa Rice to be his running mate to try and get Black and Female cross over.  Without that he needs to rely on the incumbent advantage which is greatly reduced as mainstream republicans stopped defending him in public right after the budget became known.  Read the drudge report sometime.....most of your guys have gone home.....</div></div><hr />
