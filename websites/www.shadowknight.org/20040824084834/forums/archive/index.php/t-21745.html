How the fuck are they supposed to get better shit if they don't try to progress cumguzzler ? Swallow your man dick and die cunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for calling me cumguzzler and cunt and what not, I came up with a few words myself, but I'll not sink down to your sad level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elephantitis of my cock would just fucking rule. It might also be possible that the flesh eating anal virus just might finally get rid of that pesky tape worm.<br />
<br />
Oh Xeb, come on sink down to my level :D It is truly fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if people and guilds can get to EP more power to them, i will say however it is depressing to see 6.5k warriors sitting LFG in PoE.<br />
<br />
dont really matter, farming mear time quality loot in GoD with 1-1.5 groups of people = teh win.<br />
<br />
lets see you do that with 6.5k hp.</div></div><hr />

thats not as bad as trib. one jackass left his ep guild, and started a series of open raids to get every retard and fuckup in BoT ep flagged. they finally wound up killing RZ a few times with ~150 people. <br />
<br />
now i xp in god =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bigger the guild, the more idiot number potential.<br />
<br />
The tards pay for eq as well though, they have no right to see the zones they pay for?<br />
<br />
Maybe your bill should reflect how many flags you have and how much you play!   The tards not flagged are paying for your fun in higher zones.  Maybe it's time you got trained a bit by them lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>morbbidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Boo fucking hoo. So they got EP flagged and you didnt, get your guild off their ass and get moving, or go to a different guild.  Dont be a bitch and whine. They put their time in somehow and got there, do the same and quit being a bitch.</div></div><hr />

 Best bazaar can buy...whatever you may have gotten when guild was doing luclin..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lets see if someone can find it, about 6 months or so ago I saw a picture of some guy in a village in a 3rd world country who had elephantisis in his balls he was walking and had 2 guys behind him helping him carry them, then he had them help lift them when he got into a truck.<br />
<br />
Someone find the pic, I know you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wow, I was watching the discovery channel a couple of years ago and saw something I will never forget! There was small village in Africa (do not remember tribe or village name) and there was 1 guy with elephantitis of the nutsack. I mean, they were fucking humungous. The first shot of him was sitting by a fire with a bunch of other tribe members and at first you didn't notice it. But then you focus in and realize... He is sitting on his fucking balls!! It reminded me of being a kid and bouncing around on that big ball with the handle, you guys remember those ? They were that big. So then he gets up and drags them along the ground to his hut, literally dragged them while walking. He lived in the upper section of his hut so he had to have his brother push his balls up the ladder after him as he was climbing. <br />
<br />
To say the least, I was enthralled... amazed and absolutely disgusted that his brother was nonchalantly hefting someones balls up a ladder. You have to picture this in your head. This guy was standing under his brother on the ladder putting his shoulder under his nutsack like you would carry 2x4's.  I then asked myself out loud... why doesn't his brother take the upstairs part of the hut ?</div></div><hr />
