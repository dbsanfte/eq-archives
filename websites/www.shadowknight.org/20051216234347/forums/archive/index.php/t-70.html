<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i posted something to this affect on the interealms site having no idea it would suddenly disappear (anyone know why?). Anyway, i would like my thoughts to be heard, so i am going to post it here:<br />
<br />
<br />
We look terrible<br />
<br />
I am a horrifically evil beast who lives to kill and serve his dark lord, i believe death is the solution to every problem, i enjoy battle and killing...and i look like im wearing a sheet of tinfoil. Why, oh why, does the Verant art department make everyone look the same?<br />
<br />
With the exception of a few bits of Shadowknight only armor i look exactly the same as a warrior who is not dual weilding. Granted, in real life a breastplate would look the same on anyone, but EQ isnt real. Why not be a bit more inventive. I want to look different from a warrior. Why cant i have a softly glowing hand while harmtouch is ready, glowing green eyes, spikes on my armor, a mace that doesnt look covered in tinfoil, blood spatters, arcane symbols on my armor, i wanna see certain SK only weapons leave blact streaks in the air as i swing them. i dont want a graphic overhaul of the game, what we just got with luclin is very pretty, i want detail. And not just for SKs. A robe on a wizzy looks the same as a robe on a Chanter. IMO the wizzie's should be sparking with energy while the chanters would be slowly swirling colors. Detail would make me, you, and everyone else look a thousand times better in this game. <br />
<br />
The WORST offence, IMO, is our &quot;Unholy Steed&quot;. Its a black horse, whoop-dee-doo-da-day. I get all the way to lvl 59, spend weeks getting all the AAXP points, and i have a black horse?! Its an UNHOLY STEED! Why doesnt it have armor? Why cant it atleast have red eyes? I would love to see sheets of spiked black armor on my horse, riddled with holes/scrapes/tears from battle, as it runs around leaving fire in its hoofprints. C'mon, you fellas are paid to be creative in what you do. I would love to see more details in every class/race/weapon/item, would it really be that hard?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea what that looks like =/<br />
<br />
Besides, what i posted was not what it should look like, it was just illustrating how uncreative the art dept. has been. I am sure that if we really got into it we could create something a thousand times better than what i wrote there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or one with rotting flesh.......hmmmm......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if they did all the stuff you want to see, load times would be huge on the global files and such.<br />
<br />
There is stuff that is broken tho...as a troll, when I swing a two handed weapon I use one hand, the 2hb animation looks goofy - it looks seriously kinky when I fight behind a critter with a brawl stick. When I duck and crawl, my bp drops to my crotch and lays on its side. And sitting...sitting...sitting...trolls would NOT sit like little girls with their knees together. Ugh. It's bad enough living with the new troll model, the animations make it worse. The only reason I keep them on is to fit in doors easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Luclin animations need a lot of work. Heck, nobody mentioned turning bald when you sell at a merchant, or how the texture of a lot of the armors disappears and you can see the naked newbie peeking through at elbows, knees, forearms, etc.<br />
<br />
Of course, planes of power is coming out, so unless they roll in some changes with that (makes sense: buy another expansion to complete what the previous one started:rolleyes: ), we'll probably not see tweaks to the SoL animations anytime soon.<br />
<br />
And for the love of all that's (un)holy, I hope they get rid of that SoL DE female plate helm! I thought the original EQ &quot;chipmunk head&quot; was bad but wow they sure managed to make it worse.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of a single one of them that I think are truly good looking... The DE one is ok... if the thing on your head doesn't eat your head anyway. but ugh.</div></div><hr />

Hope Hoss are treating you right.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds great but I have a terrible time running alot of the Luclin models as is with a 'decent' machine and a cable modem.<br />
<br />
Hell, I have all Luclin graphics (besides DE), spell effects, level of detail etc turned off to improve the gameplay.  I used to love looking at all the pretty colors and graphics from spells but now just think they are a pain the arse as it makes it actually hard to see what is going on, regardless of the lag it may create.<br />
