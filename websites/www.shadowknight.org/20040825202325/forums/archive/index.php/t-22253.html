I can't believe I put my all time killer pick-up line down for you all to steal.   It has a perfect percentage (1 for 1)<br />

Also:<br />
This thread is the gayest thing in the history of the universe. It is gayer than Elton John and Richard Simmons doing a duet of Bangles songs in falsetto. It is so gay that the pure force of gayness unleashed in this thread will so overwhelm mankind as to set a new redefining standard for gayness, thus rendering all previous forms of gayness obsolete. All gays will surgically remove their genitals and have them cryogenically frozen, and will play pinochle until a form of gayness comparable to the one introduced in this thread in which they can participate is discovered.</div></div><hr />

After a while the blood produced from all of the tearing skin starts to act as a rather nice lubricant so you just need to reach that point and you can continue on in your own masturbatory nirvana.</div></div><hr />

Everybody knows that a one hour log isn't enough to get meaningful numbers.  You'd have to parse the exits overnight at the very least to figure out which was best.</div></div><hr />

Besides, the point of this thread is to uncover why this forums is a snooze-fest.  I stated some reasoning, then followed it up a few posts later with some evidence - it was more of a working theroy, then followed by a little evidence rather then 'the same stupid shity sentiment'</div></div><hr />
