<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this was posted yet or if it was already known, if it was, my apologies. But here is a transcript regarding the Original Epic Quest with a small sentence at the end regarding Epic 2.0<br />

question is yes GoD/OOW zones be included but how about fixing the epic 1.0 first before moving on. Epic drops are bottledneck and hard to complete like Quillmane for the Mage epic 1.0. 99% of the time it drops leggings vs. Cloak and it has no PH like other mobs for other epic or turnin mobs to make it spawn. And also who raids PoSky anymore espically to get to the 7th insland for the crown. How abount making PH for quill and making Crown a random drop of any NPC in PoSKY because if it requred to finish epic 1.0 before moving on to 1.5/2.0 there alot people that want be able to ever do this quest to begin with. So my question is is the oriagial quest for epic going to be fixed or is it going to stay the way it is ? <br />

I realize that the time investment for camping epic pieces and the unreliable nature of the drops can be frustrating. I realize that the relative values of the original epics vary greatly, and some of the weapons have aged better than others. Right-click abilities and effects tend to hold their value much longer than stats or weapon ratios. On top of that, the difficulty between epic to epic varies greatly. There is no doubt that these epic quests could benefit from a thorough top-to-bottom retuning. <br />
<br />
That said, there are infinite aspects of the game that, with enough time and resources, we would love to change for the better - but the catch is we are dealing with a finite amount of time and resources. Since the epic quests are fully functional and have been working as is for the past several years, there are less reasons to tinker with them than other more pressing issues. <br />
Not often I get to quote myself. We're not going to revamp the epic 1.0 quests anytime in the foreseeable future. You will not need the original epic to work on or complete the new quest.  <br />

So if you didn't know, Epic 1.0 is not required.<br />

Once again... apologies if this was posted already</div></div><hr />

You can just about solo or double box 95% of the stupid things now.  Short of the hide, if you can't do most of that quest with 1 group now, it's time to give up.<br />
<br />
Oh, and that Quillmane remark is bullshit.  I've killed him 10 times in 3 hours before.  You just need to know how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemoness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">40+ hours camping Quillmane for my mage, no fuck'n sight of that flying donkey let alone a fuck'n cloak. And most of the time I have had help, ie. 3+ tracker who all claim they can get 3+ cloaks to drop per hour, guess what no fucking drop!<br />
Then one day after a 9 hour session in that shitstain of a zone the little fuck pops 5 mins after I log.<br />
As for the hide in PoHate thats too fucking simple to camp, 40 hours camping in hate got 4 hides, 5 mage staffs and 1 chanter drop.<br />
<br />
ps, BTW I hate that donkey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">just way unlucky then i pop to south karana to get a cloak for each of my 2 alts and 1 of my fiances took about 5-6hours tops each time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the exception of Soul Leech and final fight, i soloed the whole thing EASILY, didnt even need HT for any of the fights.  Took me about 2 days.<br />
<br />
Darkforge: Bazaar for 1k, OT dude was up and an easy solo<br />
Drake Spine: took 10 minutes on the second day.<br />
Decrepit hide:  took about 6 hours and 100+ kills<br />
Ghoulbane: 2 hours<br />
Blade of Abgoration: Fairy on the first island dropped it (NOT the princess)<br />
Cell Key: 3 clears of the chests<br />
Dusty Tome: 2 clears of the ratman inhabitant PH<br />
Caradon: What a wuss.<br />
Mummy: dosent autopull anymore, you have to go into the basement before he aggros, but the left CY has no spawns now and there is only 1 roamer.<br />
<br />
Quest is pretty gimped now, only cockblock being the soul leech, which I had MQd for 100k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Id still be happy if they made epics 2.0 involve epic 1.0 in some way.  For instance, 8 step process to get epic 2.0 has the npc for step 3 say, &quot;I need items from step one and 2 or epic 1.0 to continue my work.&quot;  Something along the lines of reducing the time sink, not the skill/gear/numberoffriends required to complete it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deckka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don`t even have GoD yet,still waiting on OoW before I decide to buy anymore expansions.But I`m curious if any part of Epic.2. will require adventures in GoD?<br />
 Been soloing Inny`s Curse lately for a break from xping etc..just need Souleech.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mummy : DID autopull for me . did hand in to ghost in right graveyard . moved the entrance there and saw the mummy running towards me . easy kill too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see a weapon that will have a recomended level of 70 , required level of 66 ( taking a guess). <br />
And by looking back at Kunark content and seeing how much of Epic 1 required Kunark raids ( at the time).. <br />
One could assume that Yes GoD/OoW Raids will be required for Epic 2.</div></div><hr />

You're either completely full of shit or a couple of hundred mages on the mage compendium are stupid - the latter I don't buy.</div></div><hr />
