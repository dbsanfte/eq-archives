How high is the softcap if at 2574 I'm still getting some returns in PoV?  Compensating for the difference in shielding a 6.85% increase in AC (2409 to 2574) resulted in a 10.91% decrease in dps.  When comparing shield to no shield at exactly equal AC though there was no beneficial change.<br />
<br />
Curious to see parses anyone else has done on this.<br />
<br />
Edit: Added DI distribution</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that warriors have seen improvements (at least in GoD) up to the 3k AC level, from what I've seen on TSW. I'd venture a guess that the softcap/marginal return level for AC for SKs is off into that range or beyond. The GoD endgame zone (if it is even coded yet) and the coming of L 70 with OoW imply the need for greater caps. However, it seems most likely that the thread about shields 'raising' that cap was an error. and it should have said shields tend to raise overall AC totals...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Correct, they have.  Thats why I intentionally used PoV, it's a fairly low end zone so the mobs should be lower atk.  The level of AC being used should be high enough to have hit that softcap but it apparently didn't which brings up the point before, if shields are beneficial when hitting softcaps but you aren't hitting it until the content is extremly trivial, whats the point when you would do higher dps by using either a 2h or dual weild in either of those situations, and take less damage as a result of that by killing the mob twice as fast.  That extra benefit that shields supposedly have is useless since by the time it will impact you, you will have surpassed the content by too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That would also fit with SoE dev thinking...the gear that makes an encounter more manageable is availible only after that encounter has been defeated anyhow...<br />
<br />
With the mob dying on that last parse, do you think that there is any question of variability in the mob level/ac/hp/atk? Or were the first 2 also relatively close to dying also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did I read the results right, that the average hit was higher with the shield? (granted might be in margin of error)?<br />
<br />
What was the DI distrubtion like? With 2400ish AC there should be a ton of min/low hits regardless in PoV,  which may make it harder to see the effect of a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The mob went to about 60% hp the first time, 20% hp the second time, then died halfway through on that 3rd one.  I didn't let the mob heal up.  I looked through it and it seemed similar to the other 2 attempts so shouldn't be any real difference there.<br />
<br />
I'll go through again and look at the distribution later, sleep now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interesting, to say the least. Wish I could play atm so I could parse more extensively with a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3 things could have happened there :<br />
<br />
a) The dev was full of shit and shields do not effect the softcap.<br />
<br />
b) The softcap on PoV mobs is higher than 2500ac (so to equip a shield and increase such softcap doesnt make any visible difference since you couldnt hit it to begin with)<br />
<br />
c) The softcap is much lower than 2400ac (yet you still gain tangible mitigation improvements after you hit said softcap. In that case, if, lets say the softcap was 1500, to equip a shield around such ac would make a noticiable difference, yet with another 1000ac, any improvement gained from the shield is burried under all the extra mitigation)<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally i'd bet a) is the good answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice chart Lej...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This would probably be a pita but I think it would be interesting to see damage parses for sizeable differences in AC.<br />
<br />
Something along the lines of using a couple of low end (ac30 or lower), a couple of midrange (ac35-75) and a couple of higher end (ac80+) shields.<br />
<br />
Just a guess, but getting a SK to 1300ish AC with bazaar gear seems fairly reasonable. Some people have said there's some kind of softcap way below the 2500AC listed here. Would anybody be willing to run some tests with say 100AC or so incriments starting at 1300AC and going up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">TSW parsed AC in PoP and showed almost linear gains to ~2200.  If you want more than that, be our guest - parsers are free.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Madrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">From How I understand what they mean is the softcap isnt like the softcap we think of when we think of velious, but rather its like how lejina had it in her graph, the rate that AC effects mitigation is shifted, and more horizontal, then veritcal, and that the AC &quot;softcap&quot; is not something thats hard to reach.<br />
<br />
I'd think it would be more easy to see the effects of a shield, when not so many of the hits are already hits for minimum, because  well, they are already mitigated down to the least, which would cut the sample size that can be effected by shield, down considerably.<br />
<br />
I dont know what % were hits for minimum, but at 2400+ AC in PoV it should be a very high ammount.<br />

still that said, the results are disapointing =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Madrone, the point about many hits already being at min damage so further mitigation would be impossible is good however, assuming I understood the developers comments correctly a shield would raise the soft cap. In my example lets say that AC has 20% effectiveness over 2k and 165 of my ac is from a shield.  In the no shield test that 409 ac over 2k would be worth 82 ac so I should be taking hits as if I had 2082 ac if there was no softcap.  In the shield test assuming its a 1:1 ratio which its quite possibly not (and from these brief tests so far I would assume it isn't) the softcap would be 2165, so only 244 ac would be subject to the 20% effecitveness thus worth 49 ac meaning I should be taking hits as if I had 2214 ac without caps.  Considering that the test with all my gear on (2574 ac) still showed a definite reduction in DPS intake my assumption right now is that ac is worth different amounts in different slots (beyond just the shield) and lacking an item in one place is a huge penality.<br />
<br />
The entire reason for using such a trivial mob was to insure I was at a softcap so the shield effect could be seen more easily from how I understood the comments... perhaps KT (or Barindu if I can't find a suitable test subject) will show better results.  Although it's unlikely I'll go beyond 1 hour for each test since parsing this is alot more tedious/boring than turning on auto attack and afk'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You could probably download the archery autofire program from the ranger boards, set it to cast dark or something on the SK, and cast CH on the cleric and still just AFK to parse... put a fire beetle eye or tradeskill ceramic or something in your primary so you don't ripost and kill the test subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Maybe the softcap is always active but works as an reduction in mitigation on all ac levels. But if the ac advantage against the targets atk is to large an item that allows to break the softcap wont show any benefit, since all aquireable benefits are already gained through ac.<br />
An test in which the ac is less then sufficent for the targettet npc, should show better results when switching an shield on and off while keeping the same ac level.<br />
Try this test with around 1000 ac against the pov frog and you should get useful results if there is an softcap at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hehe, nice info.. <br />
<br />
But.. Bottom line.. It means jack.. I still am not happy with 1h/shield code. 1h/shield still need improvement like I said for long time. I want shield to function well in ANY darn AC level instead of high AC level. Plus, shield AC means nothing to bosses with high ATK, it's still better off for knights to use 2h where riposte penality is being minimized..  <br />
<br />
If there is actually slight improvement due to soft cap being upped a little with shield. It's too small to notice and won't even offset riposte problem. We need noticable improvement to 1h/shield for defense purpose. We ACTUALLY enjoyed NOTICABLE increase in dps via several 2h code upgrades over years. We need that for 1h/shield for noticable defense code upgrades. Once we have that, then we can use BOTH 1h/shield and 2h as viable route. Use 1h/shield for pulling and tanking and 2h for dmg support. In raids, we would use 2h alot cuz pulling/tanking generally are left to warriors/monks and we sometimes offtank in raids then we can use 1h/shield. In xp groups, our roles are flexible, do dmg, pull or/and tank then 2h and 1h/shield can be used in this group setting.<br />
<br />
There are lot of SKs disagreeing with having 1h/shield ALL cuz they are TOO lazy or didn't want to waste DKP to get 1h/shield. Oh please. :) They prefer 2h to do ALL of jobs. How boring is that.. :( And I'm sure SOE is very resistant to give SK good measurement in defense improvement WHILE using 2h for increased dps. I'm sure SOE is more willing to improve our defense if we use 1h/shield with reduced dps. DPS means little if we tank for example.. As a tank, our job is to take damage not to cause damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Also, I think its rather gay for EQ developer to communicate with warriors in TSW about damn shields while EQ developers won't even communicate with damn knights who use shield ALOT more than darn warriors over 5 years. Isn't that ironic?? It would be more logicial for EQ developer to talk to knights like us on shield cuz we are more expert in this over 5 years of experience. Heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please post your parses that show there is no noticable improvement. based on brael's data and tiny bit of other, at this point i'd guess brael is right, there is a penalty for having naked slots and tests need to be done without them.</div></div><hr />

There are just too many iterations to test against, multiply that by the time needed for a qualifying sample size and you have hours and hours of boring parse time needing to be done. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i did an extremely short parse (about 6 min) on gamite frog at 1798 ac with shield, DI was around 6 for that. so... against the gamite frog, you're well beyond the point of diminishing returns for AC.<br />
<br />
will try to do some longer parses on this at lower ACs when i can convince a chealer.</div></div><hr />

how are you calculating average DI on these? when you say average are you calculating the mean? i thought the formulas were<br />
(max hit - min hit) / 19 = DI<br />
min hit - DI = DB<br />
(mean hit - DB) / DI = mean DI<br />
or, with changing min hits due to shielding,<br />
(mean hit - min hit + DI) / DI = mean DI<br />
<br />
which on your parses makes it<br />
<br />
DI = 18.79<br />
DB = 45.21 (with 18% shielding)<br />
ave di without shield 5.94<br />
ave di with shield 6.16<br />
ave di with 2574 AC 5.58<br />
<br />
also, for some reason your min and max hits differ by 10 more than mine on a gamite frog...<br />
<br />
anyway, i was able to do some parsing last night for a short period.<br />
for all tests all slots at least had something in them except i was holding a 2hander for test with no shield.<br />

<br />
so... in the short 20 minute tests, the average DI was lowered by 0.18 at approximately same AC by having shield equipped... this is basically the same within statistical error.<br />
<br />
<br />
i also did some other even shorter tests just to see how higher/lower ac changed things<br />
