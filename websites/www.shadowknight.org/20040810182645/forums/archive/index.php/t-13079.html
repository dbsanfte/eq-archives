Can any of you tell me solo possibilities or techniques you used to get certain shards?  I'm not overly familiar with luclin zones, but I seem to be managing okay, getting the easier ones out of the way first before I go calling people to assist me.  Yesterday I left a train of about 20 iksar skellies in the grey at the ZI and felt pretty bad about that. :)  still working on that shard... seem to be managing okay with soloing the pond's sun rev's.<br />
<br />
Shard pieces remaining:<br />
<br />
Dat - Fungus Grove from Shik`Nar Warriors and Royals <br />
<br />
Kel - The Grey from Sun Revenants near the Lake <br />
<br />
Kelera - Sanctus Seru from A Legionnaire of the Hand, or Legionnaires on the top area of the zone <br />
<br />
Raf - The Deep from Thought Horrors and Thought Leeches, any but Young <br />
<br />
Tak - Maiden's Eye from named Goranga <br />
<br />
Ved - Acrylia Cavern from Griling Skullcrackers near the Gate <br />
<br />
Vin - Ssraeshza Temple from Skeletons in the Mines</div></div><hr />

Thanks, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>silthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I soloed all except for the Deep and FG. No real tricks except for the frame. For the frame you just FD flop in the remains, get up, hit attack, FD, repeat until you get your hand-in MOB.<br />

I imagine if all the posts were removed that were essentially bullshit, and vital information was organized better, you wouldn't need a search button. <br />
<br />
Alas, beget and woe.... till then, you can count on folks with garfield sigs to link it for you anyway, but they'll type all sorts of witty and biting remarks as a price.  <br />
