<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so the PoHate and Sky drops are my last two peices i need so i think im gonna finish my epic....I was just wondering if based on my gear do you guys think i would be able to farm hate and like first isle of sky efficiently with me and a cleric geared vt also?  i havent really been to either zone in a while,   and have the resourses to get there on my own.  I just dont wanna go alone and get owned the first time since my only experience in the two zones have been with no less then a group, and ive kinda been through a lot of raid content since heh.  Id like to get my epic but if i can do it alone rather then force my friends to farm hate and sky with me for a epic i dont really need then ill do it.  (theyll do the final fight im sure, just not the farms)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With a slower or healer, you can definitely duo the first section of Hate.  Was doing that last week with a 52 cleric bot and my crappy gear.<br />

Enchanter epic piece dropped twice tonight within the first 30 minutes we were in Hate.  Add 20 more dead drakes to my list -  ashenbone shield and the abbasi dropped, but no freakin hide yet again.</div></div><hr />
