Today I finally spawned the Breeder, killed, looted, and handed in.<br />
<br />
The 3 items for the sheath are Eye of the Dark God from amy knights in fear, Lock of Hair from a Blessed Unicorn from a rolling plains steed in growth, and a Gloom Nightmare Hide, from gloom nightmares in nightmare.<br />
<br />
Combine was trivial for me at 239+ 5%.<br />
<br />
When turned in, you get this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I admit that I did not think you could accomplish this task. Perhaps you really are meant to be the sword's champion. Our work here is not done however. There are those that wish the sword to be destroyed. One of these beings is a froglok paladin named Fraga. He was last seen in the Plane of Valor. Kill him and bring me any clues as to what his plans may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fraga is a blue to 68 con frog pally in one of the tents in valor. Quad 2850 max but hes pretty gimp. 1 group took him down with me tanking. Loot Fraga's Parchment and bring it back to Sienn.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Got bored, and decided to see how hard froggy hit for myself. Snagged Virtue and FoS, putting me at 6333/1361 with CA3, CS3, PE.<br />
<br />
Took a swing, hit him for.... 14 damage.... shut up....<br />
<br />
Punched me for 1160<br />
Ramped<br />
Punched for 252 ((Stunned))<br />
Attack off<br />
Punch for 380<br />
((Unstunned))<br />
Punches for 640<br />

Punched for 251 ((Stunned))<br />

FD<br />
Fraga is surrouned by an aura of Divine Favor<br />
<br />
Well, DF is a small rune, that explains the 14 ((HaHA! VIndicated!))<br />
<br />
Supposedly, fully slowable.. think he can be crippled to... lemme test if there are adds:<br />
<br />
..... OW.<br />
<br />
You begin casting Festering Darkness<br />
Fraga says &quot;For the Glory of Marr!&quot;<br />
Your target is immune to changes in it's run speed.<br />
Your target resisted the Festering Darkness spell.<br />
You no longer have a target<br />
Fraga punches you for 2720 ((At this point, my heart rate tripled.))<br />
You try to slash Fraga, but miss.<br />
Fraga tries to punch YOU, but YOU riposte.<br />
Fraga bashes YOU for 251 damage<br />
You begin casting Death Peace<br />
Fraga tries to punch YOU, but misses.<br />
Fraga tries to punch YOU, but misses.<br />
FD<br />
<br />
This bastard his HARD... here's my suggestion.<br />
<br />
Since there were no adds, SHammy pulls with slow. As Shammy begins casting, begin casting snare. Won't land, but we'll get aggro ((assuming an sk is tanking. Warrior can arrange it his own way)). Cripple to follow immediately.<br />
<br />
Alright, going to nuke him, test HP and Disease resist. Wish me luck!<br />
<br />
Only got off one spear of Decay before I had to FD, and it was resisted. =/<br />
Hit for 1810, 259, and 1030 out of 7 swings, other three missed. Ramped once. Stunned...<br />
<br />
This ones gonna need one damn well oiled group.<br />
<br />
FUrther edit:<br />
<br />
Managed to land disease twice and Zeefers. Though at diff times. 651 didn't take him past 99, so we're deal with... about 100k HP. Now, I personally, since he just got a new high of 2850, wouldn't like to see this fight over 1 minute. So, we'll need about 1667dps.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to have an tanking group with our healer, similar to how we did Varns today. Dps in their own group, and just burn him down. Except, this time, no AE to worry about.<br />
<br />
<br />
.... Punches for 2850? More a monk than a pally....</div></div><hr />

Haven't done the combine =) I didn't actually fight Fraga, I got Virtue and FoS, and just hit him and FD'd a lot, to get what info I could. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Voltayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well thanks to my mystical magical powers. I have found out that fraga is a lvl 65 mob....IE he cons white to a lvl 65. based on the dmg reports though I'm thinking undercon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaln V'Orro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fraga's DPS is a little overstated, he hits very slowly.  I one grouped him today (Im level 67 now) with me cleric shm bard gar and necro.  Cleric had to heal with SL because the DPS is so spiky, and the shammie kept Trushar on me for most of the fight.  Feel free to HT his ass at 10% to finish him off :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Indeed. His overall DPS isn't bad. Just VERY spikey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any faction hits?<br />
<br />
Nope, and nothing assists him either. Most named epic mobs have no faction hits, it seems. Rogues have an odd faction issue, IE: KoS to bards from aggroing named until hand in for that part is done. But the epics seemed designed to not hurt faction too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crynus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just some bonus info here...<br />
I killed him with myself (67 gimp sk) a 70 time sk, 70 time cleric, and a 70 time enc, that was a bot.  We had no troubles, even had cleric on rampage the first time.  Also, his respawn is less than an hour or so, prolly like 20 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just killed him easy with me (70 sk), 65 nec, 68 clr, 70 bst, 69 dru (boxed) and another 68 cleric (also boxed) and another 70 sk that happened to be near helped out with dps from halfway (thanks Grimknot). Was cake. I'm mostly VT-geared, nec also, others mostly high-end bazaar/some PoP. Buffed 9700hp 1750ac (+AoP).<br />
<br />
Pulled him out with ToD, took some blasting at the beginning before beastlord got him slowed, then just mow him down. Started casting spells at 20-30% somewhere and thus he was totally finished. Fight took about a minute.<br />
<br />
Pretty much what the others have said, just confirming how gimp he is and that pre-elementalgeared can do it easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">as others have said, he's a pussy.<br />
<br />
So what if he hits for over 2k, he doesn't hit for it often.  He spends most his time casting, especially below 50%.  I seriously doubt he has 100k hp, he went down pretty fast when I did him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xikraazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well on my first try - he quadded the warrior for max dmg.<br />
<br />
Result Dead warrior in 2 secs :)<br />
<br />
2nd try - a success<br />
<br />
<br />
Xikraazy - Druzzil Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fragda was utterly pathetic when i killed him.. his max hit of 3k was intimidating so i grabbed 2 groups.... during the entire fight his top 4 hits were 2100, 900, 800,680... every other hit was sub 700.. this guy was a complete goober.  just get some dps and burn him down.  (just fyi.. i tanked him at 10k, 2200ac).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lenerien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did Frage out of order and did have anytrouble</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tried him twice so far, I also tank him at about 10.4k and 2200 AC (with Aura) both times he has come away with exp while we recovered corpses.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I just got unlucky with the RNG but he was hitting me for 380 about half the time and the rest of the time was 1500+ with quite a few 2850's thrown in for good measure. <br />
<br />
He hit really fast even when slowed and rampaged alot. I guess the next time I bring a warrior and 2 clerics just to make sure.</div></div><hr />
