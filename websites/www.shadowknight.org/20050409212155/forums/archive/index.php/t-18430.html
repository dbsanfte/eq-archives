<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to parse damage done by all raid members to a single target (God, boss..etc) I want to see who has the biggest total damage in that encounter. I have YALP but I have no clue how to use it. Can someone help me please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Once you have your log file loaded into YALP:<br />
(File/Open, then browse to your EQ directory and choose your log file.  It will be in the format eqlog_charname_servername.txt)<br />
(For example, my log file would be eqlog_Khat_vazaelle.txt)<br />
<br />
Click the Damage tab.<br />
Choose the mob name from the drop-down list.<br />
Click the DD by Party radio button.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point it will list all of the group members and their respective numbers.<br />
You're choosing DD by Party (defensive damage) because you chose a mob name from the drop-down.<br />
If you click on the OD by Party you'll see the damage the mob was doing to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you Khat for your reply, that certainly explains the DD, OD stuff I couldnt understand. I did what you told me but there's a problem.. I cant see caster's DPS. It only shows me as the only DPS to one monster, how do you enable Nuke parsing? (or even dots)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see caster damage from my latest log.<br />
I know YALP has/has had issues reporting true spell numbers on occasion.<br />
However, if the spell info is in your log it should be incorporated into the report.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the menu under Options and ensure that  Calculate Third Party Damage has a check next to it.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it very well should be showing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you have to turn on spell damage, other melee hits, etc in everquest. otherwise it doesn't get logged and you'll never be able to see caster DoT damage because thankfully that never shows up on other peoples screens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was filtering all other melee damage, but I have enabled them now in my junk window. I still couldnt see other melee DPS until I UNchecked (calculate third party damage) the DPS of other melee players was enabled. Howevr, I still cant see casters DPS. There was no DPS for our casters in the Damage tab under DD by party for a specific encounter that am sure casters were nuking it.<br />
<br />
 I am using YALP 2.3 btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you still have to turn on spell damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spell damage is turned on, and I can see casters daamge in main chat window. I have noticed something while parsing. Our pet dPS is RESPECTABLE, and grouping with a rogue with less AAs and level 65 (but somehow not very well equipped) I out DPSed him :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still cant parse spell damage I am sure Spell Damage is including and goes in Mani Chat (the melee damage goes in another chat window.. do I need to have them in same window?). I really need to prase ALL DPS to reward guildies for being active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Isn't there something severely flawed in rewarding guilies based on DPS contribution to a raid,  unless your applying somekind of handicapping system, your rogues and wizards are always going to be rewarded and your clerics never will be.  Care to elaborate on what you means by rewarding guildies based on thier DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have downloaded the Developers Version of YALP which prases spells. The other version of YALP doesnt. :)</div></div><hr />
