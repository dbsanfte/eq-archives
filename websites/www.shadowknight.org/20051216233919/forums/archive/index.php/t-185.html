<br />
1.) Please take a look at my weak gear and make some suggestions. I've got a mere 8k to spend.<br />
<br />
Magelo Profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=150706) <br />
<br />
Note: I guestimated base AC and ATK values. They're sure to be off.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) I have a 53 shaman to help me solo. Given constant Strength + Dexterity + Agility + Stamina + Tuna + Alarcity + Regrowth + Slows + Heals + Pet damage from an ungrouped shaman...Where in would you go? (Shaman doesn't have Luclin)<br />
<br />
3.) How do pets work regarding XP earned these days?<br />
<br />
Thanks, any advice would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few suggestions...<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin Gauntlets or Thunder Etched Gauntlets<br />
Shadel Bandit Ring<br />
Royal Frosted Velium Boots<br />
Blood Ember Bracers<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
Idol of the Thorned<br />
<br />
If you are on Kael faction, quest for the Collar of the Storm.<br />
If on Coldain faction, quest for the Coldain Ring, 9th is very nice.<br />
If on Claws of Veeshan faction, look into Bracers of Benevolence.</div></div><hr />

Well overall I'd say your gear's acceptable for 55, in fact much of it is better than mine. The Splitpaw mask's got to go though, that's just sad. There are literally dozens of masks far far superior to that which can be bought for chump change or a small fraction of 8k. <br />
<br />
I suppose personally I'd also ditch the earring of essence. Aside from some Luclin stuff that's not necessarily common, your current gear hasn't been made obsolete. Any upgrades you desired when you quit should still be valid choices, and probably considerably less expensive than they used to be.<br />
<br />
Welcome back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha. I can explain that actually, I play on Rallos Zek. The resist/worth ratio is excellent. Though, I am looking for something with a bit AC.</div></div><hr />
