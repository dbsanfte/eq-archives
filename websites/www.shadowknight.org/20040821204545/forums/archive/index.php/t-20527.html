<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's kind of spooky about the end was that he hasn't updated since 5/19/01, and he said he would when he returned from the cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">holy shit.<br />

holy shit.<br />
<br />
i hope this is bullshit.  <br />
<br />
it is most likely bullshit...still very nicely done tho....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think it is too, the link i posted above had some info on why it's a fake but none of the links they posted work...<br />
<br />
lol, the end seemed a little over the top but it was a good scary story...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">...if he had toned down the hyperbole a bit towards the end, and kept it more &quot;scientific&quot;, people would still be guessing.<br />
<br />
Good read, very reminiscent of Lovecraft<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hodag myth infoz (http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/hodag.html) <br />
<br />
In case any of you are curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and if any of you looked up Hodag the first three links on google explain how the Hodag is a hoax so the reference of the author of the story to the hodag is a pretty good clue the story is false</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He went a bit too far at the end which spoiled it imo. The rest was very well done though, good suspension building. Long time since something I read was remotely scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't think anyone knew about the hodag unless they had lived/vacationed near Rhinelander, Wi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i think the blair witch project symbol was a give away too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uwildi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would think that a website has been kept up for four years now whith the owner &quot;missing&quot;, and therefor not paying for it, is a fairly good sign that it is fictional.</div></div><hr />
