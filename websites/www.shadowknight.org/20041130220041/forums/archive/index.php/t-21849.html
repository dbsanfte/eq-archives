<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At the suggestion of others, I'll go with something more concise for now.  Still a work in progress, though I'm getting close to finished with this stuff... suggestions/comments/etc. welcome.  As always, please cross-link any re-posts.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There are currently two tanking gaps between the three tank classes.  One gap between Shadowknights and Paladins, and another between Warriors and Knights in general.  These issues need to be addressed, but cannot be treated entirely independently from one another.  <br />
<br />
- Link the paladin Force of XXX line of stuns so that only one can be used at a time.  <br />
<br />
- Replace the paladin Quellious' Word line (10.0 sec stuns) with a 0.0 sec stun with a high resist mod and low cast/recast time and a moderate mana drain.   (Spells would fill paladin role of interrupting casters.)<br />
<br />
- Add a “Recourse Box” – a buff window specifically for recourse effects.  <br />
<br />
- Give shadowknights a 25% accuracy debuff with high aggro.  18 sec duration, 12 sec recast, 1 sec cast, -55 resist check, equivalent restrictions to paladin stuns.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, give shadowknights a 0.0 second stun with a 25% avoidance recourse.  24 second duration, 20 second recast, 1 second cast, -55 resist check.  It should have a max level paralleling the equivalent paladin Force of … stun and a minimum level low enough to not be a hindrance, but high enough to prevent use on Eye of Zomm and random low-level mobs.<br />
<br />
- Give knights two disciplines to return them to their offtanking role.  <br />
<br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: shield block (thus shield must be equipped), 18 second duration, 30 minute reuse.  <br />
<br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, 72 second duration, 4.5 minute reuse, shield required.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns are at the root of a lot of the current class balance problems for the tank classes.  They are extremely powerful against blue trash mobs and the like, are entirely useless against immune mobs, and address only part of the problem with others (incoming DPS vs. being one-rounded).  The above changes would reduce paladin reliance on stuns and make their impact more consistent.  Currently, the impact of stuns varies greatly from mob to mob depending on level, immunity, resistance, etc.   Paladins would be compensated for the lost stun power with the much-needed tanking disciplines.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknights would be brought into line with paladins through the avoidance buff/accuracy debuff, which would effectively parallel paladin stuns.  These abilities, together with the rapid-fire mitigation discipline, would cement knights in their traditional offtanking roles while having little impact on the traditional warrior role of raid main tanking.  All three tank classes would be viable for single group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would prefer the avoidance recourse/buff as opposed to the accuracy debuff.  For one, it is more in character with the class for the effect to be &quot;selfish&quot;.  I also envision it having some use as a pulling tool, an area where we badly need a shot in the arm, where it would be far more useful being a buff on us that would be effective against multiple mobs hitting us than it would be as a debuff on a single mob.<br />
<br />
I also think it should be tuned to have a shorter duration but a higher effectiveness, like 2 ticks and 50% avoidance with a 12 second recast.  At 24 seconds and 25% avoidance, especially with a 20 second recast, we are guaranteed 25% avoidance for as long as we can cast it without interrupts/resists.  This is a great deal more reliable and results in less spiky damage than paladin stuns.  At 2 ticks and 50% avoidance, it also buys us a bit better of a chance to get FD off when pulling, or get back to the group with mobs needing mez before we die.<br />
<br />
I'm in full agreement with the rest though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The accuracy debuff/avoidance buff is not what we need in terms of pulling.  As an SK, if you get hit while pulling you've already made a mistake and are probably going to die anyway.  SK pulling would be better remedied by the addition of stonewall and a FD upgrade.  This is mostly about tanking balance, but I should/will add in pulling-related things.  I'd still like to see what siilvir has to say on the matter (*hint hint*).  <br />
<br />
As far as duration is concerned, you're right about it being less spikey than pally stuns.  The idea behind that was that it's balanced by the fact that pallys can reduce damage further with their stuns (even limited to a single spell from the force line, they can get ~31%  avoidance if all goes well).  Perhaps decreasing the duration and increasing the + avoidance/- accuracy would be better... I'll have to think more on that.  Simply shortening both the cast and recast is also an option.  <br />
<br />
As for avoidance buff vs. accuracy debuff, I consider the accuracy debuff the better solution in part *because* it lacks some of the advantages you mentioned - those advantages disrupt the balance vs pally stuns and give it the potential to extend into areas it shouldn't (cast on an offtanked mob when tanking something immune, for instance).  A short duration high-aggro accuracy debuff will not lead to us being debuff bitches any more than pally stuns do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree we need an FD upgrade anyway, but I'm sure monks won't be too happy about us getting something like stonewall on top of that.  I don't think this spell as a buff/recourse by any means &quot;fixes&quot; pulling, but it could help and would have uses.<br />
<br />
Mainly why I'd prefer it as a recourse/buff is that's the way I originally envisioned it when I proposed it and I guess I'm just attached to the idea.  I think any advantage of that implementation would already be handily offset by the advantages of a true stun.  Of course, that doesn't hold as true anymore if it's tied to a 0.0 sec stun.<br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to it being a debuff, I just don't find it as appealing.  And in that form it is considerably weaker than paladin stuns which completely prevent attacks (or any activity at all), and which they have multiple forms of that they can chain-cast.  I think it would have to be tuned to be quite a bit more potent if it was a debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not opposed to it being a debuff, I just don't find it as appealing.  <br />
<br />
It's easier to code and doesn't have anything exploitable holes in it like a buff would, even if it had a min level to prevent casting on eyes and such.  <br />
<br />
And in that form it is considerably weaker than paladin stuns which completely prevent attacks (or any activity at all),  <br />
The avoided damage over time is roughly equivilant.  As for preventing casting, I consider it fair/balanced that pallys keep their superiority at interrupting casts.  <br />
<br />
and which they have multiple forms of that they can chain-cast.  <br />
<br />
Not if my above changes go into effect.<br />
<br />
 I think it would have to be tuned to be quite a bit more potent if it was a debuff. <br />
<br />
Any more potent and it exceeds pally stunning.  This is bad.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for stonewall, we should have gotten it the first time around.  It's my one notable complaint with our pulling.  I think a FD upgrade is probably overdue, but stonewall is my only major gripe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they change the stuns too, yeah, it'll be fine.  As long as paladins retain all their stuns as they are, including the new OoW stuns on Lucy, it's too weak.<br />
<br />
Do you believe we'll get some kind of spell to be competitive with stuns, an avoidance and a mitigation discipline, and stonewall in addition to that?  I think we'd be lucky to get the proposed spell and the avoidance and mitigation disciplines, and if by some miracle we were so fortunate, I think an improvement to FD and the AA to FD through spells would be sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Stonewall IS the AA to FD through spells...<br />
<br />
As for whether or not we'll get it, I can't say, but it's warrented.  Warriors have the tools to excell in their primary role of main tanking.  We lack the tools to excell at our primary role of offtanking - warriors are currently as good, better if you take away the argument of &quot;they have to be ready to step into the MT rotation&quot;.  <br />
<br />
None of the above would infringe on anyone else's role except for the makshift role of WS tanking taken up by rangers because of knight tanking issues and ranger DPS issues (rangers need their DPS fixed too).  What it would do is cement knights in their established role of offtanking like warriors are cemented in their established role of main tanking.  We need the tools to excell in our role like other classes can excell in theirs.<br />
<br />
And as far as FD-related stuff is concerned, it's extremely secondary to the tanking issues IMO.  It needs addressed, but not nearly as badly as the tanking issues.  Our primary function is to tank - pulling is a secondary function of peripheral value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pyrthin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, brain fart, I was thinking of their Stone Stance disc.  Yes, Stonewall is warranted and overdue.</div></div><hr />

There are currently two tanking gaps between the three tank classes. One gap between Shadowknights and Paladins, and another between Warriors and Knights in general. These issues need to be addressed, but cannot be treated entirely independently from one another. <br />
<br />
First of all, Warriors are SUPPOSED TO HAVE A TANKING GAP OVER Knights. That is the ONLY role of a Warrior - tanking.<br />
<br />
Also, I would attribute any &quot;assumed&quot; tanking gap between Paladins and Shadowknights by stating that Paladins have always been cast into the Defensive tank role by sony, and Shadowknights into the Offensive tank role. SKs can out DPS Paladins with thier DoT's, etc. If you take a Paladin and a SK similarly geared, that SK better outdamage the Paladin, or they just suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Link the paladin Force of XXX line of stuns so that only one can be used at a time. <br />
<br />
Those without a valid fix for thier class often seek to nerf other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
--- Melee immunity discipline: shield block (thus shield must be equipped), 18 second duration, 30 minute reuse.  <br />
<br />
Um, Harmshield much? Please, don't complain that you can't attack when its been cast, that is the price you pay for being a hybrid. Mure melee can attack while in thier immunity discipline, you can't. Be happy you have a way to achieve melee immunity at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
--- DI-mitigation discipline: 30-35% DI-mitigation, 72 second duration, 4.5 minute reuse, shield required.<br />
<br />
HAHAHA are you serious? So a Warrior has to wait 7 minutes between their disciplines but you want a Paladin to wait only ~3 minutes? A significant amount of the encounters I have been in last over 3 minutes... Warriors have to tank then without defensive. Of course you are going to waste more mana healing a non-Warrior, thats the name of the game. Got a problem with it? Twink out a Warrior and work from there.<br />
<br />
Dude, you are not supposed to be able to take the damage a Warrior can. You already have the lifetaps in conjunction with the heals from everyone else to add to your total health.<br />
<br />
With all these disciplines added in for you, that would also mean that Endurance will play a &quot;vital&quot; role as well for you. So not only do you get to make use of HPs and Mana on All/All or Plate Class items, but you want to make use of the Endurance (which was implemented for pure melee) as well? In that case, you better be giving me benefit from the wasted mana on the items I wear and give casters added mana from the wasted endurance on theirs. <br />
<br />
The best example of poor itemization would be to simply look at the Planar Progression charms.... Warriors max at 100HPs, while Knights get 90HPs and 80Mana. Not only are the HPs on the item 90% of that of a Warrior's, but you have the 80Mana to complement that. What ever happened to the 75% Warrior, 25% caster role that Knights were supposed to fit into? Seems more like 90% Warrior, 80% caster. This can futher be eveidenced in the itemization of armors such as Ornate and Elemental.<br />
<br />
I'd be the first to admit when a class has a problem, but in this case it is a serious case of Warrior penis-envy thats for damn sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Stonewall IS the AA to FD through spells...<br />
<br />
Oh, it is.. but it is also the disipline that mitigates 50% of the DI of a mob while allowing a Warrior to keep his DPS. The Warrior, however, is hella snared.<br />
<br />
Its just another take on defensive, and runs on the same timer. You cannot use Defensive and then Stonewall in succession.<br />
<br />
Also, taking the Stonewall Monk AA would be the same thing as taking a Warrior's defensive. It is unwarranted and infringes on class specialties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1.  He's not seeking to nerf paladins overall, but improve them.  It's tied to getting discs.  Turn your brain on.<br />
<br />
2.  You lose agro with Harmshield, dumbfuck.<br />
<br />
3.  Yes there is a tanking gap between knights and warriors.  There should always be one.  But it is too large right now.  Lifetaps don't scale.  Nothing in our spellbook allows us to tank where we need to.<br />
<br />
<br />
This proposal is not about taking the MT spot from warriors.  You aren't thinking or reasoning.  If you said, tweak it, less DI reduction, shorter duration, etc., you might be thinking.  As it is, you are displaying the typcial &quot;Warrior is the only tank ever&quot; mentality.  Fuck off and go back to Steele Whiners.<br />
<br />
And Ziagwa, did you even fucking read the proposal?  The entire proposal is based around off-tanking, not Main Tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dumbfuck?<br />
<br />
Like i said in my post, losing that aggro is the price you pay for being a hybrid. I guess I should itemize every post I make and make the assumption you think you are talking to someone without a clue. By the way, most of the time when someone posts without a &quot;D00D&quot; or  &quot;L33T&quot;, they might know what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
Show me the &quot;assumed&quot; overly big tanking gap with parses of significant length and I'll agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh this is going to be goooood!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow, some people just don't get it.  Ever hear the expression &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;?<br />
<br />
That applies to this, suggestion or not there is nothing that is needed to impove knights.  We are fine.  I can OT in Plane of Time phase 1 2 and 3 and I am by far not even that greatly equiped, but I can do it with no deaths.<br />
<br />
Ya i read the thing, it was some dude bitching because he thinks he cant OT, Newsflash WE CAN :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">With your 1340 ac you arent tanking with a reasonable group.<br />
<br />

<br />
Going to give you the benefit of the doubt so I'll explain this.<br />
1.  There is/should be a tanking gap between Knights/Warriors however the gap right now is slightly too big.<br />
2.  There is a tanking gap between Paladins/SK's.  There should NOT be one at all.  Paladins spells are more defensive oriented meaning they have heals and buffs, our damage Warrior like damage when burning is our third function and something that rarely comes into play (much like Paladin CC abilities via root, infact their method of Warrior like dps comes into play more often).  You're thinking that because we have the capability to do some damage occasionally we should tank worse.  You're also thinking that defense=tanking.  As a final note you cannot be an offensive tank in EQ it simply doesn't work, there are how many DPS classes (8 is the correct answer here: Berserkers, Beastlords, Magicians, Monks, Necromancers, Rangers, Rogues, and Wizards), there are how many tank classes? (3 is the correct answer here Paladin, Shadowknight, Warrior)  If we were to be an offensive tank which we aren't since well... contrary to popular belief our spells are more defense oriented than offense we would be at the very best the 3rd best tank and the 9th best source of damage.  Do you see how this does not work?<br />
<br />
Those without a valid fix for thier class often seek to nerf other classes.<br />
<br />
You don't see the problem with stuns?  Espically OoW ones?  It's borderline ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Um, Harmshield much? Please, don't complain that you can't attack when its been cast, that is the price you pay for being a hybrid. Mure melee can attack while in thier immunity discipline, you can't. Be happy you have a way to achieve melee immunity at all.<br />
<br />
Harmshield and Divine Aura are non tanking abilities, just like Feign Death is.  When it is on you lose aggro, you cannot tank with anti tanking invulnerability (no, sorry posistioning an uber mob with invul when you're the only person on aggro doesn't count as tanking)<br />
<br />
HAHAHA are you serious? So a Warrior has to wait 7 minutes between their disciplines but you want a Paladin to wait only ~3 minutes?

<br />
Lower duration/faster recycle disciplines are perfect for Knights, we aren't going the stretch on a boss mob, we're tanking weaker mobs that sometimes do and sometimes don't live as long (the longer living ones are generally lower dps once debuffed, so these abilities even have tremendous benefit then)<br />
<br />
Lifetaps are dead, they cannot be balanced under the current system because player and mob damage do not scale equally.  <br />
<br />
GoD itemization for SK's is abysmal at best.  PoP is alot better (with the exception of ornate armor).<br />
<br />
75/25 went out when it was proved it doesn't work, only idiots that can't think continue to believe it can.<br />
<br />
Oh, for the record I don't want whats proposed here.  I simply want a global decrease in mob dr, an increase in how often players debuff dr, and a stonestance like disc.  That doesnt change the fact that you just made yourself look like a complete idiot however.</div></div><hr />

A 2AC and 5HP difference between them, in addition to you being able to use the mana on them... to me, that looks like the itemization favors SK BY FAR.<br />

<br />
I assume you've done some of the same events I've done from your Magelo, and defensive sure as hell does not &quot;go the stretch&quot; on a boss mob. From events that last significantly longer than 3 mins, to mobs that tap endurance (with no viable form of endurance regen currently in the game by the way), defensive is pretty much void on a lot of encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya, I guess I'm the idiot....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm maybe im missing something here..but here goes<br />
<br />
Yep warrior discs often dont last the whole boss mob encounter..thats why warriors have abilities that allow a smooth tank transition that no other class has. <br />
<br />
Ziagwa you sir are an utter dick if you cant see that SKs to a greater or lesser degree (depending on level) are broken as far as tanking goes when compared to either of the other tanking class's. Hell with your hp / ac you wouldnt get a tanking spot in most half decent guilds other than when people are feeling sorry because SKs are so shit and rather than make it clear to the Sks in your guild they give out token off tanking jobs to keep you happy. You somehow seem to have missed the numberous other threads where it was made more than clear as to why SKs were the worst of the tanking classes.<br />
<br />
SJ - the tanking discs you are proposing both rely on the use of a shield.. not to be funny or anything but until you get to fairly high level of raiding content the 1h + shield combo sucks major ass due to the quality of 1h and shields that are available. What you are proposing would do little to help the SK in the smaller guild just starting out on some kind of progression and so would not in effect make us any better tanks than we currently are and so the gap between warriors, paladins and sks would remain exactly as it is , with us at the very very bottom.</div></div><hr />

No your an utter dick for not understanding that whilst yes you can off tank...we can all off tank (athough  in GoD where it dubious we can tank at all some mobs..at least not with any reliability). The problem is the difference in how much damage we take when compared to Warrior and Paladins. <br />
<br />
Its not a hard concept to understand this but seeing how you somehow missed all the other threads and discussions on this I will give you a short recap. <br />
<br />
Warriors have inate mitigation + various discs should they be needed.<br />
Paladins have stuns<br />
shadowknights have ..............................................Oh thats right shadowknights dont actually have anything at all, zip, nadda, not a god damn thing, making us by far the worst of the tanking classes and situationally worse than none tanking classes. <br />

Sks are getting dangerously close to being rangers without the dps yet again.<br />
<br />
Im smelling peoples twink knights or soe employees towing the company line in this thread.  The tank balence is so far out of wack there is no other conclusion.  No matter how many times you say its all balenced, it will never be true.<br />
<br />
For whoever said to stop looking at other classes skills, its tough not to look over the fence when all we got was better and bashing and a marginal improvement to a pet that is basically a fashon statement.  For the most part we got the same aa's as another class(es) that we share abilities with, only they are fractionally as useful to us as the class they where designed for with the same aa cost.  We do share abilities with the monks, only the stonewall aa would have been just as useful to us as to the monks and we cant have that...maybe they can just quadrouple the aa cost for sks to keep &quot;the standard&quot; of fairness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any time a raid guild loses their MT's (warriors) its always a devastating blow to progression and morale, more so then any other class by far.  SOE in an effort to prevent that from happening, have made changes to the game/classes to keep warriors pacified.  It has been my observation that for whatever reason warriors and to a lesser extent other classes have always found sks to be distasteful.  As part of SOE's effort to keep the game alive, they have choosen to make sks a weak and inferior class to pacify knight haters.  Im guessing nothing is going to change.  I dont see gross incompetence, and complete neglect as reasonable explanations for the problems with the game and some classes that has been around for 5 years and is obviously still not tagged as dead by SOE.</div></div><hr />

None of the tank classes do enough damage for it to be particularly impactful, and cannot from a balance standpoint.  The idea of &quot;DPS tank&quot; simply doesn't work - you end up with a 3rd rate tank and 9th rate damage dealer, and that simply equates a shitty class.  <br />
<br />
Our tanking advantage over a ranger is smaller than a warriors tanking advantage over us, weaponshield aside.  Factor in discs and a ranger is situationally better - they can tank things we cannot thanks to weaponshield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW Annoc, DPS isn't our primary focus, infact it's not even our secondary focus, those goto tanking/pulling roles, just like yours is tanking/healing, our dps equates to your cc and buffing (others) abilities not to lacking a way to compete with stuns so that we tank equally again like we have for oh... 4 years now (well... thats not entirely true, we held the advantage for 3 years).  Theres 2 ways to compete with stuns, give SK's their own stuns or give us melee mitigation abilities like stonestance but on a faster recycle.  Take your pick, personally I would rather have the latter since stuns interrupt mobs to and theres no reason for SK's to share that advantage.</div></div><hr />

I will tell you another thing, i am damn glad I tanked my own trials and didn't get pushed through by some warrior.  I tanked my way through Vxed and Tipt and didn't wait for some warrior to feel sorry for me and let me tag along to get a flag.  I earned it and I have the scars to prove it I tanked this stuff pre nerf.  I am not one to comment on stuff I didn't have direct experience with thats why I didnt say much about the GoD trials until I had done them myself.  Prior to that did I have problems tanking?  Sure it was harder for me, first time I went to PoD Cy at level 53 it was rough.  When I went to tank pov at level 60 (after passing trials not when it opened) I got my butt kicked pretty good until slow landed.  When I went to bot (again before it was opened I had a rough time with the wing bosses but I geared up and I did some strategy and I did it with no warrior help and I am damn proud of that.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned if I could not tank Vxed and Tipt and pass without help for a warrior I sure don't belong in Kod Taz<br />
<br />
I sure don't want to have to rely on a warrior to fight my battles for me now.<br />
<br />
We clearly need some direction here from SoE and the Devs.  If we are no long are tank class are we going to be dps or puller or what?<br />
<br />
If we are give us the tools to do that job.<br />
<br />
For pulling stonestance type ability and a insta FD would be the trick.<br />
<br />
If we are going to be dps give us a skill increase and some dps spells.<br />
<br />
If we are going to tank give us some kind of mitigation bulwark of vie type spell or a riposte disk<br />
<br />
This not having the tools to any job well is really frustrating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the surface it would seem that I have done well but at the same time I can see tremendous deficienies in my tanking and where this is going to end up.<br />
<br />
Each expansion brings harder hitting mobs and with no way of our class being able to mitigage damage in a way that scales there is no way we can be a viable tank.<br />
<br />
As it is i have to beg for groups in GoD or start my own.  Ikkiniz I can't even beg someone to take me so looks like do it yourself time again.  The warriors are considered the only viable tank there.<br />
<br />
I think I have my guild conviced I am adequate to tank Kod Taz exp groups now but if there are warriors available they won't pick me, only when no warriors are available or if I start my own group do I even have a chance of being picked.<br />
<br />
So my sentiments are we need a riposted disk combined with a mini defensive as has been describe here very well by several people..  This could easily be made available in the areas where it is needed.  Also a DI bump to put our tanking above rangers where we are way to close.  I am afraid that the rangers in my guild tank pretty darn close to me and I am suprised that they don't main tank groups more then they do.<br />
<br />
My second choice would be a Bulwark of vie type self but but one that absorbs more damage as with Bulwark of vie a cleric must recast this buff after almost every mob when I tank in GoD zones.<br />
<br />
My third choice would be a riposte disk along with a fear with a stun component.<br />
<br />
My last choice would be if we could just get the riposte disk that would be a big help to me even if it had a resonable duration similar to ws along with a shorter recast time maybe 30 mins with an aa ability to shorten the resuse time to 20 mins or so.<br />
<br />
I really don't see us being made any type of dps tank as this idea will not work.<br />
<br />
As far as pulling I don't see us being able to compete well here unless we get serveral improvements.<br />
<br />
So really tank remains are best and only viable solution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Doomhulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Dallatar posted a link to this page on thesteelwarrior.org under the title &quot;funny&quot; in the war room and continued with saying we have a &quot;serious case of Warrior penis envy&quot; I clicked the link and it took me to where Slein Jinn was talking about some things we needed. I'm kind of speechless. On one hand we have lots of warriors who agree with some much needed upgrades that care that we play EQ too that understand the time we invested who would like to see us get better and on the other we have the people cutting our legs out from under us. It's sad that we cant all be on the same team so we can be balanced.<br />

You might want to worry about yourself before you worry about someone who is doing just fine even with gear that is not as good as those around him.<br />
