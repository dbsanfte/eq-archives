<br />
An evil basketball? WTF???<br />
<br />
I mean, thats all Gnomes and Halflings are good for. Stomping on, playing ball with, acting as appetizers for mobs when we raid... basically they're dispensable. Like toilet paper<br />
<br />
I have to say this though... they need to make 2 race-specific spells. Head-glare for gnomes, has a blinding effect. Lice infestation for halflings, has a Tagars Insects effect<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fear the gnomes.  all the evil in half the space = more evil per square inch than any other sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kainzzothewindmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Amen!<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomes are evil. <br />
<br />
Can you SMELL the jealousy?<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for the &quot;punt/snack&quot; joke we've all heard 700 times.. .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If a lump of shit were evil, more evil than the evilest SK, would I  be afraid of it? No.<br />
<br />
And hence I am not afraid of gnome SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skrap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The fact that we offend all the other Shadow Knights just proves how evil we are.<br />
<br />
There are some things that even they, supposed knights of darkness, consider to be crossing the line.  &gt;=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah, go shower in butter and climb into the oven, I'll be with you in a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Minevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why do people have such a problem with gnome SK's? I love my gnome SK. Are they just to scared to try it ? WHAT!! Afraid you might actually like it?  Just because we're small only serves to put us at castration level. :mad: :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now Timmy, just because some people live a different lifestyle - because they like being cuddy evil - doesn't mean that they should be ridiculed.<br />
<br />
In today's world, it's a perfectly acceptable lifestyle choice - and their difference in preferance doesn't neccissarily mean you'll have to be cute as well.<br />
<br />
Tolerance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skrap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LOL Dohn<br />
<br />
And from now on, if you punt a gnome it will be covered under the new hate crime legislation.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well gnomes are good for one thing, they are the only playable race with armor &quot;named&quot; after them :).<br />
<br />
Just for fun, I got my old necro's (deleted) faction in ak`anon up really high, but on a full set of gnome skin, sat down in front of king ak`anon, and force ate tons of Gnome Kabob. Was great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, except for the Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings, Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask and all the Iksar Hide stuff. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway... the spell Tiny Companion makes your skele pets Gnome-size. Which is good, since the only thing Gnomes are good for anyway is skinning. :D <br />
<br />
/e takes a bite out of his Gnome Kabobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sooshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We gnomes travel in packs kinda like Hyena's.  <br />
Get a few of us around and we'll take ya down... not talking the wimpy kill ya down but the ripping flesh from the bone while yer still screaming and kicking kinda down. I for one love the thigh meat.. yumm yumm.<br />
<br />
BTW.. Ogres tastes like chicken and trolls are too grisly to bother with.  I'll let ya know about Iksar in a few minutes  (horrific iksar screams of pain in the back ground)  ... damn they starting without me.. catch you guys later.. heh next on the menu is humans.. you could be next!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fycellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do halflings still get the 5% racial xp bonus? Cause if they do I don't think thats fair to all the other stupid people that picked short races. They should be compensated for their suffering as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
stupid people? now lets not get personally insulting... Hitting yourself a dozen times in the head with a hammer is stupid.. not picking a short race in a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fycellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sooshi, I feel your pain...<br />
<br />
Don't let it bother you. Starting over with a real sk race now would be a lot of work anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Humans from Qeynos are the only other real sks.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk is the god of teen angst and goths.  Cazic-Thule gets some respect, but not his followers who are all a bunch of 'fraidy cats who are skert of their own god.  And even followers of the warlike Rallos will die one day.<br />
<br />
Death is inevitable.<br />
<br />
One day every knee shall bow and every tongue confess before Bertoxxulous as they rot in the wonderful mire of his decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh yeah? Well us Cazicites are gonna kick you bertoxx followers asses, foo'!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">bring it, suitcase</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well i hate to say it but if you read lots of books gnomes are tribal and are usually rogues warriors shamens and i guess if you stretch that a lil i guess you could include sks but they are usually too primitave to be sks or necros since they are so supersticial and stuff. i say kill all the gnomes and add frogloks hehe jk just flaming i have a gnome enc too and love em lots of rp value there.</div></div><hr />

Gnome Knight!<br />
<br />
Sorry I just cant see it, Traditionally in fantasy literature its rare for even a elf to be given knighthood staus, let alone a tiny half pint, creature that belongs stuffed as a garden ornament, or in Enid blightons Noddy books. <br />
<br />
I also cant see them having the Fanatical dedication to a cause or god, apart from there mechanical experiments. <br />
<br />
Ok now Dark elves are small and kinda cuddly 2, but they are oft portrayed in fantasy as highly skilled warriors and fanatical followers. They are often the very embodiment of evil! <br />
<br />
and hobbits? ... The hobbit race must be exteminated.<br />
<br />
I also think we should be able to choose terris thule as our diety at creation =/</div></div><hr />
