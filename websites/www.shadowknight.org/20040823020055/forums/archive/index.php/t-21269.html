<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was listening to the radio this afternoon, and it being a slow sports day, the announcers were having people call in with thier dumbest arguements.<br />
<br />
My favorite call in was the couple that had argued for a 6 hour road trip over how many squirrels it would take to drive an automatic sedan (the wife insisted 6 and the husband said only four were needed unless it was stick shift then you'd need 7) - anyone who thinks that's fake hasn't been married<br />
<br />
I can't think of any I've had right now, but anyone have any amusing stupid arguments?</div></div><hr />

Thats not the highest point in the series for characters though, its in the billions at one point...<br />

<br />
<br />
Heh, I don't give a flying fuck which way it rolls... as long as it's on the damn roller when I have to use it, and I don't have to go searching for it in my time of need. Only two &quot;toilet rules&quot; in our house.. Flush when done, if you use the last of the toilet paper roll, get a new one out... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Toilet seat if left up, just gets placed down when I need to go... Haven't fallen in yet, so that isn't a rule in our house.....(yet)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Never said I had fallen in.  Never said the seat was always up either. What I did say was  &quot;Toilet seat  if left up, just gets placed down when I need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
I also don't recall saying I was paranoid about the seat being left up.  And If you actually &quot;Read&quot; what was written, you would see that I  DO  place the seat down. <br />
<br />
It was just a comment on the fact that there aren't many &quot;toilet&quot; rules in my house.</div></div><hr />

On a similar line of thinking....if a guy fucks a girl in the ass...and finds out later that she's a guy (how he didn't know is another matter...) ....does that make him gay?</div></div><hr />

Hello, I'm American. What I'd like to do now is dribble out some pop psychology I saw an airport paperback writer talking about on Oprah once and which I've slavishly used as the basis of my whole life since because I really can't go to the effort of thinking anything through for myself. Clearly, I don't have the reading skills or the intellectual depth to claw my way above the crashingly literal, so I'll use this embarrassing lack of subtlety as a misplaced springboard from which to launch into a critique of your relationship. I'll probably say something like, 'For the sake of the children', I simply won't be able to stop myself. Depending upon how I feel, I might even state that, 'I have a good sense of humour' too, a fact which, tragically, I, myself, genuinely believe to be true. Can I have a 'I Don't Get It' badge please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our mom is from Portugal, our dad from America....<br />

He claims to be more Portuguese than I am, because he was born first, and therefore has more Portuguese blood in him.<br />
<br />
His arguments consisted of:<br />
&quot;Mom gave me more blood than you&quot; <br />
&quot;I am more Portuguese because I have a bigger nose&quot;<br />
&quot;My skin is darker than yours I have to be more Portuguese&quot;<br />
&quot;I came first, and took it all&quot; (ahem... yeah all the stupidity)<br />
&quot;it's common knowledge that the first born has more genes then the second born&quot;<br />

My arguments consisted of me getting exasperated, and throwing biology books at him, telling him all he got more than me was dropped on his head... My theory is that our mother did drugs while she was pregnant with him.</div></div><hr />
