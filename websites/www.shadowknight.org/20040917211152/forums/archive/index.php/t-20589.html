<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there fellow sks. At about 2 pm est today Lhranc fell to a strong 25 man team. No one died was it was overkill big time. Would like to say thanks to the people of sk.org for the walkthrough and all the posts with great information about the epic. Feels great to join the ranks of the epiced and dual epiced sks. <br />
<br />
It took me almost 5 months to do the epic but it was well worth it. It looks cool and will serve me well for a long while. I will be posting a picture pretty soon so you all can see. I took a nice picture of me on horseback with IC and in skelly form (shroud of undeath).<br />
