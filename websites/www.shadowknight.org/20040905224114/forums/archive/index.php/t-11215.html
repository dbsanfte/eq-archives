<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagger Knight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to seek the advice of the master SK's, which race would you choose Ogre or Troll? If you can support your reason, thanks.</div></div><hr />

Because you're to lazy to research and make a choice on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To quote Groobash:<br />

&quot;Ogre. If you were meant to be a troll you would know it and this would not be an issue for you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogre is your choice young one.  Who wants to live in the refugee camps in Neriak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seriously.  Ogres have overall better stats, not as bad exp penalty, and unstunability from front which can't be replaced with gear like Troll regen.  Not to mention Trolls are now refugees.<br />
<br />
If you want the best min/max race, go Ogre.  Players pick Troll 'cause it's in their blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Players pick Troll 'cause it's in their blood.<br />
<br />
*grin*  <br />
<br />
And 'cause yooz can't getta gud nome kabob in Oggok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taeyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not beeing able to be stuned from the front is invaluable. Have I know about it when i first made my sk, I might have chosen different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fycellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How dare you come to the race discussion board and ask a race discussion question! You tell em, Akeikyl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He could look over the hundreds of posts that have already asked this exact same question. There should just be a sticky on each race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Alduran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Niether they Both SUCK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Look at Screenshots of both. Whichever one makes you go DAMN THAT LOOKS SWEET!!! Is the one you want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ogre&gt;all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would have to say neither.<br />
<br />
Go play a DE like the rest of the crowd.<br />
<br />
We dont need anymore peeps playing Ogre's and Troll's and giving us a bad name.<br />
<br />
People all ready have this stigma about the large SK races being the &quot;dumb&quot; races.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ogres eat dorfs, more meat on them than nomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yar, but da elfies got da best flavor.  Dorfs are tough, but da high elfs meat is very tender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It comes down to:<br />
<br />
*Can you afford gear to make up the stat difference?<br />
----You'll be a dumbass either way - just deal with not having gobs of mana untill you get nice gear<br />
<br />
*Do you plan on soloing a lot? Regen will help<br />
*Do you plan on tanking a lot? Unstunnability will help<br />
<br />
*Which do you like the looks of?<br />
<br />
*Do you have the patience to deal with the Troll's XP penalty?<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you make an Ogre, choose Cazic-Thule as a god, or you will be unable to do the Greenmist quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think ogres are most fun race in EQ /shrug Oh, and dont think the ogre xp penelty is a walk in the park. We still need 4 kills to every, say, human PC's 3.<br />
<br />
-Shef</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ogres better in groups.  High stats, no stun and lower exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Trolls MUCH better solo or with non-cleric partner as regen will allow you to do a lot less medding and heal while kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ogre - because it took the very Gods themselves to smack them down, whereas the trolls got owned by some jumped-up mutant frogs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Twice.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ogres were made for 2hnders baby.  Forget the Greenmist and worship our true god, Rallos Zek!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Krulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Don't make me eat you Itzena.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if you make an Ogre I don't think Greenmist is a huge loss, and if you are into roleplay remember you are the chosen people of Rallos and all that shit... plus doesn't Zekkers have good cultural?  Maybe I'm thinking of warriors...</div></div><hr />

Hmmzz... ogres are dumb as a doorknob now and it took the frogs some &quot;help&quot; of MACHO MAN to take em down :p<br />
<br />
I think the gods might want to give the ogres there intelligance back so they know they made the wrong choise and should have gone TROLL all the way :p</div></div><hr />
