<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shizzythugmasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are the coldain ring quests worth the trouble?  Or would my time be better spent elsewhere?  I think they sound kind of fun, so I may do them anyways, I was just looking for some feedback on whether my time would be better spent grouping for exp, or farming plat to buy better rings, tradeskilling, etc.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The question I have for you is, &quot;Do you like questing?&quot;.  If so, then yes the Coldain Ring quests are totally worth it.  If you don't enjoy questing, you probably don't want to do the rings or the shawl quests.  Really, the rewards are sub-par until you get to the final few quests.  Unless you are willing to put forth the effort to see all the quests through, don't bother.<br />
<br />
Progression:<br />
Ring #1 - AC: +1 Str: +1 Magic Resist: +1<br />
<br />
Ring #2 - AC: +2 Str: +2 Magic Resist: +2 <br />
<br />
Ring #3 - AC: +3 Str: +3 Magic Resist: +3<br />
<br />
Ring #4 - AC: +4 Str: +4 Magic Resist: +4<br />
<br />
Ring #5 - AC: +5 Str: +5 Magic Resist: +5 <br />
<br />
Ring #6 - AC: +6 Str: +6 Magic Resist: +6<br />
<br />
Ring #7 - AC: +7 Str: +7 Magic Resist: +7 <br />
<br />
Ring #8 - AC: +8 Str: +8 Magic Resist: +8 <br />
               Clicky Shield of the Eighth (8 point damage shield)<br />
<br />
Ring #9 - AC: +9 Str: +9 Sta: +9 Magic Resist: +9 HP: +50<br />
                Clicky Shield of the Eighth<br />
<br />
Ring #10 - AC: +10 Str: +10 Sta: +10 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +100<br />
                 Clicky Frostreaver's Blessing (10 hp/tick, 10 point damage shield, +10 ATK)<br />
<br />
So you see, until you get to the last 2 or 3 quests, the rings really are not worth the trouble.  However, if you are willing to put in the time and effort to fight it out to the end and complete all 10 quests you will end up with one of the best finger slot items in the game.<br />
<br />
So sum up: If you like questing and are willing to see the entire thing through to the end, do it.  The rewards are great (aside from the ring you can pick up some other really nice stuff along the way) and you won't be disappointed.  If you don't plan on doing all 10 quests, then no - the first few rings aren't worth the effort.  Go buy yourself some 6/65's and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did 1-7 in 2 days with help from a few friends, the only difficult part was getting the furs for first ring. The rest of the parts were either duoed or one grped, got lucky on catching gloridain up two days after getting my 7th and duoed the 8th ring with a friend who pulled the Chief for me.  Then bought a Tainted Avalanche Ale combine and did my 9th ring two nights later and waited two weeks on my guild to get around to doing my 10th ring.  Total time spent on getting my 10th ring: around 3 weeks, including over two weeks of waiting.  I personally would say that is WELL worth a ring with 10 ac, 10 sta and 100 hps plus and insta clickie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The hardest part is the farming. Level 60+ can easily solo all the way to ring 7, and maybe ring 8 as well. Below that I dunno, as I never tried it below 60.<br />
<br />
Basically just do all the farming beforehand. Get your cougar skins, and kodiak pelts, and tusks, walrus hides, skinning rock (ground spawn), etc. Check for tain any time you pass the bridge, get him out of the way whenever you see him since you don't hand him any ring to do that part. Same with warden for the shackle key.<br />
<br />
Basically, though. Make the blanket, turn it in to Garadain, get ring 1.<br />
<br />
Say 'what assistance' and he gives you an axe.<br />
<br />
Run to Boridain, hand him the axe. Follow him and pre-clear any mobs in his path that are giant or orc. Aggro him to keep him in place if need be (don't have a DS on if you do this). You can pull him from spot to spot once you learn his path and all his stop/turn points.<br />
<br />
Once Boridain is back at his spawn a kodiak spawns, kill it, loot hide, give that to boridain, he gives you an axe.<br />
<br />
Hand the axe and ring 1 to Garadain and you get ring 2.<br />
<br />
Take the skinning rock, tusk and walrus hide thingy and smith the coldain dagger (droppable, you could buy one). Hand that and ring 2 in for ring 3. If you did the pre-farming, you could get ring 3 right after you get ring 2 with no wait.<br />
<br />
If you did Tain already, just hand in the hammer and ring 3 right away for ring 4. Otherwise go to Tain, say 'i will help' he instantly respawns. Invis up and wait. Target the named, run to max range and single pull him out. Solo him down, loot elixer. When Tain respawns say 'i will help' immediately hand him the elixer and take off, let him die again. Then go turn in the hammer and ring 3 for ring 4.<br />
<br />
Now kill the rygorr messenger, or buy invasion plans, or you could already have them from pre-farming. Hand that to the scout behind Garadain's camp. Run to the front side of the camp, target Scarbrow, single him away. Let the dwarves fight the rest of the orcs. Solo scarbrow, loot the head, once Garadain respawns hand him the head and ring 4 for ring 5.<br />
<br />
Go to icefang camp. At 10pm game time ghost dwarf spawns. Hand him ring 5, triggers a follow the wolf quest. You can ignore the wolf. Run to the orc camp beside the bridge, FD or invis and wait. Poxbreath will spawn inside. Target, run way off, pull him through the wall single, solo him, loot the head.<br />
<br />
Then go to the rygorr fort (if you didn't pre-farm Rodrick) let the emissary run around and spawn Rodrick, kill rodrick loot head and dagger, keep both.<br />
<br />
Go back to garadain, hand him rod's head and note off pox plus ring 5 for ring 6.<br />
<br />
Go to the prison clear the house with the dorf in it. hand him the shackle key off the warden (warden can be single pulled through the wall, Kromrif Prison Guard is his PH). and ring 6. He hands ring 6 back. Follow him.<br />
<br />
When he says something about an ambush, aggro him and run fast to the north (the shore). then follow the shore to Dobin's hut, run inside and once he's in with you, FD and wait. He will talk to Dobin then poof. Dobin asks for your ring, hand it to him and get a letter. Give the letter to Garadain and get ring 7.<br />
<br />
If all the mobs are up you can do all of that in 5 or 6 hours. You can do multiple rings at the same time, actually, in 5 or 6 hours. I currently have ring 7 and the letter for another ring 7 from just 6 hours of time spent tonight, some of that was farming. Now I can simply trigger ring 8 war, then turn in the letter for a new ring 7. The plan is to MQ a ring 8 with a friend and have a ring 8 for me to clicky for DS. Ring 9 and 10 may follow later.<br />
<br />
For ring 8, it's super easy. If you can clear the orc fort solo, you can solo ring 8. If not, you may need a friend to help. Duo is cake for a level 60'ish team. Anyway, clear the fort, hand garadain ring 7. Hand the not to gloridain, invis and run back inside the fort, single pull the chief (he's outside, in the outer wall). Kill him, loot head, invis and run back out. When garadain calls charge, hand him the head and get ring 8. Simple as pie.<br />
<br />
So if you pre-farm and all the mobs are up, you can do rings 1 through 8 in a single night, easily. And solo most likely. Being able to self DS up to 24+ is worth the effort. Since ring 8's effect stacks with banshee aura and our hp buffs. +8 DS never hurts when you're just grouping, soloing, factioning or the like. And it's even a insta-click for crap buff on raids/pulling dispellers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyway, clear the fort, hand garadain ring 7. <br />
<br />
Clearing the fort is not needed. The whole fort will despawn upon triggering the little war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey nice info, I always cleared it so I wouldn't have noticed that lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great info there Vendric, i was gonna call up some friends for rings 7/8, but i see its not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I solo'ed 1-8 in less than a day to MQ to a friend a couple months ago.  If you have decent gear and at least touch of volatis (trying to chain cast drain soul might get ugly) then soloing ring 8 isn't bad.  Just pull and kill the chief from inside the fort and invis back out to garadain, give him the ring after he gives the orders to fight, but before he gets killed, and then leave him to his fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How long do you have? I don't want to fook up and have to start over again.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, do you deal with any NPCs besides Garadain on quest 8? IE: Can i have a necro friend kite him around just to make sure he doesn't get killed, then after i kill the Chief i'll come by, necro will FD, and i can do the turn in with no time constraints?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have plenty of time.<br />
<br />
1: Turn in ring 7 to Garadain at his hut. He gives you marching orders.<br />
<br />
2: Give the marching orders to Gloradin in the hut next door.<br />
<br />
3: Invis and run into the empty orc fort, to the right as you enter, and wait in the clearing.<br />
<br />
4: When the mobs spawn, pull the chief away from the mobs that spawned in the center of the fort courtyard.<br />
<br />
5: Kill the chief, which can easily be done solo at 60+, and loot his head.<br />
<br />
6: Invis and run outside to Garadain up on the hill now. He will walk back away from the fort eventually then call for his troops to &quot;FALL IN&quot;. This takes a while. But, he then goes into a speech and moves them into position before calling the attack. You can hand in the head to get your 8th ring any time after he says &quot;FALL IN&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, i solo'd the 8th ring thanks to your advice, but now which parts of the 9th ring are soloable?<br />
<br />
(Obviously, the 10th ring is 100% unsoloable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Duke Vendric Ravenkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not sure as I personally have never done a 9th ring. I'm sure bits and pieces are, but at least half of it is single group events. None of it is raids. 10th Ring also isn't as hard as people make it sound, and the hardest part of the 9th ring is the potion you have to make/have made and MQ'd. Really the farming for that could be considered the hardest part of the entire quest. 10th Ring is all about 30 or so 58 to 65 char with high DPS, really. Nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Once you do the turn-in of the ale, you can solo the guy that falls down (I forget his name).<br />
<br />
None of the other traitors are really soloable, except of course the guy you already killed for ring six.  Minimum, you'll want a harmony puller for the guy in the cave, a snarer or stunner for Peffin, a group for the plate house in Kael, and a healer for Juliah.<br />
<br />
I grabbed five friends and did those traitors in a couple hours.  Not hard at all, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can do very little of the 9th ring solo.  You need Rodrick's dagger (which you probably already have) and the heads of 5 coldain traitors.  Rodrick is cake, but you will need at least a good solid group for most of the heads (a couple of the traitors can't be pulled single, one involves running the plate cycle in Kael, etc.).  Plus there is a tradeskill combine you must do (Tainted Avalanche Ale) that is trivial at 248 so you will need to train up brewing yourself or maybe find a gm brewer to make it for you (the ingredients for the ale are also a huge pita to get ahold of).  If you find a high end brewer to do it for you, they will have to come with you to do the hand-in because the Ale is NODROP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The guy in the cave cannot be single pulled, even at 65?<br />
<br />
Bummer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bummer. <br />
<br />
Example of non-pull: One of the traitors spawns at a campfire surrounded by several L50+ giants.  The dwarf and all of the giants are perma-rooted so you can't seperate the traitor from her &quot;guards&quot; (in the past you could, but they perma-rooted them all to &quot;fix&quot; it).  I also believe she summons so you can't just DoT and sit.<br />
<br />
Also, the dwarf that you turn the aforementioned ale into.  He spawns in a hut surrounded by several dorf guards.  Upon doing the turn-in he falls down and all the guards around him attack.  You need to kill him when he falls.  You may be able to single this one by single pulling every other mob in the camp and then doing the turn-in, but I haven't tried.<br />
<br />
Plus, I may be naive, but I don't see 1 person soloing the Kael plate cycle.  But hey, I've never been uber...maybe it is doable.</div></div><hr />

I also believe she summons so you can't just DoT and sit. No need to pull Peffin at all. Have on aggro all the giants and let him sit down on the hill near the fron gate, The giants will face away from peffin and you can go in and whack her without having to worry about her guards. Just grab a healer, afair Peffin hits quite hard. Probably best bet is to bring one group and do all the Traitors in 1 hour.<br />

You need to kill him when he falls. You may be able to single this one by single pulling every other mob in the camp and then doing the turn-in, but I haven't tried. You hand in the Ale, wait a bit, the dorf falls down, you step out of the hut, snare tha fallen dorf and pull him with his guards out. FD and wait for the guards to move back and kill the Captain who stays behind. Simple snarepulling.<br />
<br />
Plus, I may be naive, but I don't see 1 person soloing the Kael plate cycle. But hey, I've never been uber...maybe it is doable. I doubt one can single that one as one of the last mobs is quite hard. Just bring one group for all the traitor and its over in about one hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It takes some work but you can single out the guy in the cave also.  Did this at level 58 I think at the time.<br />
<br />
pull them all out and then FD at the cave entrance  Most will will walk away just keep getting up and running farther and farther from the cave and you will lose a few each time, eventually you will have the dwarf all by his lonesome.<br />
<br />
Killed him easy with just me and a cleric 2 boxed.<br />

Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for the easy ass walk thru to solo this ring. A sure fire way to get an insta clicky item for your needs. Only problem I had with this quest was the last part of ring 7, The dorf chick you need to turn in the marching orders to isn't always up. I'm told she is on a 24 hour cycle, only took me 4 hrs  to do up to ring 7, then just checked periodocally to see if Gloridain was up for the marching order turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Maeel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">OK, the dude in the cave is cake, pull him and kill him, super ht does wonders.  Loot his head and fd to lose his friends.  Other than that, me and a 65 Warrior duo'd the entire 9th ring in one night.  Was pretty easy other than doing the avalanche ale.  Only real fun part was duoing the plate house part with no healer.  But definately doable if you have the right gear.<br />
<br />
If ya have any questions just send me a tell.<br />
<br />
Maeel<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just wanted to say the cave dude was killed with his friends beating on me also.  When you get him to about 50 percent super ht him before he is healed.</div></div><hr />
