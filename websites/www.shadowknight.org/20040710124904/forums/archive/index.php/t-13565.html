&lt;/font&gt;</div></div><hr />

I dont even have a reqular HT hotkey.<br />

when I die and HT refresh's wihout refreshing IHT, i have to pull up the combat menu and use HT from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FWIW, I've had 2 HT's for about half the damage they should have on low low low greens that have no business having an uber rune or any other reason for me to do partial damage.<br />
<br />
One of them I am uncertain if I had UT3 or just UT2  but the other occasion I'm 100% certain I had UT3.  I HT'd a frog in UGuk (friend was waiting for the Old Froglok to spawn, zone was empty, so I killed the PH).  My /disc'd UT3/SCF3 IHT was for 4800.  Okay, that isn't half but certainly not the 7200 I'd expected and have gotten 100% of the time except for the one time when I HT'd Stormfeather for 3600 instead of 5850 or 7200 (again, I'm not sure if I had UT2 or UT3 at the time but did have SCF3).<br />
<br />
Those are the only 2 times I've had anything less than expected mimimum damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keuven Nightstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think on lowbie mobs it only does its max amount hp for dmg, like say some crap mob has 3700 hp you /disc IHT it and kill it outright for 3700, get it? Just a guess , i had it happen to me a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Klotar, based on the numbers you gave us, i would guess it simply didn't realize you had used the disc (4800 is IHT without disc for example), either because your disc wasn't up yet or because og lag issues and the IHT info reached the server before the disc info.<br />
<br />
Amarth's numbers aren't as accurate especially with a focus effect making it more fuzzy, but i think it might be the same issue...<br />
Let me guess, you have both in the same hotkey ? if so i suggest adding just one line between the /disc and IHT, /pause 1 should be enough, just to increase your odds against internet latency. If they aren't in the same hotkey, maybe you pressed both back to back very quickly ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keuven: that makes sense.  Perhaps I should just try an orc pawn or grass snake to settle that question.<br />
<br />
Keyan: that also makes sense.  I did see the Unholy Aura message both times, however (no clue on how it works) it might just be a client side message which didn't make it to the server on time.  I do now have a short pause in my single key 3-liner &quot;HT&quot; key but at the time I may not have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Update: HT'd a shadowman while pharming shadow essences last night in West Commons, it hit for 5300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shadowmen come in 3 types, necros clerics and SKs, the necros usually have a self rune up... which flavor was it ? Not saying there's no bug btw, but if there is one, which isn't exactly obvious from these posts, it only concerns NPCs that can be killed in one shot anyway, so not really earth shattering :)</div></div><hr />
