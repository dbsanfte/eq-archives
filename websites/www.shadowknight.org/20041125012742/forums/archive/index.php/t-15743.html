<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In 2 different zones on 2 day different days within the last week autorun had switched on of it's own accord and I couldn't toggle it off.<br />
My autorun key is set at the default, [NumLock].<br />
Hitting NumLock after the fact wouldn't turn it off, however.  All I could do was sit down to stop moving but as soon as I stood up I was off and running again.  Naturally, /q out would resolve it.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experience this?  Something wonky with EQ or perhaps an external program event conflicting with EQ keyboard hooks/interrupts?<br />
<br />
Would have gotten me killed if I hadn't had Bobbing Corpse up on both occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found this to happen when:<br />
<br />
you hit the ENTER key, then hit the &quot;move forward&quot; key (up arrow)<br />
<br />
To stop, you hit the ENTER key again.... it's not broken or bugged, it's working as intended... or so I was told after waiting for about 4 hour for a GM to explain it to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck... can't turn this &quot;function&quot; off btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Lurker.<br />
I could very well see that happening since, if I remember correctly, I was talking in /rsay and deliberately moving to a different spot at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes, that is what triggers it. if you have anything going on that activates the chat cursor thing in your chat box, autorun engages.<br />
<br />
there are some other buggy things related to it. like i was fd in a diff view, stood up and started auto running hehe..right into the mobs i was trying to split</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya i noticed this in highkeep with my necro, it seemed like after i stood up after having my spellbook open i would move forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have had the same problem with strafing using Ctrl+ side arrows. Hitting up arrow seems to do something similar hehe. Definitely new, definitely annoying.</div></div><hr />
