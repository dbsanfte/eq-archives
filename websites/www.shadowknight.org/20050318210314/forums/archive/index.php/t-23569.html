<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, you never bothered to get your tailoring up to 100 and need to for the epic?  You have a few k to burn, but don't want to get ripped off?<br />
<br />
Well, here's my quick and dirty method to get 100, thought it requires a decent level of brewing and smithing....but brewing and smithing were always easy to get up...(ol tugem's fierce brew to 135 baby....) <br />
<br />
First step, use find for the alchemists in plane of tranquility.  buy a bunch of mandrake root, and then find yerself a loom and make woven mandrake to 66.  Then, picnic baskets to 76. <br />
<br />
That ends the easy points. Next is  ribbons to 100+.  ribbons  require farming (and over 100 skill in brewing)... but the parts in the bazaar can frequently be found for much lower than high quality pelts, and non-existant greyhopper hides (search for &quot;cursed&quot; and &quot;steamfont springwater&quot; combinables).  In the event that there are none, farm the crap out of kobolds in steamfont for springwater. 15 plat per ribbon plus 1-10 plat per foraged/farmed part may seem like a lot, but it's cheaper than the 30-60 plat per hq hide you get charged in the bazaar.  Ok, so the shears mold costs 75 plat, but that's just a one time charge, and the oak staff from the fletchers doesn't cost much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wtf are you using ribbons that early for?  Try crystaline silk/wu's that what I did a few years ago and that goes up to something like 120 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All those steps, why make it so difficult on yourself?<br />
<br />
Mandrake root 0 --&gt; 66<br />
<br />
Crystalline Silk Armor 66 --&gt; 100+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm pretty sure there are some dumb quests in abysmal sea that get you to around 50.. anyhow<br />
<br />
Silk thread/swatch 15  (easy, no fail.. duh)<br />
<br />
Mandrake root 66 (vendor buyable, cheap)<br />
<br />
Greyhopper hide armors 95 (buy hides in bazaar, cheap.. else: )<br />
<br />
Crystaline silk armor 100+ (buy silks in bazaar, failry cheap... else: )<br />
<br />
Tailored quiver 115 (just need HQ cat pelts, buyable in bazaar..)<br />
<br />
Once your past the mandrake root, choose one of the three to get you to around 100, or possibly combine the 3 options depending on whats available/cheap in bazaar, as all 3 require one component that you either need to farm or buy.  Don't start on Wu's until you have exhausted these three options, they are much cheaper and easier than Wu's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Udyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">im at 100 from 0 in under two hours w/ about 1000plat spent ;/. I just did the mandrake thing to 66, then bought a few stacks of HQ cat pelts made quivers. Yeah its done. Also would someone confirm that the combine is no-fail and will work w/ only 100 skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll confirm that, Udyen.  Did my combine at 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you can get your crystaline silk at less than 20 plat per combine, go for it. It's all about what's cheap and what's available....<br />
<br />
The point is to not have to harvest the damn stuff yerself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pffft, crystalline silk is cheap enough in bazaar on my server.  I did mandrake + crystalline to over 100 in less than an hour and for under 1k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just went to bazaar and bought the items to make wu's armor. Starting at a 20ish skill, went to 130 in about an hour at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now, for those who have been getting flamed for asking questions on this board, refer to THIS post as to the method to get your answers.  Rather than say &quot;how do I get to 100 skill quickest&quot;, smugly say you have found the best way, then watch what happens when you use the natural aggresion of the board denizens to flame you with the information you were looking for in the first place....;)</div></div><hr />
