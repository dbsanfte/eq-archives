I average like 7% exp per hour in pickup groups, which is absolutely horrible.  Is this something common to all ogre SKs?  Compared to my bard, this is an absolutely horrendous exp penalty, and I'm wondering whether or not I should continue.. because I find AA exp to be damn crappy as well.

It is a price you pay for being an Ogre, but hang in there. The frontal melee stunn immunity is a huge boon, and from what I understand, slam is godly for tanking. Being a Tier'dal I wouldn't know but, meh, keep with it. i believe Iksar have a worse penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssakaschaigidel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">7% an hour at 58?  Where are you hunting?  <br />
<br />
As for &quot;does it get better?&quot;  <br />
<br />
1) Not before it gets worse.  59 sucks hard.  At 60 though your power starts increasing massively.<br />
<br />
2) forget aa's unless you plan on stopping at a certain level to be even with friends.  Levels&gt;aa's.  And as a side note, unless I'm smoking crack, the xp penalty doesn't apply to aaxp if you have 100% going in.<br />
<br />
3)  Your xp penalty isn't massive. AFAIK.  I'll look it up, but I'm fairly positive that my iksar penalty is higher.<br />
<br />
4)  It comes down to this.  How much do you love playing a Shadowknight.  Personally even asking if you should continue or not makes me want to tell you to just play your bard or roll up a druid.</div></div><hr />

1) He's not smoking crack on the AA thing<br />
<br />
2) Ogre's have the only differentiating racial ability, as a jealous and petty Erudite I think you should get to 70 then have to start again from level 1 just to have that ablility<br />
<br />
3) Ogre's have a 10% exp penalty for slam and being immune to melee stun from the front, Iksar have a 15% exp penalty for regen and an AC bonus Trolls share the 15% exp penalty (and no real cultural) for just Regen and slam.  Your ability smokes theirs and you pay less for it.  <br />
<br />
4) Get to 70, put all in AA, forget how hard it was to get to 70 and gloat about how awesome your racial skill is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ogres have a 10% exp penalty and Troll and Iksar have a 20% penalty according to Brael here (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=21177&amp;highlight=racial+penalties)<br />
<br />
Post 65 levels are especially bad and your not as bad off as Iksar or Troll. Grind through it, its worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
Besides it used to be ALOT worse trust me. When I first started if I recall correctly hybrid penalties were around the 40% mark and a Troll SK was the most penalized race / class combo in game sitting at 80% exp penalty. <br />
<br />
On top of that any group that took you in had to share your penalty. Life is pretty easy these days by comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go grind in GE before they move the hotspots.  The place is awesome right now.  I was getting ~12% an hour there from about 55-60.  At 60, it's stupid fast, I did 60 in about 5-6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ssakaschaigidel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 60, it's stupid fast <br />
<br />
I vote Torment at 60 myself, but really, orc pawns are probably &quot;stupid fast&quot; xp at 60.  <br />
<br />
 Ogre's have the only differentiating racial ability <br />
<br />
What about my regen and innate AC bonus?   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh well, at least I have a tail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Should have been a Gnome, not only do we not have an xp penalty, we also have an innate sexiness ability, that is a 15% aggro increaser due to mobs wanting to touch our hot little bodies so bad.</div></div><hr />

only works on priest class mobs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crasek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm an ogre as well. The exp penalty does bite. It hurts the most when you start getting to mobs that proc stuns and you feel like you wasted time leveling a character that is supposed to be immune to frontal stuns. And yes, I know it's a proc, but it still pisses me off that I get stunned while I'm facing a mob.<br />
<br />
My advice is the highest PoP zone you can get into as DPS. You likely won't be able to tank, but the exp will be the best. Even if it's an aggro kiting group, take it if they will have you.<br />
<br />
GE wasn't popular for exp when I was lvling. It may be the best place now though for a traditional tanking spot in a group for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gnaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With my Ogre Shaman I split AAxp and regular xp at lvl 51. From this I can verify that AA xp is not penalized.<br />
<br />
With my Ogre SK (my main), I agree that the penalty sucks, but not getting stunned by regular melee attacks is great.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I thought for sure ogres had 15% and troll/iksar were 20%?<br />
<br />
Anyway, man there are a lot of times I wish I had frontal stun immunity on my little dark elf.  Then again, I tried playing an ogre once and just couldn't get used to the huge size.  I'm 58 right now too, but I stopped looking at my exp bar.  Exp is gonna suck, I just try and have fun... if I get decent exp at the same time, it's a bonus.<br />
<br />
(hmm... maybe that's why my 4 yr old SK is only 58... that and I WAS clean for 2 yrs *sigh*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">as an ogre, im pretty sure the racial penalty is 15% not 10 [atleast according to all the time i've been watching my XP for the last 68 levels.]<br />
<br />
AA xp is, as others have said, unaffected.<br />
<br />
and also as has been said troll and iksar are 20% penalty.</div></div><hr />
