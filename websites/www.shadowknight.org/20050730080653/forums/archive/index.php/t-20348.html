while warriors will likely deal even more damage, tank even better, and have even more flexability added by adding half the spellbook<br />
of a hybrid to their Alt-C window.<br />
<br />
Its quite frankly time to add something for the knights to be ABLE to tank the big dogs, if only for a few minutes.<br />
Knights should NOT have to be &quot;knightemized&quot; in order to do the only job they are qualified for... <br />
(warriors are now superior or at least equal add tanks as well...)<br />
<br />
<br />
I will work with the following principles as a basis for the changes I suggest.<br />
-Warriors should remain superior at absorbing consistent damage, and maintain their reason to normally tank boss encounters<br />
for most of the encounter.<br />
-SOME sort of tank stacking should be possible<br />
-Knights should be DIFFERENT tanks capable of filling certain places in the Tank list due to certain talents.<br />
-Above all, knights should be superior raid tanks over monks and the other damage dealing light-armored classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
<br />
-Add raid-tanking abilities for the knights that essentially do the same thing as the knights' primary spell lines, and that cost mana.<br />
-These should be a level 65 discipline or AA or Spell...<br />
-basically, every time the knight is hit, it costs him or her mana, and the damage done to them is reduced in some way.<br />
-Paladins will auto-heal themselves every hit, and shadowknights will auto-lifetap every hit.<br />
-This auto-mode should not be as efficient in healed/point or damage done/point as if the knight simply cast those spells normally.<br />
-Auto-mode WILL be more efficient in healed/time than normal however...<br />
-The basic idea is that the knight must use a large chunk (and perhaps all) of their mana to tank closer to a warrior for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the shadowknight:<br />
<br />
Lets say auto-lifetap heals 25% of damage done to the shadowknight during its duration (1 minute max, 30 minute re-use)<br />
Lets say it auto deals half of that back to the mob and costs half of that in mana each hit.<br />
(I am not saying these are perfectly balanced, I just picked numbers for comparison)<br />
<br />
I have about 7500ish mana raid buffed...<br />
<br />
Lets say the mob is around 1000DPS...  my mana will auto-lifetap for 250 healed and 125damage/sec and cost 125mana/sec<br />
My auto-lifetap will last 60 seconds at this DPS.  (total of 15k healed and 7500 damage if the SK lives for 60 seconds)<br />
<br />
Lets say the mob is around 1300DPS...  my mana will auto-lifetap for 325 healed and 162dam/sec and cost 162mana/sec<br />
My auto-lifetap will last 46 seconds at this rate ( total of 14950 healed and 7452 damage if the SK lives for 46 seconds)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets say the SK is NOT tanking...<br />
<br />
I can alternate Touch of Inny and Touch of Volatis for 470 and 350 every 12 seconds for 820 lifetap for 610 mana.<br />
In 60 seconds, I can do that 5 times for 4100 lifetap for 3050 mana, and thus still have mana left.<br />
In 120 seconds, I can complete 8200 lifetap for a cost of 6100 mana.<br />
This is NOT COUNTING focus items or criticals...<br />
<br />
Or, I could actually use real damage spells and not bother with using solely lifetaps for damage.<br />
(the lifetaps are used for comparison...)<br />
<br />
Now, why would a SK need this ability?  To concentrate his power in a short period for the use of tanking something.<br />
Lifetapping usually does little good on tanking these mobs...  Time-equipped knights will be lucky to get a few spells out while being jacked for 2k.<br />
Would a SK use this ability in XP groups?  I doubt it.  This is HIGHLY inefficient use of mana. (dead mobs don't hit back...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
next, I must apologize to the paladins, as I am less informed as to what would help them most.<br />
<br />
I'd say a similar idea as above, but minus the damage shield.<br />
It should Absorb more per hit (35%?), and be more efficient per mana point than the shadowknight one.<br />
<br />
<br />
results are:<br />
WARRIOR - absorbs 55% (plus normal 12%) discipline lasts 2 minutes, refresh 10 minutes<br />
PALADIN - absorbs 35%, discipline lasts 1.2?? minutes, refresh 30 minutes<br />
SHADOWKNIGHT - absorbs 25%, discipline lasts 60 minutes (max), does 12.5% damage shield. refresh 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior is still the best, but Paladins are quite decent (&gt;20% below warriors), Shadowknights would become shock troops used to deal 15k to the mob (HT+tank damage shield) very quickly.<br />
(remember, that given time, their mana will deal quite a bit more damage if the mob survives longer than 1 minute)<br />
Note, afterward, the knight is naught but a weak warrior barely capable of off tanking where as the warrior suffers no downside. (save having to wait for 10 minutes for repop).<br />
Either Knight could stand most mobs up for a short time and be able to live given reasonable heals...<br />
<br />

Armor is the appropriate fix for raid yard trash, a disc is the appropriate solution for exp groups, it would allow us to tank named with a reasonable enough amount of security for our group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one feel that the only thing we really need is a bit more mitigation to put us a bit further above Rangers and BL and some type of mini defensive disc to tank these GoD expansions and what ever mob inflation the future holds which I am sure is going to be much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lejina Bloodbath</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To have our agro fixed wouldnt hurt either.<br />
<br />
We are meant to be the best agro generator (Voice and Terror lines of spells), yet we generate less agro than both paladins and warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, since we cant tank for shit currently and that dont seem to bother SoE much, i guess we should ask for some sort of jolt instead...<br />
<br />
:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are really starting to reach here.<br />
<br />
The problem is us not being able to tank boss style mobs in single person groups.  They have to be balanced for a defensive warrior, or they're trivialized.  That makes them virtually untankable by us.  Instead, they need to make the mob proc something that cancels defensive and then balance it for a non-defensive warrior.<br />
<br />
The difference between knights and warriors when they aren't using defensive is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya Lejina having our aggro fixed is the other thing we need, its pretty bad when the highest aggro tank is actually the lowest.  Terrors could use an upgrade, 1 sec cast on all of them, hate dot for 1 min value equal to 1/10 the direct hate on it each tick, 2.25 recast on them, scale the top one to 1200 hate, up the mana cost somewhat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowblade</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">basically comes down to them adding to much fucking weight to warriors, and trivilizing much of the game, then had to tune the new content to make it challanging again. As a result knights are practically worthless in GOD.<br />
<br />
Up my weapon skills to warrior level at least, then we might actually do more damage than them at least like we are supposed to do. Seriously Sony just sent out a big fuck you too knights tanking, so  maybe its time they turned us into a DPS class, that can tank when the shit hits the fan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
certainly we should NOT be better than warriors in damage absorption...<br />
<br />
but we should be every bit as valuable in a raid overall...<br />
<br />
my suggestion would make us a different kind of tank....<br />
<br />
a special type of shock-trooper meant to take a big chunk out of an opponent before they die, OR a finisher.<br />
<br />
Warriors would still be the tank of choice...  but we would become the most powerful burst damage in the game provided they could keep us alive while tanking.<br />
<br />
This ability would also help in the 1-group encounters that we are currently needing quite a bit of help in. (a bazaar-equipped warrior is better than a time-equipped knight...)<br />
<br />
Our advantage would be a quick fight should the opponent have lower HP...  Our disadvantage over warriors would be that we wouldn't last as long.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't be as good at mitigation as a warrior... and this would mean we aren't.... but it DOES make us different...  and give us advantages all of our own.<br />
<br />
This is how balance should work.<br />

OR the guy where the buck stops when the warriors are out of juice...<br />
<br />
I imagine SK would be bookends with this ability for low-HP raid mobs...  that is the first tank and the last one if necessary.<br />
Warriors 1,2,3,4 in the middle.  Some targets, the SK would only be a finisher due to needing to have as few tanks as possible...<br />
<br />
On off-tanking, where the mob has to die fast, we would be the tank of choice...<br />
<br />
We had WAY too many time gods live through our first encounter with them with 0% left.<br />
<br />
If I would have been more than a speed bump in Vallon's way, (had that ability) he would have been toast first shot...<br />
<br />
The first encounter is how you measure your guild's skill.<br />
Every time after that it takes less skill.<br />
<br />
Would be cool if we could actually play a tanking role of some sort.<br />

<br />
I think what we need is reworking of the mitigation tables for knights, its a joke that monks can out tank us, no matter what the situation or special circumstance, Lejina had a good idea for caping the DI value, but quite honestly i dont see why warriors are on a different mitigation table in the first place.  <br />
<br />
Also a complete overhaul of terrors simular to what brael sujested.. another lifetap ToI size wouldnt be bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowblade</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is there are three tank classes in this game, and for some reason they want one to be better than the other 2 at doing their job..... <br />
<br />
This is why we will always either be considered  under powered or overpowered whatever they do too us. I am very sceptical that anything will ever be done about this, its just too hard to properly balance an Offensive tank without stepping on anyone elses toes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do explain...<br />
<br />
Rangers can insta-aggro whenever they want...  (flame lick) they just dont want to...  and why would they considering they can do damage-dealer level damage from outside range of most AEs...<br />
(i dont remember anything in the proposal about ranger-level dps from outside AE range??)<br />
<br />
Lejina have you ever played a ranger?  do you understand what you just said?<br />
<br />
I proposed a way that shadowknight tanking would be different than warrior tanking....<br />
<br />
Warriors would last longer<br />
Shadowknights would HURT to hit.<br />
<br />
The closest ability rangers have is weaponshield, and that deflects ALL melee damage for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
Try re-reading my post and discover not a single word of it fits into what you just said...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there's this new proposal out there...  it's been met with mixed reviews (some Paladins and SK's love it, some warriors hate it) I think it's the most solid proposal found to date )incidentally, for those who dont' know, I'm a rabid warrior).<br />
<br />
New Discipline, name is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
+25% mitigation increase<br />
+35% damage decrease<br />
+25% spell haste decrease<br />
3 min duration<br />
40 min refresh<br />
Works on Endurance<br />
<br />
Caveats:  Tome drops in Ikkinz Tiral #2 and can only be turned in to NPC in PoTime to have the disc enabled, ensuring that only those knights who need it get it.<br />
<br />
In essence, it's a SCALABLE discipline that's half as effective as /disc defensive (it cannot realistically be any closer without jeapordizing warrior raid MT role), scales with content, and allows a very solid level of spike mitigation without encroaching too much on warrior tankability.   It would ALSO provide a drastically needed tankability differential between Knight and non-tank.<br />
<br />
Results vs (using a mob everyone knows)  AoW<br />
<br />
Warrior max melee round: 2816<br />
<br />
Knight max melee round: 3716<br />
<br />
Everyone else max melee round: 4616<br />
<br />
Vs. DB=200, DI = 100 theoretical Ikkinz boss<br />
<br />
Warrior max hit: 1200<br />
<br />
Knight max hit: 1700<br />
<br />
Everyone else max hit:  2100<br />
<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind that you're currently on the &quot;everyone else max hit&quot; table, this would represent a rather dramatic increase in your survivability and opportunity to be successful in these trials.   It would also greatly differentiate your tankability in absorption-critical encounters from non-tanks.<br />
<br />
The refresh time is identical to /disc furious, which can be used on boss#1 and boss #2 in these trials.<br />
<br />
I would also support a couple of additional changes.  I would support Anger augments having their War only restrictions removed, as well as implementing a &quot;Raex BP&quot; type effect augment for BP only, usable by War/Pal/Shd to drop further in GoD (Post-Uqua).<br />
<br />
Since this issue really only affects Paladins and SK's at this level of the game, there is no need to make it widespread, or to reduce the minimum requirements of defeating Ikkinz #2 and to be time flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moongarm</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add a &quot;totem of defense&quot; NPC where your progress through GoD follows the same description of that disc in incriments that directly correlate to your progress through GoD.  The totem would be a augment that you place in your shield. <br />
<br />
Knights who aren't as far in progression would recieve a small tanking bonus for completing a trial here and there.  While the main focus would still be on helping out where knights need it the most.<br />
<br />
The casual knights would recieve a small boost while performing their roles of offtanking or rampage tanking.  This would not step on warriors MT role.<br />
<br />
It would fix the tanking problem and add a use for shields.  Finding a use for shields, outside of stats, has  been a topic that has been brought up on this board for years now.  Why not kill two birds with one stone while it having a benefit for every knight that can pass at least one trial?  <br />
<br />
In other words. Same shit, different pile.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I understand the concern over all knights having access to the proposal, I still don't think it would be overpowering if we knights did. My perspective comes from that of a small guild. We like to take on mobs with small numbers ( currently ST key dragons, PoN events / nameds, etc, with an average of 16 ppl ). <br />
<br />
Our guild only consist of a select few of long time friends, none of which are warriors. Currently, there is nothing holding back our non-tank classes from participating in more difficult mob kills with our numbers - our rangers have the crafted bows, rogues have BoT daggers, casters have all / most non-GoD spells, etc, etc. The only thing that stops us from doing more is the extreme damage output some mobs can produce, and its not for a lack of healers, but simply because we don't have a warrior to go defensive that can survive a round of combat.<br />
<br />
Now grant it, this could be used as a point to demonstrate the 'need' for a warrior as a good thing, but from my perspective, its a bad thing to 'need' any one class; I support options. When it comes down to simply having or not having any form of defensive that stops us from taking out certain targets, I think its a bad thing. Don't get me wrong - I don't expect to walk the planar progression tree with a 16 person raid force, but I do expect that using knights for tanks we may have a fighting chance on some of the pre-PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
In summary...I don't think it should be a tome from a deep GoD drop, where you need Time gear to get it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres progression aviable from you, Knights are able to tank mobs in the majority of cases by obtaining gear from that encounter or from beyond it.  In your case you could buy ornate in Bazaar, kill some Ssra mobs, couple NToV raids for the odd piece or two not much there for you other than maybe dozekar, get some quest items and tank the mobs.  In the case of Ikkinz the gear from it and so far beyond it doesn't allow Knights to tank and requiring a Knight to be geared up from Uqua (at the earliest... no ones seen it's loot yet for certain) is extreme since at that point you won't go back to these trials.  When character advancement is no longer possible and you're limited to such a small number of people and 2 out of 3 tank classes are incapable of tanking it then thats where an issue is.  Knights were just fine in PoP pre changes and no changes have gone in to directly or indirectly nerf us so we continue to be just fine in all previous content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not make the mob simply proc a 10000 point endurance drain on every swing and just balance it for a non defensive warrior?<br />
<br />
We're talking about a small handful of mobs here.  It makes more sense to change those mobs than it does to implement an entirely new skill.  <br />
<br />
Adding a new discipline and restricting the drop to Ikkinz trial 2 would ensure that only SKs who technically need it, could get it, but it does nothing to ensure that the discipline is then only used on mobs that require it.<br />
<br />
The complaint is that 1 group content should not require a defensive warrior to tank.  The fix should not be to give SKs a version of defensive, it should be to simply make defensive not required, nor usable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think this is one of the best proposals so far, and the fact that warriors might can get behind it gives it a lot more weight with the developers.<br />
<br />
In response to Xanathol:<br />
<br />
You can't seriously expect knights to act as MTs against raid-level encounters in gear that is not far superior to the encounter itself.  Warriors were designed to be the ultimate tank, especially on raid encounters.  To suggest that a knight should be able to tank these same encounters just as well, and in the same gear as a warrior robs the warrior of their most important role.<br />
<br />
The problem with GoD is that one of our most basic roles...that of the single-group MT, has been serioursly nerfed.  As Brael stated, 2 of the 3 tank classes can no longer tank these 1-group encounters.  This is a far different problem than a knight that can't effectively tank Dozeker (a raid-level mob) wearing nothing but SS gear.  I can tank Doze just fine now.  I can tank Vindi better than a warrior could back when Vindi was considered a hard mob.  But that doesn't mean anything, given that I'm wearing almost purely VT/Elemental gear, with a smattering of LDoN/GoD augs.<br />
<br />
GoD is an entirely different story.  I get raped by the trial bosses.  The only way I survive them is with massive healing by at least 3 healing classes, one of which MUST be a cleric.  And, the only way for me to reliably tank even the first two difficult trials (Vxed/Tipt) is to have a charmed pet doing crazy DPS so that it minimizes the chance for a huge DPS spike on me.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem at all with making the tome that gives us this discipline something that you obtain from a GoD trial.  I am not sure how I feel about requiring you to turn it in to a Time NPC, but that's largely because my guild is not quite in Time yet (1 kill away).  I can definitely see the logic in that suggestion, though.  Knights do not need this disc. for pre-GoD content.  If you can't tank any given pre-GoD mob as a knight, then it's because you weren't supposed to.  A knight should not be able to tank AHR in VT wearing NToV gear.  I don't even think a knight should be able to do it wearing pure VT gear, at least not without crazy amounts of healing.  It's a raid event, and that is a warrior's role.<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear from more warriors (serious ones, not the whining wanna-be-gods) about this proposal.</div></div><hr />

A Warrior with no discs has no bellow either basically all their abilities except rampage, ae taunt, and /shield get stripped.  The only way to balance that out would be to cause Knights to lose mana to and that type of adjustment is just gay.  <br />
<br />
They could still get a bellow off on inc, but if it is really a problem, then put a little extra development into just dispelling damage mitigation disciplines.  It still makes far more sense to address an issue that relates to a handful of mobs by fixing those mobs and not by introducing an entirely new ability that may have profound effects elsewhere.<br />

Talking on GOD and elemental advancement for SK's will not do good for SK of all levels in general. I think an SK should be able to develop as he moves in his progression and not be left behind.<br />

What about all those AA that you can only use on mobs up to level 58. Hmmm..... What about upgrading this and making it like lvl 68 mob. That is simple and all of us can get.<br />

What about totally useless spells for a level  like heart flutter, asystole, fear, make them work for a level 65 Sk..Could have an AA to be able to upgrade these now useless line of spells. <br />

My train of thinking was that if knights were given a scaled-down version of defensive that it still wouldn't unbalance us against Warriors. Basically what defensive comes down to is mitigation; it provides a large gap of mitigation between warriors and other classes. A scaled version for knights is only to slide knights into that scale as well.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure everyone is on track with my statements, I am in support of this disc for non-GoD content, from small guild usage perspective. IMO, its all about options. When you form an XP group, you should need 'a tank', 'a healer', 'a slower', etc. I'm not sure why it should be any different on raid content. Sure, there should be classes that fit role better than others, but much as EQ2 is being advertised, any class of a given role should be able to perform thier basic 'role'.<br />
<br />
Sure you can over-gear, but now that's a chicken and egg scenario...can't do the mob without the gear and can't get the gear without killing the mob. ;) Let me change gears, since most here seem to agree that a version of defensive, however defined, would be a 'good thing'...what would allowing non-GoD / Time geared knights this proposed version of defensive break? The Warrior would still be the best tank for the big mob, and the Knights would just be scaled to fit in between, IMO. Balance is a matter of perspective; help me see yours. :)<br />
<br />
*EDIT: re-read some posts...another way to spin the question is 'why should tanking a raid mob only be a warriors role?' esp after the upgrade to assist warriors in the XP role, which was needed.

Artifical requirements are how you ensure that it doesn't make its way to Knights earlier than it should, it requires a Warrior initially to reach where it drops, allows you to &quot;gear up&quot; off current content to be able to tank the mobs (it's always worked that way except in this area you can't gear up enough), an item from Quarms corpse forces people who have moved on from time to not only go back to it but to do it multiple times a turnin in Time is merely a check to ensure that you're not merely someone who leeched a Kod'Taz flag, and the Ikkinz drop is to ensure that your guild has hit the proper level of progression.  The disc is not needed on trial 6, I can tank it with 1 cleric this means that there is progression aviable to Knights to be capable of getting through it (time gear), in Ikkinz this is no longer the case.  <br />

SK's who can't hit elementals are fine, it's about far less than elemental geared SK's, more like top geared Knights.  Not many SK's in raids means our raid role is lacking (honestly I don't think it's that bad but it's the perception), this fix is about fixing our group role to be capable of tanking still.  SK's progress just fine until this point, if this were Kunark or Velious you would have a point but that isn't the case.  The spells you listed do work, I actually use Asystole quite often, Fear as well.  Voice is junk and always will be it's more like 6% on the best one btw not 12% (atleast on a Warrior, would be 12% on us if using the right spells).  HT is 36 minutes currently, a faster one would be nice but it's not really feasable, if you haven't noticed they havent given any ability more than a 50% recycle reduction yet.  SCS is an entirely different issue, and needs changed to activated badly.  Monk lull is to balance them out with our pulling abilities, anyways lull is gay (and in Monk hands insanely overpowered... instant fd/lull is insane) it's a cheap way to split stuff.<br />

That was our lock, and with the changes, yes, knights still manage aggro better than warriors, but warriors are viable options; your group really isn't hindered by using a warrior to tank.

IMO, when you roll-up the 'grouping changes', the fact that there are dozen of post where 'on raid mob01, after the warriors died, the monks, rogue, and rangers tanked - knights were not an option' and the recent developments of GoD, a change across the board for knights is in order.<br />

To tank the boss?  Unless already geared up with equipment from that content, yes Warrior only.  Adds during the fight, trash mobs, etc shouldn't be (and aren't) Warrior only.  I tank quite a bit in raids (when I'm not pulling) ut I don't tank the big mobs.<br />

Asystole is good aggro but high cast time, it's good for overcoming a large aggro gap, its also a respectable debuff which makes tanking harder mobs a bit easier.  Spells are the same aggro wether they hit or not (exception on dots, some aggro each tick on them, initial aggro equal though), Fear being resisted is what makes it useful.  With the exception of no resist mod on spears and Terrors being piss poor our spellbook is pretty good.<br />
<br />
Answer me this:  Are you any less effective in old content since melee rebalancing/GoD came out?  Not less effective comparatively you're supposed to be then to give Warriors more desireability but are you less effective at doing anything you did in those exact same zones prior to GoD?  The answer to that is no, infact you're slightly more effective.  Thats why that level of play doesn't need upgrades</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. From my perspective, the game has two aspects in regards to tanks - big raid mob and not the big raid mob ( aka the common group mob ).<br />
<br />
Balance is yin for yang. We get preference on group mobs, but warriors *can* tank them effectively, just not *as* effectively, only due to aggro. Warriors are the best *big mob* tank, and as it stands, and always has, we aren't an option at the same point in the game. All I suggest is that we be as effective tanking the big mob as a warrior is to a fast grinding XP group; not do it as well, but be an option. Just because something always has been a certain way, doesn't mean it's the right way it should be.<br />
<br />
Again, agree to disagree; it seems our basic arguments for &amp; against are too far apart to see eye to eye. About the only thought left to pose, along these lines, is what about the 'monk, ranger, rogue' rotation; I'd be curious to see a justification for that occurence, but its probably another topic, and really a moot point if you believe knights should never tank a big mob in any way, shape, or form, at their current level. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kritr</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I am not less effective but I surely have to use my imagination a lot. I was in Sol ro a couple of nights ago and was the puller and tank. Did relatively well, actually, good.<br />
<br />
Monk comes, pulls  and he basically was much better with his pulls and was also giving good dps and even in one case fighting a mob when we had a pop in camp he took a tanking job and kept the mob till I killed mine then changed to tank his. When I was pulling it was the usual way, hit one mob with an arrow or get aggro with FD or CD asystole, etc, run a bit, FD, wait for one mob to go and then bring the mob that stays back to camp, or have someone peel the one that is by me. Monks now have an option over us.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not just want to see our role just doing exp gps and taking trash. I at least and I am sure other SK's would like to tank Mob/ raid encounter mobs. Do not see why this would stepping into the warrior's job. I have been in RD, Bert raids in which all the capable warriors were dead. Now why in such a situation I could not step in and have a shot at it?<br />
<br />
Diamond skin line of spells, and shield type of spells... this is a total joke... when I get hit for 300- 400 at one time. Why spend pp on pearls, etc. ?<br />
<br />
Was in DL a few days ago to take a loot to a friend. A green giant hits me and I hit him back, finally kill him and my killing hit was 32,000. Now why this can not be used on upper level mobs? This should be upgraded to our level of play. Was doing MM one time and he was 0 %. I was one of the last ones still fighting, would it not be nice to be able to at lest use my 32,000 hit on MM and have my killing shot at that time and save a wipe? Yes, it would have been greatly appreciated, but as I said this AA only works for mobs up to lvl 58. Now you may say this works in Ldon, aggree, but I think it should be able to put in use at other times.<br />
<br />
To summ it up: Why re invent the wheel? Abilities, spells we used should be upgradable and this would keep us in a good balance with others. I do not see the point in inventing other spells, or abilities, disciplines when all we have to do is upgrade our already acquired capabilites that are not of much use at a higher level of play. We can add augmentations to gear, why not add agumentations/upgrades, whatever you want to call it, to all we used in the past and make it usable at a higher level of play to suit our particular style.<br />

<br />
Note:  Any enhancements need to be applied for SK in KodTaz and higher.  Shadowknights in Pop are FINE AND BALANCED.  Good dps and good tankability, scaling with progression.  No knight ever was able to function perfectly in the first months of a progression, but after gearing up we are very useful in Pop.  in PoP I always had a role in raids as add tank, same as our paladins.  If you have trouble tanking in Pop, GEAR UP.<br />
<br />
If a mini disc would ever happen to us and if it would be available to SK NOT flagged for KodTaz, it would be unbalanced for the lower tiers/progressions.  With such a mini disc, I could tank most gods in Time, breaking class balance.  There would be little need for warriors, and the situation we are complaining about in GoD would just be reversed.  We should ask for help where we need it, and NOT try to gimp other classes.<br />

Hell yeah I think Knights deserve a defensive disc that is close to that of warrior defensive, there is no reason why not.<br />

No I do not want to be a warrior and after almost  2 years of playing my toon I am very much attached to my SK. I still think that if any of us would like to tank a raid boss that should be available. Monks lull, tank, warriors have all kinds of amenities and why not allow us to do the same?<br />

<br />
Where were these arguments about wanting to be able to tank raid level mobs when the warriors were complaining about how their ability to tank in xp grps was gimped when PoP came out because knights got such a desired upgrade?<br />
<br />
If you want to tank raid level mobs look at the content you are going for and equip yourself accordingly.  If it were implemented there would be no need to make it available to toons that had not reached that level yet.  Almost like handing the keys to a 15 year old after getting their learner's permit, yeah they may do okay with it, but the wouldn't have the experience of when and the best and most efficient way to use their ability and it could end up doing more hard them good.</div></div><hr />

Okay just because I would like to tank a boss does not mean I want to be a warrior. I guess I am a flexible person. If I have a toon with a skirt, some male warriors wear skirts, does not mean you want to be a woman warrior. That is going to the extremes.<br />
<br />
I like casting too, that does not mean I want to be a caster. I like my DD and dot spells, now I realize many Sk's hate this type of our line of spells. I like them and use them well. Would like to improve them and actually GOD/ AA has done a little improvement on that. That does not mean I want to be a necro.<br />
<br />
I said I want to make the SK better. The puree melees got their requests. Then let me dream, I have my dreams weather it will be reality or not does not matter.<br />
<br />
For me the SK is the combination of powers and again we should not be a secondary class.<br />
<br />
Seems to me, at least in the Ayonae ro sever at the level I play there is not many Sk's in the ranks, but you have tons of warriors. To me that says a lot. This was even before the warriors got all their new toys. Some people think this class sucks. Not good at anything.<br />
<br />
Still if there is an SK that does not care on tanking, then let it be. Do not do it. But rats if we can go all over Norrah on a scavenger hunt to find pieces for a color stick that is only for fun, why not do something similar in nature to allow the SK/s that want to improve their melee do  just that?<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Oh and on the comment Gear up. That has been debated here and then as we are not good at anything, the pure classes get first shot, after that, the remnants come to the SK. Ha, not nice. I mentioned  this on a previous topic as I think me, an Sk was being passed over as others can use better than me and I really did not needed this or that as much as I thought. <br />
Well how can I gear up if others always get first shot? Not that easy is not like I go to a raid and all are offering me stuff. Or I can go to the bazaar and get stuff I need.<br />
<br />
Then, interestingly enough, some of the people that were awarded stuff, that I really did not deserve, have not played in over a week. I have played every day. So... do you give the puree class that plays once in  a while a piece of gear that he can really use as he is a pure class? Or do you give the gear to one that is not good enough, like an SK, but plays all the time? <br />
What is more benefit for the guild?<br />
<br />
Gearing up is not an easy task in higher level of play, unless you are in an UBER guild, and have good friends, he he...<br />
<br />
So if we need to be balanced, then let's make it attainable in a reasonable manner. <br />

<br />
Tanking trial 6 failed too many times with almost 10300HP and almost entirely time-equipped.  (A few elem slots left, but augmented)<br />
in comparison, a warrior who left after his first quarm kill (almost NO time gear, zero augments) tanked trial 6 with ease.  I guess you are either lucky, or too elitist for me.<br />
<br />
We shouldnt have to have 6 quarm loots to do this Brael...<br />
I am no where near poorly equipped, and I am busy plowing through Ikkinz trials with ym guild as well...  i am used to being a decent tank but lesser than a warrior...  lesser is fine... THIS much lesser is not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trivializing past content?<br />
Oh come on...  PoP trivialized PoP...  our guild clears time in well under 4 hours now... we tank many encounters in time with enchanters just because we can...  you dont even NEED a melee class tanking for most of the encounters in time.<br />
Every upward expansion has trivialized the past one...<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole plan that a guild REQUIRES warriors in every raid is massively flawed.  Some encounters might nearly require warriors, and most encounters should be easier with a warrior tanking it... but very few should be unplayable without a warrior present.<br />
<br />
this should be the same with EVERY class. (clerics included)<br />
<br />
Some use the past to point out how warriors have been required for the past...  well in the recent past, knights ruled the XP groups too...  apparently this is NOT what is supposed to be...<br />
<br />
level the playing field... open up knights as lesser raid tanks, but raid tanks nonetheless.  Even if knights get their mini-defensive after beating time, no raid balance issues occur.  Warriors still tank everything, knights just are now ABLE to do it without requiring 2 expansions of equipment above a warrior. <br />
<br />
it is simply time for the warrior monopoly to go the way of the dodo...  their skills should make them quite valuable... but not so valuable as to hold a monopoly.<br />
<br />
Think knights should require a full suit of Quarm loot to tank a GoD raid mob?  Then why was it so wrong for a warrior to need rare raid items to tank in XP groups?  The same reason. <br />

Balance.<br />

Regarding your &quot;dreams&quot;:  Yes, there is nothing wrong about dreams, if you realize what they are, and are happy with what you have.  Sure I got a rush when I was main tank (TZ in Tactics or Cazic in Time).  However, I am just happy to effectively ndt or add tank.  This also can be a rush, to throw yourself into harm's way, protecting the clerics and chanters.  In PoP we had this role very nicely.  Now in Inkinz we have to carefully pick our adds :)  anything &gt; blue carries the risk of sudden death, unless you have a designated healer, which is not always the case.  Funny thing is, once hunting there, going back to poTime adds feels like fighting in an experience group in LDoN :)<br />

However, I can assure you that we're barking up the wrong tree by even suggesting that.  The howls of protest from the warriors can already be heard.  I'd much rather shoot for something that they can back, at least in part.  I actually posted this latest suggestion to our warrior message board, and got about a 50/50 split on it.  50% actually said that this, or something like it, was in order.  I actually had one warrior arguing for a lower refresh time.<br />
<br />
If this disc was made available to pre-Time knights or, worse, pre-elemental knights, these same warriors might very well withdraw their support.  The reason they would support it for Time+ knights is because there is really very little incentive for us to go back and tank these old-world mobs.  I could care less about tanking AHR or even 90% of the PoP bosses that this disc might give me.  And those are tankable by us already with enough gear and a quick enough chain.<br />
<br />
As for where it should be made available, I think the Ikkiniz trials or thereabouts is fine.  A knight can actually tank the final boss of Tipt, even if it is dicey.  Throw a couple of hasted charm-pets on it, and you only have to tank through a couple of melee rounds anyway.  It's not pretty, but it can be done.  Charmed pets only carry you through trial 6 (Tipt) though, at least that's what I'm told.  That's why we're so screwed from Kod'Taz on.</div></div><hr />

Wow...that's nice - according to EQ Rankings ( which is less than scientific, but the only source available ) that would include all of 45 SKs amoung all servers, when ranked by AC and 74 ranked by HP...good idea! /boggle<br />

Now to me this sounds to make an elite group of people who will use their powers for greedy purposes, as it already happened, and then we poor pre elemental guys have to put up with this kind of shit.

First of all you need to understand the endurance system before you start spewing opinions about futher upgrades, and thats assuming the opening system gets changed to a trigger on demand system, and the abilities that were added to game are actually obtainable and useable.  I have heightened endurance 3, as high as regen goes at this point in the game, i have basically 160 or more endurance on every item i have.  Do you know now many discs i can burn before i run out of stamina?  Exactly 3.  Furious, defensive/evasive/stone, and fell or mighty.  Thats from a full tank of probably 5k endurance.  Now to the kicker, endurance regen is basically 0 with max aa.  Why is this you ask? because i pretty much have to bellow every mob in god encounters.  Bellow is a 30 second refresh 444 direct hate 77 a tic for 10 tics and 275 endurance.  Do you have any idea how much endurance i regen in 5 tics?  It sure as hell isnt 275.  Basically what i am saying is warriors are very constricted at the current time on encounters in duration of 10 minutes, basically ones where you would need to use a defensive disc more than one time.  For example, newer ep guilds who have to do xegony are royally fucked for lack of a better term, because under the old system 3 out of every 7 1/2 mins i was under disc, now if you get a full second off you are fortunate.  If the new trigger on demand properties do in fact make it live, they will be virtually useless to a Tanking warrior.  They will however add utility to a nontank warrior, who if they werent tanking in the first place has very little utility to begin with.  If you will think of the new system giving warriors burst dps similar to what sks have.<br />
    As for sks tanking, you are focusing on the wrong element.  Knights have traditionally tanked mobs in encounters such as emp, rathe, tier 1 time.  Mobs that really arnt that melee intensive.  Knights do tank these better than warriors, because there is a point where mitigation stops, regardless of gear and a warrior flat lines as to his/her tanking ability.  This is the point where knights take over as better tanks because of their healing power.  Granted these mobs arnt god raid bosses, they arnt even 6 man raid bosses, but they are mobs that knights are able to tank far more efficiently than warriors can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please explain this. I tried breaking this off into a seperate thread to not distract from this one, but have yet to get an explanation. I just don't get it. If WarriorA is geared for his content level, and KnightB, at the same content level, is geared for that level as well, and you introduce this defensive idea, what does it break?<br />
<br />
As noted in the other thread, currently, tanking big_bad_mob01:<br />
(a&amp;b)----------(c)<br />
Where left is less effective, right is most effective, 'a' is 'other classes', 'b' is knights, and 'c' is warriors.<br />
<br />
With the suggestion:<br />
(a)-----(b)-----(c)<br />
<br />
So what if knights tank half as well as warriors on older content? I still want the best tanking tank available to tank the mob ( say that 3 times fast )!!! Where / why / how are warriors in older content put out? Do you mean to suggest that warriors not geared up to their level would be turned away in favor of a knight who is? *gasp* Sounds about right to me - why should someone who's gear sucks be preferred just because of their class ability, when all arguments stating the 'other' class has options to 'overgear' and accomplish the task?! /baffle What's good for one class is good for another...<br />
<br />
Previously, you answered that &quot;it would infringe on their lock of the raid mob&quot;...shouldn't there be options? What is wrong with taking a raid mob with a warrior and 2 clerics, or a knight and 4 clerics? I fail to understand...<br />
<br />
Note: forget overgearing - overgeared enough, even enchanters can tank pre-GoD mobs. Its a mute point, and has nothing to do with balance. I understand that knights can't do much of anything at the 'back' of GoD, but if a fix is going to be requested, why not 'fix' that which has always been broken? If you believe its not broken, then please counter the points above.</div></div><hr />

I call BS on that Brael, warriors are not hurting in that department, quite frankly they never were in the 1st place.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention PoP is now quite out dated, with the opening of the planes to the n00bs, and the introduction of LDoN and GoD, PoP should becoem trival very soon, and i dont see how holding back a watered down kunark era disc will change that.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind we are talking EP sk, the ones that don't have all their foci, and are stuck with low ft/atk, the same EP sk who now have far worse mitigation and agro managment than warriors.  I mean yeah sure give me that disc and id school any EP warrior across the board, but that is as it should be.<br />

<br />
incorrect....<br />
<br />
Knights still have a very hard time with spike damage...<br />
<br />
We have NO defense for it except collecting piles upon piles of equipment....<br />
<br />
A warrior two expansions behind is a better tank for anythiing that has good spike damage...<br />
<br />
Furious + defensive is something that NO amount of my mana, no amount of my abilities and NO amount of equipment can give me.<br />
<br />
I just want to be a reasonbly good tank.<br />
<br />
Thats it.<br />
<br />
10300 HP and 2300AC is nothing to these mobs...  I am tired of collecting equipment and having some of the best in the game only to see that NO amount of equipment will allow me to even stand in the same ROOM as my warrior brethren in order to be able to actually DO the only job I am actually cut out for...  ALL of this is due to the mobs being TUNED for defensive...<br />
<br />
The only remaining solution (other than the correct one of nerfing defensive into the toilet and retuning the mobs) is to give knights a lesser damage mitigation discipline that is intended for raid targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even with a 25% miitgation, knights will not take raid places from warriors unless the warrior in question is horribly undergeared...<br />
No raid leader will choose a knight with 25% over a warrior with 50%... anyone who does needs their head examined.<br />
<br />
I can think of NO advantage a knight would hold while tanking a heavy hitter that a warrior can argue about... especially with a spell haste mod on the discipline.<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the less a requirement for useage makes sense.  Remove the &quot;must be time-enabled&quot; to use...  remove the &quot;Ikkinz&quot; trail requirement.<br />
<br />
Knight defensive is as important and as much of a balance fix as Incite is...  they should belong on the same type of distribution.<br />
Either that, or its time to put aggro procs and incite on ikkinz trials...  and even I think thats just stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Truly... think about it warriors...<br />
Imagine being free of the &quot;defensive&quot; curse, and your class (and all three of the tanks) free of the balance problems inherent with such an overpowered ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;guaranteed mititgation&quot; at the cost of damage output becomes the definition of tank...  Warriors are no longer tied to just defensive, and developers are freed of this curse as well.<br />
Knights become fair raid tanks (but not better than warriors) and have spells and utility in exchange for their lesser ability in that role.<br />
<br />
I don't care how bad the warriors whine...  in the end they will see their folly... The game needs to include knights as tanks... for that is what they were designed to do.<br />
<br />
NO class that is second in a broad catagory such as damage or healing is as horribly far behind in their raid role as knights are for tanking...<br />
<br />
its simply time for the balance pendulum to fix the imbalance that has been in place since Kunark...<br />

Knights do tank these better than warriors, because there is a point where mitigation stops, regardless of gear and a warrior flat lines as to his/her tanking ability.  This is the point where knights take over as better tanks because of their healing power.   <br />
<br />
You are such a troll.  Go back to the kindergarden of TSW.  You do not truely believe that you cannot tank those mobs efficiently.  You know better.  You know that you will keep aggro just fine.  You know that you will tank just fine, with your nice mitigation bonus and armor superiority.  <br />
You try to lure us with your ridiculous see-through hand-downs.  Not because you fool cannot tank those, or think you are inferior in doing so, no, BECAUSE YOU ARE BORED, YOU TROLL!  Got to go afk at some point between tanking bosses, don't want the strenuous every second on the watch add tanking shit...RIGHT?<br />
<br />
<br />
And Brik, why do you bother arguing with this juvenile moron?    You waste your intelligence (by the way, there was not one word in your post I do not agree with).  There are warriors who are known as &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;smart&quot; people (Frodlin), and actually have game balance as an important goal.  Not god complexes like this infant from RZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First of all im from tallon zek not rallos zek, so your direct attack is nice considering you arnt competent enough to read.  Secondly you seem to want to attack defensive.  The last time i used defensive or stonewall, on a raid, aside from tz/vz in time was in plane of fire.  I honestly havent used that disc in probably 8 months aside from those 2 mobs.  Call bullshit, do what you like, but i have 2900 ac with a bard on raids, and defensive is useless compared to evasive, and this includes ikkinz raid mobs.  If you wanna cry about only having 2300 ac and getting bitch slapped its for a simple reason, your gear isnt good enough to tank.  Pick up some ac augs, get some avoidance and shielding gear while giving up some focus, then complain about these mobs.  You say how ikkinz 6 man adventures are geared for defensive?  Again ill restate my point that these mobs are basically immune to defensive for all intents and purposes, aside from the adventure bosses.  Defensive just simple doesnt cut the max hit down enough to make it any more useful than evasive, and sure you will get a few spikes here and there, but the miss rate of these npcs is huge.  You want to talk about hour long discs and cry about that, guess what the refresh of furious is?  42 minutes.  Of course its not 72 mins like your discs but its long enough to allow it to not be up for every boss i tank.  Now onto the aggro thing.  I never said aggro was a problem on encounters like the rathe ect, however there are an awful lot of guilds who chain root to hold aggro on the tanks, and rotate logging clerics to clear aggro.  Warriors have 1 means of generating aggro, and that means is melee.  Bellow is pissing in the wind compared to melee aggro, regardless of what you would like to say.  The fact is knights do offtank encounters such as emp and rathe far better than a warrior can, just because of their self healing power.  Im not saying warriors arent balanced, because they are in fact finally a useful class.  Knights on the other hand are HYBRIDS, they were not intended to be main tanks on raids, they were never intended to be main tanks in 6 man trials, what they were intended to be are situational tanks.  Let me spell it for the delusional people who think knights should be able to tank every mob in the game just as well as a warrior.. SITUATIONAL.  Situational does not mean tanking a quad 4k mob the first time your guild enters a new high end zone lol.  Situational means offtanking adds in time, or tanking mobs such as inny and ct to ensure your tank never gets feared.  A warrior will always mitigate significantly better than knights, its a fact of eq, and its the way the game was designed.  If you want to tank as well give up your spells log delete and make a warrior and you problem is solved.  Oh one last nite, it takes me about 25 minutes to regen a full bar of endurance..and thats afk time meaning i spend 0 over that time period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Optional tanks on 1 month old content?  I assume you felt you wanted the option to tank fennin with a knight the 4th time?  Or did you clear time with a knight tanking ever mob the 4th time through?  This sir is the definition of optional.  Situational is tanking a mob that procs fear, or offtanking a mob that you can deal ZERO damage to.  That is a knights place, and where knights excel.  Knights are not the primary tank class, they are a hybrid utility class.  As a hybrid you do nothing the best, but you do a lot of things above average.  You can start the bard pulling arguement but everyone in eq knows their pulling ability needs to get beat with the nerf bat.  I will trade you a gimped defensive disc for an aura of pain type self buff anyday, and you know what it wont give you what you want because warriors will still and always be the superior tank class on NEW content, because thats the way everquest is designed.</div></div><hr />

i would gladly give you a 50% (22.5% mitigation) defensive disc.  Seeing as you are a hybrid you will be bound to a 72 minute refresh, however this will let you tank ikkinz trials, and in return give me aura of pain and aura of the crusader.  This is a simple solution to shut all the whiney knights up, while only asking for 1 simple spell from both classes.

Yet another example of the tendency to lump Shadow Knights and Paladins into the &quot;Uber Knight&quot; class, if you ask me.  Heck yeah if I had all the abilities of a Shadow Knight and a Paladin, I'd agree that would be overpowered.  By a lot.  But there is no such thing.<br />
<br />
I have to say that the more I read TSW and the more I read SKO, the less and less I like the fact that warriors are the &quot;only&quot; raid tank for new content.  Everquest has not &quot;always&quot; been this way.  Granted it has been this way for something like four years since Kunark came out, but when the level cap was 50 it was not like this.<br />

Warriors got better aggro capabilites. Monks got the lull, and tons of disciplines.<br />

Aggro before the upgrade was unmatched end game.  The only upgrade we got was 400 hate every 30 seconds + 70 a tic dot.  God gave us a 10% upgrade to that.  400 hate and that minor dot is nothing in the grand scheme of things, its used for 1 purpose and 1 purpose only, to pull aggro at the start of a battle.  Now on to mitigation, There has been an ongoing dispute for years about warriors getting an innate mitigation bonus because guess why? You guessed it, knights were tanking mobs and mitigating very very similarly, see luclin where AA were identical, and so was gear.  The only difference was naked hps, and defensive skill caps.  Now onto the retard who was crying because i was willing to trade half of my disc for 1 spell from each knight class..not 50% of their spells.  I dont think its being selfish to ask for 1 spell from each class who is going to get half of my disc, hell its only 1 spell.<br />
<br />
As per tanking on raids knights can tank perfectly fight.  They can not main tank, but they can offtank efficiently.  We consistantly have knights tanking quad 1900 trash in ikkinz.  It seems to me like sks want utility.  Utility is not granted by taking a warriors spot in a raid, its granted by adding an effect to the overall raid.  Give sks a raid attack buff similar to aura of hate maybe, or a debuff that is worth something.  You also complain about being useless.  I know most of you are bluebies, but sks are the best pvp class in the game, granted soe doesnt give a shit about pvp, but it is a small part of the decision when balancing characters (see ranger archery nerf).</div></div><hr />

Most guilds with sufficient numbers of warriors online know that it is safer to use wariors for Inkinz adds.  I clearly decreases overall risk, and, more specifically, ass tank healer death, and time lost.  Most people think it is more efficient for a raid to have warriors alone tank these adds..<br />
<br />
The change will come.  All those SK twinks will disappear, and only the old ones will be left.  At the same time guilds will be flooded with warriors, and knigts will forever and ever lose the add tank responsibility.<br />
<br />
I hate the word &quot;utility&quot;, and will make a new post on that later.  There is no &quot;utility&quot; short of FD a warrior cannot get and use, utilizing item effects and potions.  Warriors can have a &quot;spellbook&quot; just about as convenient as ours.  You may want to say &quot;well, you got your great AC and ATK buffs, and feed mana to the group.  I cannot do this with potions&quot;.   I don't care.  Give the warriors all our buffs etc., just for exchanging mitigation and some useful discs.</div></div><hr />

First of all, if u gona quote me dont missquote me.<br />
<br />
Second, if you dismiss the fact that all of a sudden warriors have snap agro as in before they didnt (ae taunt exluded) you are just a total moron.  Knights have been all over snap agro since day 1, warriors have never had anything besides the &quot;broken&quot; taunt key, which btw aint broken at all.<br />
<br />
Third, the mitigation change was 100% un-needed, and is mainly the reason why we are in this fucked up situation (and by we i dont mean knights alone i mean the entire game).  This game belive it or not has THREE TANKING CLASSES. And no warriors are not the only tank, and never will be, in a group there are 6 spots, 1 healer 1 tank 1 cc 3 dps/utility, there are already wiz,rog,mag,nec,rng,ber,mnk and bst as classes who primarly only do dps/utlity in a group or even raid, notice i left out dru,brd,enc,sk,war,pal since those can also fill in as utlity/dps classes but usually man other roles, so we got the vast majority of classes lumped into 1 role, while you want just 1 class (warrior) to be the only tank, well tough shit man, thats just aint gona work.<br />
<br />
Trials that take 1 group, MUST be tankable by knights, since knights ARE tanks, there are no if or but about it, live with it, or stfu.</div></div><hr />

We do not have snap aggro with disc.  Im not sure if you mean bellow of the mastruq as a disc, which is only very very minor aggro, in fact less than your terror line which is also useless, or spirit of rage, which as a disc is also pretty useless.  Although i have used it during an occasional tank switch where taunt failed and had no ae taunt up, and got aggro in about 12 seconds after half the raid died.  12 seconds is clearly snap aggro.  I do agree however on ldon and god, these 2 upgrades were huge for warrior aggro, not just end game, but at all levels for the most part with anger 3.  The mitigation change was indeed needed because knights were parsing out just below warriors nondisc, and not a statistically significant change.  I don tknow about you, but im sure you would be complaining if the only ability you had to make yourself a better tank than a knight was a level 55 disc.  One thing that sks do need is a utility ability or buff on raids.  All other hybrids have a buff of some sort to make at least 1 ideal.  For example paladin - brells ranger - sot sotp beast - sd sv bard - ae mana + 10000 other things.  Sks really get nothing aside from aura of hate, which makes every priest class bitch up a storm because it eats a buff slot lol.  Give sks instant fd hotkeys to pull, or a target groupable ac or attack buff.  Make it so that people want sks on raids, not just have to settle with them because xyz sk plays a lot and has full time gear yet is still useless.<br />
<br />
The 1 group events in god were made for 1 reason, and its the reason why 1 person can get your guild a raid.  Send the top 6 in your guild in and beat them so your guild can advance.  At this point in god progression, there is no indication that everyone will need these trials, and the logistics of pushing 100+ people through 3 4-6 hour trials is a nightmare.  Given that you would assume for the good of your guild you want your best tank in the trial, and that happens to be a warrior by design.  Again you need to understand the event, and what it means to your guild.  It doesnt mean hi i cant tank these 1 group events efficiently that we only need 1 person flagged for, i need a full class upgrade.</div></div><hr />

What is desired after all is for 6 person content to not overfavor a single class at the expense of the other 2 classes.<br />
<br />
I don't for a moment believe that the suggestion should be implemented prior to where there is an actual issue.   The only place it's an actual issue is in GoD, really beginnning at KodTaz and beyond.   <br />
<br />
Prior to GoD, most people will agree that single group tanking is at it's most balanced point it's ever been.   Warriors bring some benefit in terms of increased survivability, the different knight classes being their own strengths in terms of durability combined with versatility, all in all, group tanking is quite well off.<br />
<br />
In terms of the generation of aggro, I feel bad because a lot of people make a valid point that warrior aggro post time is better over time than anyone else's, yet that truth begins to trickle down to the point where it becomes myth.   Warrior aggro pre-time isn't that hot still, but it's acceptable.    It takes on a tremendous transformation when warriors begin to acquire PoTime gear, and the threshold becomes passed, and they are now into the &quot;very good&quot; range of aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Now, prior to time, knights DO still have an aggro jumpstart on warriors, and because of this, there exists a justification for replacing a warrior with a knight on raid level content when confronting a boss.    Since on many post-velious raids, knights have plenty of additional roles to perform if the content is challenging, and since warriors really are rather unidimensional, in other words if they're not tanking, they don't really have many options, (including DPS, which a warrior cannot perform to the best of his ability due to the inability to shed unwanted aggro) the function of boss tanking should remain in the realm of the warrior.    <br />
<br />
Also, because there isn't the need for this to exist prior to GoD in single group environments, where tanking really is well balanced, I simply cannot find a reason to justify the distribution of something of this magnitude prior to the content in which it's actually needed to perform your primary function in single group content.<br />
<br />
Let me further explain.   Clerics are &quot;raid level healers&quot;, and there's 2 reasons for it.  The first is because they happen to be the best at it, but moreso, because they can't really perform other functions outside of healing during raid level content.  It's a double edged sword so to speak.    You could succeed with the same order of magnitude with an all druid/shaman healing pattern as you can with knight tanking without a discipline.    The big difference is on raid level content that druids and shamans bring significant other ancillary skillsets that give them value outside of healing.<br />
<br />
While on velious style encounters, there's not a whole lot of ancillary skillsets that knights can bring, the same cannot be said for Luclin/PoP encounters.    <br />
<br />
While I fully agree that there should be a much larger spread between knight tanking and others, I cannot deny that there are some issues that would need to be considered, such as &quot;what are you gonna do with warriors if they're not tanking?&quot;   Also, you HAVE to be honest with yourselves about pre-time warrior aggro issues and how there would still be justification for replacing at least the primary tank position to knights on big bosses with the early implementation of such a disc.<br />
<br />
Finally, you have to ask yourselves &quot;What is most likely to be supported vs. shot down to address our valid grievances?&quot;    I cannot emphasize enough that I'm not swimming in a sea of support even pushing pretty hard for a limited access disc, but if it were handed at a lower point, even &quot;soft support&quot; would dry up like the Sahara Desert.    Hell, I dont' even know if *I* could support that, seeing that it's not really necessary prior to the point where it's an issue.<br />
<br />
I tend to be firmly on your side when it comes to the GoD content, but not really prior to it.</div></div><hr />

I do not know how you play, but this makes no sense to me whatsoever.  Any guild I know uses sacrificial rangers or RT knights with DA/HS to lock the mob, and after 24 secs the warrior has plenty of aggro.<br />

You smartly have worded this as &quot;knights&quot; and not &quot;SK&quot;.  I otherwise would challenge you to tell me my additional roles.  I have no chance breaking into our bard/monk/occ.rogue pull team.   I have no great raid buffs making me desirable.   I cannot group heal like a paladin.  My dps is not much different than yours, and we know where we stand with this.  <br />
All I had was tanking.  You would call this unidimensional.<br />
<br />
TO ALL WARRIORS:  DO not bunch us together with the paladins.  <br />

How on earth could this true issue be addressed?  It hurts, and is embarrasing to us SK.  SOE will NEVER EVER worsen the tanking abilities of rangers and monks again, I bet you money on that one.   The only possible way to increase the gap again to reasonable differences would be upgrading SK mitigation and avoidance.<br />

<br />
This always has been the problem with the EQ community.  Remember how you warriors were bitching prior to December?  Now, when powerful, suddenly they turn the blind eye towards other game issues not directly affecting them.<br />
<br />
We SK have said that you need more aggro generation, it is well documented on this board.  We were not arguing like the paladins did.<br />
<br />
If warriors would be fair, they would turn the question right away:<br />
<br />
 &quot;what are you gonna do with shadowknights if they're not tanking?&quot;<br />

Aye.  This is what most experienced SK have been saying.  You will not hear anyone who has personal experience in tanking Pop to the highest level argue otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I think most of us feel this way. There are a few exceptions, but if you look at it with an open mind, this is the right attitude. Never before Kod/Ikk did knights ask in earnest for a boost tanking power, as none was needed. <br />
<br />
Personally I am torn as to a solution. Adding a defensive type discipline needs to be handled properly or it has the potential to blur the lines between warriors and knights too much. As it stands now though, for one group content, the gap is too large. Hopefully a balanced solution can be implemented.<br />
<br />
Addressing a few other things:<br />
<br />
One thing that sks do need is a utility ability or buff on raids.  <br />
<br />
No. Buffing others on raids is not the issue, nor is raid desirability. Let's stick to the subject and not your subjective opinion of our problems.<br />
<br />
The 1 group events in god were made for 1 reason, and its the reason why 1 person can get your guild a raid. Send the top 6 in your guild in and beat them so your guild can advance. At this point in god progression, there is no indication that everyone will need these trials <br />
<br />
It sounds like you have progressed pretty far into GoD, so you know very well there are many indications this has to be done by everyone. Easiest one to see is the amount of Artifact drops on the four Ikk or Summoner raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have differences in opinion I'd like to point out, but works is calling. One thing I will say atm is that just because there wasn't a 'large' complaint about the tanking situation pre-GoD release, doesn't mean it didn't exist.<br />
<br />
Throughout these forums, there is a history of suggestions, etc for knights to have some tanking role on raid content ( esp when the ranger / monk / rogue discipline issue is brought up ). These 'suggestions' have been around for a long time, but something else you can see on these boards is this community is historically very complacent, for reasons that elude me.<br />
<br />
/IMO<br />
I think its the 'oh! we finally got something decent ( speaking of PoP additions ) so lets just be happy with what we got and not complain, for fear of the nerf bat'. There have been complaints about 'no raid lvl mob tanking options', just the 'nerf bat fear' of certain folks has stricken them down.<br />
<br />
Hopefully will have to respond more detailed later in the day.</div></div><hr />

First off sks are complaining about not being able to tank 1 encounter 1 month into the expansion that in the grand scheme of Gates will probably end up to be as significant as camping rz bane weapons in pop.  I may be wrong on this, but i severely doubt it.  Secondly if in fact everyone in your guild does need to complete this retarded quest at one point or another, there are a lot of other classes who are screwed before high end sks.  Shaman for example are 100% useless in ikkinz simply because the final fights + bosses are immune to slow, and they arnt adept at healing or dealing dmg at a rate acceptible enough to make them useful, sks on the other hand can dump about 20% of a bosses life with death touch, similar to what i can do with furious and plankton when engaging a mob.  And if you like, you can extend this to the bard class, who in all of their supposed glory, really doesnt do anything for ikkinz that i wouldnt rather have another class do, although i used one for ikkinz 1 for ds + backup mezz.  Or maybe you want to talk about rangers or beastlords who dont deal excessive enough damage to make them useful over a monk rogue wiz or mage.  Or how about a necro who can hit the dps mark, but cant sustain it from the massive aggro attained through stacking 2k a tic in dots.  <br />
<br />
Now onto the reasons why the 3 ikkinz 6 man raids will not be required.  Number 1 anyone who has a clue can understand.  All 3 of these are 4 to 6 hours in duration, you can not sub people in to loot rotting artifacts after the boss dies, and each encounter is designed to use a completely different strategy.  Each of these strategies yeild themselves to favor a certain class, or mix of classes, with 2 in common in all of them (cleric and warrior).  I know many sks dont think this is fair but lets face it, the whole game of everquest revolves around tanking and healing..the warrior staying alive, and the cleric healing him/her.  The sheer logistics ofpushing 1-200 people through 3 different 4-6 hour trials even if not one group fails is immense, then assume that 2 in 3 will fail, and the time sink is staggering.  We arnt talking 2 days to camp shards for vt key here, we are talking on average 36 to  54 man hours per person to complete just the 6 man raid group, assuming the average pass rate is 1 in 3 attempts.  This is further compounded by the fact that you wont always have enough for a doable group, so add in any type of wait times, or people who are already flagged helping others, and you turn this into a complete mess ready to drive half of the end game population out of pop.  Now to your points, i am well aware that many of the tasks past the 3 6 man trials drop 6 items, such as summoner, but many of them, such as the collects and ground spawns can only be done 1 at a time pending respawn, however the runes that drop in summoner do create a gate rune when combined, so that could be the reason why 6 drop each kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps you're playing in a different Gates of Discord as I am, but Shamans are quite valuable in my groups.   While their healing falls woefully short, and bosses mit slow, I'd really rather not have to play buffbot games all over the place if I die cause my cleric cracked a beer open while I was tanking some yellow trash mob.   I also prefer the safety a shaman brings during clearing, and they're completely capable of providing enough secondary heals to make me survive (although I've found that I prefer a smart paladin as back up healer to a shaman).<br />
<br />
<br />
 And if you like, you can extend this to the bard class, who in all of their supposed glory, really doesnt do anything for ikkinz that i wouldnt rather have another class do, although i used one for ikkinz 1 for ds + backup mezz. <br />
<br />
Again, we must be playing different versions of gates.  My favorite group setup is Bard, Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Druid, and Cleric.  I'd swap out monk for mage in some scenarios.     Bard pulls named, despawns pets, dances the gay bard nimble dance, and monk goes to town with auto ripo disc while ranger/warrior engage, then ranger WS's while everyone pounces, then I AE taunt with furious, and finally, go defensive and the mob's at 35% or so when I JUST START to need heals, and I'm piled up with a nice damage shield and druidboy's dotted the crap out of the mob.    If mage is substituted, bard goes to town while jaboner engages, bard backs up and jaboner enrages, before that's done, ranger WS's and we go to town, and then I furious/defensive, and mob is at similar health.  I've heard of 6 mage groups killing nameds in KodTaz by pre-summonning 2 pets each, one held, and chaining pets who basically enrage kill the mobs.  If they had the balls to go into Ikkinz, I'm sure they'd be able to do that there as well just not as easily.<br />

<br />
Oddly, again, you aren't playing with the same setups I am.  Rangers, Beastlords (again, raging pets), etc are all pretty damn powerful in those trials in my experience.   And if you got a necro who hasn't figured out how to pile up dots/feign, I worry about your necros.<br />
<br />
I think Brael nicely covered the &quot;trials needed&quot; and drops issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thanks for at least recognizing the problems, Frod.  This alone, is enough to keep me sympathetic to warrior concerns in the future, as in the past.<br />
<br />
I did post on that steelwarrior thread, but I didn't want to rehash everything.  My ultimate suggestion was that they simply retune these encounters for at least 12 people, rather than 6.  That would allow knights to performa  raid role and I think most of us would be happy.  In other words, if they are going to treat these trials as mini-raids, then actually make them MINI-RAIDS and not single-group grinds.  There is no such thing as a single-group mini-raid.  If they retune for 12 or 18 people, they can actually make the trials harder, and they would then not have to give us defensive or anything like it.<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that retuning the GoD encounters is by far the best way of fixing this without totally screwing up all previous content and throwing classes out of balance once again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize you can make your icon of the altar with just the 4 drops and not doing the quest right?.  Add in the 7500p (which they have said they would start adding to help control the economy) assuming no fails to construct the items and the small time sink to camp the inanimates in kod taz, its about what the time sink should be.  Nowhere does any of this require the 3 ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
Frodlin i dont know if you are bipolar or what, one time you are crying about this post only being about tanking ikkinz 1 man trials, next you are talking about larger encounters.  Shaman in ikkinz 1 man group are 100% useless.  The bosses are 100% immune to slow, and a chanter can slow trash just as efficiently since they mitigate.  Again with your &quot;ideal &quot; groups I have no idea how you keep them uniform, since every trial requires a different focus.  Remember as you said this talk is about ikkinz 1 man trials nothing else.  Trial 1 i want 2 clerics 1 warrior 1 chanter 1 bard 1 dps/druid.  Trial 2 i want 2 clerics 2 warriors 2 rogues, sub a chanter in for 1 rogue while you are clearing before malevolents.(simply better against the aes than wizards).  Trial 3 i want 1 warrior 1 cleric 1 druid 1 ench and 1 random dps.  Nowhere in there do you see a hybrid apart from the bard for DD because they simply dont do 1 required task well enough to merit them in a group, however there are places where they are able to be fitted in to get through the trials very very similar to poj at the start of pop, although not near as assrape as kod taz trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aspit, that mentality was completely unacceptable for warriors being mercy grouped through PoJ.  Why would it be any more acceptable for knights here in GoD now.  Furthermore, there is a large difference between not being the preferred tank (what warriors were faced with) and being completely and totally unable to tank (what knights are faced with now).<br />
<br />
From what I have seen, the basic warrior attitude towards all this is &quot;screw you knights; I spent 3 expansions sucking ass, so now it's your turn!&quot;  I hope you're happy with where that attitude will get you when SOE is forced to implement some type of knight defensive or be faced with the loss of a huge part of their player base.  At that point, you'll be even more pissed off because of all the ensuing balance issues.<br />
<br />
In other words, warriors that refuse to acknowledge the depth of this problem are just setting themselves up for even more trouble later on.  Disagreeing on HOW to fix it is quite acceptable, in my opinion, but turning a blind eye, puffing up your chest, and beating the warrior GOD drum will ultimately result in your own demise.  Glad to see there are some intelligent people playing your class that realize this and, very wisely, want to head it off with a proper fix that won't erase all the necessary rebalancing that has been done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what is your problem but at this point I think I have become nauseated enough with your posts that I have to say this:<br />
<br />
Last nite in BOT I was two boxing my cleric, he is lvll 65 313 AA. Our gp consisted of one shammy, one bst, one monk one mage, my cleric and me/ Kritr.... lvl 65 SK 614 AA...now working on my Gates AA.<br />
Kritr went LD... Ha wipe I said... <br />
<br />
Wrong no wipe. My cleric starts using DD of 1100 and stuning 300, plus using DA and healing the remaining of the gp, no problem. The monk and Bst start tanking, and the mage gets a pet. Kritr was LD for 15 min just trying to get back. <br />
<br />
But this was a nice little, unpredictable , not planned little experiment that tells me I was not really needed. Now let me tell you this is MSR in bot and we were by the Kriegers and  tons of mobs, roamers etc. These other guys had no problem, I mean no problem, tanking staying alive and my cleric never once went under 70 % mana, till Kritr finally showed up. <br />
<br />
Damn that was embarrassing. Tells me I was not really needed. Not that I was not proud of the job our group and my cleric did but it tells me one more time something needs to be done for our precarious position as good at nothing class. <br />
<br />
I said and will repeat this I have been in raids in which all the mighty warriors were dead. Actually I was the only tank left standing and again totally useless at that point.<br />
<br />
So with all of these in mind I propose:<br />
<br />
1. Make ND6, only for SK and Pally's,  ... 50 AA to activate, only for lvl 65 <br />
<br />
2. Make LR10 , again only for SK / Paladin ... 50 AA to activate, only for lvl 65.<br />
<br />
3. DD spear line of spells.. increase to double, so  lets say you would have spear of Decay hitting for 1200 every time and random 2400. 24 AA, only for level 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. HT refresh time 5 min. Damage up to 10 K. 75 AA to activate, only lvl 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Voice of Thule: aggro gain of 50 % self, 25 % when casted on warrior.. lvl 65 sk. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Death Peace mana regen 200 / tic, will not eat your life. <br />
<br />
<br />
7. Permanent Fabled only for SK in sol ro: <br />
<br />
BP drops 60 AC, 20 int, 10 Dex, 200 mana, 50 endurance, 200 HP.<br />
Mag + 20, Fire + 20 cold.<br />
<br />
Vengeance 4.<br />
mana regen +3<br />
<br />
 8. DS totally uselss at this time Make a Banshe Aura lasting 20 min, mitigation of 800. 24 AA, lvl 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Make my hide as good as Rogues, and when I move it will still work.<br />
<br />
10. Make Disarm a usable skill only to be used by SK, 200 skill. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
11. Give me a stun spell. Ldon acquired.<br />
<br />
<br />
12.   Give me a pacify for lvl 68, 50 AA.<br />
<br />
<br />
13. Summon corpse, only need bone chips to use. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
14. More drops only for SK and pally, warriors not included with mana of 150, HP 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are only a few...<br />
<br />
I read this and just about pee my pants laughing and I hope you throw up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Truly yours:<br />

Im not quite sure if you are trying to be completely sarcastic or a total retard for comparing your tanking ability on 18 month old content to that of 1 month old content.  The reason why poj trials were bad for warriors was for 1 simple reason..warriors are, by design the primary tank.  The issue wasnt mitigation in those events, it was the lack of aggro ability.  with disc up in ikkinz i need a top cleric and a top shaman at the very least, cleric druid to be safe to tank these mobs.  Do you hear my crying about how hard they hit?  Thats with disc up, you are complaining that with no disc you cant tank them with that healing power..guess what neither can i.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you elaborate for me please?  I'm confused where you got the larger encounter part from.   Perhaps in your search for my bipolarity, you must've read something in a post written by someone other than &quot;Frodlin7th&quot;.    I disagree that a solution can be found in expanding the trials to accommodate larger groups, as I suspect that you can much more easily &quot;class stack&quot; non-limited content, and automatically you can overcome it without adequately experienceing prior content, which I find to be incredibly bad for EQ as a whole.   <br />
<br />
<br />
 Shaman in ikkinz 1 man group are 100% useless. The bosses are 100% immune to slow, and a chanter can slow trash just as efficiently since they mitigate.<br />
<br />
What the enchanter cannot do is turn into secondary/tertiary healer for the boss encounter, and someone who can cripple, malo, and heal is of more value to me than someone who can tash, cripple, and nuke not real well.<br />
<br />
Again with your &quot;ideal &quot; groups I have no idea how you keep them uniform, since every trial requires a different focus. Remember as you said this talk is about ikkinz 1 man trials nothing else. Trial 1 i want 2 clerics 1 warrior 1 chanter 1 bard 1 dps/druid.  Trial 2 i want 2 clerics 2 warriors 2 rogues, sub a chanter in for 1 rogue while you are clearing before malevolents.(simply better against the aes than wizards). Trial 3 i want 1 warrior 1 cleric 1 druid 1 ench and 1 random dps.<br />
<br />
Last night I did trials 1 and 2 with Warrior, Ranger, Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Mage.   While each trial gives added strength to different classes, with the right strategies, each can be overcome.  I suppose you need to think outside the box though.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Nowhere in there do you see a hybrid apart from the bard for DD because they simply dont do 1 required task well enough to merit them in a group, however there are places where they are able to be fitted in to get through the trials very very similar to poj at the start of pop, although not near as assrape as kod taz trials.<br />

<br />
Even if gearing up after farming for 6 months may allow a SK to tank Inkinz 1, the same SK would have NO ROLE at all in the insane higher level tiers, where defensive is REQUIRED to tank trash adds, unless SOE wakes up and realizes that something needs to be done to 2/3rds of the tank classes.<br />

The issue wasnt mitigation in those events, it was the lack of aggro ability.  with disc up in ikkinz i need a top cleric and a top shaman at the very least, cleric druid to be safe to tank these mobs.  Do you hear my crying about how hard they hit?  Thats with disc up, you are complaining that with no disc you cant tank them with that healing power..guess what neither can i.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for further proving my point.<br />
<br />
As you have stated the problem in pop WAS NOT that warriors couldnt tank well compared to knights, the problem was agro, or lack their of.<br />
<br />
Melee balancing gave warriors the needed agro, BUT u also recieved mitigation/avoidance boosts that upset the balance, hence the 2nd part of your yaping about how u need a top cleric and defensive to just barely tank ikkinz.<br />
<br />
So if you are still with me aspit, by your own logic, knights need to get a avoidance/mitigation boost and maybe even a defensive type disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darko your theory...well i dont even see it.  You are trying to say that just because warriors got a 5% innate mitigation bonus, which they should have for being the primary tank class, and only tank class on raids, you could argue about knights, but lets face it, if a knight is tanking fennin, a shaman can tank him and has, that knights and paladins are due to have this bonus?  First of all warriors received NO avoidance bonus, the only avoidance bonus.  Avoidance mods on gear increase the miss rate, This is not affected by dodge, parry, riposte ect, so there really is no disparity between knights and warriors here, aside from gear, which is attainable by knights.  So by gaining only 5% mitigation, which is virtually nothing in ikkinz 6 man trials, you are justifying knights should also gain this how?  I hate to tell you but 5% mitigation isnt going to help you tank ikkinz, in fact nothing is going to help you tank ikkinz short of a third healer.<br />
<br />
Shaman are useless in ikkinz because there are classes that i would rather take over them; for example i would take a druid over a shaman anyday in these trials.<br />
<br />
Frodlin you did not do ikkinz 1 and 2 last nite with those groups, in fact you probably did neither for the simple reason that eb procs were bugged in patch, and up to the patch last nite were basically procing a jolt effect instead of a + aggro effect.  Secondly you are lying because DD would drop you like a bad habbit with only a bard to mezz (who caps at 3 mobs).  You can root with the ranger but you kill your dps so vastly that you will end up with all 10 adds by the time the fight is over, which you cannot possibly cc.  Trial 2, again you would have to use the 1 warrior to tank both mobs, which as of last nite was impossible with bugged aggro.  Would you care to explain how ou did the impossible?  Hrm oh yeah you didnt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know what I want, sorry if you do not aggree for whatever reason it is. What I asked is just a set of ideas and work from there. It is not written in stone. But damn what I said/ my wish list really beats Diamond skin that I need to cast a peridot and can only use once?<br />
Hide that works only if I do not move, disarm that only works when I go to mess around in Neriak, and now being called by some an utility tank. He my opinions are as good as anyone in this board.<br />
<br />
Then the LD incident the point on that is that look others can tank well. So then I need to improve my tank as other classes are doing well at it too. I guess I need to improve on my tanking. Certainly I have not been to GOD yet, but rats seems that you guys are not doing too well there either. Maybe something can be done at my level to be able to avoid the situations at the upper end of the game.<br />
<br />
Hey as someone said, if nothing is done to correct this problem maybe some will actually leave and not play any more and SOE will lose players. <br />
<br />
What I am talking is fairness. Pure melees got their day. One way or another we need ours. I do not see myself as utility or secondary but I can take a primary role if needed and if I want to.<br />
<br />
And Stru what I want retarded? <br />

Again, I want whatever I want. That does not make me retarded not more than it makes retarded the pure melees that got their wishes.<br />

<br />
The reality is this would've been the case with or without the melee changes.  The melee changes had --zero-- effect on GoD, with one exception and that was the unlinking of disciplines, which while very powerful isn't necessary to complete any of the trials, only very helpful.  Defensive existed prior to the melee changes, and the addition of the mitigation bonus is completely eliminated while defensive is in effect.  In other words, if the melee changes had never happenned, we'd be talking about this today just the same.<br />
<br />
Aspit.  I'm sorry, I guess the earring that I didn't have when I logged on last night, and the Carved Totem that the druid ended up looting happenned to be insta-spawned onto our toons because you had a tough time with aggro.   As a matter of fact, last night, before going to Ikkinz, I did the Riwwi coliseum belt quest &quot;Defy the officiator&quot; event for a while and was tanking.... 3 mobs at a time with NO problems whatsover with aggro.    I dont' know, it seems to me that you're really fixated on certain roles and incapable of envisioning being able to adequately perform outside of what you've conceived to be the &quot;only way&quot;, but I got news for you... there's lots of ways to think outside the box.<br />
<br />
I had *zero* aggro problems last night, not a one, and I was multi-tanking all night.</div></div><hr />

This thread has become sort of interesting.<br />
<br />
Now seems some people think that their ideas are correct and anyone else that does not think like them is just not good, or wrong. Or like Brael said, I do not know what I ask.<br />
<br />
Now some one, you , knows I am frustrated.<br />
<br />
HA ha ha...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, well I have had a blast getting my  all my AA's . As there are basically no other Sk in my guild that I can talk there is no way I can discuss the good or bad of the AA, spells, loot, etc. <br />
<br />
Being in BOT. He he I am sorry if this is a low place for you  to be but I really had a good time there and still do. This game is to have fun and I am having fun. I am not frustrated. I rather grind and do AA than LDon. Now that is another whole new thread. Is AA  or gear better  to improve. Different ways of thinking on this.<br />
<br />
I was not sure, although at times I get the impression, that this board for Sk in general not for high end game SK, that do time in 4 hrs and now are playing around in GOD. <br />
<br />
<br />
So I have 614 AA, worked my ass to get them since lvl 0, and very proud of my accomplishements. Did not get this through anyone PL me, being in an &quot;UBER&quot; guild or having high level end friends  and actually I am totally enjoying my fight to get to the elementals and eventually Time. So do me a favor and do not think for me. Think and post feelings about yourself.<br />

Aspit:<br />
<br />
So with all of these in mind I propose:<br />
<br />
1. Make ND6, only for SK and Pally's,  ... 50 AA to activate, only for lvl 65 <br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;And in the name of balance warriors would have to get their HP upp'ed as well&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
2. Make LR10 , again only for SK / Paladin ... 50 AA to activate, only for lvl 65.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;And again in the name of fairness warriors would get a mitigation hike or something similar&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
3. DD spear line of spells.. increase to double, so  lets say you would have spear of Decay hitting for 1200 every time and random 2400. 24 AA, only for level 65.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;If we get this then we would probably get our HT nerfed&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
4. HT refresh time 5 min. Damage up to 10 K. 75 AA to activate, only lvl 65.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Where you around before manaburn was nerfed, high high nerf bat&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
5. Voice of Thule: aggro gain of 50 % self, 25 % when casted on warrior.. lvl 65 sk. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Instead of making the values dependent on the target, why not just make two spells, one for self and one for a target.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
6. Death Peace mana regen 200 / tic, will not eat your life. <br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;I think you mean Pact of Hate upgrade?  Hmm..., you want the Lich as well?&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
7. Permanent Fabled only for SK in sol ro: <br />
<br />
BP drops 60 AC, 20 int, 10 Dex, 200 mana, 50 endurance, 200 HP.<br />
Mag + 20, Fire + 20 cold.<br />
<br />
Vengeance 4.<br />
mana regen +3<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Why don't you get a LDoN BP and decide what augments you want to put on it instead of going in and putting in an unneed BP.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
 8. DS totally uselss at this time Make a Banshe Aura lasting 20 min, mitigation of 800. 24 AA, lvl 65.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Not going to happen&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
9. Make my hide as good as Rogues, and when I move it will still work.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;you have no clue how that works or else you wouldn't have even made that statement&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
10. Make Disarm a usable skill only to be used by SK, 200 skill. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;why?&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
11. Give me a stun spell. Ldon acquired.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Strike of Ykehsa has a stun component&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
12.   Give me a pacify for lvl 68, 50 AA.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;FD splitting still works in PoP, try it sometime you would be amazed&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
13. Summon corpse, only need bone chips to use. 24 AA.<br />
<br />
We faught tooth and nail to get the level 65 spell that works w/ stackable coffins, i'm sorry but that is unreasonable.&lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
14. More drops only for SK and pally, warriors not included with mana of 150, HP 200.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Go to allakhazam and look at some of the drops from the elemental planes, or better yet, go look at some of the magelos from SKs that are in both the elementals and time, and you will have your drops that are SK/Pally only with the HP/Mana you are wanting&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
These are only a few...<br />
<br />
I read this and just about pee my pants laughing and I hope you throw up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Truly yours:<br />

<br />
LVL 65 Sk 614 AA , Ayonae ro server.... <br />
<br />
The reason Brael said you don't know what you are asking for is simple.  You could not have put in any thought at all for what you requested without knowing that any and all of those request have no bearing at all with balance.  And you would have every class screaming foul for the simple reason that we would be given to much and every aspect of the game would be trivialized up to the point that you are at and beyond.<br />
<br />
You yourself said that you have no experience with GoD and that is what the discussion has been about.  You also stated that you have not entered elementals, but you have no clue the type of items that await you in those zones.  So I think most if not all your request are a tad bit off base because most of the discussion doesn't even apply to what you are wanting.<br />
<br />
As far as whether or not you are a viable tank, listen most people will agree that f you want to be the main tank for an encounter, you more then likely will have farmed that encounter to hell and back.  But while you learn the encounter and want to make a serious attempt at winning the encounter pre-GoD, you are going to need a warrior because of the HP/Mitigation/Defensive.  Wanting to be an MT for anything in GoD well..., I think you are asking for a bit to much.  The disc Idea is kewl and i think if it gets implemented it should be where most have said, and not made accessible unless you have gotten time flagged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The logic in this statement defies me. It basically states that warriors should be the only tanks in the game, whereas, quoted above, if a knight can tank a mob, a shaman can too.<br />
<br />
This does nothing but strengthen my stance that the knight community should not welcome input such as this and present our proposal on our own. Comments like the above don't welcome balance, yet declares a monopoly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SKs/Pallys/Warriors are the three tanking classes in EQ, point blank that is the way things are.<br />
<br />
Now, the way things are setup, a warrior is the BEST at tanking, get over yourself if you are a knight and want to be better then a warrior, that ain't happening, what we do is provide an option in a strategy so that in the likely hood something happens to the warrior tanking a mob, you have a line of warriors able to pick up the slack where the other warrior left off.<br />
<br />
All this wanting to be the same as a warrior as far as tanking ability, again I say, this ain't happening.  There is no monoply of a class, there are 3 tanking class in EQ, one is better then the other two, but the other two DO EXIST.</div></div><hr />

Frod, I personally havent tested this but from what i hear, its a bit more than just <br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=20631&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1<br />
&quot;&gt;5%&lt;/a&gt; , plus warriors already benefit from a smoother spike distribution, not to mention that warriors naturaly have more ac/hp (either through aa, nat bonus or war only gear) and can afford to gear specificly for tanking, which is fine and well but all that adds up.  Also i fail to see how the mitigation changes do not stack with defensive, but i am all ears, enlighten me :D<br />
<br />
As far as melee balancing having nothing to do with GoD, thats simple, when new content is made its tuned to the top, ie if you gona tune mob dps you tune to the warrior as the tank, since warriors tank best, so if warriors are far above and beyond all else as tanks, even in 1 group encounters then u end up with content that isolates warriors as the only tanks... this kinda leaves the other tank classes useless as we see now in GoD.<br />
<br />
And although i do realize that being on the same tank table as warriors would still probabaly not be enuf to tank ikkinz it will prevent further balancing probelms down the line.</div></div><hr />

 no one has requested this - my 'monopoly' statement was in regards to the attitude portrayed in the post I quoted. The concern being displayed by some of us is that even beyond GoD content, the tanking abilities do not scale. Its warrior only on 'raid' mobs and as previous posts have outlined, if we are a tank class, shouldn't we at least tank a raid mob half as well as a warrior, and better than monk, rogue etc? Please reffer to prior posts in this thread for discussion background.</div></div><hr />

I did not have problems tanking either, when I was in Bot and PoV, where you apparently hang out according to your Magelo profile.

Nerfing the game. Please is already nerfed. <br />
<br />
I would need more time to reply to some of the comments above but I need to jet and actually play later tonite but suffice to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
What ever it takes to make me better let it be. I will ask the high end of what my dreams are knowing I will not get it. Actually I do not have it. <br />
<br />
No I do not want a weapon with a proc that stuns. I want a spell that gives me this.<br />
<br />
Yes I want bone chips. <br />
<br />
And yes I want those goodies I said.<br />
<br />
Then that we can not tank, is not going to happen attitude. I really give a rip on what happens. I still want it and I am a paying client so as you. Whatever I want let it be, I will not put myself down for it.<br />
<br />
This game is nerfed already. If anyone thinks this is not the case then you need your head examined. I am just nerfing it my way with my wishes, and damn it if this is not the case then give the latest melee advnacements back. <br />
Getting gear has not helped the problem for SK that are falling behind similar levels / classes.<br />
<br />
Yes I want to be able to disarm, anyone carrying a weapon, and yes I have a invisibility hot key, as we are shadowknings and at this point this hot key  is a waste. That invisibility that we already have is useless. We have a disarm that is also totally useless.<br />
What I suggested is just the way I would like it to work for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think SK need to wait till you get to elemental or above to get gear. We are already falling behind.<br />
At least I am falling behind and I am working my ass to get better. <br />

<br />
<br />
If you think my ideas are stupid, so be it. Like  I give  a shit of what you believe. <br />
<br />
I only have 614 AA not 650. My opinion for two years playing this toon was/ is :  get level 65, work up to max your AA, get the gear that you can but not be totally oriented in gear. Now some people, you appear to be one, thinks that aug, gear makes it or break it and does not care about AA. I enjoy this, actually I really do. Like some peeps are questors I am an AA freak. So what?<br />
That is my choice not yours or anyone. What I like for me is my own fucking business. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well seems that by reading the post of the big boys here they are feeling like they are being runned over even  with all of their elemental/ Time gear. So at least for them gear, aug or whatever has not been a solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I am happy making myself better with AA and the gear is  my compliment. <br />
<br />
So whether you like it or not, as I said I can care shit.<br />
<br />
Your beliefs are as good as mine and seems that yours are not getting you anywere at this time but to have a bunch of warriors saying that we need to be happy to be just a secondary player. They think they own tanking and they had pissed to much in their territory that do not think any one else is allow to go there. <br />
<br />
I really do not like jails or bars. I am a free spirit and just because another one wants me to be complaisant in mediocrity does not mean I am going to accept it. I am not and will not.<br />
<br />
Have  a nice day.<br />
<br />
Ps. by the way some of the AA are so stupid I am not buying, Innate wisdom being one and SCS another, he he..<br />
Not sure I want to get pack rat either.<br />
The AA's I got I am using. Actually I have so many AA that maybe I will be my own experiement, and see how it goes when I get some real gear...Muuuhhaaaaahaaaaaa<br />

Be careful or I may suck yer blood hehehe<br />

Calling someone retard, telling someone your ideas are stupid.<br />

Is this disjointed too?<br />
<br />
Some of my suggestions may seem silly and that was the intention. Silly suggestions,  as what is going on now is a  nerf for SK's. <br />
<br />
When a cleric has a DD that hits for 1100 every time and double of that / random and my best DD hits for 600, and I am the one that is supposed to be defending the group, hmmm that is something that makes me think. <br />
<br />
A few days ago I was in the EC tunnel and was checking the monk discs. Wow, they have so many. Now I am not downplaying or saying none deserves what they got on the other hand when I see my own 4 discs of with only 3 that are any good and takes forever to use again, it keeps me wondering. Is this balance? <br />
<br />
I suppose that when balance hits your way it feels good. The other side does not feel that great. <br />
<br />
I am happy where I am. I am having fun. When the balance issue comes to my mind then these are the thoughts that come to me. <br />
<br />
But life is not balanced, it never was and never will. <br />
It is the powerful that dictates wich way is the right way, the way to balance. This game follows the same as RL, the mighty dictates. SOE dictates.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is that is not in my personality to follow the powerful. There is a rebel inside of me.<br />
<br />
Finally I do not think is that bad. Never said that. I am having fun. The sky is not falling. I just stated my opinion on the unbalanced balance.<br />
<br />
If that makes any sense. Is like the balance : when in Rome, do like the romans. he he he.<br />

I see you can not follow my thoughts. Well that happens to be your problem. At one point Window, some people believed the earth was flat. <br />

If you think you have a concern at your current level, please feel free to make a new thread.  Hijacking is not polite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frod, I personally havent tested this but from what i hear, its a bit more than just <br />
5% , plus warriors already benefit from a smoother spike distribution, not to mention that warriors naturaly have more ac/hp (either through aa, nat bonus or war only gear) and can afford to gear specificly for tanking, which is fine and well but all that adds up.<br />
<br />
In the spirit of healthy debate, let's be certain to not confuse issues here.   <br />
<br />
Issue #1:  Did the melee changes affect GoD issues?<br />
<br />
The answer is a resounding no, with a single exception, that unlinked discs makes it easier.   These would still only be defeated through defensive, and if not a single one of the melee changes made it through, we'd still be having this discussion considering the culprit is /disc defensive, which was around prior to the melee changes.<br />
<br />
Issue #2:  What benefit did the melee changes give warriors?<br />
<br />
It's limited to a straight 5% shaved off of each hit (from a rounded minimum).   No more, no less.   The 3 major areas that impacted warriors from the melee changes were... Incite, which while it's nice, isn't nearly the panacaea that it's cracked up to be, but completely acceptable as an &quot;on demand&quot; aggro generating skill which was desperately needed.  Next was the 5% mitigation &quot;bonus&quot; for warriors, which in my view was justified, although I am not real happy that knights dont' have a spread between them and non-tanks.  Third was the unlinking of discs, which was the #1 boon that warriors got.<br />
<br />
Issue #3:  Did warriors have a mitigation bonus prior to the melee changes?<br />
<br />
The answer is a little more vague.   Not strictly as defined by the 5% mitigation type (i.e. now warriors actually take hits for different numbers across the entire 1-20 line, whereas before the 20 values were identical), but there's evidence that they made a little greater use out of AC than anyone else, which you referenced in the &quot;taking hits more smoothly&quot;.  It seems to be that there's data to support the notion that warriors took less high rolls than others.   The interesting thing though is there's also data which supports the opposite view (notably, the cleric parses which show a similar mitigation spread throughout the values with identical AC).   I think that enough data exists to support the theory that warriors &quot;use(d)&quot; AC a little more effectively than others.  The difference is relatively non-dramatic though.<br />
<br />
Finally, the issue arises of &quot;warriors have more AC/HP&quot;.  The truth of this is, yes, warriors can gain about 1khp more than their knight counterparts with enough AA.   Again, I don't find this inherently problematic.   AC on the other hand isn't as cut and dried, since warriors and knights have an identical opportunity to gain AC to the same level, since the defensie skill is identical.  The only real reason you'd find AC variations would be to account for knights selecting gear to support both sides of their character development, and sacrificing AC.   Again, I don't find this all that problematic since the opportunity exists to match warrior AC, and in some cases even surpass it.   While a warrior tends to have less stats to bother themselves with, and can be less picky with gear, most gear at the levels we're referring to dont' have a whole lot of differences, and are beneficial to both warrior and knight, and are popular choices among both.  <br />
<br />
Total hitpoints are becoming less and less of a benefit, due to a couple of factors... first being the nature of the GoD healing paradigm, second because of the hard caps on complete heal.   Essentially, the warrior with 1k more hitpoints will delay the inevitable by less than a single hit by mobs of the environment that we're referring to, and those hitpoints are rarely completely refreshed any more, so it's merely delaying the inevitable.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Also i fail to see how the mitigation changes do not stack with defensive, but i am all ears, enlighten me <br />
<br />
I'll be happy to.  Prior to the melee changes, /disc defensive offerred a 50% mitigation bonus (i.e. DI value was calculated then the total was halved).   When it was turned into SPDat form and in conjunction with the 5% mitigation bonus, it was turned into a 45% mitigation disc, to keep it's relative power identical to what it was pre-changes by adding the 5% warrior &quot;bonus&quot;.<br />

<br />
As far as gear, warriors only gear does give more ac/hp than knight gear, compare raex to grimror or trydan for instance, I have no problem with this but this should be taken into consideration when comparing the classes.  I realize that time+ it isnt as clear cut war only vs knight only gear, but thats bat itemization for ya, but then again time+ warrior agro gets a bit out of hand also :D<br />
<br />
Again please understand i firmly belive warriors should be the superior tanks on raids, however i have a big problem with knights being inadequate at tanking single group encounters, no matter the circumstance.<br />
<br />
This is why for single group encounters warriors tanking can not surpass knight tanking by a large margin, this is what i was trying to illustrate.  And that is exactly why i think knight mitigation needs to be brought up, along with an addition of some sort of tanking disc.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, why are all the warriors being pussies about this? Is a watered down defensive gonna make the warriors useless? I mean seriously WTF. Wouldnt that make everyone more efficient, raid/group-wise? I would think that it would take a little stress off the warriors, but fuck, you would think that we just stole their girlfriends. When the warriors were cryin like little bitches with skinned knees, I was like, shit, give em what they need. But when we say &quot;hey, throw us a watered down defensive&quot; they cry foul, and pitch a fit. Guess what warriors, we are tanks too, you got what you want, good for you, however, that threw off the balance, cause you cried for more than what you should have got. Now, we ask for a little balance, its just that simple. Give us a mini-defensive, make us wanted such as the way you felt. I lost so much respect for the whole warrior class due the few pussies that are talkin shit cause we want balance. I got a message for you warriors, you aren't the only fuckin class asshats! I laugh at the pussies that want a spellbook in exchange for us getting a defensive. Hey pussies, what did we get when you just got all these neat little toys? DICK! So, if SoE decides they will give us a watered down defensive, guess what the pussies should get? yep, you guessed it, DICK! I will tell the pussies the same thing they said to us, you want a spellbook pussies, log out, delete the pussy, and make a fuckin knight asshat!<br />

<br />
Because defensive is useless in ikkinz 1 trials, its like using defensive on rallos in time.  It wont solve your problem, it wont give you what you want.  As for warrior vs shadow gear, i have 2 items that i feel cannot be upgraded by an item that knights cant wear.  First is the dbotw, which is obviously warrior only, and the second is my 1 elem bracer, simply because the other time bracer doesnt grant enough ac to justify the hp jump.  Other than that, hps and ac come down to the changes in naked hp and ac which have been around from day 1 minus sturdiness.<br />
Warriors have a smoother hit distribution prior to the removal of di 19 simply because we have higher defensive skills, and the law of averages takes over, it had nothing to do with the way damage is calculated like it does now.  <br />
<br />
Warrior mitigation bonus is pegged at 5% because the top of the 20 dis was removed and 1/20 is..you guessed it 5%.  So again this bonus only occurs when a warrior is not in defensive or stonewall, IE has nothing to do with this discussion, because you like to compare sks with warriors in disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I thought Kritr was kidding in his original request for what basically amount to making SKs into GODS!  I'm not sure whether I should roll over laughing now or call for some pschiatric help if those were meant to be serious requests.  I mean, some of them could be modified to be serious, but the combination of everything...holy cow!  Why not throw in an instant completel heal, 0.5 sec 10k spear nuke for 100 mana and a 5 second recast time, as well as the ability to port ourselves to any zone in the game?<br />
<br />
As for hating warriors, don't.  Warriors are fairly split over this.  The majority don't seem to want us to have defensive, even watered down, but a good 50% of them agree that we are screwed atm and that is not right.  Just because idiots like aspit insist there is no problem, despite pointing out the exact things that are the problem (the fact that certain classes are completely undesired and useless in GoD 1-group encounters, heh), doesn't mean all warriors could care less.  You, my friend, have some issues you need to sort through in your head.  Do you agree...or not?  I hope I don't send you into a tail spin just by asking the question, since you will probably agree and disagree in the same breath.<br />
<br />
I think Frod is spot-on with his assessment of pre. vs. post GoD.  I didn't know the exact changes to defensive (45% vs. 50%) and why, so thanks for that eductation.  But I was already in agreement that the melee balancing really has little to do with our current dilemma, aside from the three things Frod pointed out.  We aren't in this shit hole because of incite.  We aren't in this shit hole because of the innate 5% mitigation (in non-defensive mode) that warriors have.  We are in this situation because in GoD, defensive puts 2000 miles of difference between warriors and every other tank class.  And while that was fine on raids, it is completely unacceptable for single-group encounters.<br />
<br />
I think it really boils down to two options.  Retune GoD single-group content for 2+ groups or give us defensive in some shape or form.  The only other option is to leave it alone, and the only way I would even consider accepting that is if it was discovered that the ass bullshit that we're going through in Vxed, Tipt, and Ikkinz stops at those zones!  But we have ZERO reason to believe that will be the case.  I suspect these 1-group trials will be found all throughout GoD.</div></div><hr />

 no one has requested this - my 'monopoly' statement was in regards to the attitude portrayed in the post I quoted. The concern being displayed by some of us is that even beyond GoD content, the tanking abilities do not scale. Its warrior only on 'raid' mobs and as previous posts have outlined, if we are a tank class, shouldn't we at least tank a raid mob half as well as a warrior, and better than monk, rogue etc? Please reffer to prior posts in this thread for discussion background. <br />
<br />
Xanathol, I never said that tanking in GoD wasn't screwed up, please reread what I said and maybe you will understand that.  By what you have said in previous post you want to be able to be the MT on raid level mobs prior to GoD, and I have also said, that there is nothing wrong with that if you have farmed that mob and gotten the best equipment for that level of content which would allow you to do so, however as you have stated overgearing is not an option, so from what I have gathered you are saying this, You want to be an MT for raid level mobs regardless of the content, however if you don't have the gear equipment that will allow you to withstand the dmg the mobs is putting out, are you being realisitic to your ability to successfully tank the mobs?<br />

<br />
Yes, my magelo tells of my whereabouts when I play the game, that is fuckin beautiful.  And as I stated before, I was not referring to GoD since apparently that is the new &quot;high end&quot;.  Take a look at the Xananthol's post about wanting to tank mobs that are not at the current high end?  I mean people make a proposal for a possible disc available to only players that have reached time and you get people like Xan and Kitir w/ their panties in a bunch because they think they would be missing out on a role they think they deserve just because they picked one of the three tank classes.  Apparently you missed what I said, when I stated that in order to be able to tank encounters that are pre-GoD you would need to farm the hell out of stuff in order for that to happen.  But its okay, I'll just go back to my little cave in PoV and play nice since according to you my &quot;advise&quot; isn't warranted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again you are 100% clueless as to the ikkinz 6 man trials.  As i have previously stated defensive does virtually nothing based on the small db on the mobs here.  If you want the ideal disc for these bosses its evasive, and starting an arguement that you should have an evasive disc isnt going to help you either.<br />
<br />
Every encounter in eq has classes that are not desireable for them, its just a fact of life in everquest.  Again you dont hear rogues or monks crying about fennin (Assuming you range fight him),   You dont see enchanters crying about being useless in tier 4+ time aside from quarm to a small extent and tt/saryrn, although theres no mezzing needed.  You dont hear anyone crying about the flag mobs in pop, which in a perfect world the raid would be 1 warrior 10 clerics 1 shaman 1 ench 1 paladin 1 druid 1 monk and 50 rogues, aside from the few add encounters such as tt, saryrn, agnarr.<br />
<br />
Class expendability has been part of everquest since it has come out, you just decide to bitch about it now because you feel everyone should be empowered on every encounter in the game, and it simply isnt possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And again, you fail to see the most important difference in your examples.  Those are RAIDS.  Every class can find a role and fit in to a raid, to a certain extent.  And even if they are there to just soak up loot, they do at least get to tag along.  You love the fact that your holy trinity is required for these 1-group trials, because nobody gets to do them without you.  That means your #1 competition for loot (knights) fall further behind in many ways.  That means your #1 competition as tanks (knights) are relegated to mercy spots.  That means your #1 competition in the game (knights) are essentially eliminated by way of nerfs.<br />
<br />
And your argument that these are just a small part of GoD is equally moot, because they are a necessary part.  And the further guilds progress, the more there is to suggest that there are going to be things that everyone needs from these trials.  Just like there are things needed from the Vxed/Tipt and sewer trials to complete the Breakdown in Comm. quest, there are probably quests and maybe even key pieces that will be required from these trials.  If you look at Tipt/Vxed as an example of the way things might be, then there WILL be some trials deeper in that require everyone to get flagged, possibly in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
All I see from you, aspit, is a desire to lock on and totally dominate not only the raid tank position, but now the single group tank position.   Your belief that warriors are the only true tanks is completely wrong.  There are three tank classes.  And while warriors are supposed to be the best, they aren't supposed to be orders of magnitude better on every single encounter in the game, raid or group, than a knight.<br />
<br />
No reasonable knight has indicated ANY desire to take over your precious raid tank role.  It's too bad you can't see that and use your fear of knights suddenly becoming the preferred tank for pre-GoD content as a thin excuse for denying us the balance we need.  And answer this question:  why would any knight that can actually obtain such a proposed discipline give a rats ass about tanking pre-GoD bosses.  If you drop the tome from Ikkinz trials 2 or 3, you're talking about the very top people in the game even having a chance to get them.  Most of the guilds capable of getting that far don't even raid anything below Time and certainly not below the elemental planes.  I don't know about you, but I can't see there being much value in Brael being a better tank against the AoW in Kael than a warrior, because I can guarantee you that to his guild, the AoW and pretty much any pre-GoD boss mob outside of Time are nothing more than blips on their radar screens and fond memories.  And any Time+ warrior is still going to be the absolute hands-down preferred MT because their mitigation will still be far superior (just not orders of magnitude superior) AND they can hold aggro as well or better than most knights.  What are you worried about, that end-game knights could then effecitvely single-group the AoW as easy as a warrior and farm BoCs for phat plat?<br />
<br />
Edit:  oh, and by the way, braniac, knights should have had an evasive, or at least furious-type ability long ago.  It's totally absurd that rangers, rogues, monks, and bards get a similar type ability, but all knights get is DA/HS, which is craptacular for tanking.  I did a Tipt trial last night.  I tanked the entire way up to the final boss, including mama crag, with a charmed pet.  When we got to the final boss, guess who tanked?  Yep.  The ranger in the group, because even with THREE healers (2 clerics and a druid), we decided it would be much safer to tank with a 24 second evasive-type disc than to risk an SL chain on my sub-par ass.  Despite that this particular ranger is a good 2k+ behind me in HP and probably 500 AC behind me, he made a better tank than ME, a plate-class tank.  If you can't see the incredible problem with this, then nothing will open your eyes and you should just stfu and drive on.<br />
<br />
And if you really think defensive is such crap on Ikkinz #1, then quit using it and try to tank it with only a single healer that way.  I'm betting your chance of success drops rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

So far, I haven't seen very many knights come forward to support your claim.  All I see are warriors posting that knight-so-and-so from my guild tanked them just fine.

Edit:  You know, aspit, taking a que from Darko, I decided to go back and just let YOU defeat yourself, since that is far easier than expending energy myself.  Here's what YOU had to say:<br />
<br />
...with disc up in ikkinz i need a top cleric and a top shaman at the very least, cleric druid to be safe to tank these mobs. Do you hear my crying about how hard they hit? Thats with disc up, you are complaining that with no disc you cant tank them with that healing power..guess what neither can i. <br />
<br />
So apparently, according to YOU, the reason you can make it through these is because of your disciplines.  Now I've been told by warriors in my guild that evasive doesn't really help that much, because the mob's &quot;to hit&quot; is so damn high that they still hit you near every time.  So defensive is still very useful, because it still mitigates a good chunk.  It may not cut the damage in half, like you are accustomed to, but even 20-30% is a huge difference with mobs that can max hit at 2500.<br />
<br />
You are also saying that knights CAN tank these just fine, but again referencing this same statement above, you say that they shouldn't be able to tank them without disciplines, because neither can you.<br />
<br />
You are just full of contradictions!</div></div><hr />

I question how far along you are into the PoP content before you can call my statements assine.  You obviously have no experience or you would know that we tank half/if not better then warriors in PoP, we are used for split tanking and sometimes are even the best option to tank when it comes to an encounter(by the way, these encounters are pre-elemental), so I say again.  Why do you need a 50% defensive for content previous to GoD?  If it is to make up for the lack of skill you have, well fine but say that you want defensive cause you suck at tanking in PoP.<br />
<br />
And as far as using monks/rogues/rangers for when all the warriors die, that sounds like you need to have a conversation with your raid leader cause that is by far the stupidest thing I have ever heard of when you have knights alive and able to take aggro.</div></div><hr />

I assume all of your &quot;uber&quot; warriors waste defensive in time also?  That mindset is about as old and outdated as the Im a better tank because i have 10000 hps, even though i have 1600 ac.  The game has shifted over and over again, and at its current stage, many encounters yeild themselves to using evasive over defensive.  In fact the breakeven(not exact figure based on db ect) is 2400 max hit where over 2400 defensive parses better, under evasive parses better.  You can question it all you want but once you hit around 3k ac, the advantages of defensive are all but dead.  If you want an example of this look at my parse of terris on the warrior board evasive.  This is amob everyone bitched moaned and cried about when i argued that this mob was a primary evasive target.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule<br />

<br />
600 dps to a time god is unheard of defensive.  The attack on ikkinz mobs is a tad higher, but overall dps/max hit is a bit higher, but not enough to make defensive primary.<br />

The latter doesnt give much info as to a breakdown, but that was timmoks parse posted defensive on tt in november, still pretty much full time gear at that point.<br />
<br />
Now that you are choking on your words, how can you possibly compare 1593 dps to 601 dps?  Thats the difference between tanking rallos in time with a warrior, and tanking rallos in time with a chanter.<br />

Edit defensive parse obviously does not count rampage damage so dont bother bringing it up.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at what most people doing these trials have for AC, 2500 or so with appropriate progression not the sickening levels people like me and you are at... Defensive will cut more damage than Evasive with that type of AC, the DI/DB values of the mobs in question are also more on the DI side of things in GoD than Terris, next time I tank in Ikkinz with a Warrior I'll parse under evasive.  The other thing which you are missing is that Defensive cuts the effect of spikes guaranteed, spike damage is one of the biggest problems Knights have right now, so reducing that (btw we take way more spikes than you... you can hardly call them spikes with the way Knights take them) by a guaranteed amount is more preferable for our situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call BS, and as for my experience, I *have* experienced the encounters, vs ebaying past them. So you are telling me pre-elemental gear that you tanked the nameds during Bert or Bert himself, in teir1, better than a warrior? How about AD? RD? RtZW? All better than a warrior with the same level of gear? We're talking pre-elemental enounters, where mobs are swinging ~2k a hit.<br />
<br />
There is no skill to taking a hit - you either can or can't. Last I checked, the duck key wasn't used to avoid a swing. There was no 'block key' to twitch on a melee round. Did I miss a patch or something?! You stand there, you hold aggro, you AC tap if you can, lifetap when you think the heal may miss, attack tap ( group encoutners ), ZB, get off an FD ( if you are confident you can regain aggro when standing ) if heal is really late ( and mob won't pummel anyone else too badly ) and try to get some DPS in between the stunning you are recieving.<br />
<br />
So what are you saying? /random, or &quot;I bid 12 DKP&quot; now introduces &quot;skill&quot;? Is there some special way to loot a mob that I am missing, that adds AC &amp; HP to the item? Maybe pull an elemental drop out of the ass of a gnoll pup? Wow...no one told me about that one! Maybe we're suppose to use watchEQ or wtf that thing is...<br />
<br />
If you have tanked any of those mobs with gear that was no better than the encounter offered, show me logs. Show me screenshots. Show me you outtanking a similiar lvl of gear warrior on RZtW. Otherwise, try to keep up with the conversation, and use the bigboy voice. Bc you didn't.<br />
<br />
And now to question your experience...all warriors dead, encountering Bert your first run through, and Bert has 16% left. Knight take aggro? Yeah...they have a term for that - its called one-rounded. So what in fact does take place? You send in the ranger to taunt + snare ( to get aggro ), and then weaponshield. He has 18(?) seconds of a superman tatoo stamped on his chest. Then you send in the next, and the next. Then the monks to evade, then the rogues to repoiste. They can each last 'x' amount of time, guranteed. Knights have no gurantee, not even an offset ( aka defensive ), least not one that the mob will aggro you on ( HS / DA ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see, there are now, counting Berserkers, nine melee/hybrid classes in the game.  As far as mitigation/immunity disciplines, here is the breakdown:<br />
<br />
Monks:  Stone Stance - 12-second disc that lets them take 1/10 melee damage.  Re-use time of 3 minutes at level 60.<br />
<br />
Beastlords:  Protective Spirit - 12 second disc that lets them take 1/10 melee damage.  Re-use time of 7 minutes at level 60.<br />
<br />
Bards: Deft Dance - auto-dodges every melee attack for 15 seconds.  Re-use time of 67 minutes at level 60.<br />
<br />
Rangers: Weapon Shield - auto-parry every melee attack for 15 seconds.  Re-use time of 67 minutes at level 60.<br />
<br />
Rogues:  they actually have TWO;  Counter Attack - auto-ripostes every melee attack for 9 seconds.  Re-use time of 53 minutes at level 60; Nimble - auto-dodges every melee attack for 12 seconds.   Re-use time of 25 minutes at level 60.  I do not know if these two discs are on the same timer now.<br />
<br />
Warriors: Evasive - lowers the number of hits on the warrior for 3 minutes.  Re-use time of 7 minutes at level 60.  Defensive - 45% melee mitigation for 3 minutes.  Re-use time fo 10 minutes at level 60.  Furious - auto-ripostes every melee attack for 9 seconds.  Re-use time of 56 minutes at level 60.  Fortitude - auto-dodges every melee attack for 8 seconds.  Re-use time of 59 minutes at level 60.  That's right, you counted FOUR disciplines that warriors can use to mitigate or make them immune to damage, though I don't know how many they actually use on a day-to-day basis.<br />
<br />
Paladin: Spell Divine Aura - 20 second immunity to all forms of damage.  Re-cast time of 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
SK: Harm Shield - 18 second immunity to all forms of damage.  Re-cast time of 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, let's see.  Bards and monks get a 1/10 damage mitigation for a few seconds.  Rangers, rogues, and bards get a melee-immunity disc for a few seconds.  Warriors get all kinds of mitigation/immunity stuff to choose from.<br />
<br />
SKs and Pallies get an immunity SPELL (no disc and in fact, we have never had one, even prior to SKs getting the HS spell....talk about unbalanced back then).  The BIG difference is that every class except the SK/Pally can attack through their disciplines.  And the big thing this allows is for them to hold aggro.  HS/DA drops the knight to the very bottom of the hate list for the duration of the spell.  Yes, it is complete immunity from all forms of damage, but we can't do jack for holding aggro with it, so it has ZERO tanking value.<br />
<br />
Every other melee/hybrid class can, in a pinch, tank the nastiest of mobs for 8-15 seconds without taking any or very much damage.  Rangers are often used to position mobs using this, though rogues and bards could easily do the same job.  The point is that knights are the 2nd best tank classes, and in those same situations, we are the absolute WORST tank of all.  There's just something wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Again you are 100% clueless as to the ikkinz 6 man trials. As i have previously stated defensive does virtually nothing based on the small db on the mobs here. If you want the ideal disc for these bosses its evasive, and starting an arguement that you should have an evasive disc isnt going to help you either.<br />
<br />
It's clear to me that you have absolutely no understanding about how melee damage works in Everquest.   I had suspected a shallowness in your ability to percept how EQ works before based on your comments about group makeup and the ability or inability of less standard class group makeups to function in the Ikkinz trials provided they met certain requisites (Warrior + Cleric + additional healer).   With the above statement, all of my suspicions were confirmed in one fell swoop.  You my friend, are not qualified to accurately comment on the high level game, particularly when it comes to tanking.   You make an implied claim of knowing the difference between retardation and non-retardation when you make qualitative statements about others such as &quot;are you retarded?&quot; yet you show an uncanny ability to show that perhaps that was a question asked to ensure that conversation partners were at your level.    <br />
<br />
Defensive is THE difference between warriors and knights in these trials and it's ALL about the DI of the mobs.   I am speechless that someone who makes the claim that &quot;If you want the ideal disc for these bosses it's evasive&quot; actually levelled their own warrior to the point that they're able to function in these trials, I actually suspect that your warrior was recently purchased, or inherited, there is no way in hell that someone can not know appropriate tanking techniques, having levelled their own warrior through time, it seems a literal impossibility.<br />
<br />
Every encounter in eq has classes that are not desireable for them, its just a fact of life in everquest. Again you dont hear rogues or monks crying about fennin (Assuming you range fight him), You dont see enchanters crying about being useless in tier 4+ time aside from quarm to a small extent and tt/saryrn, although theres no mezzing needed.<br />
<br />
You miss the boat YET AGAIN, the reality about Enchanters in time, is that they have enough value throughout the adventure to justify their existence on a raid.   From p1-3, to TT/Saryrn adds to Quarm adds, to buff/babynuke duties, they have enough value that their existence is justified.   Just as rogues/monks on Fennin, warriors on Coir (who are completely unnecessary) and so on.  All of these contribute enough value to justify their existence.    Knights in GoD trials do not contribute enough to justify their existence, and THIS is problematic.<br />
<br />
<br />
[/quote] You dont hear anyone crying about the flag mobs in pop, which in a perfect world the raid would be 1 warrior 10 clerics 1 shaman 1 ench 1 paladin 1 druid 1 monk and 50 rogues, aside from the few add encounters such as tt, saryrn, agnarr.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Let's be a little more clear:<br />

Class expendability has been part of everquest since it has come out, you just decide to bitch about it now because you feel everyone should be empowered on every encounter in the game, and it simply isnt possible.<br />
<br />
If you feel the need to claim what people &quot;want&quot;, then the burden is upon you to provide evidence that this is the case, otherwise you're doing nothing other than making stuff up.<br />
<br />
/disc defensive does *absolutely nothing* to the DB part of the melee damage equation.  <br />
<br />
Can you show me a SINGLE example of where this was claimed by anyone?  Better yet, can you name me some encounters where defensive isn't beneficial?  The only reference to stupid comments about defensive and DB that I can find was in the first quote of your very post.</div></div><hr />

You want logs/parses of me tanking any of the kings during the Bert event..., okay; next time I do him they will be yours np.  But, I call BS on you man; cause apparently you have not tanked either of the zek brothers, and I guess you probably didn't even tank any of the kings during the Bert event you seem to be so in love with.  Been there, done that, and wiped my ass w/ his tunic.  Point is the shit was done, and as has been pointed out by Aress I apparently have no elemental gear and only one piece of VT gear in my magelo, but when I tanked the king i had a Narandi crown as my helm..., /shrug go figure.<br />

Which is it you want, first you say you don't want to be an MT over an equally equppied warrior, but the more and more you post the more it seems you want to be a tank who tanks the entire encounter like a warrior would, which is it?  If you want to pick up the slack when all hell breaks lose, then I say kewl; rock on Xan, but if its to try and tank at the same level as a warrior, HAHAHA; thats never going to happen man.<br />
<br />
Lastly I only ask you this Xana?  You are so bent on wanting a proposed item that is available to SKs that have only broken into time, yet you call foul and think that it should be made usuable by SKs that haven't reached that level.  In saying that you prove the point they make by not wanting to have the disc made equippable by SKs that haven't broken into time yet, because they don't need it.</div></div><hr />

In terms of the generation of aggro, I feel bad because a lot of people make a valid point that warrior aggro post time is better over time than anyone else's, yet that truth begins to trickle down to the point where it becomes myth. Warrior aggro pre-time isn't that hot still, but it's acceptable. It takes on a tremendous transformation when warriors begin to acquire PoTime gear, and the threshold becomes passed, and they are now into the &quot;very good&quot; range of aggro generation.<br />
<br />
Now, prior to time, knights DO still have an aggro jumpstart on warriors, and because of this, there exists a justification for replacing a warrior with a knight on raid level content when confronting a boss. Since on many post-velious raids, knights have plenty of additional roles to perform if the content is challenging, and since warriors really are rather unidimensional, in other words if they're not tanking, they don't really have many options, (including DPS, which a warrior cannot perform to the best of his ability due to the inability to shed unwanted aggro) the function of boss tanking should remain in the realm of the warrior. <br />
<br />
Also, because there isn't the need for this to exist prior to GoD in single group environments, where tanking really is well balanced, I simply cannot find a reason to justify the distribution of something of this magnitude prior to the content in which it's actually needed to perform your primary function in single group content.<br />
(end quote)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While it is true that Warrior taunt increases in time through the roof, it is also true that Knight durability (on a raid scale) does not really start taking off until time as well.<br />
<br />
Either way...  since the discipline being suggested is lesser than defensive in every way, there is always a reason to use a warrior over a knight.<br />
<br />
Granted, the knight's taunt may be better at one point, but then again... the warrior's extra 1000HP nakid turns out to be quite handy when the tanks we are talking about have only 8k+ buffed.<br />
<br />
We must be fair enough to compare pre-time knights to pre-time warriors.<br />
(note, ALL the knights/warriors reaching time at this point can be expected to have piles more AA than we all had our first time through time... this all by itself makes these encounters less challenging.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly...  would you use a knight instead of a warrior against the likes of Vallon in time if you are facing him for the first time with relatively no time gear?  We both know the warrior wins no problem, even with the discipline suggested (25%) for knights.<br />
<br />
In fact...  given a pre-time warrior and a pre-time knight with this discipline... is there ANY mob save Cazic or Inny that you would use a knight on instead of a warrior?  Not me... and I KNOW what to expect from these encounters...<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't remember a time post Luclin when our warriors needed any help holding aggro on raids... and they didn't have incite or augments...  We got them aggro weapons and learned to control aggro.  Since the warriors of today's pre-time guilds are going to be tougher, better aggro equipped, AND have incite;  I think its fair to say balance will finally be achieved pre-time by adding this discpine for the knights.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact remains...  this discipline cannot trivialize anything more than it is already so due to defensive and just plain expansion power bloat.<br />
<br />
Making knights raid tanks should be part of the game and as long as they are lesser by design, it should not matter when the knights get such an ability.  The ONLY requirement on the proposed discipline should be level 65.  It should be on the vendor where every other knight discipline is.  This is a long-standing balance fix much like Incite is.<br />
<br />
Time to finally undo Kunark.<br />

I broke down aggro generation of Warriors vs SK's so you can see exactly how it is.  It's too late tonight but maybe for fun I'll do it again without WA5/augs/later added taunt weapons to remove the effect of mudflation from the comparison.  Depending on those results it might actually be reasonable to add in the discipline at earlier levels although before I go through those numbers and check it to see how the gaps have changed from expansions/aa I would have to say im opposed to everyone getting it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the numbers are nice, but not the whole story...<br />
<br />
Remember that you only need enough hate to keep the mob on you...  for instance, 17000 hate is worthless when 10000 will do the job. (using distance, and special hate rules like TAUNT and AoE TAUNT)<br />
<br />
In all reality, Shadowknights need a INCREASE in their burst hate generation in the high end... (fixing the terror line, as it is currently quite pointless)<br />
<br />
That said, I don't want a mitigation discipline any earlier than level 65...  I just don't want some stupid hoops on it besides the level.<br />
<br />
I would have the book personally as quickly as anyone else here if it only dropped in Ikkinz...  I just will not accept limitations to what is supposed to be our main role that no other class has to deal with.<br />
<br />
Because the proposed discipline scales with your AA/equipment and the mob's level, you are still not going to see under-equipped knights doing anything more than slowing those 2k hitters down for a few seconds.  Truthfully, can anyone here say that an 8kHP buffed knight is going to do anything vs GoD mobs with this discipline other than suck up mana (if they were lucky)and get pounded either way?<br />
(keep in mind their AC would be low as well)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hate has diminishing returns...  HP does not...  guaranteed mitigation does not...<br />

You do only need enough hate generation to do the job.  Anything above that is just insurance and will only help in rare circumstances, such as LH aggro, overnuking, etc.  As long as a warrior has enough hate generation to lock aggro, there is nothing advantageous if a knight can out-aggro him as a tank.<br />
<br />
The problem is that &quot;sufficient aggro&quot; is a moving target that changes all the time.  For example, an undergeared (pre-Time) warrior has a hell of a time holding aggro in the Ikkinz trials.  This is largely due to the fact that clerics are having  to chain-SL him to keep him alive, because he won't survive long enough for a CH to land, at least not in a 6-man group, unless all 5 other classes were clerics.<br />
<br />
It does seem crystal clear to me that, for the most part, post-Time warriors have more than enough hate generation to kill the argument that knights would threaten their role as raid MTs.  That dog simply won't hunt anymore.  It's still debatable concerning pre-Time raiding.</div></div><hr />

That would be great - but remember, not just you tanking, but a simliar level of gear warrior, showing you tank just as well. I have tanked a couple of kings on Bert - the question isn't 'can' knights, its the comparision between us and warriors. So, what we need is logs of is you tanking the mob, and a defensive warrior tanking the same mob, while defensive, all gear and AAs being equal, where you do the job just as well. Just for the record, tanking Zeks was easy, as yes, I have tanked them as well. ;)<br />

Again, I don't ever want to take a beating as well as a warrior. I just want to do it half as well. If the shit hits the fan, if no warriors are avaiable that night, whatever. Just able to do the job half as well.<br />

1)  If you have done it, then why do you need logs..., when you say half as good as warriors what do you mean?  Did you die while tanking?  Did you get one-rounded by the king?  Were the clerics OOM from you tanking the mob?  If you answer no to any of these questions then you again prove the point that SKs don't need a defensive disc for content pre-GoD.<br />
<br />
2)  Tanking the Zeks is easy yes, but again I ask the question Did you die while tanking, did you get one-rounded by any of the zeks, were the clerics OOM after the mob was dead?  If you died from tanking either of the zeks, then I would look into how you did it and why you died instead of blaming the fact that you didn't have defensive.<br />
<br />
3)  No doubt if the shit hits the fan, and all the warriors are dead, you would make the raid aware you are tanking and need heals for the brief period of time you were tanking while a warrior was battle rezzed and got back to tanking the mob.  There are all kinds of options out there, you just have to use your head and think.<br />
<br />
4)  My question is this since I must have said it to fast for you.  Why are you wanting the defensive disc that doesn't even exist but is proposed; to be available for knights of all levels for content pre-GoD when it is not necessary.  The only reason that people are wanting the disc, is for 6-man content not to take the MT role on raids.  From all of your post however, it seems that you want to be the MT on raids which is all fine and good, and there are actually toons who are MT'in mobs like Fennin Ro and Quarm that are monks/pallys before GoD even came out.  So i'm kind of lost as to why you feel it is needed.</div></div><hr />

SK does not want to be the raids MT.  If by chance the warrior goes down it would be nice to not be one rounded like a chanter.  After all we are a tank/plate class. <br />
<br />
knight defensive expands guild/raid options.  Warrior will always be preferred.  That is what knights want.  Warrior = preferred tank, knight = viable tank, right now warrior = only tank.  SK= one rounded and waiting for rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want the disc to be just level 65 (and no other requirements) for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  Knights are &quot;out of the BOX&quot; raid capable tanks at any point past level 65, so long as they have acceptable gear.<br />
(meaning not requiring multiple quarm loots to tank a boss reasonably well - but still lesser than a warrior)<br />
<br />
2) Warriors and frankly every other class in the game does NOT require 10+ slots of the best loot in the game to even be considered reasonable at their primary role in the game.<br />
(Shadowknights are STILL tanks first and everything else second.)<br />
<br />
3) The disc as suggested does NOT have the slightlest effect on either raid or XP group balance.<br />
Warriors will STILL tank the big dogs, and the disc as suggested refreshes WAY to slowly to have any efffect on XP groups.<br />
<br />
4) It seems quite a few people have forgotten what it is like to have less than 8k HP buffed...  remember back on the day when you DIDN'T have 5 slots of quarm loot and everything else time loot?  Remember the first time you tried to just slow vallon intime down, and you were about as effective ads a tank as the enchanters? Remember when you tried to actually just survive and do some damage against Fennin?  Remember when tanking Vindi was something no knights could ever do?<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL of that is broken...  knights are supposed to be the second-best tanks in the game...  why is it whenever we try to stand with heals against something that is considered a &quot;boss&quot; mob, we get the smackdown?  Even the RANGERS can stand a mob up if they have to, and have been doing so since Kunark.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, we can tank in Time gear and with 5+ slots of Quarm gear, and 5 40HP augments, and a complete charm....  but if you think thats cool, you might want to pay attention to the fact that we tank time with ANY random class with that loot...  tanking in time (save certain mobs) has become ANYONE's role...  knights beat enchanter tanking in time by about a week...  Damn near every melee class save knights has been tanking up until now with minimal gear using disciplines SINCE KUNARK.<br />
<br />
It is time for knights to rise as tanks... by the only definition that actually seems to matter in this game...  guaranteed mitigation.<br />
<br />
Knights should have been second in line to tank every boss mob in the game after warriors...  and we have gotten by using other talents and by being inventive... it is simply time to BE the second best hands down...  Everything the knights managed to carve out for themselves they have now given to warriors on a silver platter.  Note that incite works on EVERYTHING...  there is no level limit... there are no &quot;incite immune&quot; mobs...<br />
<br />
<br />
End the madness... fix this silly monopoly.<br />
Open the gates for the second-best tanks in the game to rise to where they should have been since Kunark.  Just like the changes to Druid and Shaman heals, (remember the cleric bitching?) warriors will eventually stop whining and figure out what every knight has been telling them since Kunark.<br />

The first time we did him, we ended up taking almost the full 2 hours waiting on defensive to refresh because i was getting raped.  to top it off, at the time my mr didnt cap with veeshan so i had to have spellshield spammed on me for 2 of the last 4 grummus model knights.  Tz in tactics was fun also, dmf to kill the knockback, turn into the wall and stack buffs full, while havnig a bard in gropu crank veeshan + dispelling the debuffs/dots/slow as it lands so you can keep aggro, Btw ive owned my account from the beginning and dealt with all the issues of a lower level warrior.  I remember trying to tank in pov with a boc and sod(didnt have frenzy at the time) and watching every sk in the group pull aggro off me every god damn mob.  Aggro generation is essential for warriors at this point in the game by design.  Do you think a warrior wo high end weapons would be able to out aggro a cleric spamming holy light?<br />
     Im not sure why you are talking about getting one rounded, because theres 0 chance of you being one rouned on annihliator for example in ikkins, assuming you have over 8k hps buffed, and if you dont you dont even belong there.  And if you do want to discuss mobs that can one round you such as guardian of righteousness who is just shy of quad 4k, thats a one shot for me too ouside of disc.  Or maybe compare it to guardian of glorification who thought hed be cool this weekend and tripple 3k proc, or whatever he does on me on engage.  That didnt one shot me but it did kill me, and there are no discs that i have that can keep me from taking that 9k dd.  Of course im not complaining about making defensive cut 45% of spell damage, its just another aspect to warrior gear as im sure spellshield items are going to become more and more vital to tanking.</div></div><hr />

I cannot possibly disagree more with that statement.   I don't believe for one second that any burst mitigation improvement is necessary (save one) prior to where it's needed for survival.<br />
<br />
Knights already ARE the &quot;2nd best tanks&quot;, but I agree that it's not by enough.  I furthermore believe that the biggest issue is with the ability of every other melee based class having a burst super high mitigation disc -or- avoidance disc except knights, and I feel this is wrong.<br />
<br />
Knights don't need to nor should they be able to tank cutting edge content &quot;out of the box&quot; for hitting 65.   To claim that warriors by nature &quot;will do it&quot; is simply overoptimism.   Pre-Time, warriors still are at quite an aggro disadvantage, and there's enough disadvantage to make a serious consideration to make &quot;knight first&quot; tanking a reality, then &quot;warriors after&quot; with AE taunt.   <br />
<br />
I for instance have absolutely no issue with changing the dynamics of Harmshield/DA for knights only to allow them to generate and maintain aggro for it's duration via the casting of spells and melee attacks, as well as having the &quot;drop to the bottom&quot; of the aggro list being removed for knights, and I don't have an issue with it regardless of level, once the spell is obtained.<br />
<br />
The secondary burst mitigation discipline which I also support, I ONLY support being able to acquire in the area where it is essential, which is in GoD content.   If you think that an undergeared warrior can walk up to any mob and tank it, just because of defensive, you're sorely mistaken.   <br />
<br />
Insofar as separating knight from non-tank tanking, I also have no issue with knights having 2 spell lines to address this, since it needs to be done:<br />
<br />
Paladins:  A specific version of Yaulp that has a vie-type component in it.<br />
<br />
SK's:  A specific version of Shadow Vortex with has a vie-type component on themselves, as well as a reverse vie type component for the mob.<br />
<br />
I am completely and utterly opposed to a &quot;level 65 out of the box&quot; bonus of a burst mitigation discipline though.</div></div><hr />

Rangers have survivability extremly close to us prior to their discs that actually puts them ahead in some cases (btw I've tanked the trash of Ikkinz trials with Rangers).  A DA/HS change combined with a disc would be pretty good although maybe not entirely fair for Paladins since our invul recycles in 10 minutes and theirs is 15, although I suppose you could say its justified since that would be a rather good change to SK's for pulling and help alot with the insane number of casting mobs this expansion since there is no Stonewall aa for us.  Could you expand more on the vie type ideas?  Although I do have to mention that i would rather see more melee based upgrades since sk spellbooks are alright atm</div></div><hr />

<br />
They cant change harmshield without changing the dynamics of da in eq, for example if you dont lose aggro through it clerics wont lose aggro through it.  Although its not always a bad thing, at some point it is in fact overpowering, especially every 10 minutes.  If you want to shoot for something along these lines it should be something similar to weaponshield.  You could go with furious, but this is a pure melee only disc, and 12 +- seconds wont help you.  Possibly put in an AA thats triggered 30 second duration 1 hour refresh which grants a % change to mitigate damage x%, 3 levels for a 10 20 30% chance.  This would give you an option to help lower spikes without taking the utility away from warriors.  You will still have the spikes, but spikes are characteristic of every class in eq outside of defensive/stonewall warriors.  I honestly dont see how an ability such as this would be overpowering because you will still have spikes, but it will make tanking ikkins doable i guess.  As long as warriors get bind wound 6-8 in return its all good~</div></div><hr />

If you haVe 8k or less HP, there are kings on the Bert evet that can one-round you. Bert himself can. Hell, even on Carprin run. AD can. RD can. Also, clerics will use exponentially more mana helaing a knight versus a simliar equipped warrior in defensive. Love how you dodged providing proof though...<br />
<br />
Zeks are easy - get over it.<br />
<br />
Not even giving point 3 the respect of an answer.<br />
<br />
As for point 4, I give up - you are lacking in reading comphrehension; no sense in repeating myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am in agreement with Brik. Warriors have a defensive disc since what lvl??? I see no compelling agruments to date why knights should *not* have a 'half version'.</div></div><hr />

You need to go back to elementary school and have your 2nd grade teacher explain to you what reading comprehension is or you would have notice what i said, go back and look maybe have someone that you either play EQ with or better yet a member of your guild or hell even another SK on this board read and say where i specifically posted that nothing was needed.<br />
<br />
The point you keep trying to dodge is where it is needed.  Before GoD even came out you were huffing and puffing about wanting to tank at the same level of warriors, yet a few post ago you say you don't want to tank at the same level as warriors.  You truly have no idea what you want, you just want the game handed to you on a silver platter which isn't going to happen.<br />
<br />
I will say this again, and for the fourth time I am asking you, WHY DO YOU FEEL SKs need this Disc for content previous to GoD.<br />
<br />
All your arguments point to saying that we can get one-rounded by mobs.  Well hell Warriors of the same level can to if you have shitty clerics that don't pay attention.  If you have competant people who know wtf they are doing maybe, JUST MAYBE your ass will live through a fight.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I in no way said I would not provide proof, however I see no reason to if you yourself have done them.  By your own admission, you basically leave me free of having to provide proof that it can be done if you have yourself performed the act.  Now, if you are so worried about HOW it was done, I ask you the same questions i did before that you refused to answer, Did you die on the encounter, Were the clerics OOM.  Yeah the zeks are easy, but your example was the bertox event, and as I said before if you answer no to either of those questions then the point is proven that we don't need the disc for pre-GoD content.  And hell even if you did die, it doesn't mean you couldn't mitigate the damage, there could be a number of reasons why.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, dude get a fucking clue, you not only want to be at the same level as warriors, you want their jobs on raids; and no matter how you try not to come right out and say it, you are.</div></div><hr />

Their lack of response on this issue might be their way of trying to quell the debate.  They hope that issue might die off over time, and except for the occassional thread bumps, these issues will never surface again.  Remember the ornate leggings/BP petition? where is it now?  Remember the Fury of magic petition?  All garbage, because these things just lose steam.  I'm not saying i necesarily agree with this, in fact i /feedback this crap every week.  <br />
Over time, however, there will be a de facto acceptance of the set up.  <br />
And yes, you will need a cleric, warrior and an enchanter to succeed in a single group event.  Too bad.  Sucks.  Too bad they are busy trying to fix all these new &quot;features&quot;.</div></div><hr />

 it.<br />
 <br />
<br />
It mainly depends on guild structure and if they're a raiding guild who wants to progress fast or a casual rading guild.  Numbers play a big difference as well.  <br />
<br />
If you throw 50-60 people at SSRA, VT, and lower teir PoP. Busting ass to the elementals I could see a viable reason against every knight having access to a half defensive.  Since these guilds, due to numbers, are going to have more DPS which lightens the healing output over time while providing a need for more hate over time. They tend to have more healers which would also benefit the knight in some, but not all, situations.<br />
<br />
In a casual raiding guild like mine who does things with much smaller numbers and progresses much slower.  The warriors greater margin of safety wins out in almost all situations hands down.  There's virtually zero chance I'd tank a significant portion of progression mobs when we have four warriors over 9k buffed and one damn near at 10k.  None of which are exactly horrible at aggro either.<br />
<br />
There does need to be some kind of disc, or at worst a spell(slot issues), that can give us ample opportunity to tank in an &quot;oh shit&quot; situation for all levels though. No,  leechcurse doesn't cut it in current state. Then reserving knight defensive, if it's still needed, at the higher levels of progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's kind of the point of the whole thing.  While I'm completely sympathetic to knight issues within the context of GoD, I totally believe that within the rest of EQ, warriors should *absolutely* have dominance on tanking boss level mobs.   I'm prety unsympathetic to the notion that some guilds don't want to use warriors, since that's one of the things you do to succeed, and since MANY additional roles, particularly in the areas of offtanking were created specifically for knights pre-GoD.    Boss tanking is, simply put, warrior's domain, and prior to GoD, there shoudl be a gulf, as there has always been between warriors and knights.  <br />
<br />
My aim with supporting knight upgrades in GoD isn't to make the rest of the game easier for people to do without warriors but it's to make the game fair for knights in GoD.   Warriors should remain boss tanks, since that's their forte, it's ALL they do, and while one can name 20 reasons why skills A, B and C won't be used in specific encounters, the reality is you DO have the whole package, and you SHOULD have more breadth than depth.<br />
<br />
The area where there's TRUE brokenness is in GoD, the rest is just &quot;I wanna tank the baddies too&quot; and that's not enough justification to change the raid tanking paradigm, which has worked quite well until this point.</div></div><hr />

 this is the last time I respond to one of your posts, as you sir, are an idiot. I have pointed out time and time again where the half defensive would be needed, given numbers, while you have provided nothing. Currently, knights cannot tank a raid level mob HALF as well as a warrior. Who gives a shit if you can put a 30 cleric heal rotation on a knight and live through a fight, when it takes exponentially less clerics to heal a warrior? THAT is not balance.  More clerics on a knight heal? Yes, but not exponentially more. Read that again. Get your english teacher to quiz you on it. Understand it. I think you lack the capacity to do so, but please, do try. I have specifically stated what I want; your comprehension is not my issue.<br />
<br />
NO ONE on these boards ( in their right mind ) has requested to tank as well as warriors. You can state this all you want, believe it even, its simply not true. Look up the definition of the word HALF. Damn you are dense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously dont understand what being one rounded means.<br />
<br />
Being one rounded means that a mob can kill a full health player in one single round of attack.<br />
<br />
You go from 100% health to 0% in 0.1sec.<br />
<br />
You could have 3000 clerics spamming heals on this player and they would not save him : the maximum of damage this mob can dish out in one single round against this tank is greater than his total of hp.<br />
<br />
Warriors can avoid being one rounded because their discipline cut by a good chunk the maximum of damage a mob can deliever in one single round, the knights do not. This leads to knights being unable to tank this type of mob because they can, and are, being one rounded every now and then, and no amount of healing can change anything to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xanathol, I'm going to try to address your points in as polite and simple manner as possible.  In order to understand the problem with what you propose, we first have to examine some of the most basic issues in the game.<br />
<br />
First, we have to agree with the premise that warriors are supposed to be undisputed tanking kings, especially for RAID BOSSES.  If you disagree with this, you are in the wrong forum, because you will not find much sympathy from the vast majority of serious knights nor from ANY warrior.  That does not mean knights should not be &quot;viable&quot; tanks for raid bosses, just that warriors should always have a distinct advantage on any raid boss.<br />
<br />
Second, you have to recognize the incredible gulf that exists in aggro-generation between pre-Time (and especially pre-elemental) warriors and post-Time warriors.  The weapons warriors can get in PoTime are game-changing for them.  See Brael's logs on aggro generation to get even a small understanding of just how bad pre-Time warriors had it prior to the addition of new disciplines like Incite/Bellow.  Yes, these new abilities do help ALL warriors, but the gulf in aggro capabilities between knights and warriors was so huge to begin with that it's like trying to put out a fire with a water pistol.<br />
<br />
Third, you have to recognize that when choosing an appropriate tank for a raid boss, hit points, AC, and disciplines (surviveability) are not all that have to be factored in.  Of equal or even greater importance is for the tank to be able to hold the attention of the mob being tanked.  It does absolutely no good to have 3000 AC and 15k HP if the mob isn't beating on YOU!  Can we all agree on that?<br />
<br />
Now, in your normal pre-Time raid, warriors have always held enough of an advantage with their superior HP and mitigation abilities that it would take a knight of incredible gear to warrant a switch from a warrior to a knight tank.  To put it another way, our (knight's) superior aggro abilities were never enough to justify the incredible difference in healing it would require for us to survive a boss mob, pre-Time/elemental.  The only knights that could realistically challenge a warrior for the MT role on raids were those with gear that was way beyond what is required for the encounter itself.  In other words, for a knight to tank a mob such as the Avatar of War, he would need to be wearing all of the best gear available in all of Velious...in every slot...and maybe even some Luclin gear.  And even then, he would still require more healing than an equivalently geared warrior.<br />
<br />
The reason why a warrior's MT role CAN be threatened in such a situation is because there is a point in a guild's progression where they have an almost infinite capacity to heal.  In other words, they have enough clerics in the CH chain, and with sufficient FT and mana pools, that they can literally heal a knight almost as effectively as a defensive warrior.<br />
<br />
So, in pre-Time scenarios, giving a knight a defensive discipline closes the gap between warriors and knights surviveability enough to justify choosing a knight over a warrior for their additional aggro abilities that are WAY above a warrior's in equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
Now let's factor in PoTime and GoD.  With PoTime, warriors can actually close the gap quite a bit between knights in terms of aggro capabilities.  Furthermore, there is a point where additional aggro becomes nothing but insurance against bizaar and unusual events.  When you reach that point, you effectively kill the argument that a warrior's MT role is threatened, because they STILL surviev better and they NOW can generate sufficient aggro so as not to be a liability when MT'ing.<br />
<br />
THAT is why a defensive discipline should be limited to only people that will use it almost exclusively in GoD and other post-Time encounters.  You simply can't give it to pre-Time knights without seriously threatening the warrior's most important role, unless of course you further increase their pre-Time aggro capabilities to be even closer to a knight's.<br />
<br />
If you want to use charts to help illustrate the point, here is the way things stand pre-Time with regards to the 4 &quot;tank&quot; classes (I'm including rangers just for comparison's sake).<br />
<br />
Aggro:              &lt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt;<br />
                     W              |           R K<br />
<br />
Surviveability:     &lt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt;<br />
                     R K            |             W<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, the two scales balance each other out in the current form.  Now let's see the same for GoD:<br />
<br />
Aggro:              &lt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt;<br />
                                    |   W       R K<br />
<br />
Surviveability:     &lt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&gt;<br />
                     R K            |             W<br />

See the problem?  Warriors gain a huge boost in aggro abilities, but knights receive ZERO boost in surviveability.  This throws the whole thing out of balance, at the expense of the knight.  We no longer retain enough of an edge in aggro to be preferred in exp groups, and we are worthless in surviveability <br />
<br />
The &quot;|&quot; indicates an arbitrary level that shows the minimum level needed to be considered &quot;enough&quot; to not jeapordize the encounter.  And while I realize the above charts are far from scientific, it should illustrate the point I'm trying to make.  Pre-Time warriors often lose aggro on raid bosses, even with the best weapons.  I do not know how bad of a problem this is with post-Time warriors, but it seems as though it's substantially better with the right gear and disciplines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although you make a clear and well stated case, the conclusions are a bit off. <br />
<br />
With LDoN augs now available to any warrior that puts in the time, and the new warrior aggro disciplines, even pre-Time warriors have very solid aggro generating abilities.<br />
<br />
Post-Time they are better than knights now, certainly so in sustained aggro generation.<br />
<br />
However that is not the issue, and in my personal opinion it was a very positive change for the game and a much needed boost for warriors.<br />
<br />
The issue is simply that some one group content was designed around defensive, and the knight community, along with some warriors, feel that knights should be able to continue to tank single group encounters, given reasonable gear.<br />
<br />
The fact that, baring luck, we cannot tank these consistently is what we are trying to resolve. To me it's not a knight vs. warrior issue, but a knight vs. content issue.<br />
<br />
To fix it they can adjust the content so that a knight can tank it, or they adjust the knights. Pretty simple.<br />
<br />
Again personal opinon, but I don't feel we are that broken. What I see is a lot of people using this issue ask for extreme upgrades, which frankly are not warranted. I think that the moderate proposals for knights that have been kicked around would go a long way, and at the same time not be game altering, or place knights in the raid main-tank role (where we do not belong but situationally).<br />
<br />
The requests for upgrades pre-Ikkinz and upgrades not relevent to fixing the specific issue, do nothing but dilute the focus on the central issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) TOTALLY agreed! All gear, AAs, etc being equal ( and even somewhat unequal ) a warrior should ALWAYS take damage better than a knight and be the preferred 'raid mob tank'; I couldn't agree more! <br />
<br />
2) I won't dispute the gap of aggro generation; I do believe knights should have an advantage over warriors, but does it need to be as big as it is pre-Time? That's another topic, but point understood, and I am not against an even further enhancement to warrior aggro bonuses. ( I will admit that with the rumors surrounding the melee changes before they were in place, I was concerned about the effect, but I am pleased with the outcome, and even in support of a bigger increase for warriors ).<br />
<br />
3) Yes :)<br />
<br />
So, in pre-Time scenarios, giving a knight a defensive discipline closes the gap between warriors and knights survivability enough to justify choosing a knight over a warrior for their additional aggro abilities that are WAY above a warrior's in equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
Yes, and this is my only concern with the suggestion. Answer? I think you answered it in your post - upgrade aggro ( aka more / new aggro producing combat disc's and / or gear for the pre-Time warrior ). I can understand this concern, and as long as knights still have the edge on aggro, I'd support upgrades for the warriors to address these issues in the event of a 'half defensive' for knights.<br />
<br />
This, IMO, would be a boon for all. Knights could stand up to a mob when all warriors are dead / not available, and, for whatever reason needed, warriors could effectively add-tank in place of missing knights. Both would still be preferred in the aforementioned respective roles, but one could limitedly replace the other, without jeopardizing the event. In short, it would allow for a broader makeup of classes allowed to participate in events. Strategy is the only thing that changes, and yet its only minutely.</div></div><hr />

Question,<br />
<br />
By that statement, are you saying that you would support even more/new aggro generating disc, abilities which include the current incite/bellow disciplines in order to get a half defensive for SKs?  Is that what you are asking?<br />
<br />
You do realize that the only thing a warrior has to do is get to level 65 in order to use all these disciplines right, so warriors pre-Time are able to have the same aggro minus time equipment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rangers can still generate an obscene amount of hate.  And while ensnare was partially nerfed, both rangers and druids still use it to gain aggro.  Ranger weapons alone, which are the same as warrior weapons for the most part, can generate similar levels of hate as anger-augmented warrior weapons.  Wielding two 20ish dmg/delay weapons with native DD procs (PoEb, Ssraa come to mind), combined with Ykesha and that other DD aug from LDoN, produces a lot of hate.  A little snare here and nuke there, along with root (even when resisted) will gain them aggro if they want it.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I only included rangers for comparison's sake, since they are technically a &quot;tank&quot; - i.e. they have a taunt key.  I don't have any personal experience with post-Time warriors with lots of Time gear and augs.  My guild is pre-Time.  I do know this, however.....the better geared warriors in my guild do not have much of a problem with aggro in exp groups, thanks to the addition of incite-type abilities.  Grouping with warriors is much more pleasant for me now, because I do not have to hold back near as much.  So I can definitely buy your argument that post-Time warriors can hold aggro on par or even better than knights.  All this does is further prove that the old paradigm is dead (post-Time) and that there is absolutely no reason for post-Time knights to NOT have a form of defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in a recent Ikkinz trial we were low on warriors, so the knights were asked to step up for the adds...<br />
<br />
Hoping for the best, I readied my GoD shield (90ac 205HP) and my GoD 1H (195HP) and readied my aggro spells...  I got every buff I could get.. (10600HP 2400AC with vie/etc) and popped leechcurse just for the hell of it...<br />
<br />
I expected a tough mob...  but it was an add tanking job, so I figured with a cleric and a druid backing me I could step up.<br />
<br />
I found my add and stood up...  aggro was quick and everything started well...<br />
<br />
two-rounded... first round he rolled low with his QUAD 1900s...<br />
(I know his max due to guild chat afterwards.<br />
heals landed...Second round... splat...  with a cleric and druid in my group specifically knowing the challenges I faced.<br />
<br />
This is an ADD...  this is not the boss...  this is the traditional role that every warrior tells us we should be doing...<br />
I even lived through the dreaded first round of attacks before the heals started...<br />
<br />
I simply cannot tank it with nearly all slots time gear...<br />
(I was with my guild when we were among the first 10 guilds anywhere to enter time, and the first 10 guilds to kill quarm...  so we have been farming for a long while)<br />
<br />
I was NOT the only knight who went down so quickly...<br />
One knight had even better gear than I and went down in one round... (unlucky)<br />
<br />
The encounter requires at least 7 warriors and the knights are &quot;utility&quot;.... <br />
<br />
I WISH this was the exception and not the rule...<br />

A great deal of what is positive about knights goes AWAY when they are tanking...  spell casting is severely limited while being hit by even time bosses... even in MY gear...  slow casting by the amount that was suggested, and it will be even harder.<br />

I invite you to tank as a time-equipped knight in time...  its STILL a crap shoot...  not 30 minutes ago I was killed in less than 2 seconds by Vallon in time...</div></div><hr />

Why out of all the various group roles (or even raid) only one class can be a &quot;real&quot; tank?  Same can be said for healing, but this is not druid/shaman board.  I think the real purpose is:<br />
1) to keep the status quo<br />

Which is virtually 0 aggro.

You died because A your ac is weak, B you had bad luck and it never got slowed or rng fucked you, and C your healers werent paying attention and sucked.  Quad 1900 mobs are nothing, they are just mean before they get slowed.  Btw we use 2 warriors on every ikkinz raid and have no problem clearing the encounters, although 2 needs to be worked a bit for the boss.  And yes i can still get one shotted by vallon in time also, although its highly improbable.  So if you want to bitch about being one rounded, remember it happens to warriors also, on the same mobs it happens to you on.  We only have disc up every 7.30 if you dont count the 3 mins its up, so there is a lot of non disc time tankign those &quot;badass&quot; quad 1900 mobs.</div></div><hr />

Thought the problem you all had with aggro wasn't so much on raids because overtime Warrior aggro is locked, but in xp groups and that was the reason the disc's like incite and bellow were put in, to make you all desireable again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now with the WA/Anger augs, you all shouldn't have any problems as far as aggro(snap or overtime) is concerned I wouldn't think.  And isn't that with the majority of this has been about, giving knights a discipline for content previous to GoD where it isn't needed?</div></div><hr />

Warrior aggro is pretty good even without PoTime weapons.  There's a warrior in my guild who's equipping a Cord Hilted Spiked Driver+Anger3 and a Sceptre of Destruction+Anger3 (these are not hard weapons to obtain at all).  On the incoming of a raid target, warrior throws up Furious and solos the mob until a proc or two goes off.  Debuffers go about the business while warrior maintains aggro.  Once Furious wears off, warrior throws up defensive and tanks it without aggro problems.<br />
<br />
True, if someone wanted to be an idiot and take aggro from the warrior it would be possible (i.e. a pally chain casting cease and desist), but under normal circumstances the warrior won't lose aggro.  This is with 305 dex but no weapon affinity.<br />
<br />
Anger3 augs, Furious being on a separate timer from Defensive, AE taunt, and Incite have tremendously raised the aggro ability of warriors to the point where it really isn't a problem anymore.  The tradeoff between mitigation and aggro CLEARLY favors warriors now even pre-PoTime.<br />
<br />
And how perse do you suggest giving 1 sk an ability [like defensive] because of his point in progression, and not another?  <br />
<br />
Easy, make it a No Drop tome that drops in one of the later GoD trials.  You could also design a quest that will check against character flags.  This ensures only people deep in the progression will obtain the ability.  Some will argue that this will trivialize old content, and yes it may.  But its the exact same situation for the warrior Defensive discipline.  If old content is such a concern, they should never have added the ability.<br />
<br />
If not a Defensive-type disc, Knights should at least get a melee avoidance disc similar to weaponshield or deftdance.  How is it that rangers, bards, and rogues get this type of ability but the tanks don't?  I would argue that Pallys should get an avoidance ability (i.e Weaponshield) while SKs get an autoriposte ability (i.e. Furious) since our advantage as tanks is dealing out damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem wasnt holding aggro, it was gaining aggro in an adequate amount of time, similar to what dark does for sks, or stun for paladins.  Bellow does provide this to a certain extent, but 440 direct hate and 77 a tic for 10 tics is really a drop in the bucked over the long run.  The second problem warriors had was aggro at lower levels where eb weapons arnt available, yet knight spells are(although i really dont care about lower level war abilities)  The biggest fix to this issue was the implement and upgrade from 300 to 600 hate of anger 3 augs in ldon.  Bellow does, atmost pull aggro off a puller, assuming they dont pull with anything retarded.  For example 440 hate is enough to out aggro tash or turgurs, and is about the same as dark.</div></div><hr />

All gear, AAs, etc being equal ( and even somewhat unequal ) a warrior should ALWAYS take damage better than a knight and be the preferred 'raid mob tank' <br />
<br />
This is a sentiment I've heard often and I couldn't disagree with it more.  Warriors should never be the &quot;preferred raid mob tank&quot; for all new raid content.  So at the beginning of each expansion all the Pallys and SKs should sit on the sidelines and watch?<br />
<br />
Explain to me why two people should put in the exact same time and effort to obtain gear/AAs/everything else only to have one person become the &quot;preferred&quot; tank over the other?  That's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
What I *might* concede is that for equal gear/AAs, a warrior will have better melee mitigation.  But this is only fair if, conversely, a Knight has an advantage that makes him equally desirable as a tank.  It used to be that this advantage was aggro.  However, in the endgame, a warrior with max weapon affinity and PoTime weapons will out-mitigate and out-aggro a knight.  How is this fair???  This is not balance. <br />
<br />
If they want to make it so that at the high end a warrior can attain aggrolock, its only fair to provide gear such that Knights can match Warrior mitigation (i.e. Knight only armor that provide focus effects like shielding, defensive, furious, etc).  Or create encounters that require some Knights ability (i.e. Fearless), such that for 1/2 the encounters Knights are a superior choice to Warriors.  This way, Knights and Warriors who have put in the same amount of effort into the game can both maintain the same level of desirability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you actually go back and READ the suggestions, this was covered....several times!<br />
<br />
Brael covered it.  Frodulin covered it in his original suggestion and several times since then.  Most SKs on this board have backed having such an ability only be available to Time+ knights.  Hell, I have backed that, and I'm not even in Time yet, so I would still have some work to do before it would benefit me.<br />
<br />
As for trivializing old content, please!  I've covered this already.  First of all, someone like Brael could easily tank the Avatar of War.  I like using him because he's the hardest hitting mob in Velious and unslowable.  Brael's gear has already trivialized this mob.  So what if he has defensive.  It wouldn't change anything in terms of Brael's ability to tank this aging mob.<br />
<br />
Second of all, why in God's name would Brael give a rat's ass about tanking the AoW?  Or any pre-Time content?  His guild doesn't even acknowledge the existance of pre-Time content except when they break out their twinks for some post-raid fun.  Exactly how would this benefit him, practically speaking?  Defensive would do NOTHING for him in old-world content that he can't already do.<br />
<br />
I really can't believe the lack of analysis you display by adhering to the same dead arguments that have already been rebuttled by knights and warriors alike.<br />
<br />
As for the comment by someone about how knights should be equally viable as raid tanks on current content....please, take that elsewhere.  You're doing nothing but giving the moronic element of the warrior world something to chew on.  Knights have no business competing with warriors for raid tanks on non-trivial content.  Period!  You will not find sympathy from me on this.  If you want to MT non-trivial RAID bosses, then you should be playing a warrior.  A knight's strength on raids is utility and add-tanking.  A knight's strength in single groups is utility and TANKING.  Please do not further weaken the arguments being used to fix GoD single group encounters by insisting that knights should be competing for warrior's jobs on raids.<br />
<br />
By Frodulin:<br />
<br />
I just don't think it needs to nor should extend gamewide. I have ZERO issue with knights being completely interchangeable for group content, but that on current raid level content, there's gotta be a specific warrior advantage for boss mobs.<br />
<br />
This sums it all up for me.  Knights and Warriors should be completely interchangeable in single groups.  There should be no inherant advantage to choosing one over the other, except to fit with the needs of the specific group makeup.<br />
<br />
For raids, warriors should always retain a distinct edge on current (non-trivial) content.  It doesn't have to be a HUGE edge.  As long as the edge is enough to prevent justifying a knight MT'ing over a warrior.  That means warriors need superior mitigation AND adequate aggro.  If they have that, then an equivalently geared knight would never be chosen over a warrior unless the mob was an unusual one that was specifically geared towards a knight tank (Zek twins in Tactics, for example).</div></div><hr />

4) only post 'x' GoD trial knights get it ( which in turns means the subject for pre-GoD knight will never be addressed again )<br />
5) pre-Time knights have access to it as well.<br />
<br />
So *if* anything is done, along these ideas, we'd best get it taken care of now, bc once its in its implemented form, it'll never be looked at again ( esp since most folks are done with pre-Time content and could care less ).<br />
<br />
Chances of gaining support for knight main tank role? 0. Not bc there isn't an argument for it, I'm sure, but bc it simply won't happen. IMHO, it shouldn't, least not when an equal warrior is around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll use myself as an example, Xan.  I have 9200 HP and 1950 AC fully raid buffed (and that includes Aura of Pain).  I am pre-time.  We have 4 or 5 Blades of War in our guild (all in warriors' hands).  We have a few warriors wielding decent 1h combinations.  One has the blade from the Avatar of Earth in PoEb and that nice one from Ssra (I forget the name).  Both have inherant DD procs, and he has aug'd one with anger 3 and one with Ykesha, I think.  We have some warriors still using BoC's.<br />
<br />
Aggro isn't a huge issue with our BoW warriors except on the initial pull.  They generally hold it very well once it's established.  Same with the guy using the two uber 1h combinations.  Not so much for the ones using BoCs.  The proc on the BoC is nice, but the DPS is lower enough that other melee can quickly close the aggro gap with their various elemental weapons.<br />
<br />
The highest warrior in my guild is just over 10k buffed.  That's only a little over 800 HP ahead of me, and with only about 100 AC advantage over me.  Furthermore, I am the 3rd highest raid buffed knight in the guild.  Our highest has 600 HP on me, so he buffs to about 9800 and probably around 2050 AC with AoP.  That puts him a paltry 200-300 HP behind our absolute HIGHEST warrior.  Granted, this SK never misses a raid, but our best warriors are also very very active as well.  They are pretty much equivalently geared.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, with pre-Time gear, aggro isn't a HUGE issue normally, but it can be on occasion, especially on the initial pull, where we are most likely to lose a debuffer, slower,  or healer.  With warriors having a 50% mitigation advantage over knights when using defensive, there is not strong justification for swapping out our best knight with our best warrior for MT purposes except in those specialty encounters.<br />
<br />
However, if this same knight were to have 25% mitigation, he could probably tank all the same stuff as our best warriors, save for Reparm, Fennin, and Xegony maybe.  And, he could do so with guaranteed aggro lock.  Hell, being an SK, he could pull in many situations to increase his aggro on inc, then turn around and tank.  I can very easily see him being chosen as an MT even over our BEST warriors, and this is on current non-trivial content for my guild.  Forget what he would do to our mediocre warriors.  To me, this is just not acceptable.<br />
<br />
Now, if we had the same scenario, but our warrior had Time-quality aggro weapons, this would not be an issue.  Even with a 25% defensive mitigation, the knight would not retain enough of an aggro advantage to justify the lower mitigation and extra healing that would be required.<br />
<br />
You see the dilemma?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First is in asessing the Pre-GoD issue, second in identifying the opportunistic view, where lower end SK's, who cannot even fathom how terribly broken the tanking balance is in GoD are trying to latch on to a valid issue to usher in a &quot;me too&quot; thing and are literally doing more harm than good by causing already skeptical warriors to be extremely apprehensive about their support simply because of the ramifications described above.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Lower end Knights need it too&quot; argument is a distraction from a real and valid balance issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the most valid argument regarding pre-GoD knights not getting it is that encounters from late Luclin onwards have been specifically designed to give knights a specific raid role, and because knights are capable of performing far more tasks thatn warriors who are by nature, of insignificant value outside of boss tanking.<br />
<br />
In other words....<br />
<br />
Because a knight has more breadth, the warrior needs more depth to retain the same volume.   Balance is measure by volume.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, as I stated previously, I definitely see the problem that can arise, which again, the poster has addressed in the post on the problem; if the aggro generation by pre-Time warriors is in fact too low that that scenario would occur, then its not a matter of the proposal breaking the situation, IMO, but instead a matter of introducing further aggro abilities to the warriors along with the proposal. This would also address the depth vs breadth issue, as now the gaps between warriors and knights, in both tanking and in aggro, are closed, both could assume each other's 'raid role', and yet each is still most effective at there designated 'raid role'.<br />
<br />
On another note, I do see where this debate over the pre-GoD proposal takes something away from the backing of a post-GoD proposal, however, this is not a new argument. As mentioned elsewhere, these concerns have been brought up before, and all too often the consensus has been that of complacency...&quot;we have a raid role - don't complain!&quot; That statement really does not address if the situation is right, but is more pacifist in nature. Sure, post-GoD is a much greater problem than the imbalance pre-GoD, but if the subject is going to be mentioned / debated, there really is no better time. Quite frankly, if this became a 'voting matter', and only a post-GoD suggestion was to be implemented, I'd have to vote 'no', simply because, IMO, if its not going to be balanced in all applicable areas, there is no sense in addressing the problem at all. I always believed in &quot;if you are going to do something, do it right&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing that has to be considered is the great difference between the raid environment and the single-group environment.  In a raid encounter, there are far more &quot;roles&quot; to be fulfilled than in single-group encounter, typically.  Raids need good pullers, add-tanks, CoH, mana dumps, resist songs, spot-healing, heals for healers, hot-rezzes, and lots of other things.<br />
<br />
In most single groups, many raid roles are completely marginalized, such as CoH and add-tanking.  Pulling can usually be done by multiple classes, because the mobs are tuned for that, whereas on raids, things like lull-pulling aren't near as useful, and FD pulling becomes more handy.  On the flipside, certain roles become even more important in single groups.  For example, almost all single group encounters CENTER around tanking, slowing, and healing, with CCing coming in slightly behind.<br />
<br />
What this means is that for single-group encounters, the versatility brought to the table by many &quot;hybrid&quot; classes for raids becomes less valuable in single groups.  Yes, pallies can rez in single groups too, but in the traditional single-group encounter, pallies aren't NEEDED to rez that often, whereas on raids they rez quite frequently.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there is much more room on raids to find a role for everyone.  When you can bring 72 people to a raid, it's easy to find a spot to make a pally or SK useful.  In a single group, when a knight's utility value has already been reduced, we have to rely more on our primary ability - tanking - in order to be attractive to the group.  There simply isn't enough room in a 6-person group to fit in every utility role that exists in a raid.  And this becomes even more extreme in GoD than anywhere else.  You HAVE to have a stout tank.  You HAVE to have at least one cleric.  You pretty much HAVE to have a spot healer.  And you HAVE to have a slower.  That's 4 slots in the group taken up right there.  Of the remaining two, you have fill at least one with some DPS unless you can use a charmed pet (not possible from Koda on).  This leaves 1 slot for all the various &quot;utility&quot; roles.  Of those roles, what is more important?  Picking a pally for backup rez (2nd cleric would be more useful), an SK for mana regen (necro would be more useful), etc. etc.<br />
<br />
From what I have seen, Rangers are still desired, because TS is just so powerful against the bosses (their primary role is DPS), and WS (utility role) can be very useful for tanking in a pinch.  Rogues are still heavily desired, because they bring fantastic DPS (primary role), along with great utility for CR and scouting (secondary role).  Necros can provide great DPS, mana dump, group regen mana/health, and save a group from a wipe far better than any other class.  Monks are still fairly useful for FD pulling, because they fill the DPS role quite well too.  Bards are just all around utility kings, even though they aren't the best at everything.  I still see them suffer some in GoD though.<br />
<br />
Wizards, Pallies, SKs, and Mages seem to be hit the hardest, with Beastlords not far behind.  While Wizards and mages have great DPS, they provide very little utility value to single group settings.  Same with BLs and Mages.  But knights are even more screwed because our utility value is marginal at best and our tanking value is almost non-existent against the boss mobs, which are the whole goal of the single-group encounter.<br />
<br />
So what GoD single-groups usually look for are specialists for the primary roles of healing, tanking, and slowing, along with other classes that fill their primary roles very well while also providing good utility value at the same time.  One-dimensional non-specialist classes are pretty much screwed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because theres a specific Knight advantage on quite a few of them.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or better yet, because Post Ssra encounters were designed with specific knight oriented tasks for the most part, and since they can and do perform a FAR wider variety of raid tasks than warriors, they can perform in a multitude of different roles.   Warriors are unidimensional, they tank really really good and that's about it, bosses tend to hit really really hard so it's the right match.<br />
<br />
Now, let me ask a question another way...<br />
<br />
Aside from &quot;me tooism&quot;, what justification could you possibly give for knights &quot;needing&quot; to tank raid level boss mobs instead of warriors, aside from the knight oriented ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what I was referring to, mainly with adds and/or group heals.  SK spell lineup doesn't benefit as much in those roles however, and leaves us as subpar dps unless theres some semi reasonable mobs to offtank (where our dps advantage on Paladins is useless), but that still most likely doesn't justify a disc earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it justifies spell lineup tweaks, which is entirely reasonable, but not discs.<br />
<br />
I think that what's happenning is a lot of lower end pallies and SK's just don't realize how badly SK's and Paladins have it in GoD, so they assume that their concern over raid boss tanking is anywhere in the same ZIP code as GoD issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you comprehend the difference between 50 ac, 175 hps and 135ac 430 hps?  If you dont understand the difference you should play a different game because its retardedly huge. <br />
<br />
Second point, you have clearly never used an fb 7 shield.  Aggro isnt retardedly huge, but it is adequate for raid and 6 man encounters, and thats all it needs to be.  <br />
<br />
Incite is not an aggro booster, it is an aggro utility item.  440 hate is nothing over the fight of a battle, but at the start it is invaluable to assit in pulling aggro.  Again this is when the only person on the mobs aggro list is the puller, and probably some newbie bard who is aeing mana.  2533 ac is solid for a knight but i pull 2900 with a bard on ever mob i tank.  Again 400ish ac is a huge difference.  The biggest upgrade warriors have gotten has been anger 3.  The second biggest is utility aggro (incite line).  Remember the only role warriors play is tank, their dps is ok but not ideal by any stretch of the imagination.  Sews is shit aggro, rune 3 is nice, but the aggro from rune is virtually nonexistant anymore compared to eb.  Throw anger 3 on there its adequate, but by no means ideal.  Then again using a 2 is nice if your gear is marginal and you risk the threat of dying from excessive riposte damage, but 2 1hs or 1h and shield are ideal end game where A your gear is sufficient for error in time, and B the extra ac may be the difference between a wipe and a win in god.  Judging by your lack of magelo, i would say you are clueless about end game encounters but thats just a guess, and reinforced by your post.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for finally acknowledging the big difference between two similarly well equipped tanks.<br />

You have seen the truth, that SOE got carried away too much with warrior itemization, tables, and mitigation.  You logically agree that in the current end game there is only one viable tank.  Not three.<br />

<br />
I have to say, I completely disagree with this statement.   None of the melee upgrades had any dramatic effect on GoD, except perhaps the unlinking of discs, but even if that weren't an issue in this, we'd still be having the same discussion, because the discussion revolves around a skill that we had far prior to any melee changes.  That skill is /disc defensive, and nothing that the melee changes did made defensive any more or less effective than it was prior.<br />
<br />
I actually think that the melee changes were just about perfect in every way.   The mitigation change was completely justified, incite/BoM is weak enough that it doesn't really do any major alteration in warrior aggro.   It's time++ warriors that have the extreme aggro, not necessarily pre-time warriors.   I dont' know what you're talking about with itemization, the melee changes introduced not a single new item to EQ.    Perhaps you're referring to the +End on items, that didnt really do much, since most endurance based skills are on hardcoded timers anyhow, so endurance isn't really, nor was it ever really an issue with the canning of openings.<br />
<br />
Not that I don't identify and see the issues in GoD, I just think you're going after the wrong target.   The melee changes were fantastic, and have ushered in prior to GoD the best tanking balance EQ has ever seen.<br />
<br />
The issue is defensive, and now having seen what's happenning in Uqua with offtanking, I'm more convinced than ever that SK's and Paladins need the disc I've been referring to, cause now we're up to two &quot;former roles&quot; of knights that has been completely overtaken by warriors, group tanking and raid offtanking.</div></div><hr />

I don't think itemization or the melee changes are at all to blame for the current situation.  It does, indeed, all revolve around defensive and/or auto-riposte/dodge/parry disciplines.<br />
<br />
Warrior itemization has always given them a slight edge in HP/AC, but that is usually countered heavily by the huge availability of end-game all/all or multi-class items.  There really are very few armor pieces a warrior can use that knight can't use.  If anything, the balance has been tipped in favor of non-warrior, and especially non-tank classes.  Everyone knows how screwy things got in Velious with monks having similar HP and AC as tanks but with superior avoidance skills.  I'm glad to see that they did wise up somewhat in PoP and put restrictions on armor that make reasonable sense in most cases.  Death to all/all!</div></div><hr />

Warriors can be BETTER at it, and still have more depth.<br />
<br />
In order to have breadth, knights need to be able to fill multiple roles...<br />

Knights are designed as tanks...  what else are we supposed to do while warriors tank and knights are paper tanks?<br />
<br />
Specifically, what are SHADOWKNIGHTS supposed to do?<br />
Damage?  Provided the warrior isn't tanking, hes outdamaging us now over time...  and we are nowhere near a real DPS class.<br />
Utility? Our group buffs take up much-needed buff slots, and are usually frowned on...  our group heal is appreciated, but not really necessary.<br />
<br />
In time, many people refer to Inny and Cazic as &quot;knight tuned&quot;, but warriors are not even just mediocre tanks for them, they are just as good if not better for Inny...  Cazic is and has always been a wuss...  we beat him the first time with a warrior and tank him currently with whatever class wants to... (enchanters/etc)<br />
<br />
putting a mini-defensive in the game for ALL knights changes that without a single exception.<br />
<br />
Even low-end 65th level knights are now superior raid tanks for most situations than every other class save warriors.<br />
<br />
I think it is little more than unfounded fear that makes the warriors complain so loudly about this.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you would take an 8500HP knight with 25% mitigation over a 10k warrior with 50% mitigation? for time mobs? really?<br />
<br />
<br />
Aspit, I don't think you understand, but you are actually HELPING my point and not hurting it.  SO what you figure I need 5 or more quarm loots and how many GoD AC and HP augs before knights should qualify as tanks in GoD??<br />
<br />
I admit, I am not the best equipped knight, but my equipment DOES reflect a time knight's stats.<br />
Remember please that elemental-only equipped warriors are tanking this stuff with a great deal more success than time-equipped knights.  Thats broken and you know it, even if you will never admit it.<br />

Truly, Aspit... I wish you could see yourself through someone else's eyes.  The result would be worth paying to see.<br />

You people seem to have forgotten your roots as a hybrid.  You picked a hybrid because it allowed you to do many many things, althought not 1 thing superior to any other class.  Come 4 years later..or 1 for many people posting here apparantly, you not only want to have your many things, but also tank as well as warriors.  Sks do have utility in their group mana tap, which is the second best in the game behind necros.  Time geared knights have no problem whatsoever tanking in time, in fact the only time they should ever die on ct is from an unlucky silence, and never ever should they die to inny.  Knights dont need added mitigation on any levels.  You can argue all day long about god ect ect, but the fact is new content is not created for knights to tank.  How many new encounters would allow shaman to only heal the mt?  If you had to rely on that you would wipe every single time.  Do you see my point? new content is designed for the tank specialist which is warrior, not knights.  Do you think a warrior can tank annihliator with just a shaman healing?  I hope you said no because its the most retarded thing i could possible think of, but even if you compare a warrior being healed by a druid (second best healer) to a knight being healed by a cleric in ikkinz 1 you have an identical result.  A horrible wipe 99% of the time, unless you are extremely lucky.  Then again you dont hear druids crying because they cant solo heal a warrior vs pixxt annihliator do you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why SHOULDN'T a knight be able to be a tank pre-time?<br />
<br />
I'll tell you the primary reason Brik.  The primary reason is because warriors need boss tanking more than guilds need warriors.   Without boss tanking, warriors are obsolete and/or worthless.<br />
<br />
The two knight classes absolutely have roles to perform, lots of guilds DO use SK's for pulling, they DO use SK's for offtanking, and they DO use SK's for damage, both burst and sustained, and SK's ARE used for Rampage tanking.   This is not to say that you're perfect.  There's a lot of things that can and should be done for knights so that they feel good about their role while on raids and not tanking.   I'd LOVE to see a form of spell or high rate proc/crit damage which won't splat your ass on the pavement from aggro.   I'd like SK's when not tanking to be not marginally better if that than warriors with spells and melee, but closer to monk levels when melee and spells are combined while they're not tanking.  <br />
<br />
Paladins already have some roles, unfortunately they're being completely eroded by MGB &quot;heals&quot;.    They need something to replace their great role of group healing, which has been eroded, they also need some more powerful single target fast heals.   Again though they have a MUCH larger array, just like you do, of skills which they bring to a raid, which while it doesn't make for a really well defined role as much as a far more flexible role, and a lower chance at a &quot;glory spot&quot;, it's still a valuable role nonetheless.<br />
<br />
A warrior when not tanking is a liability to a raid in every single aspect of play.   They can offtank, as long as they have an entourage of support types providing the means to enable it, and they do respectable DPS, the problem being that they have absolutely no way of shedding unwanted aggro save death.   Warriors will tend to gear up with aggro increasing gear, and are very likely nowdays to be splatted on a raid (I get splatted a lot myself because of this).   In order for a warrior to engage in melee without drawing aggro, they tend to have to limit their melee to sub- bard levels, making their contribution nil.<br />
<br />
Warriors pre-time ALSO have a fairly substantial aggro disadvantage even with incite in the game.   I just got a Raex BP not too long ago and the difference is automatically night and day.  I can see an easy justification for knight MT's as the primary tank for mobs, followed by warriors because of this issue pre-time, and this shouldn't happen.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Why SHOULD a knight be a paper tank for every raid encounter save ones they are horribly over-powered for?<br />
<br />
Well realistically, they're not.   There are very few mobs in EQ where a knight cannot &quot;actually&quot; tank on the first shot or two.   In PoP that list is Rydda Dar, Mith Marr, MAYBE Bertox, pre-elemental, and I can't really think of any others.    They arent' &quot;paper&quot; tanks on any but those mobs (and I may have forgotten 1 or 2), and in the EPlanes, save 7 mobs, all the rest are pretty easy and in some instances have been better tanked by knights.    Remember that the first Xegony kill in EQ was done with a knight tanking, and Xeg is actually harder than most, as she has a chance to 1 round you.   When I was in Elementals, knights were able to tank from day 1, every boss in PoAir, Groihin (they tended to be Groihin RT's), Most of the ring bosses in Earth, all of the Earth B bosses except perhaps Ginto, and mezzable Rathe Councilmen, and pre-flaked Unmezzes, Warriors were pretty much considered a &quot;must have&quot; for Hydro, Krizzik, Blazzax, Magmaton (with a warrior RT), Raparm, although Raparm is a special case since it didnt' matter who tanked him, we had knights 1 tank him from 70% health no prob, Ginto, and that was about it.   <br />
<br />
Knights did ALL of the tanking during the Coir event until Coir himself and no one really tanked him anyhow.    <br />
<br />
I'm a little confused as to this lack of raid tanking roles for knights without a 25% mit disc.    While I believe strongly that it's necessary in GoD, prior to that point, there is WAY too much possibility for drastically altering the raid game to consider it in my view.<br />
<br />
(note, I have no issues with XP group tanking -comparing warriors and knight- save that we have no separation from non-tanks... this could be solved with a simple addition to both warrior and knights)<br />
<br />
I fully agree with this, and support you 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors can be BETTER at it, and still have more depth.<br />
<br />
Actually, without more width, there's really nowhere else to go, this is the catch-22 that warriors have in raid tanking.   <br />
<br />
In order to have breadth, knights need to be able to fill multiple roles...<br />
<br />
Knights are designed as tanks... what else are we supposed to do while warriors tank and knights are paper tanks?<br />
<br />
All of the examples I gave above (and there's even more in time as you know) include tanking.   P1, 2, 3 in Time knights make great tanks, in p4 we use kngihts exclusively to tank adds.  In p5 we're a little different in that we DONT use knights to tank the 2 &quot;knight&quot; mobs, but pull Cazic to the zone in, shut the door so the feared tank can't go anywhere and kill him off.  Inny we will always use a warrior tank just cause his damage while nit excruciatingly high, is consistent and fast.   Knights do clearing crap  in p5, and adds on RZ.  On quarm, knights in my guild do a LOT more than non tanking warriors since all that we do is sit in p5 till it's our turn to tank, and kngihts can sustain themselves fairly well without major help vs. the AE's.<br />
<br />
<br />
putting a mini-defensive in the game for ALL knights changes that without a single exception.<br />
<br />
What it does is give a valid reason to use knights as primary or first tanks, with warriors after, particularly pre-timefarm.   I dont' feel that this is a good thing for EQ.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you would take an 8500HP knight with 25% mitigation over a 10k warrior with 50% mitigation? for time mobs? really?<br />
<br />
No, I wouldn't but that's not where the major issues would be, it would be vs mobs leading up to there.  Throughout EP's, and early in PoP if we could've used the aggro that a knight brings to compensate for warriors' issues, we'd have done so in a heartbeat.   Warrior aggro generation is STILL an issue pre-time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still have seen nothing to persuade me that pre-Time knights need a defensive ability.  The only argument that has any merit was one that suggested pre-Time warrior aggro be tuned up another notch to compensate for knight tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
It really boils down to one big difference in these examples.  Raid vs. single group.  In a raid situation, knights have LOTS of roles to choose from.  We have plenty of use, both utility and offtanking.  We really shouldn't muddy the waters by comparing raid roles to single group roles.<br />
<br />
I have said it over and over.  In a single group, there simply is not enough room to fit in all these raid roles.  The harder the single group encounter becomes, the more you have to choose specialist classes to have a realistic chance of beating it.  That is what has happened in GoD.  The encounters were tuned around warrior defensive, and even then two healers are pretty much required.  Filling a 4th spot with a slower, this only leaves TWO spots for DPS and &quot;utility&quot;.  This is a FAR cry from a raid, where the practical limit on attendees is well over 100, until you get to Time where it drops down to a paltry 72.  Hell, even in the hedge event, there was plenty of room for a knight to play a role, even if it was NOT as MT against the final boss.<br />
<br />
When you create a raid encounter but only allow a single group to do it, you force the group to pick specialist classes MOST OF THE TIME.  Sure, you may pull it off with some jack-of-all-trades filling up a slot, but the value they bring is usually marginal at best.  There are only two ways to &quot;balance&quot; this.  Either retune the encounters for more than 6 people or give all classes the ability to perform their PRIMARY NON-RAID ROLES in that single group equally well.<br />
<br />
Imagine a bunch of single-group encounters where ONLY a shaman could slow.  Where does that leave the enchanter?  Imagine a bunch of single-group encounters where ONLY a wizard could nuke.  Where does that leave the mage?  This is single-group content.  It is NOT raid content.  My raid roles are just fine, and they have been for a very long time now.  My single group role is the thing that has taken a total nose dive in a few short weeks.  It is nothing even remotely comparable to the slow descent that warrior aggro took over several expansions.  Basically, we woke up one day and found the WARRIOR part of us had been almost completely wiped out, leaving only a ghetto necro/monk.  Last I checked, we have TWO parent classes, not one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling stacks worse than tanking because while each only have 1 person performing the role on a specific mob at a time, a puller can handle a cluster of mobs at a time and when you die you don't need a new puller within seconds with tanks you do, and that can justify having additional ones around, with pulling this justification isn't present.  I pull for my guild and have since we started doing LDoN raids although I really don't know why since in every raid I've encounted so far (as well as group) in 99% of all cases an Enchanter or Cleric makes a better puller, not to mention a Monk, Rogue, Bard, Ranger, or any halfling (sneak pulling=bs).<br />
<br />
Knight offtanking value has declined sharply, you yourself have even said that Warriors are now taking these roles, and this is unfortunate since one of a Knights strengths is our ability to heal ourselves and tank mobs with lesser healing support (which I could see a definate value in with the number limited content trend).  With the way it stands now, I would rather see a Warrior offtank Uqua than a Knight, this applies to most other encounters with offtanking as well even non GoD ones, for an example my guild has killed Saryrn 38 times since entering Time, for 37 of those 38 attempts I have tanked the adds since well... one of the larger Knight strengths (and perhaps the only melee oriented one) is offtanking with lesser resource dedication, or atleast this is what I've been lead to believe.  Well, one of these recent times I had a Warrior with gear far inferior to my own tank an add in place of me (without a disc even) and he required less healing power than me that says alot for our declining desireability.  While this has been focusing on GoD mainly that semi recent expierence really opened up my eyes and made me notice that in atleast one area its actually prior to the point being talked about where Knight raid roles are being eroded.<br />
<br />
SK sustained damage sucks and always has, never in our classes history have we outdamaged even Warriors when clearing lots of mobs over a moderate-long period of time.  Our burst damage is highly dubious now as well when compared to other classes, SK's are one of the few (only?) classes to recieve no meaningful upgrades with GoD.  Our spells are not upgrades and neither are our aa's.  For some examples:  Ancient: Bite of Chaos is actually a downgrade of the regular version, and while both can be memmed at once a downgrade is not worth an additional spell slot.  Our new DD is a MAXIMUM of a 1.32 dps increase for 10% more mana useage but with the resistances of this line the actually dps increase is actually only about half of that, meaning a dps increase of 0.66 which is nothing (btw this line is less mana efficent than lifetaps and is meant to be our dd line).  Our lifetap proc is an additional 225 hp/minute which comes down to another 3.75 dps mitigated through taps, unfortunatley lifetap procs have been useless as a healing source for us since Luclin due to mob dps increaes.  Finally while our mana proc is easily the best spell we got in GoD it also completly misses the mark of an upgrade for us, its value is in the 1 hour duration vs 20 minute duration, the additional mana gain is nothing due to the nature of our other spells.  To add to that the only aa which constitutes as a meaningfull power gain is Swift Journey which is something all classes recieved.<br />
<br />
Returning to the raid tanking issue for a moment since Rampage was mentioned, SK's are not a good choice in this situation either because of one simple fact, Clerics/Paladins are capable of procing invul and the Rampage list makes no distinction between invul being on or off when finding the target, which puts SK's again at a disadvantage since a smart Paladin/Cleric is going to flat out avoid 70% of rampages with those procs.<br />
<br />
If you weren't aware of it Knights now are requiring just as much or in many cases MORE support to offtank successfully now, and I have quite a bit of expierence with that as we offtank everything in raids and typically have 2-4 mobs in camp any time pulls are coming in.  All tanked by Warriors, free Warriors watch for additional mobs, dead Warriors, or a mob that gets free.  Knights CAN do this but not to any reasonable degree right now considering the alternative, and unfortunatley it was a role better filled by Knights until a couple of months ago.  This problem is not from discs alone however as you can only be disced 30% of the time at most, and its safe to say you're tanking more than 30% of the time.<br />
<br />
It's true that Warriors have high aggro with no aggro control but with the right tactics such as the ones just now mentioned this is fully avoided and provides an additional level of saftey for the camp.  The other option for low aggro melee is to use non aggro weapons but usually there aren't enough of these to go around for Warriors who have their eyes on more useful gear, although I would imagine most non DKP system Warriors to have a Cudgel of Wrecking and depending on your level of Ikkinz farming a Jagged Onyx Staff soon if not already (assuming they've been in GoD since release) and those are capable of doing higher dps at a lower level of aggro.</div></div><hr />

i.e. great aggro management and survivability with limited backup.<br />
The moment SoE tuned warriors to become equal for groups they effectively gave them the offtank role, too.<br />
<br />
It's actually worse since in most raid environments you usually have extra resources to keep your warriors alife. The &quot;survivability&quot; aspect does not make much of a difference in <br />
raids. Overall our lifetaps (or selfheals) will be inferior to an offtank-warrior who gets a shaman or druid grouped to heal him on raids.<br />
<br />
The reason a Knight was picked to kill Xegony was a significant advantage in aggro at that time. Raids had the choice between aggro and mitigation in their MA. <br />
With enough Clerics you could choose aggro.<br />
If you do it nowadays it's not because a tactical option but because &quot;you can&quot;. Same as having druids or chanters tank for fun. It's a fun thing, not a serious tactical choice during your guild's progression.<br />
 <br />
Warrior aggro is as good as knight's aggro for all practical purposes nowadays. <br />
However, Knight mitigation did not change since.<br />
<br />
Looks like after the &quot;balancing&quot;, Warriors maintained their &quot;boss monopoly&quot;, became equal in groups and are superior offtanks now. /shrug<br />

<br />
I dont' necessarily disagree with your issues, and especially in Uqua, knight offtanking took a pretty major hit.   The problem I see is this though... I don't think that with those issues you raised that the solution is to give knights a disc where they don't actually need it, which does have potential to impact the entire role of raid boss tanking, particularly the first tank spot (I'd concede that one cannot justify using a knight as #2-# whatever in the tank order because of AE taunt).    Those issues shoudl be addressed as serious knight issues, and not by slapping on something that again, isn't &quot;needed&quot; before that time, just desired, and also that has the potential to change game dynamics in warriors' most important role in EQ.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, while I agree that it's possible to utilize some lower aggro weapons (I actually use a DoD from p3 in this regard), there's also some additional issues with it.   If for some reason it becomes my turn to tank, and I'm holding a DoD + Cudgel, and have taken off my Raex BP and clicked off my Symbol, and turn off Pestilence shock, the raid is in deep deep deep doo doo.   I won't take that risk unless I'm dead last in tanking and cannot see being used at all.<br />
<br />
That's fairly rare, and I don't think it's real appropriate to make me get half naked and have to not utilize the tools I've been provided with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanathol</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah this thread is so long now...<br />
One thing I would like to ask, particularly to Frodlin, is something I posted elsewhere as such:<br />
<br />
At the moment, Warrior Defensive reads as:<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 45% <br />
2:  Decrease Damage Modifier by 55% <br />
3:  Chance to Critical Hit(0) <br />
<br />
The only concern I have heard that really brought a valid argument to the table over a knight 'half' defensive, especially pre-GoD / Time, was knight's aggro abilities. It would be quite possible that with the suggestions being made that a knight would be preferred over a warrior in certain encounters as the half-defensive combined with knight aggro, esp pre-Time, would give knights an overwhelming benefit. Well, knights get aggro from spells. So, what if the suggestion read as such:<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 30% <br />
2:  Increase Spell Casting Time Modifier by 55% <br />
3:  Chance to Critical Hit with a Spell(0) <br />
4:  Chance to Exceptional Heal(0)<br />
<br />
There is not much point in lowering knight's melee abilities, as knight melee is already below warriors, therefore, the focus on spell casting. This would slow knight casting, therefore lowering aggro abilites, much as lowering damage for a warrior lowers aggro abilities. Some may think 55% is not a big enough hit, but take into consideration that warrior aggro is more about effects, procs, and now things such as incite, and the two in comparision don't look that far apart. Also, SKs couldn't crit on HT while 'defensive' and pallies couldn't exceptionally heal themselves while 'defensive'.<br />
<br />
This suggestion may need adjusting, but all in all, I think it would allow for warriors to still be prefferred on 'big mobs' while giving knights a fighting chance to perform their primary role of tanking when warriors are not present, for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

I still don't think a disc is necessary any earlier Frodlin however I do think that Knights (SK's espically) are in dire need of some spell adjustments also, of course the chance of that happening if we're getting a tanking disc which we won't be (of that I'm certain) is non existant. I was just pointing out that Knight roles are now disappearing in many other areas of the game as well.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I saw the Fan Faire announcement and while so many warriors were fighting tooth and nail to keep knights from sharing in burst mitigation once they attain a certain level, an undefendable position, that they are gonna end up REALLY hurting warriors with these lame &quot;Girlie versions&quot; of trials.<br />
<br />
I happen to think that knights overall need some help in the raid role department, and this won't be adequately addressed by sticking them in the long line to tank the bosses, I also don't think that one needs to go &quot;Well you need 2 things... help on raid roles and burst mitigation, but we can only do one&quot;.   If you have 10 needs, then you should have 10 needs addressed, if you have 1 need, then you should have 1 need addressed.   I don't think it's unreasonable to go &quot;Sk's need something of value that they and ONLY they bring to a raid party, as do Paladins&quot;.   Then following up with that going &quot;Also knights need to be able to survive tanking encounters where their primary role is to tank&quot; such as Ikk trials, Kod named and Uqua offtanking (and whatever else is in store), and addressing both issues. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, now we've got the grown up roller coaster vs. Bugs Bunny World roller coaster versions.... and I do't know what's gonna happen in Uqua and KT named and beyond.    The problem with addressing specific content is if every time you hit certain content this raging debate comes up and it takes forever to make a &quot;Bosssnake&quot; version of it, then it's creating far more work than needs to be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like you I despise the idea of the Knight fix they proposed, it not only won't scale to raid mobs, but it's really just not fair with the way its being implemented, makes no sense in the mechanics and applies to areas that they deem appropriate only, which I'm fairly sure differ from what players feel the problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aress</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, just like our aggro spell line...at least they admitted now that they cannot fix it.<br />
<br />
This trial idea is a stepmom's bandaid to a (seemingly) crying child.  &quot;this will keep them going until we have finished The zones after Uqua in July&quot;</div></div><hr />
