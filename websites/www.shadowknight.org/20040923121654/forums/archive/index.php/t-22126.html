Not currently to the point where I'm raiding or killing mobs that fear, so going to wait a bit on fearless.  Generally I was thinking that none of these are all that much better than another, so do them slowly and work on the lowest cost first, or the most interesting among equal cost aa's.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Before I read Dhantes post, I was going to say:<br />
<br />
1) Max Channeling Focus<br />
2) Max Mental Clarity<br />
3) Max Weapon Affinity. (still broken, but better than the rest of our GoD AA's)<br />
<br />
EDIT: With zoning pets, I would really consider Pet Affinity in there somewhere. Especially before Weapon Affinity if you plan on using KGM for awhile. Maybe even before Mental Clarity. Especially if you group with a bard very often. Pet Affinity is definitely the biggest powergain if you group with bards.</div></div><hr />

It's currently got a 75 dd cold aug proc on it cause it's cheap.  Planning on a 150 dd cold proc aug soon as I get a few more points from LDON -- about 4 or 5 more adventures or a couple hard adventures.  With rune 3 &amp; 150 dd, weapon affinity sounds good.<br />

I'm gonna do mental clarity 2 and 3 next for sure I think.  Still not quite sure after that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given what's left, I'd prolly say Weapon Affinity.<br />
<br />
Mind and Body Rejuvenation in itself is cheap but both the prerequisites (Mental Clarity 3 and Natural Healing 3) aren't there yet; so that makes it a long road in comparison to WA.<br />
<br />
I notice you left out Leech Touch (both from the 'done' list, and the 'to-do' list).  While I realize that this skill is frowned upon by most (and I agree it's not one to get early when there are so much better things to spend points on), and that a 900 point dd/heal will hardly have an impact on your hp bar -- with the PoP aa's you can get that to 1500 and with GoD aa's, to 1900.  The GoD extensions are not as cost effective as the PoP ones (so it seems with most GoD aa's) so if you go this route, stop after the PoP ones and re-assess.<br />
<br />
I've used it enough times that I can say it's saved me from late CH or while healers recover from AE fear, etc.  Combine these with Touch of the Wicked later and it becomes a nice overall package IMO.  At the very least I think I would consider it before, say -- Critical Affliction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm... to me critical affliction is more dps.  My friend's shaman has it, and it's nice to see bane crit for 1k+ per tick.. naturallly we coudl expect no more than 320 per tick or so from a crit on blood of hate.. but with new dots coming out in OoW, crit affliction might be worth getting at some point.  Just to kill stuff faster, if nothing else.  I do tend to use dots a decent amount.   And yeah the prerequisites for body &amp; mind rejuv stink.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love pet affinity.  I realize its cost is higher than its worth, but around 250aa I just couldn't find any AAs that were more enticing.<br />
<br />
Pet affinity does two things for me: first, it saves a spell slot when I have a pet up, because I don't have to mem AoD.  Pet gets hasted with the group.  Second, the pet stays alive a lot more - he is pretty much guaranteed to have some sort of hp buffs and regen at all times, and he gets healed 200hp every minute with ZB.  He used to slowly wear down on mob DSs and occasional ripostes, but now he routinely stays alive until I need to invis.  Also, I can use the extra spell slot for more DPS myself.<br />
<br />
With the change to allow pets to zone, this AA becomes a must-have.  He gets full buffs before LDoN adventures and GoD expeditions, or on a raid.  Combined with pet hold, I can pretty much have a fully-buffed pet up at all times now.  That's like a 20% increase to my DPS in situations where my pet couldn't stay alive previously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, the argument for pet affinity on LDoN and GoD adventures now that pets can zone could be the complete opposite and a far cry from a must have.  If you can get a pet up and buff it outside before you enter, then who cares if the buffer has to load up a single target spell and expend the additional mana since you can med up before enterring.  If not everyone has pet affinity then the single target buffs will have to be loaded up for someone in the group anyway.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a bard all the time, pet affinity is more about convenience then necessity.  It has it's convenient uses but I see a lot of AA with more value for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pet Affinity is one of those AA's that after you get it, you wondered why you didn't get it first. The fact that Aura of Hate, both Zevfeers, and bard songs hit the pet, alone make it one of the best AA we got in Gates.</div></div><hr />

Touch of the Wicked 2, 3<br />
Critical Affliciton 1, 2, 3<br />
Pet Affinity<br />
Weapon Affinity 4, 5<br />
Channeling Focus 1, 2, 3<br />
<br />
I'm thinking with intense hatred that it's more damage thus easier to hold aggro, and that it's good for pvp especially vs pets or dual wield classes.  And that it's a permanent additon to my dps that can't be dispelled and functions even when OOM or disarmed. :)<br />
<br />
With touch of the wicked, I'm thinking that with the harmtouch nerf to 40% max damage in pvp, that the harmtouch itself without the disc will pretty much always hit for 40%, so that this would just reduce the total time between when I can do that 40% pvp damage, since the disc isn't as big of a factor in using my harmtouch.<br />
<br />
With critical affliction, I tend to use DOT's a lot when I duo mobs for exp or quests or when I pvp, and more damage from dots would help with aggro and killing stuff faster.  I'm considering saving up 30 aa's for OoW expansion, and if the AA's in OoW stink, just getting Crit Affliciton 3 all in one go.<br />
<br />
With pet affinity, it's a lot of aa's, but I've got pet hold and I typically use a fully shaman buffed pet when I exp (box a friend's shaman for exp), so that might make a lot of sense to have zevfeer's and radiant cure and aura of hate hitting the pet.<br />
<br />
With a weapon that procs rune 3, having weapon affinity maxed will actually help my ability to tank mobs.  If I swap out my 150 dd for a 75 lifetap, it could help me tank mobs even more.  I'm thinking once I camp a Plankton Laced Greatsword, I would stick the 150 cold dd on the Plankton and then do LDON's to get a 75 lifetap to put on the Stone Etched War Sword.  Meaning weapon affinity 4 and 5 would help significantly in my ability to tank mobs (due to rune and lifetap proc'ing more) and my ability to pvp (due to 150 dd proc'ing more).<br />
<br />
With channeling focus, I haven't really had all that many problems with my spells getting interrupted -- probably largely (no pun intended) because I'm an ogre and immune to stun from melee blows from the front -- meaning it's nowhere near as big of an issue for me as it is for other races... but I hear a lot of good things about CF, so I'm considering it as well.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Out of those I would do all the channeling focus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Channeling Focus3, Pet Affinity, Weapon Affinity 5<br />
<br />
CF3, you can still be stunned from non frontal blows (like you are surrounded, ya know tanking 4 PoV mobs at once)<br />
<br />
PA, now that pets can zone this AA is even more amazing. I had the same pet for 12 hours once.<br />
<br />
WA5, might as well finish it off, it can't hurt anything.<br />
<br />
I have 23 AA's saved (354ish AA's)... I have no idea what to buy ;P finishing blow and fear resistance are starting to look good...<br />
<br />
I like your new sig ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Vici, You should really look at Touch of the wicked. At max level you can HT for 5k, 9k, 5k, 9k every half hour. Definitely worth the AA's. Also it makes Leech touch much more appealing since you have HT available more to use it with. And leech Touch gets a bit too much of a bad wrap. It is over priced, and it will not save you that often, but it will save your butt occasionally. So I would definitely consider those 2 lines before fearless and finishing blow. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Senatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ah yes -- I didn't think of the OoW dot's.

<br />
Sounds like you havent solo'd very much. I got CA and I solo about 30% of the time, most of the time w/ lfg flag up or just really really really bored, and it helps me out a bit not as much as I would like but eh it cuts down the time it takes me to kill a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Make Channeling Focus3 and Pet Affinity priorities.  You'll be glad you have them both.  <br />
<br />
WA5 is a much better AA than many people make it out to be as long as you have a decent weapon proc.  With your SEWS, you'll probably have a decent weapon proc from now on out unless something changes with OoW.  I'd make that third.  <br />
<br />
Crit afflicition is decent with no downside; you say you do make use of dots, so that would be logical to follow.  <br />
<br />
Double Ripost 1 isn't bad for the points either - it's just that the cost:power scales so abysmally that makes it worthless, and it's not good enough to really be worth it in spite of that like WA is.  I wouldn't go past the first level, but for 3 points, it's not a bad purchase.  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to comment on the PvP value of TotW, but it adds less than 1.5DPS if you use HT every time it pops... not hugely valuable.  Like Leech Touch, it has it's uses, and is worth having, but even now I wouldn't make it a priority, at least in terms of PvE.  Both TotW and Leech Touch/Consumption of the Soul will be worth getting, but I wouldn't put them over Channeling Focus, Pet Affinity, or Weapon Affinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I guess I'm just surprised to see channeling focus rated so high.  I get interrupted very little now -- maybe once every ten minutes? -- and to reduce that by 15% at level three of channeling focus means that roughly once an hour I'll have a spell not interrupted that would otherwise be interrupted.  To me it seems like 12 aa spent for something that I won't even notice.  What am I missing that makes this skill worth having?  Do non-ogres get interrupted all the time or something?<br />
<br />
I just bought Touch of the Wicked 2 for 4 aa's.  I have almost 2 unspent again.  Basically with harmtouch being capped at 40% of a person's max hp, don't need the disc for pvp for it to do it's max, meaning whenever it's available it's good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Being an ogre would certainly help, but the majority of interrupts aren't from stuns, and that's your only advantage over non-ogres... as much as I, and people I know/talk to, get interrupted, I can't imagine that your 1 interrupt/15mins claim is even remotely close to accurate, especially if you're doing any GoD content and such... I'm not going to believe that one without a parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll pay more attention to interrupts next time I fight and count how many it is.  Perhaps it's much more significant than I realized.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok Slein, I parsed my logs from July 11th through August 19th.  <br />
<br />
A little over a month, roughly five and a half weeks.  During that time, I had spells interrupted 989 times.  A lot more than I figured hehe.  Flinty Cragbeasts seemed to interrupt me a lot, and also aoe factioning gave me a bunch of interrupts, as did fighting underwater.  Not sure if channeling focus would help with that or not.. but it couldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Assuming that every single interrupt would be affected by channeling focus, that means this many fewer interrupts per 40 days:<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus 1 : 45 fewer (5%)<br />
Channeling Focus 2 : 91 fewer (10%)<br />
Channeling Focus 3 :136 fewer (15%)<br />
<br />
Roughly one less interrupt a day per level of Channeling Focus.  At max level, 3 fewer interrupts per day, give or take.<br />
<br />
At the start of the log:<br />
<br />
[Sun Jul 11 21:21:15 2004] Total time playing Bolas: 307 days, 15 hours, and 59 minutes<br />
<br />
At the end of the log:<br />
<br />
[Thu Aug 19 10:39:16 2004] Total time playing Bolas: 317 days, 20 hours, and 20 minutes<br />
<br />
That means roughly 10 days 5 hours played over the course of the log.  Or 245 hours played.  Meaning that I play on average about 6.125 hours per day.<br />
<br />
Meaning that I'd get this many fewer interrupts per hour:<br />
<br />
Channeling Focus 1 : 0.184 fewer<br />
Channeling Focus 2 : 0.371 fewer<br />
Channeling Focus 3 : 0.555 fewer<br />
<br />
That means for twelve AA's, I could get something that roughly every other hour that I play would mean one spell less was interrupted.  Doesn't seem like a bargain to me for twelve aa's.  Not when I can get things that will make a measureable difference in my dps still, like Critical Affliction, Weapon Affinity, Intense Hatred, and maybe even Double Riposte or Touch of the Wicked 3.<br />
<br />
Granted I wasn't hunting non-stop those days I play... but then that's a long enough log to be a good indication of what I do with my time -- sometimes quest, sometimes hunt, sometimes raid, whatever.<br />
<br />
Furthermore.. that one interrupt every other hour that it saves at level 3... would that make a difference in if I live or not?  Maybe one in ten, it might save me from disaster.  Maybe less.  Meaning once or twice a week it would save me from serious problems.  That might be worth it.. but perhaps other things might be a better buy at the moment.  Might get level 1 just cause it's cheap heh.  But level 3 seems overpriced for what you get.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Oh and 989 interrupts every 245 hours = 4.037 interrupts per hour... roughly one every 15 minutes played.

Looks like my &quot;1 per 15 min&quot; estimate wasn't too far off... it's probably more like 1 per 10 min during combat.<br />

Flinty Cragbeasts (and Umbiki) proc &quot;Crag Jaws&quot;, a ~260-270 DD (depending on mob level) plus a 0.0 sec stun.<br />

<br />
And yes, I probably need to look at just the combat portion of the logs.  But... if I'm fighting 1/2 the time, it's still only one less interrupt per hour.  I'm tanking 95% of the time that I'm playing, and I don't think I've been on any raids in the last month due to a guild merger etc.  So the time I'm fighting, I&quot;m tanking.  The MOST it will get me is 3 less interrupts per day, since that's the most I'm tanking and getting interrupted.  Not too big of a deal, IMHO.  I'll probably skip channeling focus until I've done another 100 aa's or so -- think I'll focus on the ones that give more DPS for now, and just re-cast spells if they are interrupted.  Might get level 1 to try it out and see if I can tell a difference or not though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You can't parse a combat skill over time online...and you can't parse interrupts while raiding when you are not the MA and getting hit with anything.  That is like dividing your total damage over 40 days and saying your DPS is 0.008....or proving that proc rate is in fact 0.00003 per minute because you didvided your procs by 40 days.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to get it don't get it....but unless you only parsed in GoD and LDoN adventrues where you were always tanking or always pulling you won't appreciate how often you get interrupted.<br />
<br />
I've gotta agree... the &quot;info&quot; you (bolas) provided was extremely subjective/statistically bias/unreliable/whatever.  <br />
<br />
A statistic that would actually be valuable would be the % of casts interrupted while tanking.  Cut the &quot;over the course of my playtime&quot; crap; all it does is render the parse useless.  It's like the ebay kids who think their DPS is the same as their max critical hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sorry slein, just tried to do a quick &amp; dirty count of how many interrupts I got over the course of my most recent log.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">the 5, 10, 15% is additive, not multiplicative.<br />
<br />
with channeling focus 2 over a couple normal LDoNs with unslowed mobs, tanking 2ish at a time:<br />
<br />
458 cast attempts<br />
15 fizzles<br />
34 interrupts<br />
185 channels<br />
<br />
so that's channeling successfully 84% of chanced interrupts.<br />
<br />
channeling focus 2, normal tanking in pov inner for a long time, slowed mobs, tanking 2-3 at a time occasionally:<br />
2176 cast attempts<br />
63 fizzles<br />
128 interrupts<br />
573 channels<br />
<br />
that's 82% channeling successfully<br />
<br />
CF2, 4 normal LDoNs with shaman slowed mobs:<br />
<br />
344+260+264+230 = 1098 cast attempts<br />
14+19+10+17 = 60 interrupts<br />
76+78+86+71 = 321 channels<br />
<br />
that's 84% channeling successfully<br />
<br />
<br />
so with CF2 i'm getting about an 84% success rate on channeling<br />
<br />
now for some older logs:<br />
<br />
channeling focus 0: normal ldon bard slowed<br />
<br />
329+309+306+214 = 1158 cast attempts<br />
32+21+26+13 = 92  interrupts<br />
78+64+76+56 = 274 channels<br />
<br />
which is about 75% successfully channeled, which i'd guess is the baseline. i checked some other more general logs as well and they were all around 75%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
over all of these logs, about 35% of the spells i cast while tanking in general fighting had a chance to be interrupted or a chance to be recovered from.<br />
<br />
the base recovery rate without channeling focus appears to be 75%. channeling focus can increase this to 90%. overall that means base interrupt rate for me over all casts without channeling focus is about 8.75%, with channeling focus 3 it should be about 3.5%.<br />
<br />
on content harder than LDoNs (with faster hitting mobs) channeling focus importance increases... just doing normal LDoN with multiple unslowed mobs, channeling was checked on closer to half of all spells cast, meaning base there'd be 12.5% chance to be interrupted on every cast, and with CF3 it should be 5%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">AHA!!<br />
<br />
I was misunderstanding the description of channeling focus entirely.<br />
<br />
If I cast 75% successful, get CF1.. that means I cast 5% more spells successfully.. not get 5% fewer interruppted spells.  The description they have is confusing.<br />
<br />
So if I go from 75% successful to 80% successful to 85% successful to 90% successful... then channeling focus ROCKS bigtime.<br />
<br />
That explanation makes a bunch more sense to me.  It's not 5% less interrupts, it's 5% more spells channeled.<br />
