<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaelmar_Shadowsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">w00t! I'm a new user to this board, obviously...been playing EQ for a couple of months, and I am still a bit of a n00b.  I chose a Dark Elf Shadow Knight as my first character, and he's pretty spiffy, I think.  I am looking for a good solo spot for him (currently at level 28).  If anyone has any ideas, please share em.  I'm rather fed up with trying to find zones to exp in, only to get whomped by something that cons light/dark blue.  Most of the crap I kill isn't even worth the trouble.  I got some decent armor and weapons...got around 900 HP.  I'd really like to make it to level 30 soon, so any help would be appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 25 to 30 I soloed/duoed/grouped at the lizards on CT Isle in Ferrott.  At the time I wasn't too twinked, had a MoSS.  Great XP and they lizards drop Fine Steel weapons to be sold to vendors for a couple plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out the big stickied hunting locations guide at the top of this very forum, and next time do a search please =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Marus Seru is a good place at that level.  Group or solo, theres plenty there to fight.<br />
<br />
Zelinaks are aggressive, rockhoppers, and stonegrabbers are social.<br />
<br />
Hunt by any of the 3 zone outs and you should be plenty safe.  Oh, and the guards there won't help you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaelmar_Shadowsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been doing Marus Seru off and on since my friend showed me the zone.  The only problem I have is that the enemies there (particularly the Stonegrabbers, which are way too plentiful) seem to beat me up more than they should, and really don't add much to my exp bar.  I tried Najena last night and accidentally fell into a pit with a nice NPC and some other really ticked off beasties.  I'm so glad that my pally friend buffed me before I went in there, or I wouldn't have lasted too long.  I found a hole in the wall and ran like hell, hoping my invis vs undead would last till I got out. :confused:  Bah...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I solo in OT, killing berserkers for their braids (For faction for the OT hammer)<br />
<br />
at 29, because all the mobs are red in that area, I just Darked, and fear them. Count a few seconds, and fear again.  Make sure you hit your pet attack button, because even though the damage coming from it is minimal, it is still a pretty effictive tool when fear kiting.  After collecting braids, one turn  in gives 3% exp.<br />
<br />
(No way could I stand up and fight toe to toe with the reds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Other place would be Gnolls spires or KFC's in South Karana.  You can also try a few orc miners in Crystal Caverns.  I don't recommend Crystal Caverns until you get invis and FD though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya I would say OT soon as you can do it. You want that faction up and then theres that gate hammer thing. Theres also Echo Caverns, you can do the muties or bogglings. Im not sure how the cons would be in Nerhtirbian Lair (sp) but the loot is better in there. Echo Caverns the loot is pretty bad unless your getting alot of those lore weapons. They sell for about 4pp for an OGre with 28 charisma heh.<br />
<br />
No dungeon soloing spots come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaelmar_Shadowsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Netherbian Lair was a fun place until the mobs became uncontrollable (after about your 10th step into their tunnels).  I was able to get some mad exp in there soloing, until about 8 warriors came running out of a tunnel I hadn't even entered yet and chased me all the way back to Marus Seru.  Those stupid Legionaires got a run for their money.  Two of them actually died because of the Netherbians.  I think I am good on exp for a bit; I got myself into a new guild where just about everyone is my level, and we are currently owning unrest.  Thanks for the help, everyone, because I'm sure it will come in handy when I'm not grouped. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay so I'm the guy who would spen time to take his char there pre-pop.  I just love Stonebrundt.  Great exp from 26-40 and there are tons of animals to get trade skill items off of.  That's where Keevel is right now.  And since PoP and LoY it's easy to get to and has vendors the next zone over.  The other advantage it has over the moon is it's underhunted and the Mobs don't hit as hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im with Itchy go to kill lizzies get your dark forge armor pieces. Easy quest used in epic great way to learn FD pulling and decent loot. You dont really have to do the dark forge armor quests to complete your epic but its fun anyway and looks cool as well. There are casters there so keep in mind if one is casting the moment you FD your fd will fail so make sure the nuke hits before FD is cast. Best spot for solo is the tip of the peninsula, crusaders are sk's so send pet in to take the HT and follow shortly after. If you have a mage buddy the mage epic paper for fire drops there off the alligators pretty often as well.</div></div><hr />
