<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know this is probably the most retarded question asked here, but here goes.  <br />
<br />
I went to the grey the other day at lvl 55 and tried fearkiting things.  But I always ran into adds, is there anything that I could do to prevent adds, or do I just have to eat it and FD?  My equipment is in my  sig, so let me know what I was doing wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Grey has a lot of Traps and mobs.  I would suspect that there are lots of better places to Fearkite.  As an alternate answer, generally Fearkiting causes a particular path to be walked by the feared mob.  What would be required is to Fear mobs in different locations around the zone.  Then, one could evaluate the paths that were taken and see if adds were likely.<br />
<br />
If one were so inclined, you could include a version of aggro kiting with that of Fear kiting.  While not efficient for you, you could repath a mob that was getting to far out of the way.<br />
<br />
As an aside, no signature was attached to your message.  Gear has nothing to do with pathing so I did not need to look at your Magelo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, experiment with pathing and get a rough estimate on how long it takes to kill so and so mob, using how much mana.  When fear breaks move them back towards your camp a little if they are roaming too far.  If you don't have much room to work with use regular fear instead of Invoke.  <br />
<br />
At 55 I used to Fear kite DL.  I'd pull a mob back to the castle wall and they'd path along it.  That was long ago though, and even then you'd get better overall results in a good group.  <br />
<br />
If you really want to test your fear kiting skills, try solo'ing the Entrance of the Hole.  One mistake on &quot; pathing &quot; your mob and you had multiple adds, but it's doable if you time things just right.  I used to be the only one in my guild to solo Golems back when they were considered bad asses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your biggest problem is the Grey. (You'll have the same problem with Maiden's Eye and other places).  The issue is that those zones have mobs that are triggered spawns, when you run over a certain piece of ground.  You'll always get adds in places like that.  <br />
<br />
I keep hearing about some flies in PoD on this board, search that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I was Fear Kiting in The Grey, I found it useful to stay up on the zonewall but what I found most useful was the terrain itself<br />
<br />
Ofter what I would do is look for large boulders out in the area I am pulling through and would pull the mobs through said boulders to my camp, then I would snare/fear them. When they headed back out across the boulder, they have troubled climbing back up them and get delayed, giving you and your pet extra time to do damage.<br />
<br />
Doing this kept the range the mobs would run very small, and reduced the chances for an add.<br />
<br />
ANother tip, is to find the static trap locations and camp those. (there is one in the SW corner of the zone that gets little traffic. YOu can just trigger it at will whenever you are ready for a mob, then pull it up closer to the zone wall (lots of room for kiting in that corner)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorven Gexko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Using your short duration (lower level) fear spells will also help with the control issues in tight areas. For instance in The Grey, I use to use the low level undead fear spell on Shissar Rev's and just plain old fear on the golems towards the backside of the temple. You should be okay if you use this method unless the pathing was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TwobittRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stay away from the little white puffs on the ground, running over them will trigger mobs to spawn of various sorts. Also mobs won't add once you hit 58. Well all mobs outside of named and sun revs.</div></div><hr />
