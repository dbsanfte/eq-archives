<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone remember when DoTs did partial damage to moving targets, to nerf kiting? Or did I just make that shit up? Everyone I mention it to has no clue what I'm talkin about. Maybe I've confused EQ with another game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember seeing a dev a long long time ago saying that yes, although I think it was more along the lines of if you wre running away or something.<br />
<br />
We can never know if that was ever true however as back then we didn't see dot damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember that. That was when I first started playing my old main, my druid. Was when she was in her early 20's so would have been about 2 1/2 years ago. Damage was reduced by about 30%ish on a moving target, and I do very well remember the patch message where moving targets were changed to where they took full dot damage. I was very happy because at that time I had to root rot and also med with THE BOOK and it was a very very very very very very boring way to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zaistikaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ow Good God you had to go and mention the BOOK =(<br />
The rest of my night will just not be right thinking of that book ,You Suck<br />
 :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">July 24, 2002.<br />
<br />
Moving NPCs will no longer recieve a reduction in DoT damage.<br />
<br />
Geez, the book.  That suuuuuuuuucked! Did some looking and it seems like they removed the need to look at the book around 3/20/2002, FWIW.<br />
<br />
ADD:  Here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51183) is a link to the patch message if they still don't believe you.  It's the 3rd entry under ** Spells **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, the reduction was 1/3 of the dot damage if the npc was moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks a lot, everyone said I was making that shit up.</div></div><hr />
