<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used search and didn't find anything specific except for some ornate pattern locations, but I apologize if I missed something somewhere that discusses this.<br />
<br />
Recently my in-game wife and myself achieved access to Tower of Sol Ro.  From the way things look, that might be the best access we have for awhile unless our guild kills Rallos sooner than I expect.  And currently we don't know anyone else that we really group with that has access there (and we've only ever seen one other group there), so we trio there with a botted enchanter with every aa under the sun.  My magelo and hers (druid) are pretty current in my sig (noteable exception being that she recently won the FT4 belt from VT).  With the enchanter to slow and pacify, we are able to kill the Protectors without much trouble, it just takes awhile.  Once we get up to the Focus of Sol area it goes a little faster, but getting there takes some time since we usually get too close trying to pacify (I swear they have a bigger aggro range than anyone but Sonty).  We also have to worry that if we die, we either eat the death or bug someone we don't know for a rez, so we typically err on the side of caution.  For pure xp purposes, HoH is easier and faster for us, but we were hoping for some ornate and rune drops.<br />
<br />
So I have a couple of questions.  I am somewhat familiar with the layout of the zone from the nice map at eqatlas, but never actually gone any further than the 5 &quot;ramps&quot; or whatever you call them to the mini towers.  First and foremost, would we stand a chance of defeating any of the guardians to the towers with just the 3 of us?  And are some easier than the others, or all just the same thing with different names?  (Unless I'm just retarded and can't remember correctly, I believe each tower door from the ramps is guarded by 2 of these; if I'm wrong please tell me)  Furthermore, if we were able to get past them, would we be able to reasonably set up camp in any of the tower areas?  I know that various mini named can spawn in different towers, and some seem killable by us and others don't.  I'm pretty much just asking if people have some recommendations as to areas to check out, areas to avoid, etc.  Personally I don't think I could sit and kill Protectors all day long, especially since they seem to drop nothing better than Phosphorous Powder for us.  I look at Alla's and see tons of mobs listed for the zone, but so far I've seen Protectors/Guardians, Focus of Sol, and a mephit lackey :p (he rules for added dps though).  So there has to be a lot in the tower areas that I'm missing out on.<br />
<br />
Eventually, we will have a botted 65 shaman and 65 cleric, and a friends 65 rogue joining us, which will obviously make things go a lot smoother.  Once that happens, what would you suggest?  Remember, aside from decent xp with little or no competition, we are also looking for rune and ornate drops (specifically to outfit the shaman/cleric/rogue more than to sell them).  I know many will say to just wait for the Rallos kill and do EP's, but for right now it may be a few weeks or even months before that happens.  And I doubt we'll find much to outfit the bots with in EP's, but could of course be wrong there also.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help, and sorry for the length.  I tend to over explain things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My biggest suggestion: pacify sucks the big one in solro, where mob aggro radius&gt; casting range.<br />
<br />
Step up to the plate and monk it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do, trust me, many times.  Getting places in the zone (so far) and splitting mobs isn't the problem, it's knowing which direction I should be going since it takes us so freaking long to actually get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Without a porter you don't really want to be going up into the towers.<br />
<br />
Doing what you are doing now is really the best use of solro, get up to the hub of paths and pull the Focus' of Sols, lowest hp mob there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">She's a druid, with exodus :)  But yeah, the Focus are definitely easier.  Just haven't dropped anything either.<br />
<br />
I'm kind of just looking for if one tower might be doable, or might have some named we could at least hope for, or if another is something we should definitely avoid, etc.  I'm not afraid of dying, but if one will just own us no matter what we do, I'd prefer to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Generally the mobs in the tower have more hps, although dont see all that much tougher.<br />
<br />
Some towers are better for grind than others (Xuzl - far left wing) (Jiva - center wing) are best.  Dresolik (far right) is not bad but you can get a a named imp and he can make life miserable and there are mobs in the lava so you will want to rely on FD pulling.<br />
<br />
Forget about the wing bosses until you get 2 groups.  Maybe full Time-geared can 1 group some bosses, but you dont sound like you are fully elemental+ geared so wouldnt even try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Averse, that is the kind of thing I'm looking for.  And we have no intention whatsoever of attempting any wing bosses until the rest of the guild is along for the ride :)  Any more input is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What ornate droppers there are 1 groupable by VT level toons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">all mobs have a % chance to drop ornate gan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye any mob can drop the ornate pieces but since i went there last drops are utterly retarded one day in 9 hours i got 2 pieces from the hub area leading to steps up to the diff wings with sk/clr/shm/ench<br />
<br />
Then we tried the Xuxl tower wing and got 2 items there but less exp and in 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Ornate pieces are now virtually extinct on Kane server and only people that are selling in bazaar are the local BoT tower farm team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So basically...could me and a 65 shaman bot take the droppers down duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Technically you could probably farm the zone in with the shaman bot.  However, if your magelo is current, I would be extremely cautious.  They hit for about the same as HoH/PoT mobs, but seem to hit faster and for max more often, at least that I've noticed.  And they summon.  And are immune to snare.  And have aggro range as far as you can cast unless you have an extended range item.  And except for the wanderers almost always come in pairs so you'll have to split them.  Don't forget you can't zone out either to get away, you have to gate out.<br />
<br />
After slow landed, your shaman wouldn't be doing much besides healing, which means the fight will be drug out even longer, meaning the shaman will be doing nothing but healing for even longer.  Once an HoH mob is slowed I can sometimes tank it (with a full group of course) without losing much in the way of hps.  That doesn't happen with sol ro mobs even after slow.  They hit, and you get hurt, often.<br />
<br />
My magelo and my druid wife's are in my sig.  With an enchanter bot to slow, nuke, and uproar me, she still has to heal me a couple times a fight.</div></div><hr />
