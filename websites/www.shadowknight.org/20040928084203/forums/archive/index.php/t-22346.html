<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm building a new computer that needs to run 2 instances of EQ.  I was planning to use my old geforce4 ti4600 for the video card but when I tried to install it, the screen would flash every few seconds and then the computer would lock up after a couple minutes.  I tried all of the BIOS settings, old and new motherboard and graphics drivers, various Windows settings, etc.  Nothing helped.  Eventually, I plugged in my old Geforce2 MX100 32mb and that works fine, I can 2box just fine with the old card as long as I turn off almost every graphics feature in EQ.<br />
<br />
Sometime in the near future, I would like to buy a real video card so that I don't have to stare at graphics from 1999.  Here are my requirements:<br />
1) Highly compatible.  I need something that works with a wide variety of hardware.<br />
2) Name brand.  Goes with #1.<br />
3) Low cost.  $50-$150 is a reasonable price range.  I can't cough up $300 to get the latest and greatest.<br />
4) Works well for 2boxing EQ.<br />
5) AGP 4x/8x<br />
<br />
Also, what features are important and what stats do I need?  Directx 9.0 support is obviously important, and I know that more ram is always better.  Anything else?<br />
<br />
Here are the important parts for the rest of my system:<br />
2.8ghz P4 800MHZ FSB (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=19-116-170&amp;depa=1) <br />
ECS Motherboard (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-135-152&amp;depa=1) <br />
Kingston 512MB PC3200 (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=20-141-424&amp;depa=1) <br />
WD 40GB IDE HDD (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-126&amp;depa=1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would go with the ATI Radeon 9600XT, like found at:<br />
http://www.ati.com/products/radeon9600/radeon9600pro/specs.html<br />
<br />
You can buy one from Newegg for around $160.<br />

That's the card I'm running in my machine atm, does just fine running two instances of EQ and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a quick tip from the late, very lamented TechTV show, The Screen Savers, any video card that you pick up by Nvidia/ATI, make sure that you get it in Ultra/Pro form respectively. The data transfer rate is higher, the RAM is the top of the line and the card generally behaves better when your stressing it out (like running 2 EQs). I have followed every piece of advice that they tossed out there and they have always steered me in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was under the impression that the XT cards were better than the PRO cards, at least for ATI.  Is this correct?</div></div><hr />

Hmm its possible, from just a quick glance, the XTs in ATI seem to be a bit faster, more MHZ, and a better data transfer rate thats similar, but really it would depends on the use I would think. Some games simply run faster on certain types of cards, a year old card might out do a new one depending on the game.<br />
