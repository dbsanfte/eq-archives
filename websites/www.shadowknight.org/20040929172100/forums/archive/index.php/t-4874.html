<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varuca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Put 10 into STR/STA.<br />
<br />
Is this a sound decision?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Andred Dnocte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">STR = Easist stat to buff and raise from equiment<br />
DEX = Hardest stat to raise.  <br />
<br />
I'd do DEX/STA in a heartbeat if I re-rolled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nizuzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Need to get your AGI up to 75, too, to reap the full benefits of armour as Erudite SKs start with only 70. Being new to the game, I found this out the hard way and put all my stats in the wrong spots but it's nothing equipment cannot resolve.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would do 5 AGI, 5 DEX, 10 STA.  Alternately, you could do 5 DEX, 5 AGI, 5 STR (would bring each to 75) and 5 STA (would bring STA to 80).  But definitely put at least 5 into AGI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azieru Xionhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I say 5str, 10sta, 5dex</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">STR is easy to raise with spells (like Siphon Strength).  We don't have a Siphon Agi.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I rolled Xanyia I put 5 into each. <br />
Only change I would make now is to put 5 str 10 sta 5 agi no dex, but it really is a minor change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I made the same mistake as Nizuzen when I started Katha. You really can't go too wrong with putting points into str, sta, dex, or int, but that 5 (minimum) points into agi for Erudites is pretty much needed. Again, it can be overcome fairly easily with gear, but if you're starting untwinked, it can be a pain in the rear to find a decent item that also has 5 agi (or combos of items)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a dark elf, so it's a little different for me, but based on the other advice people have listed here, I'd agree: 5 points into AGI, then the rest you can put where you want.<br />
<br />
Looking back on my early-days as an SK, if I re-created my guy, I'd probably have put as many points as possible into STA. But as you gain levels, and find more gear, STR/STA gear isn't that tough to find, while DEX/AGI stuff that compliments other stats/AC/HP isn't as plentiful. Plus, when you get REALLY high up there in levels, STR/STA will be maxxed out pretty easily anyway.<br />
<br />
I know some SK's who put a lot of points into INT, and they are quite happy! It's all really up to you! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shadow1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes it is up to you in how you want to use your points. I as a DE wanted high int , and the rest I just spead aroung str, agi, dex. but with the gear out there is it a matter of how you want to take your beatings before you reach lvl 9 hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ryum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what about practice point advice for a new iksar.</div></div><hr />

what about practice point advice for a new iksar. <br />
One point into taunt.<br />
<br />
You can save the rest, or put the remaining four points into 1HS so you don't spend the next hour getting spammed with 'you miss' messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I put my practice points in 1hs pretty much, then I think I went with Bash next (as soon as I could). I stuck with 1hs/shield combo until I got some decent armor, then switched to 2hs. <br />
<br />
Lots of folks slap a point into swimming and sense heading at the beginning, but that's your decision.<br />
<br />
And if you're twinked at all, then it doesn't really matter. ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daelin_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Practice points, save 'em.<br />
<br />
Erudites, Dark Elves, never need to use them. When I hit level 20 I was reading many guides written by ogre/troll SKs who advocated burning all their practice points in double attack. High int means you learn things very fast, and an Sk without int is a weak warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">High DEX is what helps with weapon skills, so if you're low on INT try to raise DEX if you can.<br />
<br />
Then again, as an Iksar you have a starting DEX and INT of 85 if you don't put any starting points into them, so you should be in good shape.  I had no problems getting weapon and spell skill increases with my Iksar SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always found my skills maxed out a few lvls after I got them, except wepon skills, it's best to get some other weapon choices as you go even if they aren't as good ratio to keep skills up, generally you can max all your combat skills each lvl whatever race, but if you don't keep them up you will have some trouble when you want them... <br />
<br />
I sold my soulbinder because I really didn't feel like training 2hb with it, especially when it didn't proc oh well got it for less than half what I sold for so no worries.<br />
<br />
practice points, I started twinked with a MoSS, it wasn't really uber at the time but it sure beat the pawn's kukri, and I trained in 1hb several points because I was trying to lvl quick, and long fights from skill going up slower than I leveled (only happens to about lvl 10 or so) don't need swimming on an iksar, and swim and sense heading both go up from zero, so no need to train in them, I suggest 5 into whatever your main weapon is to start off then save for whatever weaponskills you inevitably neglect.<br />
<br />
200pp and 80 practice points saves several days of poor xp and FDing a lot when you run outta mana fear kiting. by 40 you could have enough to get a good start into 3 or 4 skills, and 40-50 skill is capped at 200 so it's a good time to work on skills that are low, as long as they aren't so low their worthless. you don't have to worry about keeping up other skills then.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah and for stats I'd say 15 sta 5 agi, get agi to 75 so you don't take an AC hit, then go for the HP, dex is only good for procs, and 5 dex wont make a huge differene, but we've all had a couple close shaves with 1-10 hp left before we zone, HT, or FD, really though the last 5 points wont matter, str would be a waste though IMO since it's so easy to max well comparatively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">wow so long ago...<br />
<br />
I put 10 into str, 5 agi, 5dex.<br />
<br />
both agi and dex start at 70 and i wasn't sure if a penalty to dex would affect my attack like the penalty to agi affects ac.. Which is fairly significant.</div></div><hr />
