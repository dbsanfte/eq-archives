<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some things I think are rather over due for us<br />
<br />
Pets:<br />
<br />
SK pets are pretty worthless until lvl 52 or so, even then they are nothing to write home about.   I feel they should move up the lvl pets we get a level by one rank.  There's no reason why they should be half our level, and so far behind our Necro parents when we get them.  The 49 pet should be our 58 pet and at 64 we should get our own pet.  Something with approx 3k hp, lvl 60, quad 61, and 100 lifetap.  Not a huge upgrade from our current pet, but would be more durable and would benefit from Mage proc weapons / lifetaps on higher lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
Noob Spells: ( already mentioned making pets better )<br />
<br />
The power scale of an SK from low lvl to high lvls is HUGE.  There are many lines that are introduced only at the high lvls, that I feel lower lvl SKs should benefit from.  Spells I feel younger SKs should get are the following:<br />
<br />
Low 20s: 15 to whole group atk buff<br />
Low 20s: 50 hp and 25 mana group tap<br />
Low 20s: 35 ac, 50 dd tap<br />
<br />
Low 30s: Proc buff that gives 30 hp / 30 mana per proc<br />
<br />
Low 40s: 30 to whole group atk buff<br />
<br />
High 40s: 70 ac, 100 dd tap<br />
<br />
Low 50s: Improved Pet buff<br />
<br />
Mid 50s: 125 hp and 75 mana group tap<br />
<br />
High End SK Spells:<br />
<br />
While SKs are very powerful in the high end game, combining a good mix of Defensive, Offensive, and Group abilites there are a few spells / AA that I feel will add to our class without overpowering.<br />
<br />
Spells <br />
<br />
65: Improved Death Peace<br />
Cast time 0.0 ( you can Run and FD )<br />
Recast 2 min<br />
Also grants a 6 sec dmg / spell immunity <br />
Mana Cost: 1200 mana<br />
<br />
65: Cloak of Luclin<br />
Adds 60 atk <br />
<br />
65: 800 dmg Rune<br />
Costs a Peridot<br />
<br />
64: Remove / Change Shroud of Chaos to this<br />
65 lifetap proc / 115 mana tap proc<br />
Lasts 2 hours<br />
<br />
64: Pact of Hate<br />
change to 25 mana / 50 hp a tick, adds 10 int, 150 mana, True Sight<br />
<br />
65: Aura of Hate<br />
Change it to a removable buff<br />
Same cast / recast as Torrent of Hate<br />
125 atk constant<br />
<br />
63: Blood of Hate<br />
Change it to Fire and to have the same resist rate as the other spells in the &quot; Blood &quot; line ( Heat Blood, Ignite Blood, etc. )<br />
<br />
62: Zev Bite<br />
Flag it unresistable or Flag it Magic with the same resist rate as Touch of Inny<br />
<br />
Increase the DD amount or mana cost on all Spears by 25 percent<br />
<br />
Increase the DD amount or mana cost on Deny Undead by 25 percent<br />
<br />
<br />
AA<br />
<br />
Increase Lifetap dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent<br />
<br />
Increase DoT dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent ( per tick )<br />
<br />
Increase Mana given by Zev Bite by 25, 50, 100<br />
<br />
Increase the Power of Leech Curse to 1500 base <br />
<br />
Change Leech Curse to HT mob and heal GROUP by 1500 / 750 mana ( up to 3000 heal with AA, 1500 mana )<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Me personally, love my Shadow Knight and feel that although she may lack in certain areas, she is a very enjoyable to play. I feel with the spell lineup we currently have is well rounded that it makes our class very survivable and versatile in more situations than other classes. Feign Death, Harmshield, Snare, Highest Defensive Capabilities, Plate Wearing, Fear, mana regen and a pet to name a few attributes. In bad situations, we are more likely to survive than many of the other classes.<br />
As for pets, I don’t know about everyone else, but I rarely conjure one. I’d love to get rid of them and replace them with self-haste spells. They don’t have to be of the same caliber as Shaman and Enchanter spells, but something to help us through the times when we don’t have a haster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The reason behind the FD is because a class that doesn't even have FD in it's original line up gets something that blows away both Monk and SK FD.  I think both us and Monks should get something with spell immunity when we FD.<br />
<br />
<br />
While a 65 SK is very powerful, getting there is very hard because you don't even get a taste of our signature spells until the very high lvls.  Even lower lvl Lifetaps are a joke compared to how much your 62 / 65 Taps heal ( for example, with theft of life your 65 lifetap heals almost a yellow of health quite regularly.  I remember when I was a younger SK your health would hardly move when I lifetapped. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Are u refering to bard gate? or rogue Escape? in either situation I dont see how this warants an upgrade to FD.<br />
<br />
Bard gate is a form of CC, one of bards core abilties, it is not used like FD, because it uses lots of mana (something bards dont have much of snce they cant meditate) and its hard to gate multiple mobs at once, and finally, gate has a lvl limit.<br />
<br />
Rogue Escape has 72 min reuse time, and is nothing like FD either.<br />
<br />
Sk got a major boost in pop if u havent yet noticed. Our tanking is superb now that chain/leather tanks are back to where they should be avoidance/mitigation/hp wise, also the itemization is really kicking in, finally there are almost no All/All high ac items etc.  Also Sk burst damage is just awesome, just what the class needed.  In all FD is not something we need to be better at anymore, we have received lots of other nice new tricks which STACK well in both raid and exp situations.<br />
<br />
Monk FD is still the most powerfull skill/spell in EQ imo.  It does not need any upgrades, it's already godly.  Monks as a class went from being utterly over powered in velious/luclin  to being back to where they should be, ie now.  Monks use to be able to take damage better than any class, have best front side DPS and have FD as well as other awesome abilities IE mend/stonestance etc.  <br />
Now they finally tank worse than plate clases, as they always should have, their damage is still very nice but more in line with what it should have always been.  Monks are a melee with INCREDIBLE utility, it was stupid how dumb it was having monks also be best tanks and damage dealers, when they also have such powerful utility tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bards have Fading Memories which is a complete aggro wipe.  Not to mention they have a powerful lull line as well.  Most of the pulling done in my guild, is done by Bards.   SKs pull the stuff that needs FD splitting.  While it's true that Fading Memories is costly, most Bards in high end guilds have a large enough mana pool where it isn't much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the contrary it is a huge issue.  In an exp group situation most of the time a bard wont have the mana (nor the time) to continuesly fade, while u can always fd split.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation, a monk is superior to both, in very few instances is a sk/bard needed, and even in those a skilled monk can do the job.  Sk have so many usefull jobs on a raid now, offtank, damage, buffs, ma, rampage tanks.... the list goes on, let the monks pull that is the path SoE gave them.<br />
<br />
Furthermore i looked at the front page of your guild, and i cant think of one encounter that you do that requires a bard to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not to mention lots of classes have lull type spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In my guild Bards pull everything from VT, trash mobs in Plane of Tatics, Ssra, to the Honorable Protectors in Temple of Marr.  In exp groups our chanter usually pulls and has mobs mezzed in camp by the time the one we are killing is down.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I don't see how improving SKs in the lower lvls, Giving us a pet we can actually use on raids, making those 18 aa we spent on Soul Abrasion not go to waste, along with giving us a FD comparable to what Bards have, give us &quot; God Mode &quot;?   <br />
<br />
Yes, I've been playing an SK for 3 years now.  I know we are doing very good since PoP.  Purpose of my thread is to show how the higher level is getting all the benefits, and all the lower ones are stuck down on the power scale mostly.  For Higher lvl SKs, I really hate having to switch around buffs all the time to rebuff Mental Corruption... along with the fact that Bards run circles around our pulling and Monks, Literally.  Also nice how Bards can drain all my mana in a few secs, yet I can't use Mental Corruption in PvP along with a few other nice spells like Bond of Death =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I agree with the notion that SK spells suck, but what you're proposing would be overpowering.<br />
<br />
That pet you mentioned would be better than the 61 nec pet. The 100 lifetap alone is much better; only thing less would be dmg output - hp would be about the same. Getting the lvl 49 nec pet at 64 is fine. It is a damn good pet. I wouldn't mind seeing SK getting the 53 rogue class pet over that though at 65 or so, again in line with the SK are supposed to be offensive focused.<br />
<br />
I think a good 85% of SK spells are worthless. We are supposed to be a highly offensive class, and most of our spells suck. Spears are nice..but against disease resistant mobs..resist resist resist. Same with mana tap proc.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with SK spells is with death peace. It fizzles way too fucking much with max abj skill.<br />
<br />
Basically give SK some DD's not disease based in the spear line, and maybe an AA to help with fizzles in general (the mastery of the past doesn't affect it) and I would be happy.<br />
<br />
Right now I don't think paladin and sk spells are balanced. They get good defensive spells, we get mostly gimpy offensive spells. Some people disagree, that's fine *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Power scale relative to what? High level twinks?<br />
<br />
Sk's used to have a problem with balance when you got into high end raids, and PoP sorted that out. At lower levels defensive is an irrelevance (hell it doesn't exist) so warriors are just fat knights with no spells. Experience has been sped up so much that crying about imbalance at low levels is so much tosh in both theory and practise. <br />
<br />
At 51 an sk has Dooming Dark and Fear and can therefore solo xp whenever he wants. He can FD split mobs as well as any monk if he needs to. He has easy travel with his invis spell. He can hold aggro easily and never meets a mob that needs defensive. He's got mana regen when he hits 52 thanks to Mental Corruption. He's even got a pet which doesn't aggro every damn thing any more and which can be remarkably useful in certain instances. He's got Harmsheild for when things go pear-shaped. He's got Comatose to load up as well now that i think of it. <br />
<br />
God knows how a 51 sk's dps compares to his equivalents but given the other advantages i don't think it's an issue.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
My guild PWNED luclin with out fade (pre pop), vt is a freaking joke to pull.<br />
<br />
HoHB and PoTactics are pulled by monks.<br />
<br />
Giving me multiple ZB spells would make my alrdy insane exp rate out of this world, oh yes i can see it now, me, druid and 4 mages PWNING everything in sight with unlimited mana.<br />
<br />
Get some decent foucs/ft/mana gear and bards go splat faster than they can twist their gay songs, comparing zb/mc to mana tap is dumb cause they dont STEAL ANY MANA! the recourse just gives you mana, the targes doesnt lose any mana.<br />
<br />
The reason its marked !pvp is ppl use to MindWrack each other on raids back in luclin, this strat made many encounters trival due to the large amount of mana provided via this strat.  And not having MC/ZB in pvp is hardly somethign to whine about considering pvp is utterly un balanced in the 1st place, and mostly in OUR favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is the Class Balance forums guys, so of course people are going to post what they feel would make the SK class more balanced, enjoyable, fine tuned, etc etc.   I doubt any of  this would be seen by Devs, much less implemented... but it's my opinion of what SKs should get in both high and low lvls.  Of course not everyone is going to agree, especially players of a class that can be interperted in so many different ways.  It's like trying to get everyone to agree on one version of the Bible.  So please, take it as it is and cut down the flaming :D <br />
<br />
Personally, I love using my pet.  It's one of the reasons I choose an SK.  SoEs reasoning behind giving us stronger pets is that we are a melee class... Well, now we have Beastlords.  They have alot of Utility, decent dps, and a powerful pet.  I'm no means asking for a BL type pet, but for 52 lvls your pet isn't worth casting.  Then when you get to 65 and raid alot, your pet get owned by most AoEs and isn't able to proc Mage weapons like every other pet even Shaman.  <br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin is a great buff, but it's a 65 Rune spell.  Getting SoT / CoR from a ranger, or Brells from a Paladin are both arguably better...not to mention Paladins have another buff the can stack on top of that.  Add atk and it's a more viable raid spell over Brell and Ranger buffs as it should be.  <br />
<br />
I almost never use Shroud of Chaos, Mental Corruption allows us to keep up all the nice Mana / hp taps, ac / atk buffs we have... yet many SKs invested quite a large sum of AA to our Class skill Soul Abrasion.  Having our  64 spell tap do both would solve that issue.<br />
<br />
As of right now our Leech HT is almost useless as an AA, especially for the cost.  Yes it can be nice in some situations, but a 65 SK with theft of life crits for 940 quite often.  Many classes have an AA that gives the group Mana and hp ( Skin like Wood, Paragon, etc. ), so this could be our little &quot; version &quot; of that.  <br />
<br />
Blood of Hate and Spears are resisted way to much to warrant the mana cost.  I'm better off chaining lifetaps, since they always hit for full.  All our &quot; Hate &quot; dots are hard to resist Fire dots, why does the end spell in our line up change to be a very resistable Poison DoT?    Spears are great spells, but they too are very resistable and don't do that much more dmg than our 65 Lifetap.  Increasing their DD dmg, making them cheaper mana, or even lowering their resist would make them alot more useful.<br />
<br />
Pact of Hate is just a dream spell thought.  We pay for having it up with our own hp, it should be better than something that can be casted on us that doesn't take hp.<br />
<br />
Edit:  an Extra 50 - 75 mana per min isn't going to overpower anyone.  Pulling can be done by SKs, Monks... but it's more easily done by Bards is what I'm saying.  Ask around, I know my guild isn't the only guild that uses Bards to pull.  Even ones in PoTime.  PvP isn't balanced is true, but it's kinda annoying that alot of our spells are deemed too powerful ( Bond of Death, Abduction of Str, any Atk tap? ) in PvP... yet Bards can drain 600 mana per tic and mez anyone with no resist check... and that's perfectly ok.  I like to PvP at times and I'd like at least a fair chance to beat an oppenent instead of hearing, &quot; You only beat me cause of your HT!!!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Show me where the Sk class lacks compared to other classes, then if you convince people there is a problem people might be more recepetive to you solutions.<br />
<br />
For instance:<br />
Your Disease based DD being resists on Disease resistant mobs doesnt warant for an upgrade, if it did it would be much easier to just have no resist on any mob, you damage over all is where the problem would be found but from parses and just my own experiance I dont see a problem in my over all damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the issue of the Spears, you still get resists and partial resists on mobs that are not Poison Immune.  For the relative DD dmg and mana cost, you can just lifetap instead... get full dmg every time.  You'll end up doing more dps on a lifetap, then on a spell meant for DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didnt say Immun i said resistant for instace mobs in PoE are more disease resistant thatn mobs in PoF.<br />
<br />
The part about spears being less mana efficent than taps is simply not true, show me some facts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Chaining lifetaps would seriously drain your mana very fast, and seriously decrease your melee DPS because of cast time. Lifetaps are not meant to be used as nukes, that's why they cost so much mana and take so long to cast.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the class as it stands compared to OTHER classes. Everyone has a role. For the most part, if they gave us 90% of the abilities being suggested, the classes that HAVE these abilities would gripe that they are no longer needed.<br />
<br />
We AGGRO better than any other class in the game.<br />
We TANK as WELL as warriors, if not better given our lifetap weapon procs. <br />
We PULL almost as well as monks.<br />
<br />
The only things that our class needs are the fun, no-real-reason-to-have-them-but-they'd-be-fun AAs. Like an insta-cast invis AA or a hotkeyed Death Peace AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spells <br />
<br />
Improved Death Peace<br />
Man this mana cost is horrible, its 1/3 - 1/5 of mana pool, and when pulling you often have to FD 4-5 times in a row to split the mobs, and you are usually doing only pulls, not fighting, not medding etc.<br />
You'd have to keep the normal DP memmed, and it is 2 spell slots.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see em fix the &quot;bug&quot; that makes you interrup your spell if you dont wait the 0.5 second between the time you stop to walk and the time you start to cast, plus the DP hotkey aa thing (increase mana cost if they wish~), that would allow us to free a spell slot and we badly need it.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin<br />
THIS is reallistic,  I'd also want to see the hps increased so it goes closer to pally combo (higher hps than bss, lower than bss+theire self buff).<br />
It would indeed still not stack with bss, this means 1 buff slot instead of 2, one less buff to whine for, and from a rp point of view you have nothing to ask to a paladin.<br />
It could also be the &quot;melee balance thing&quot; if also modify the lvl 60 one, and add some lower level ones with the atk buff part (lower).<br />
<br />
800 dmg Rune<br />
Honestly I don't care, and would prolly not use it.<br />
I don't see the point of this spell, if I want a rune (wich only happens when tanking TZ) I ask it to an ench~<br />
<br />
64: Remove / Change Shroud of Chaos to this<br />
65 lifetap proc / 115 mana tap proc<br />
This would be utterly overpowered, SoC is already *very* powerfull as a damage proc in raid-group and as a solo tool, adding a mana tap to this is simply something I would not see go live even in my dreams.<br />
*You* might lack mana regen, but most dont, I believe.<br />
Think about the ones who have already FT10+ (not like it is hard to get when on tier 4), and think about the amount of mana they would have with this, hell I already have a hard time to make my mana bar go under 95% on trash mobs.<br />
Now, asking to a MC upgrade would be more reallistic~<br />
<br />
64: Pact of Hate<br />
change to 25 mana / 50 hp a tick, adds 10 int, 150 mana, True Sight<br />
Int and mana = useless crap<br />
Well its a gimped arch lich, I find that PoH is already quite nice, but dont think this spell would be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
65: Aura of Hate<br />
Sounds ok, but I dont see them boost it that much ;/<br />
Just reduce the recast time to 38-42 seconds would be way enough.<br />
And yes I guess it should be clickable, but I actually dont care~<br />
<br />
63: Blood of Hate<br />
What a weird idea, I cant see the point of this, this spell is already close to never resisted, and moving it to fire would make it useless in PoFire (and make solo impossible).<br />
<br />
62: Zev Bite<br />
This spell is lready so good I'd find obscene to boost it.<br />
<br />
Spears<br />
Increase dd and mana cost by 25% sound cool, would help to burn mana more easily in raid for those who have alot of FT.<br />
I think they should also add a small resist mod on it, something like -10 or -20, they are too much resisted on tier 4 and I personally find them way less interesting that some peoples seem to.<br />
<br />
AAs<br />
<br />
Increase Lifetap dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent<br />
Why not, necros would also get it, might be a little too powerful if it would work on procs<br />
<br />
Increase DoT dmg by 5, 10, and 20 percent ( per tick )<br />
Same as above<br />
<br />
Increase Mana given by Zev Bite by 25, 50, 100<br />
Overpowered<br />
<br />
Increase the Power of Leech Curse to 1500 base<br />
Change Leech Curse to HT mob and heal GROUP by 1500 / 750 mana ( up to 3000 heal with AA, 1500 mana )<br />
Leech curse?<br />
You mean leech touch I guess :p<br />
Sound good, this aa thing seems not interesting to me like it is atm, not planning to ever train it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Lifetaps are not meant to be used as nukes, that's why they cost so much mana and take so long to cast.<br />
Erm...Touch of Volatis is 2.1 second cast time with standard hybrid haste...if you think THAT is a long cast time, try using Drain Soul for a few weeks :D<br />
<br />
And IMO Leech Touch does need an improvement on the dd/heal. LT is just another option for the SK class, nothing more really. But would be nice to lifetap for 8k instead of nuking for it.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see Leech CURSE (The 15 sec disc) extended to around 30 seconds or so, just to make it useful again.<br />
<br />
And I'd like to see all discs unhooked between each other. All on indepenant timers.</div></div><hr />
