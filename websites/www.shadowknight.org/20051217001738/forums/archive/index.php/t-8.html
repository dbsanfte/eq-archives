<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-22-2002, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, are shadow knights good at pulling in Hate?  I know a lot of people use rangers for Fear because of tracking, but Hate doesn't seem like that would be as useful.  Also, if we ARE useful, does anyone have any pointers?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-22-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There able to pull it fine, did it back in the day at 50 np, its a complete joke at 60... like anything else though you just gotta learn it, the pathing in poh is a nightmare, and if you dont know where mobs spawn it can suck (or dont know your way around the zone), fd pulling isnt really required at 60... did it for a friend a few days ago about 3 hours no deaths constant pulls group was: 52 wizard, 59 cleric, 60 ranger, 60 enchanter, 59 warrior (with bad gear... enc could tank better), and me.  in the 3-4 hours we were there we had 0 deaths and lots of pulls... made around 14k between all of us in pp items... if your group can kill krups in seb its capable of handling hate</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rikkar</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pulled PoH for the first time last night, had a 60 monk showing me the ropes, and had the maps from eqmaps.com just to help me along a bit =)  Pulled all of first floor (3.5 hour clear, not bad for my first time ^_^)  And pulled 2nd floor from staircase to inny and all the minibosses (DIE EVANGELIST DIE!!!)  All in all if you have 5-7 hours to blow it's a good time, though pathing can make you want to tear your hair out... especially in maestro's room!  It seemed fairly easy at 55, i'd imagine you could do first floor easily at 50ish, not sure about second</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-23-2002, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice... a monk is pulling this one, but mabye I can get a spot as puller on the next one.  Is there an order to follow, or just find stuff and bring it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nephtu</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done limited pulling there - it's moderately tricky in the low 50s, a lot easier if you have BE legs (FD backup really is a godsend)  Some moderately nasty chain aggro, tagging is best done with a level 60 because of scial aggro considerations.  Usually, Hate is just cleared outward from the camp, in my experience, nothing too sophisticated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, BE legs are out of the question for a while... so I guess I'll just wait a few levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khuobak</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling hate is not overly difficult, just learning the location of mobs, and getting a route down and getting experence at doing it.  even with 2 level 60 monks MA pullers in my guild I am the primary puller on hate. but expect to die some as you learn the ropes, having coh in your group why yea learn will help alot, if yea have it avalible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pulled Hate at 47 cuz I was the only FDer who showed up. It can be done, but it's painful and you'll die more than a higher level monk or SK...and the raid will go slower with more people sitting around twiddling their thumbs while you're rezzed and rebuffed a buncha times. Actually, I think Lejina came up and pulled for us after I got whacked for the 10th time or so.  LOL  <br />
<br />
I pulled it a few times afterwards in the mid 50's and it's much much easier. We have a monk now who's a terrific puller and I don't even bother with pulling Hate anymore cuz he's so damn good at it. He just &quot;gets&quot; it, yanno?</div></div><hr />
