<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I haven't started Epic 1.5 at all, however I have spent a lot of time in RCoD at various camps trying to pharm Tier 1 drops for ourselves.  Our latest camp is Murkglider Deathsting, and as y'all know, he's right next to the PH for the Breeder.  When the Breeder pops, we leave the camp (too much of a pain to pull around him, etc.).  We've gotten the Breeder to pop a few times and as stated above, you just keep killing PH's.  Rather, you may as well do the camp until it pops, since Deathsting drops the stones for the Tier 1 boots, FT2 aug, and runes (including 69 &amp; 70) anyways.<br />
<br />
If the zone is reset, I believe the Breeder is up.  Seemed to hold true as of the Dec. 15 patch and subsequent patch of the patches -- Breeder was always up so we had to do other camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think the breeder shows up always upon zone reset.   Checked her spot after the last big patch and the emergency patch.  No breeder, just PH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, I can't disagree with that.<br />
<br />
On Prexus, the Breeder was up on Dec 15, 16 and 17 through all those patches, so I may have assumed it was up on server up -- but it could also be that groups were killing murks and the Breeder popped; and like us,  they just left the area when that happened.  [Then I stroll in later, see the Breeder up, and assume it's because of server downs].<br />
<br />
Sorry, didn't mean it to be bad info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will Spawn!<br />
<br />
Just keep murdering that PH it will come. the first time i ever went for breeder i camped him 21 hours in a 3 day span to get him to spawn..then i couldnt manage to kill it ..long story short another sk killed it and so i had to start camping it again!<br />
<br />
Cleared PH 2 times it spawned..once again Failed killing him and another Sk took the kill.  Went back about 2 weeks ago Cleared PH once and WAMO Murkglider Breeder! Killed That SoB and Got my egg!<br />
<br />
It will spawn just keep the PH dead!<br />
<br />
GoodLuck to all of you who still need the Egg the Breeder is Definetly The Bottleneck of the Quest..once you have your Egg you will be weilding Inny's voice Shortly after!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He's a pain in the ass.  As was stated, this is the hardest part of our epic.<br />
<br />
He's 1 groupable, but you need a very good group to do it, and have to make sure he's pulled properly (everything split).  He's also a rare spawn.  While an SK in my guild got it in about an hour, it took me roughly 20 hours of off and on camping over 2 weeks or so.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Instead of dragging a group there just for that, I just checked periodically until someone else left him up (actually I found him up with a server up), and then got a group to go kill him.  So, if you want to save yourself and others some pain, you can just scout for him.  He'll eventually be up due to people doing Deathsting for the kuaan traitor stone &amp; other drops.  Then again, that's a good way to get people there to do the breeder as an aside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Breeder was easy for me. You just need a leet Bard to pull Breeder out of the cave and make it shit the adds out and then HS the Breeder back to spawn point where you single pull it to cubby single and rape it.<br />
<br />
Killed Breeder with 5 people. SK (myself tanking) cleric,rogue and Bard (Shaman boxed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vermadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're really bored and don't have any friends around to help, it is possible to solo the breeder ph.  Note: this tactic is quite risky and doesn't always work.  I take no responsibility for any deaths you take :)<br />
<br />
First thing you need to do is make sure you have harmshield up with your kiting line up, and probably your pet on hold.  If Deathsting is up, attempting this is probably a bad idea.  Run into the breeder room invis and get the ph on target.  Don't lose this target.  Get in a spot in the room between spawn, throw up harmshield, and run your ass off toward the bridge.  Your harmshield should run out as soon as you get to the long empty hall.  Run up the small set of stairs before bridge and cast Festering Darkness as soon as you can.  If luck is on your side, the breeder ph will get in your line of sight before the train you've pulled gets too close.  Once you've casted snare, FD ASAP.  If everything works out right, after your two minutes pass for a mem wipe you should have a solo breeder ph.  You can kite him back and forth in that hall there.  It's possible to move around him without getting into melee range, but it can be hard to do, so be prepared to take some hits.<br />
<br />
This tactic has a couple holes in it that prevent it from working all the time.  The first is that sometimes the breeder ph will cast that DoT the murks have on initial aggro.  When this happens, he gets delayed and is too far behind in the pack of mobs for you to get line of sight before it's too late.  The second is that darkness can be resisted.  Unfortunately, upon failure you have to wait the ten minutes for harmshield to pop up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nazlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just checking back after the holidays.  Thanks for the replies, it just dawned on me that this was probably the case.  Sigh...............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaeldarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My own experience with Mukrglider Breeder:<br />
<br />
Jan 14th 2005 I finally popped the SOB after 14 hours of camping over a 3-day span. Damned if my &quot;WOOT&quot; didn't come out &quot;WO-...&quot; because I promptly noticed that Deathsting had popped right next to him.<br />
<br />
It was ugly, but through a glitch (dumb luck) and about 6 attempts at goofy pulling tactics, Murkglider Breeder ended up single and in camp. At 90%, I went linkdead and cursed my wireless. But oh no, it couldn't be that easy! The server had reset =)<br />
<br />
Oops, depop!<br />
<br />
While on a guild raid later that evening, still wallowing in despair at the loss of my prescious knocked-up jellyfish-thing, server crashed again.<br />
<br />
Breeder pop, no Deathsting.<br />
<br />
pwned =)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I hear a lot about people finding their breeders up on server reset. Several people I know have come to the conclusion that if he's up when the server goes down, he's not up when it goes back up...and vice-a-versa. This held true in my experience, so I thought I'd throw it out here.</div></div><hr />

after reading this why not just click your prenerf COS if you have one by this time in the game you should have one if your 65+ ..... then again i'm on a old server so.... might not be true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LoQutesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">any of you know where to find the so called Place Holder of that cute Breeder??  :confused: <br />
looked around abit in the camp and found nothing strange named mob up which could indicate as a PH. :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
The map linked shows 2 breeder PH's.  There is only one, the in the western of the two rooms shown.  It's the closest breeder to the door of the room looking in from the northwest.</div></div><hr />

Feel the same way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, this is the next one on my to do list.  thank you for all the info about this mob.  With the way that we raid, and with my job, I will most likey be trying him this weekend.  But at lest their is the other named spawn that has the runes and other items.  Get lucky with those items at least while waiten for the mob to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">just click your prenerf COS if you have one by this time in the game you should have one if your 65+ ..... then again i'm on a old server so.... might not be true<br />
<br />
Not all of us have them.  Cost and availability is a bit prohibitive.  My toon is only 2 years old so never had the opportuntity to camp the pre-nerf version before it was nerfed, and I have never had 300k+ in my bank account to buy one.  <br />
<br />
On another note, I have pulled many things without a CoS over my career...things most shadowknights would think needed a CoS.  (And before anyone asks, no, I have never once had any cloudy potions in my SK's inventory).  There is hardly anything that cannot be pulled with the tools we are given inherently, and most times Jebober &gt; CoS as a pulling tool.<br />
<br />
So, in respect to &quot;you should have one if you're 65+&quot;, that opinion is just that, an opinion, and while a CoS is nice to have, it is by no means something you &quot;SHOULD have by 65+&quot; in order to do your job as a Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well after the raids yesteday I figured i would get a group together and try my luck on the Breeder, well to gut the story short, i got my egg!!! Yay, now I just need to force m'self to stay awake, cause I stayed up till 3 in the morning and by the time i crawled into bed it was like 4am, and i need to wake up for work at 8.  I am so tired, but i must get more of the epic done after the raid today!  No sleep for me this week! LOL</div></div><hr />
