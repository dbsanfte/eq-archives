<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shoggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
I am currently a 51 Ogre SK and have lately been considering scrapping him and making a Troll SK. My reasoning for this may seem trivial to some, but I don't like that way he looks - its that simple.<br />
<br />
Seems that ogre armour graphics are very basic and limited. Trolls armor looks very intricate and it seems to me that much more time was spent developing it. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if PoP is going remedy this situation and give ogres a better range of armor graphics/styles?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">iksar faction aint so bad.  The exp penalty is a pain but nothing too horrible.  Worst part about being iksar by far is the limited armor availability during low-mid levels, but I manage.</div></div><hr />

That has to possibly be the worst reason ever to make a new character. But if you, we all know inky's look the best :]</div></div><hr />

almost as good looking as the erudites dildo on their head...<br />

also Ogre and Gnome are the 2 best looking races in EQ :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">regen Is sweat being a troll. also nice having a ot hammer with out pain in the ass puppet strings but size and vary ugly luclin modles is a issue. 2hand bash nice for soloing too but you cant use it in skele form or on horse(you'll want 2hb anyways in aa hehe)<br />
<br />
 but if i were relloing i would make a new class though. really no point in leveling same class to 50+ again hehe. rangers and pallys have alot going for them and they pretty close to playstyle of sk(except for fd) and got alot going for them in raids, groups solo. bards also own alot too in the later levels.</div></div><hr />

You'll miss being unstunnable. Trust me.  <br />
Being unstunnable from the front is overrated.<br />
<br />
Faction issues are overrated.<br />
<br />
Regen is not overrated.<br />
<br />
Looking cool is not overrated.<br />
<br />
If you feel that you'd rather have a troll SK because you think their armor looks better, I think that's a pretty good reason to switch.  Kinda hard to switch after 51 levels, I would think, but it's do-able.  And troll regen means those first five or six levels aren't as bad as they can be for other SKs ('cept Iksar, natch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chwybones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hi all I played a Troll warrior to lvl 47. Ever since lvl 30 I wished I was an Ogre because a good part of the time while I tanked I was stunned, and tanking most mobs from lvl 45+ they will stun almost every 1 outa 4 rounds and all that time you coulda of been doing damage ( or spells in your case). Getting stunned constantly is a pain and lowers your DPS (on average). I know warriors, Shadowknights, and Pally's(SUCKS FOR THEM THEY CANT BE OGRES!)  are just there to be &quot;meatshields&quot; but they do<br />
a good portion of damage for the group. I now play an Ogre Sk and being unstunable really helps with spells and such. Thanks for listening to me yapper. <br />

<br />
In the end I realized I had nothing to lose so took the plunge and transfered all my hard earned gear/money to a Troll SK. At the end of the day my 51 Ogre is not going anywhere and I can always re-start playing him if the Troll does not live up to my expectations. <br />
<br />
Even at level 3 I am noticing the enhanced hp regeneration and its wonderful - which brings me on to my next question: Does anyone know if regen items like the Iksar Ceremonial Chest Plate stack with Troll regen?<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

  <br />
Yes, they do.<br />
<br />
At level 20, your regen is something like 2 standing/6 sitting, per tick.  With an Iksar BP it is 7/11 (heh), and with a Fungi it is 17/21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Humongor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hello, thought i'd put in mah two cents..i played an ogre sk to 52 after i scrapped my warrior at 55. I soloed the ogre the whole way..i then quit eq for about a year and came back and started a troll sk..same solo routine..the trollish regen really does pay off. and my troll is almost 55 now in only about 25 played days. however..the damned exp penalty is kicking me. The ogre seemed to level alot faster 51+ than this troll does..so i think its a tossup..if you already have a 51 ogre..i'd stick with your ogre and maybe do some aa xp for improved regen. but..in hindsight..if i had it to do over again i would go troll again..just cant beat the look and the regen..and GROBB ROCKS!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I actually quit my troll sk at 51 in favor of an ogre, for a couple of reasons, one, is that I absolutley could not stand the utterly gay 2hs animation that trolls have in luclin.  Also, I missed the old troll plate helms with horns, that skull shit on the new ones sucks, and for the most part troll armor on the new models just didnt look right to me.  As far as unstunnable vs. regen arguments go, its more of playstyle and preference really.  But for straight up tanking, unstunablility really owns, and for soloing w/less downtime regen owns, but you can always get a fungi as an ogre and do a few of the regen aa's to come pretty close to a troll, so its not really such a huge disaprity in the endgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Its still the same disparity, cause if you did regen AAs and got a fungi on a troll youd be the same distance ahead of the ogre as you were when you started.</div></div><hr />
