<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, Fellow Dark Knights!  I've been out of action for the last 3 months (grad school), and have returned.  I've decided to start working on the epic, but I noticed that the Hole (Old Ruins of Paineel) has been changed up.  Now, before you begin your flames, I DID DO A SEARCH in the forums!  I have yet to find anything definitive on exactly what all changes have been made to the epic zones.  I found things on the Hole revamp, but I found them to be rather vague and ambiguous.  Anyone mind schooling me on EXACTLY what (if any) changes there might be in completing the epic, please?  This reminds me of how they changed some of the zones for the Lord of Pain's Khukri,  took the quest npc's out of Droga, and placed them in Frontier Mountains.  Anyway, I digress... Any info will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.<br />
