<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miseri SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyo,<br />
<br />
I started up a DE SK on test server, and lately been doing alot of LDON groups. I have played a SK up to 18 or so before, but its been a looong time since then, and automatically being lvl 25 Im sure theres some things I could have learned but missed out of from the experience of 1-24. Now that Im 27 and on my way to 30 in awhile, id rather not waste time going through the newb levels again since Ive done it a billion times already. Rather, perhaps my fellow ShadowKnights would share some secrets of how to control/maintain aggro around my level. I have the decent starting gear (moss and sweet shield), saved up to get a better 1hander and also have a Drakkel Icereaver n gonna try to get the other types (yes I know the importance of practicing all skills), but like I said the starting sk shield is very nice and without it I take a bad hit in ac n whatnot so will probably use it when Im the tank. So any advice for timing, spells, tips etc to keep the rogue backstabbin and the casters casting, and to be the best SK I can be, I would appreciate it. Even pointing me out to a guide would be great, Ive looked through the forums abit and couldnt find anything to my level range really. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aggro is alot easier to keep than get rid of.  I use clinging darkness on most mobs, terror on the mobs that it doesn't work on.  Only found the spiders in mm dungeons to be not affected by it too much.  If there is a chanter in group I use the terror spells and stand right next to mezzed mob while casting.  Of course a couple taunts between casts as well.  This seems to keep aggro on me when I break mez.  To get rid of aggro I stay as far back as I can when offtanking a mob while still remaining in range to hit.  I also turn off pet taunt because it might or might not add aggro to me who knows.  If I get aggro I turn off attack step back and wait a sec.  If that doesn't work I fd and start over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use clinging darkness as early as possible on every pull if you have the mana for it:<br />
<br />
If someone else is pulling then /assist them and cast CD on the incoming mob as soon as you see it (so long as it's safe to do so).<br />
<br />
If the puller brings the mob round a short corner right on top of you, hit taunt then cast CD.<br />
<br />
Hit Taunt the instant you see the mob turn away from you, then follow it up with another CD.<br />
<br />
Buy a ring of the goblin lords to cut the cast time on clinging darkness.<br />
<br />
Get a bow and arrows for emergency pulling when mana runs low (which it will do these days when you can't get KEI at your level); lets you carry on range pulling singles without having to med which is important in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Stick with the shield and MoSS or whatever; even when not tanking, on healers watch for spell casting when they're below 50% hps and bash them.  Bash from behind is particularly good for interrupting casters.<br />
<br />
Kind of patchy and condensed but it's all I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />
