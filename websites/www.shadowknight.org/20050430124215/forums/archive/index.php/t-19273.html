<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curious...my traditional gaming time is 5:30pm est to 7:30pm est (Monday - Friday), and now that I hit 62, was hoping to get into BoT a little. <br />
<br />
(of course, I am hoping for a Greater Stormwatcher horn to drop that no one wants)<br />
<br />
I was wondering how good is that zone for pick up groups, or is it traditionally just a raiding zone? Anyone on the Rathe Server get pick up groups there?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At least on Zeb, BoT has become the new Karnors... one million trains served and counting.<br />
<br />
I've been doing a lot of LDoN lately, and my Shammy friend and I usually end up filling at least one spot through the LFG tool (our guild isn't terribly crazy over LDoN at the moment).  Typically, I see around four or five people in LFG who list BoT/HoH as preferred zones, so on our server, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to put together a pickup group there.<br />
<br />
Of course, as is usually the case, for some reason people are reluctant to put together their own groups, so it will probably be up to you to form the group, but it's not hard.  The last group I had there (a guild group) went around 10 hours solid on a Saturday with occasional member changes.  We started with a cleric, enchanter, shaman, beast lord, myself and a rogue, and over the course of the day found that druids heal just fine and that chanters aren't really necessary now that lull pulling is a bit less reliable than it once was. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 62 you might not be an ideal tank in there just yet, but it's a great place at your level if you can get a group. Pulling is ridiculously easy for us in there, and the aggro control you can bring to a group will be appreciated when the cleric notices he hasnt rezzed the chanter in a while. If you do L 62 - 65 there, you'll get all your spectral spells for free too, and maybe win some ornate molds...<br />
<br />
Its a complete fucking zoo in there though-- trains and ninja looting and all that fun stuff, fights over camps...make a keyboard shortcut for FD and always mem it in the same slot. A good invis item is also nice to bring along...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I was barely 62 when I went there for my first group, and though the chanter expressed some concern over my ability to tank the mobs, I didn't have any problem at all.  Just be aware that you'll want a cleric/healer who is spot on with the CH, and that they'll need to be kept aware of your total buffed HP, as there were a couple times a healer would doze off for a bit and I'd get a little low.  Run of the mill giants seemed to hit me for around 300-400, Krigers were a little harder, and the named at Upper Sands was admittedly a bit much for me at the time...  We did finally get him down though with the Shaman throwing pretty constant patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You won't be getting a Greater Stormwatcher horn unless you are raiding that Tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>natus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya, BoT is the new Karnor's on Lanys too.  Lots of shitlistings, rant and raves on the Lanys forums to prove it.<br />
<br />
Be prepared for trains and named steals as it is quite common.  Don't forget you'll be dealing with a lot of clueless players too.<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT, you can find some halfway decent groups in there from time to time and you can make some nice experience, possible drops, and collect some parchments for your spells.  And some of the named fights are fun the first time.<br />
<br />
Ideally you'll want to be pushing 6k or higher hp and 1400 ac or so to tank effectively there but don't sweat it if you're not.  Like Groff said, it pays to have patch heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definately shouldn't be tanking here under 6k HP. And even then most groups won't want to MTing. Not too hard to get a group there as added DPS or as a puller though. If a group wants you to MT, make sure they know your HP before you start to MT because they really might need to find someone better. Remember that in this zone you will be grouping with alot of lvl 65 toons with 100+ aa's under their belt. One fuck up in upper Sands and you could wipe 3 groups out. So make sure people know what you are about, they will respect you for being honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's possible to get pick-up groups there.  Unfortunately, trains are a PITA and once you pull a Named, be prepared to have people disappear on you just to join another group to do another Named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You dont go into bot unless you do named. Xp is Ldon. generally, i just grab a group and single the named like laef etc...UE, ME is great for that too..dont stay at one place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN is great xp, except for all the downtime.  A good BoT group is more xp over time than LDoN in my experience (unless group folks are swapping a lot).<br />
<br />
My experience is that most groups won't invite a 62SK to tank for them.  At 64 they ask questions about aas and hitpoints.  I think its more likely to tank in PoS/PoV/CoD than BoT.  However, I have been asked to pull BoT before.  That I could have done at 62 and is a piece of cake in most camps.<br />

PS - I noted a UE (Upper Earth?) camp.  On Vazelle, this is DE (Deep Earth) where Gaukr pops.  We generally have 3 Earth camps (LE, ME, DE) 1 camp each for Water, Wind, and Lightning and 1 camp for Flappies.  Thus without towers we can have 7 groups, making BoT a pretty busy zone.  Generally its much busier than HoH, even though HoH has more camps (mold dropping nameds are generally harder in HoH).  Tactics is still the zone that is most like these zones pre-opening by level (/lfg will have people specifically calling out tactics access) other than the elementals (I assume as I do not have elemental access).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some groups are even more picky, even at 65 I get asked HP/AC/AA sometimes before they say to join.<br />
<br />
I haven't had too many problems in BoT some of the trains I see or more comical to me than a pain. Plus maybe I'm weird because I liked KC too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">See, I find this strange.<br />
<br />
I can believe that people are asking HP/AC/AA before inviting you to join their group, but seriously, with the gimps that are running around in BoT, one would think that no one would be that fucking arrogant...  If you think you're so good that you will only take a tank with Level/HP/AC/AA &gt; X, then you should be in Tactics or some other flagged zone.  When you lay down with swine....:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Like I said, at Upper Sands (UE/DE apparently on other servers) I tanked fine at 62, had no problems using druid healer, had some difficulty with Gaukr, but we killed him once we figured out that the 1500 proc was a pain in the ass that needed to be patched.  We also killed a Mid Sands named (don't remember the name) and I had no trouble what-so-ever with him.  I don't claim to be uber; Even at 64 my unbuffed Hp are only around 3500, my unbuffed AC is 1250-ish...  <br />
<br />
I suppose that there is a significant gap between a Lvl 62, no AA gimp and a Lvl 65, 50+ AA gimp, but seriously, any competent player will be fine.  And I suppose that's really the point, if you're competent, you'll have regular groups (whether they're guildies or not) and won't have to rely on pickups who ignorantly think that Level, gear and AA equal intelligence and skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually on my server it's sHub, WTF, sPad for the desert camps.  All other camps would be referred to as like wHub, North, eHub and the like.  On my server BoT is heavily experienced in and is easy to get a group.  I've never heard of anyone asking HP/AC/AAs before allowing someone to join a group.  I guess other servers are more picky than mine.  LDoN has always been way bad experience for me, especially with the downtime.<br />
<br />
I've tanked Bot with my 65 BST who had well under 6k HPs fully buffed and no defensive AAs at the time.  Tanking BoT isn't hard at all.  More HPs, AAs and the like help but aren't required for tanking that zone.  Not the trash experience mobs at least.  Just have a slower and everything should be fine.<br />
<br />
Trains can be really, terribly awful in the zone or you can go all day without a single one upsetting you.  If the trains bother you just don't do a Hub camp and you should be fine for the most part.  Also, 20 giants randomly running through hub is all part of the charm of the zone.<br />
<br />
One could conceivably get a rotting Greater Stormwatchers Horn.  Just get the the tower key quested, invis up and run up like mad and FD.  Only the Skygges see invis, I'm pretty sure, and generally aren't too hard to dodge.  Like I said, it's conceivable but not very likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well there are of course those concerned with hp's and ac etc but to be honest i think the groups are picky for 2 reasons, 1 they are going for the named mobs and 2 they have lazy healers that dont want to work. I have tanked each type of giant as far as wind lightning sand and blizzard&lt;?&gt; had no probs. I am only 62 3k hps and just under 1100 ac unbuffed. Just send your cleric a tell saying how many hps you have before you begin and they should be able to handle it if they are any good at healing. I did run into one cleric that said i was taking up to much mana but when all was said and done her husband had a 65 elemental war with some insane unbuffed stats. From time to time just send the cleric a tell asking if you are becomming a mana sponge and they will appreciate it, dont get pissed if you die you are really tanking some tough stuff up here at 62 especially if you do not have uber gear. Pulls come fast and chain pulling is norm so have a raid assist button set up or you will look like a gimp. Anyway thats my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont think I have xp'd in BoT for 5 months or so, since it became an open zone, but iirc the camps are South Platform, EPlat, Tables, Forge, Bees, North, West.  Theres another camp in East where the krigers spawn, but I forget what it is called.<br />
<br />
Your servers obviously suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have about 3k hps and 1100 ac or so.  Lvl 65 and about 24 AA's  ie Horse, Pet Discipline.  Ive given up on BoT.  They prefer UBAH tanks if they can get them, when they cant, they will wait.  I just solo or work with friends or go faction.  Im a RPer in a RP guild so if you want the BoT or better, get into a higher end guild to get the gear needed.  I content where I am, killing Felwithe guards for cash and soloing my exp spot for exp and getting a LDoN when im in the mood to MT for a group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BOT GREAT exp much, much better than LDoN.  Mobs hit very hard though so be ready for it.  Use anything you can to keep your HPs up.  I use Pact of Death a lot.<br />

Demem all you disease spells.  They won't work period.<br />
<br />
I have had very good luck with BoT on Morelle-Thule but my groups have never camped the exit so trains have never been an issue.  Lots of camps here too.<br />
<br />
My experience has been that groups usually exp camp the spot where named appear so there is no way to join groups just for the named except during non-peak hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs in Sands don't see invis, so getting to Gaukr isn't a problem.  I don't know about the other wings, as the only time I've ever killed them we were camping at the bottom of the ramp to the wing.  Still didn't have a problem with trains, but there was a group doing the named deeper in and we didn't stay long enough to see how it was when they left.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
This is not true. The mob in BoT are only disease immune in the one wing, the south one (STop, SBottom, Forge, Tables on my server). All other wings have mobs that are immune/resistant to other types of spells.<br />
<br />
And as for the Greater Stormwatcher's Horn thing... i'm living proof that it is possible to get one without being in the raid. One day I was XPing at the birds (up near the tower entrances) and the leader of the raid called out that the Horn was rotting on so-and-so's corpse (I forget the name); so me, being a greedy little bastard, I get the cleric in my group (only person around me with a tower key) to port me up there. I Invised up, ran as far as i could, flopped a little bit of the way, ended up by getting chainstunned just outside of the room where it dropped (I could see the mob's corpse) and then dying. So I ran my ass back, got back up there without too much incident, and lo and behold, the corpse was gone already :mad: . Anywho, it is possible to get the horn, but its pretty unlikely, so don't get your hopes up too high.</div></div><hr />
