<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shortfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering how many folks I need to bring (mostly time equipped) for this fight.  Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I recommend you do grab 15-20 people. He is not very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About how many recommended for, some being Sol Ro Tower up to EP's? I was thinking around 5-6 groups, the hoped for main tank being a warrior with a large number of AA's, about 9.5kish unbuffed, maybe closer to 10k as of later, around 2k AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I took 30, massive overkill... any ep level guild take 20</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">same as Krushum.  took 32, most were laughing at how pathetic he was.  only thing i recommend DJ is a pair of MGB BST's for Para, the mana drain is annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Matador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">got him with 22 people 3 clerics one of them two boxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We took him down with 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nightjackal77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Took him down with......well...ah......40 or so (mostly VT with a bit of EP folks thrown in)...really think he died to fright more then the 28 melee that where pushing each other out the way try to get their own shots in.<br />
<br />
Overkill hell yeah think more like 20 would have work. But rather only had to try once...so overkill is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 groups of late ep early time gear could do it i think, tanking and healing is easy, just bring dps and u dont need to worry about more then 3 AEs.<br />
<br />
i had about 24 people, big overkill, and we are late EP early time geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Got him to 4-5% with 9 people, was able to take him down with 10.  4-5 groups should have no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Malamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Took 33, but only because guild called it as a nightcap raid when we were done with our standard raids for the evening.  Mid EP guild.<br />
<br />
Archfiend Malamar Blackforge<br />
Dreadlord of Lore Keepers<br />
Povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Used 12... I don't even think 8 of them were needed, it was a long fight though.</div></div><hr />
