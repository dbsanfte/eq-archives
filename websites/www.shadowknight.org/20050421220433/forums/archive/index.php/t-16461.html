<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It isn't worthwhile now.  For the most part, it wasn't worthwhile when I did it either, but it was the satisfaction of completing the quest that made it worth doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sin_vraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weapon is worthwhile b/c it has a life tap proc on it.<br />
Try using it , makes a big difference in downtime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why would one do greenmist:<br />
<br />
1. I was really into the quests.  Quests are fun and this one was well done.  I liked being the first one on the server to do them.<br />
<br />
2. TP was a brand new server and good weapons / money hadnt trickled down.  PoP and Luclin didnt exist.  This quest provided my primary weapon until about 45 when I looted a MoSS.<br />
<br />
3. Its doable by about 10 people (hardest being chardok library) in their mid 50s.  Epics are not.  Its a damn good weapon for the mid 50 person who's not privy to buying all their gear in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
4. Pulling / tanking crawls in HS and chardok is invaluable experience.<br />
<br />
I guess you can buy better now.  Now please go do so instead of trolling the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If someone pays attention to what is said in the quest, and what happens, it's one of the most enlightening quests regarding Kunark lore. At 58 I still use it sometimes, when I MT and need the regen from the lifetap. I've had and used Greenmist for about 22 levels now. All in all, doing that quest was one of the most beneficial and enjoyable things I've ever done in EQ.  That's why I did it at least</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh, but if you read up on the lore of what the Green Mist was, it makes the Greenmist more &quot;appropriate&quot; for use on the snakeys :) <br />
<br />
This is a really well done quest. Unlike some other Epics or quests, it's a lifelong quest for the Iksar - starting with their newbie weapon all the way up to the Greenmist itself.  <br />
<br />
It 's taken me into zones I'd never really taken the time to explore (Mistmoore, Kaesora, etc) and you learn some pretty valuable skills in these zones (LOTS of indoor work) while working on the khukris.</div></div><hr />

Great thought but this is Ever-Quake.  No one cares 2 shits about roleplay or reasons for doin stuff except to GET MEEZ DA PHAT L3WTZ DAMMIT KTHXLA~.  RP is dead.  Sony killed it.<br />
<br />
The idea of actually questing for items any more has been pretty much snuffed out by the devs for EQ today.  Now it's all about getting 40+ guildies together to farm endlessly for keys to get to mobs that you need 50+ to kill to loot 3 items and then be thankful for it.<br />
<br />
I soloed my greenmist (except mirror, i MQ'd it.  i like my OT faction) i loved the quest.  was the most fun i have had doing a quest next to completeing my epic.  <br />
<br />
If you cannot answer for yourself why you should do the quest then you shouldn't bother with it.  Sorta like asking whether or not you should play an SK or a paly.  If you have to ask, then just go play a paly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skaarx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also, please notice that you could post your question on all threads about weapons that do not have the name Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qedemel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why did I do this quest?<br />
<br />
1.  This sword might not be all that great for you extensive bazaar shoppers or higher level ppl out there, but the stats were slightly better than the Noctivigant Blade I've been using for the last few levels.<br />
2.  The proc.  This thing has already saved my backside when soloing more times than I can count.<br />
3.  It's a 1hs.  I like being able to still weild a shield and bash those pesky casters.<br />
4.  The satisfaction of having completed the quest, particularly as a dark elf.  Parts of this quest took my places I might otherwise never have gone, and parts were very enlightening.  Admittedly, tho, some parts DID bore me to tears.<br />
5.  The graphic.  Seriously, how many swords do you see in-game that have this graphic.  I have personally only seen one, and that's the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Also, while some of you may say that roleplay is dead, I find that I enjoy my play time much more if I'm not in such a mad rush to level-up.  Taking time out for quests allows me to meet new people, go to new zones, flesh out my skillset, and otherwise have more fun and become a better player.  If this is not your thing, don't worry about it, but don't knock those who are into it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have it and im glad i do.  now i dont have to go to the basement of ssra and farm rares for rare drops to actually make a shissar bane weapon.  If youve spent the time to get the Ring of the Shissar.  Then you know you hate ssra enough to not go back into the basement to farm the bane weapons again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chezebreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Look I have looked for a better weapon than the Greenmist and just cant find it... <br />
<br />
Theres no weapon 1hs that beats the attack delay DPS this weapon does because it ALWAYS procs. I like the 30 point regen and damage it dose to the enemies also it keeps me alive... With the greenmist, LV 58 life drain spell, shamans replenishment, me being a troll, having 3 in AA regen, and the fungi tunic on makes my regen a whopping 109 or so a tick. So the mob has to do more than 109 damage every 6 seconds for me to even feel it. I can fight for days with any mobs because I have that kind of regen. and if I ever get low I can quick cast a 336 soul leech to get some quick HP. And then the final reason the Greenmist kicks so much ass is because you KEEP aggro with it. Theres nothing mobs hate more than a hit from the greenmist proc. Its like 500+ aggro added.<br />
<br />
Im a 61 troll SK and I would not let anyone talk ill of this weapon. I hope to get Innys Curse soon so I can start getting even more hp regen when I hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sehris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if eq lore or rp mean anything to you, then you wil appreciate this weapon and what it takes to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">... because not everyone plays EQ as an unwinnable quest for PHAT LEWT.<br />
<br />
Yes, some of us DO play for fun still!</div></div><hr />

RP is dead. <br />
<br />
Sony killed it.<br />
<br />
Ummm...<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
So then, um, perhaps you could tell me why Sony is promoting this website: Everquest Role-Players (http://pub147.ezboard.com/beverquestroleplayers) ... if they killed Role-Playing?<br />
<br />
My Guild is a RP Guild on Bertox, we have a RP enemy... I can asure you, that RP in EQ is still very much alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I started it because at the time I was wielding a Noct blade in my 50's. I didn't finish until last night and am proud of my accomplishment. It was a huge pain in the rear to do and in fact I am just coming into a position to begin raiding Ssra where it will also be useful.<br />
<br />
It has a unique graphic among weapons and a 30pt regen proc which isn't bad either. Over all i think the people who do it are proud of it and thats why they finish the quest and use it.</div></div><hr />
