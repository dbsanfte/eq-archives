<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is an idea I have about &quot;rebreathing&quot; life into epics (I consider the Greenmist as an &quot;epic weapon&quot;)<br />
<br />
Let's face it, anymore getting someone's epic seems a bit trivial, maybe not in the effort, but at least in it's value. Truely as it stands the only epic that is really and truely &quot;worth&quot; getting is the cleric epic. All other epics eventually get bagged in some way or another, which to me seems wrong to do with a weapon that is suposed to make you one of the most powerful people of your class.<br />
<br />
So, on to the idea:<br />
<br />
First, I would add 3 more augment slots to epics (which would include the Greenmist, and possibly other classes weapons that are similiar to the Greenmist). Now, the first slot would stay the same, a type 4 for a proc augment (this way nothing is changed if you decide to not do the quest(s) ) The other 3 slots would a type that is epic only (like type 8 are time only). The &quot;epic only&quot; augments that could be placed into these slots would all be quested, and there would be 2 types of them.<br />
<br />
1) General epic augments: There would be quests to get general epic augments, ones that can be added to any epic of any class. The would be similiar things to the type 2 augments on LDoN merchants, just general stat/utility augments of some type, add damage to weapons, lower delay, add stats, etc.<br />
<br />
2) Class specific augments: These would be class specific types much like the effects that are curently on epics. These would range from added damage types, procs, clicky effects, skill mods, etc. All very class specific things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the quest should be semi-epic like, or even epic like, taking anywhere from a whole group to a raid to get some of the pieces. Obviously, the general augments would be easier, maybe even letting some of the weaker ones be soloable, and the class specific ones be more full group/raid oriented.<br />
<br />
Inaddition, there could be special solvent that will take off the augment without destroying it. This could either be done is a kit you could carry around, which could let you change your aug to the situation (nothing is worse that spending points on a cold based DD and then find yourself fighting cold immune NPCs). That might, depending on the types of augments you could collect, be overpowering, so maybe just make it so you can only change the aug at the augment sealer in the camps maybe.<br />
<br />
Also, I know this puts the total slots on an epic to 4, which is more than any other item that is in the game, but then these are special, extremly magical and powerful weapons we're talking about. There would also be enough of the quests that each epic could basically be unique, or at least enough that there wouldn't be the same 3 quests everyone would do. So that instead you can pick which 3 augments you would want on it, and not be forced to do a specific quests for an augment you might not want. (i.e. you can still fill the 3 augment places while not *having* to get augments you might not want)<br />
<br />
Well, it's just an idea and I thought I'd share and see what people think about it (and maybe point out flaws in it that I don't see atm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like it, sounds like a fun idea.  That being said the one and only augment that would matter would be the one that raised the dmg of an epic to elemental/time ratios. procs or effects of any kind would lose out to this and if this augment wasn't included then the epic would still be second rate regardless of what effect you added to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can't fairly consider greenmist &quot;epic&quot;.  It's not particularly &quot;epic&quot; for more reason than one, and not all classes have access to equivilants.  Warriors have a shitty partisan, shammys have a half-decent cudgel, monks have a bracer, and I believe necros have something (though I don't remember exactly what) - that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">necro skullcaps and warrior partisans are unfinished<br />
<br />
none of the other classes have subepics, except paladins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pally's are just majorly gimpified predecessors of the epic though - by no means even relatively close to on par with the Fiery Defender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amaevl shadebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the monk bracer is actually a fist, about on par with the greenmist :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That being said the one and only augment that would matter would be the one that raised the dmg of an epic to elemental/time ratios <br />
<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, you are right, so perhaps we just let epics have 3 slots, 1 type 4, and 2 that are epic only augments. The first augment slot could raise the epic's ratio to PoP type weapons' ratio, probably the est way to do this is a straight add on to the damage (the delay on the epic is nice, just long enough to cast spells inbetween and not interupt spells). The second epic only could be one that gives stats, bumping an epic's stats to PoP lvl stats. I guess it might be a little too much to have enough augment quests that nearly every epic was differant...<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't fairly consider greenmist &quot;epic&quot;. It's not particularly &quot;epic&quot; for more reason than one, and not all classes have access to equivilants. Warriors have a shitty partisan, shammys have a half-decent cudgel, monks have a bracer, and I believe necros have something (though I don't remember exactly what) - that's it. <br />
<br />
To me, when I was lvl 52 and doing the Greenmist quest, it felt like an epic quest, and I supose I always considered it a mini-epic... but you are right, not all classes are subject to something similiar, though, that's never stopped SoE before. When Warriors get thier epic, they get both 2 1hsers, and a 2hser. When Beastlords finish thier epic, they get both claws. When rangers do thier epic, they have to get each sword seperately (and really, shouldn't rangers get a kick ass bow somewhere in the ranger epic quest?), and rogues don't even have a second epic weapon (all duel wielding classes but them get 2 epic weapons, except monks, who's epic is a worn item and not a weapon, at least I *think,* I could, and may be wrong). Honestly, Paladins should have something equivalent to the Greenmist, and they should be counted as epic, or at least quasi-epic weapons, but I wouldn't be overly upset if something like this was introduced to the game and they left out the Greenmist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, anyone know and e-mail adress where I could send a refined version of this idea to SoE ? I don't think I could fit it all in a /feedback report, and it would be nice to take the time to explain it in legnth...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd be happy with a quest that lets me turn my epic into an augment that I could put on my current weapon.  In the best of worlds, it would also give whatever weapon it was placed on the same model as the epic had.</div></div><hr />
