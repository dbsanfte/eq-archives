<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Squeeksack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried him last night with 25 peeps .. cleric went oom at 67% mana drained owned us .. any suggestions ... thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Airemus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What kind of equipment are we talking about here? Is your group of people Kael/VT/PoP etc, equipped? 25 is overkill in most cases, but it all depends on the equipment of your people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Squeeksack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild is farming ele now .. working on time  .. so decent equipment.. i think it was lack of a good strat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You were light on DPS.... There is no Strat to him .. MT Gets Agro and Reduce HP to 0<br />
<br />
The diffrance from a EP Guild and a Time+ guild is Alot...  You need to Post more then just &quot;Ep&quot;. How about Raid make up ? Key profils .. Like your MT's , Yours?  Guild Page ?<br />
<br />
Your asking us for help with infor but we need a but more to go on <br />
<br />
I would say EP level .. You need more help... But it's a cetch 22...  the more people you add the more ppl to get hit by AE the more healing you have to do the  clerics you have to add... ect ect...  <br />
<br />
If you want a suggestion .. See if you can arange your Epic fight right after your guilds secduled raid day. And make it a known event. Get support of your Officers and at the end of the Offical raid have everyone who wants to help stay in raid go to WW. You will get probly get 50%+ of your full raid force. That will improve your chances of sucess by quit a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Doser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did him with like 3 groups.  14 were Time geared folks and the rest were EP geared.  Basically what Iosif said is what you should go by.<br />
<br />
In your post you said cleric went oom around 67%....How many clerics did you actually have for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarkoz_innoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im in an EP lvl guild as well. Did several succesfull runs on Sir E.F<br />
<br />
MT : about 2k AC and 12khp , has epic 1.5 to use for tanking as well. (was never in any danger what so ever)<br />
<br />
Main clerics = 6500 ish mana and Maxxed out manaregen<br />
<br />
Our setup consisted of 28 people, 3 cleric, 3 druids, and mix of the rest classes.<br />
<br />
Fight was over in 3 min or so, I was at 20% m (6k mana total) and it was cake all the way ( I was Ramp tank at 10k hps).<br />
<br />
Dont know if this help but you can compare setup/gearwise, a post was made by other in Epic forum where they list thier setup</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Squeeksack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for info ... think my biggest prob was DPS. had 4 or 5 cleric most with 6k + mana pulls and 15+ FT. <br />
<br />
Tank was an 11k+ WAR with 10k war on page.<br />
<br />
your cleric pop any MGB for heals or did dru / other healers keep people alive?<br />
<br />
guess i was looking for more of a where to fight him .. is it going to matter? ( i was in tunnel .. did not get adds but no way to out range the ae - anyone fight outside and not take ae? )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just kill him where he stands.<br />
<br />
<br />
the more DPS you bring the easier it gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some strategies to try or mix in:<br />
<br />
1.  Put all clerics in group with a bard.<br />
2.  Move a couple clerics far away, and have them come in late in the fight to heal.  His melee isn't really all that ridiculous despite his max hit.  That way they come in FM, and your other clerics move out of range to med a bit.<br />
3.  Have someone call the AE so casters can move in and out of range, save your mana<br />
4.  Bring Melee DPS,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Myth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We had the warrior stonewall, had healer-types save MGB's for heals until actual engagement and basically just burned down. Get ALL resists up, this includes using a bard and the rest is simply not pushing Sir Elmonious Falmont OOR of the healers.  With a mid-elem and less guild / raid it should take 4-5 groups tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Knevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On a side note, and I know people have been looking for this... Falmont respawns every 30 minutes on the dot.<br />
<br />
Knev</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Biglogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Took 14 of us and 4 bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Knevil is correct. I watched 2 SK's get epic'd lastnight and after the first Falmont died, the second spawned exactly 30 mins later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I did mine, we had 19 toons, at least 4 of those were boxed twinks. 3 clerics &amp; 2 druids, 1 bst iirc. We spread the clerics and druids out. I did page tank with druid twink for spot heals, had 2 clerics watching MT just in case. MGB'd CR, SotW &amp; Para as needed, as well as group heals. Maybe had 3 die and was oom all around at the end, but we had good DPS in our rogues that were there. Folks that were there ranged from a mix of EP/GoD geared ( total mismatch on pieces ) to much, much less. As others said, just burn him down...the less AEs you take, the better off you are. Don't hold back on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Killed Klandi and then pulled him to there.  Least likely spot to get adds in zone I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Two groups of end game players was way over kill. One group with a bard is doable.</div></div><hr />
