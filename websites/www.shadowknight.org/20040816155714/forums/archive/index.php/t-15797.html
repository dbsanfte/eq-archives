<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aanian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just recently dinged 49, was happily running to buy all the spells for 49. Cept for Life leech, the new life tap i was really looking forward to getting. Till i was informed by another SK, that that spell was a quest spell &lt; BAH! &gt;   .<br />
  Anyways what i'm driving at is this, after looking at the quest for the spell , is it really worth going after or just wait till my next life tap spell at level 55 .<br />
  Asking for a little guidance please from my fellow sk's out in the world.<br />
 many thanks <br />

<br />
Unless you're of the school that figures why buy any spells until you're 65, and then only buy enough to fill one set of spell gems. In this case you will want to post a later question asking &quot;what spells do you use at 65 ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amuse yourself, the quest will make you feel like an SK and set you up with a decent situational spell.<br />
<br />
Or maybe not, what the hell do I know I'm not uber.</div></div><hr />

I am uber.<br />
<br />
I am feeling helpfull lately so i'll give ya a little hint. Use the fucking search button. Oh and you cant do the quest untill you are 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Always that rude, Jupke. Into the corner and be ashamed!<br />
<br />
Basically he is right though - if you choose not to quest a spell that will carry you well into your 59th level because it takes time or effort you should play a Chanter or some other kiss ass class maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's worth it.  When you are down to 50% health, which means  you can't BW any further(without FA AA), lifetap a local green (snow bunnies in EW exist for this purpose) for 280.  When your mob is at 23% and your Spear of Pain hasn't reloaded yet, hit it with Life Leach to make it turn tail.  It takes a lot of mana, but it's got the same ratio as other lifetaps.  Heck, if you don't want to camp some tough mobs for the quest drops, buy the items in bazaar.   A lot of people still hunt in Guk to get the necklaces, as well as SolB for the stone.  Vox raids tend to get your prickly pears.  Hop in on a Vox raid until you get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ya, I did the quest.... went on raids to get the item... blew my cash on getting the triggers... and there came the big skelle... raid like force with a bunch of my friends in 40's and 50's... mostly guildies and a few hanging out in Rathe Mountains that wanted a little excitement...<br />
<br />
did I enjoy the quest... hell yah...<br />
did I spend too much money and time... probably<br />
is the spell worth it... well... in all honesty, it's fun, sometimes useful... but the ratio is pretty poor, and you can't REALLY get it till 51 (when the quest mob will talk to you), when Siphon Life comes into play...<br />
<br />
lot of money, lot of time... if anything, would like to see an increase in this spells power... bah... maybe I'll bug some mages for some focus items... that should help...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just checked back in some year old logs not to talk out of my ass - Kazzel will talk to you at level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Neblos Remus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just want to Know how to start this quest<br />
thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Go to Rathe Mountains and talk to Kazzel.<br />
<br />
Or if you want to do it like most people, get your prickly pear from permafrost, white gold necklace from lower guk, the whatchamacallit stone from Sol B (forgot the name of it and I even did the quest. heheh) and about 3k plat so you can just run around.  I'm too lazy or I'd find a link for the quest, but it's easy to find.<br />
<br />
Nice spell.  Now that I'm 58 I should probably get rid of it, but I don't use it so incredibly much that I'm willing to give up the 280 damage for a faster recharge 220.  Next lifetap I get will do over 280 and then I will finally get rid of life leech for good.  That 3k spell was a blast to get, and has been useful for a lot of levels.  No complaints here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>despedis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Going for it with my 51 SK. Have not been able to get on a Vox raid anytime I'm on, and the only time I've seen the Prickly Pear on sale in the bazaar the jerk wanted 750pp for it!This is the last piece I need too.   :mad:   Aren't we getting raped enough with the 3k we give away to NPCs? F'n Dr00ds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally, I didn't do the quest nor even consider it.  I certainly don't belittle those that do or did, of course.  Because my SK was created / played in the Velious era (as opposed to pre-Kunark), I had post-50 spells to look forward to, and the less efficient Vampiric Curse if I wanted a lifetap over time.<br />
<br />
Then again, when I got Vampiric Curse I was alarmed at the mana it took and never used it after trying it out for a day.  It's very very rare that even now I ever use Bond of Death (loaded it up for Behemoth a couple days ago, but otherwise hadn't memmed it in months).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I completed the IC after PoP came out, so I can understand the pride that comes with completing a SK quest, even an outdated one.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can any1 tell me what his spawn time or PH is or if he spawns in a few places?<br />
<br />
Thx for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just got this spell recently and am kinda wishing I used the 3k for something different. I don't solo very much, and when I group there is always a healer so this spell is very seldom in my line-up.<br />
Fast cast? I think it's pretty slow to use during melee. If you solo alot it might be worth it. With Virtue or Temperance it only heals for a couple %. That's just my opinion from my experience though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">everything in this quest also drops off the leet mob named Bazzar Trader. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">IM NOT UBER! WWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO, I have no idea why I freackin said that, But to the last post im gonna have to say...rofl...phew, Glad I got dat off my chest, Ya see, this post made no sense whatsoever because I want to test out my sig, =p, IGNORE MEH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>sin_vraal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This spell is aweseom until 60 for 2 simple reasons.<br />
<br />
1) 2.5 casting time. You can actually get this spell off while tanking. thats 280 FAST damage.  Hands down better than your 75 and below taps.  its a good compliment to your 150 and 220 taps, b/c often at those levels they are too hard to chain cast in combat.<br />
<br />
2) it does 280 damage! you get a 280 nuke at 50th level. thats pretty darn good. It if you cast your 400 and 260 spear, then 280 tap is right up your alley. <br />
<br />
Only at level 60 does your new tap drain soul become strong enough to justify not casting drain soul. At 60, you have a 338 tap for almost no mana (compared to other taps). and packets an extreme whallop.<br />
<br />
Obviously I dont have to say getting Improved damage 3 on both of those taps is AMAZING.<br />
<br />
If this Tap had no recast time (or atleast better than a lousy 2 minutes) it would be completely uber and SK would be the king of tanks at levels 50 60. Since it doesnt, its mostly just 'good'.<br />
<br />
Worth every plat you spend on it... unless you PL yourself fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I took time to get life leech at 50. Well worth the 3k i had to spend. It's was my main tap from 50-59. It has saved me from more late CH's then i care to think about. Also skelly at end of quest is a fun fight.<br />

Hope that helps *shrug*</div></div><hr />
