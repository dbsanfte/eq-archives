<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iamask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on the earring at the moment, now I need those 4 shards drop from the Praesertums in seru 3rd lv buildings.<br />
<br />
From the previos post , someone said it can be done by 1 group with pet class like mage  and neco. is it possible to be done with 3 pet classes? Does this trick still work ?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hknightismaname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get 3-4 Pet class's and 1 or 2 healer type done this so many times its too easier than tanking them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All minis are one groupable, you need a cleric and as many pet classes as possible, ench beeing the best, magicians beeing 2nd.<br />
It is very nice if you can have two magicians in group, since they can coh peoples (or each other) who could be ported to jail<br />
<br />
Best tanking pet = a dual wielding charmed mob: they have nice aggro and good hps.<br />
But charm WILL break during the fight, you need a magician pet or another charmed mob to taunt-tank the mini while ench is recharming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Either bind your folks at the battle spot, put a wizard in the jail and TL those who get banished... or pull the mob to the jail and fight it right there so the banishement isnt an issue.<br />
<br />
Both work fine.<br />
<br />
TL is 8sec cast time<br />
CoH is 12 sec cast time + cost a pearl<br />
If you have to chose, go with the wiz (make sure your folks get a new bind right after each battles, being bind up there isnt exacly safe).</div></div><hr />
