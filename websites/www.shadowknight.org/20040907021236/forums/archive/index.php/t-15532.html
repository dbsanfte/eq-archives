<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helvictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First a bit of background... I quit EQ a while ago, and I am finally in a postion to play again.  I have maybe 5k worth of crap on all my old characters to buy gear with, but that's about it. All my old peeps are gone, so I don't have much help getting any more cash. I want to start an SK, but I am having issues deciding between Iskar and Troll. With the funds I have available, which race will be kindest to me until I get to a point where I can make some money and upgrade gear? I have read basically every post here, and I understand that in later life, race is not much of an issue. Now that trolls start in Neriak that kind of turns me off, I loved the swamp back in the day, but I can overlook that. Is the no plate thing really an issue with Iskar? Kind of a noob question, but with all the new weapons and what not, I gather it is smart to max out all of your weapon skills available to you? Any other info, suggested gear/weapons to pick up would aslo be appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />

I did roughly the same thing and made a troll. Let it be known that if you decide to make a SK of Troll/Iksarian line that you will be in  PAIN when you level from the 40-65. It hurts...from 30-43 it took me 5 hours to level and only got worse I solod and grouped and it was same both ways...Some people are really power gamers and play all day but Im a swimmer and I have 2 1/2 hour practices in morn and 1 1/2 hours in night...I have band practice and youth group...I dont have TONS of leveling and twinking time but I'm roughing it until I see the shining sun at the end of the tunnel.<br />

Whichever one makes you go wow when you look them is the one you should choose.<br />
<br />
which race will be kindest to me until I get to a point where I can make some money and upgrade gear?  <br />
<br />
With the advent of the bazaar there will probably be very little difference in the amount of cash it takes to twink either race. It all depends on how much you want to spend.<br />
<br />
Now that trolls start in Neriak that kind of turns me off  <br />
<br />
PoP = xp anywhere you want. Starting citys are really just a fomality these days.<br />
<br />
Is the no plate thing really an issue with Iskar? <br />
No, once you get to Velious you will have the option to wear plate. Up till then there are plenty of chain armors that will serve you just as well as plate.<br />
<br />
I gather it is smart to max out all of your weapon skills available to you?  <br />
<br />
Yes is it smart to max out all of your weapon skills. It will take several levels to do but don't worry if some fall a little behind, they will catch up.</div></div><hr />

I was half expecting to be flamed to death after reading some of the posts on this board. I appreciate the help. I'm still a bit rusty in game, correct me if Im wrong, but Trolls have a higher exp penalty then Iskar, correct? Also, with the 5k ish cash I have on hand, any suggestions for twinkage, either for Iskar or Troll? And, I bet this will stir peeps up, what would be a good way to allocate my starting stats? I actually had an Iskar monk back in the day before I quit, so I am still semi-familiar with Cabilis. maybe that will be helpful. Also I have read many of you mention cultural armor, is that a factor when choosing race/deity, and if so, what would those factors be? Thanks again in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nubbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iksar and Trolls have the same xp penalty.<br />
Palte, starting stats and faction means nothing nowdays.<br />
<br />
When all races have their stats maxed Iksar will always have 40 more AC then any other race. Iksar stats are also easier to max since they are well balanced unlike Trolls. Str and Sta items are overflooding the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
But what it really boild down to is which race you will enjoy playing.<br />
Personaly, I can't enjoy any other race but Iksar. It is impossible for me to play anything else.</div></div><hr />

As a troll, I think you will find that most agree on dumping all 20 points in INT without question.<br />
<br />
As for iksar, its a little trickier.  If you realisticaly project getting into a top-end raiding guild (top-end Luclin at a minimum), I would dump all into INT.  If not, dump all into STA.<br />

   The reason is that character difficulty, xp gain, etc.  is based off of  Human.  How do I know this?  I started playing a very long time ago, when the hybrid penalty was still in effect.  Just about everybody who was making a second/third/etc character knew these numbers.  I was paying 35% with my semi-retired woodelf ranger, back then.  I trully admire those that had the guts to make a troll or ogre SK and stick with it, back then.<br />
   I agree, however.  Make one of each, and see which one makes you want to hurry and get home from work, to hop on the 'puter and log him on. <br />

Im not sure I agree, but perhaps I am not understanding your post.  Pre-Kunark, the XP penalties were as follows (this is an excerpt from a long post):<br />
<br />
&quot;R VALUES -------- Barbarian 105 Dark Elf 100 Dwarf 100 Erudite 100 Gnome 100 Half Elf 100 Halfling 95 High Elf 100 Human 100 Ogre 115 Troll 120 Wood Elf 100&quot;<br />
<br />
I believe all you need to do is add Iksar 120 and VahShir 100 and you have today's XP penalties.<br />

Most hybrids when they get to high levels turn out to be casters. Are SK's the same way, or can they still get in there and deal and take Damage? I want to do a DE, but would that  be a good choice for the fighter role? or should i go with a more &quot;Stronger&quot; race? Dont wanna be a weak SK. And not sure if i will have uber gear to make up for short comings of strenth /stamina etc.<br />
What is expected of a SK in the  High End game? Cast or Tank? Both?<br />

What DOES matter is if you can bare being  your character. I chose Iksar for the following reasons. <br />

~Iksar are just plain eye-candy to me.  <br />

~Who hasn't wanted to be a lizard of some sort, whether it be Godzilla or Barney.<br />

~I find the lore behind the Iksar fascinating.<br />

Wow...  I've been looking  for that, as I have been running off memory for the past few years.  Could you link me to that post?  It's a bit off from what I was told when a friend got me addicted, years ago.  But, that's to be expected, as I noticed his mind (he had read the post)  is about as good as a rusted steel trap....<br />
<br />
And, as always, somebody always brings it up....  once you get to the high end game (which I have yet to see, but I do have a 50+, somewhere...)  race doesn't exactly matter in the end.  Gear will tend to make most stats pretty well equal.  That being the case, it depends upon how you feel about the look of your character, and whether or not you are going to be soloing more than grouping.  It also depends upon whether or not  you will ever be in a high end raiding guild.   <br />
<br />
Aiyanna-  from my personal experience, DEs tend to be a bit weak during the teens.  They do have a larger mana pool to make up for it.  If you want all around average stats that are easy to build from, look at Human and Iksar.  If you want a bit stronger (although they have a lower int) look at troll/ogre.<br />
  <br />
Hybrids are casters in the high end of the game?  Thats a new one on me.  I thought that hybrids were damage dealers: Rangers use the bow, we smack AND cast, pallys smack, and beastlords punch the stuffing out of said mob.  The only reason we cast is that we have offensive spells...<br />

I'll take all info here into consideration. If I create a character and find later its not what i want, I'll just do over. I've only been playing EQ for 4 months, still trying to find my groove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>hardcoredummy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well let me tell you my experience.<br />
<br />
I had 300k to twink an SK and have some fun.  I loved the iksars looked, and figured the regen would be a big help.  So i went with that.<br />
<br />
I started out with a full set of Royal Engraved Velium and a wide variety of weapons like Reaver, Large Dragonclaw Shard, etc.   And a fungi and CoCW to make the soloing easier... even though most of the time i actually boxed my 65 enchanter to help out with C and haste, slows, rampage, etc.<br />
<br />
I did fine, and in 2 days, i was 45 and ready to upgrade my gear.  Now, i have a pretty large sum of pp, but i couldn't find anything decent to upgrade with.  No cultural armor that was worth it,  and even though i could find a piece here or piece there to upgrade, it was a pain and very expensive... unless i went all ornate, and back then (a month and a half ago), they were very expensive.<br />
<br />
Then i was looking here, and saw Fulvous armor, and got moist.  Couldn't believe there was a cultural armor that was so good that some pieces (most infact) beat ornate.  They were more expensive than other cultural armor, but FAR FAR cheaper than what i could have found for my iksar.<br />
<br />
So i rolled up a new Ogre SK.  I learned from the earlier experience with the Iksar that regen wasn't important at all.  At least up to 45, the differences between a regen race and non regen race wasn't that significant.... since i grouped most of the time anyways, and if i was soloing, i was fear kiting.<br />
<br />
So i rolled an Ogre SK, passed all the gear i had on the Iksar to the Ogre... and bought a complete set of Fulvous minus the bp (i kept the Wind Worn i had that i bought for the iksar) to bank until i outgrew the Royal Engraved stuff.<br />
<br />
And started the leveling again.  I had played the Iksar from 1-45 in a couple of days earlier, so the memories were still fresh on what it felt like to level with an Iksar vs the Ogre.  And let me tell you, the Ogre was MUCH easier to level.  I didn't have str problems, which i often did with the Iksar... even though i was twinked to all hell, with tinker bags, i still had weight problems!  I think my weight was hovering at 120 or so with all the equipment i had.  With the ogre, i was at 170 or so i think.<br />
<br />
Once i hit 45-46 and could start wearing the cultural and other gears i had banked, i was simplied shocked as to my stats.  At 50, i had better AC/HP than some 65 wars/sk/pallies.<br />
<br />
So the lesson here:  ogres have an easier time with equipment than iksars.  You don't have to be dealing with the amount i had, even small upgrades like bracers were a pain.  I could go either with Silver Chitin Handwraps, or Bracelet of Fortitude... both were about 5-8k on my server, but Fulvous was much better.  Legs were a real pain, only real upgrade was Blood Runed Greaves, but for a little more, the Fulvous puts them to shame... infact, i doubt i'll grade them with Ornate.  Vambraces, helm, boots, etc, with the iksar the upgrades weren't as good, and more expensive in the end.  <br />
<br />
Iksars do have the added benefit of a higher ac bonus and innate regen, but like i said about the regen earlier, it didn't matter much.  At the lower levels (pre 45), the differences between them was very small.  AC bonus?  I hear the differences between an iksar and any other race at 65 is 50 ac... 50ac doesn't make up for the lack of gear (or gear that is easy to obtain) that's buyable imo.  I had looked at allakhazam, and upgrades would have been sweet if i could have raided ntov, vt, and such... but i couldn't (and didn't wnat to even if i could).  <br />
<br />
But like so many have said... in the end, it all evens out.  50ac won't make a difference when you're talking about 1400+ ac.  Stats like str and stam are so easy to max as well.  But the journey to the end may be a factor to some.  Reading these boards, i figured with 300kpp+, i could be one of those that could buy their way to equalization.  But i couldn't... maybe if i had another 200k i could have.  Mithril boots, white dragon helm, etc.  But i'm sooo glad i started the Ogre.  Fulvous is great.  On my server, i've only seen a couple of pieces here and there for sale in the bazaar.  Whenever i do upgrade a part and put the fulvous on sale, they get nabbed so quickly, even though i put the price twice of what the other culturals are.  I'm so lucky i found somebody that was selling a full suit.  And i've been seriously considering working on Smithing so i can make Fulvous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">People ask all the time if they should play an SK.<br />
<br />
The answer is always the same: If you have to ask, then the class isnt for you.<br />
<br />
Same could be said about Trolls. If you have to ask if you should make a Troll character, then pick another race 'cause you wont be happy with the Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm an ogre shaman 65 who made an iksar monk as a new main for a while, but after 57 I started duoing him with the shaman, and got him to 60 with a few handfuls of AA, and then the monk nerf smashed down.<br />
<br />
So I made an ogre warrior, but they were too boring.  Ogre stats are incredible as to STA and STR though.  But AGI and DEX are seriously low.  Yet his hitpoints at 52 were more than my 60 monk's, who already had a couple levels of AA in ND.  I  did miss the regen, though.<br />
<br />
I love FD and wanted someone who could take the kind of beating mobs give out in PoP -- and warrior was out.  So since I liked ogre...hmm.<br />
<br />
I spent a few MONTHS (literally) getting smithing from 188 to 250 and made a rallos zek ogre SK.  Then I took a closer look at the armor that cazic thule ogre SK's could wear, and gave half a thought to Greenmist, and happily re-rolled to a cazic thule ogre SK.<br />
<br />
At level 25 or under, with shaman buffs, the ogre SK was 255 STA 255 STR and had huge hitpoints.  DEX and AGI could have been better, but with a shaman's buffs and a full set of fulvous armor plus other nice twinkie things like cloak of flames, he was doing really great.<br />
<br />
Even with druid PL'ing to 40 and shaman PL'ing after, I didn't get him to 45 in two days, but he leveled fast and looks fun and funky -- I like the looks of trolls, ogres or iksars.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the fulvous really does add a lot, because it has STA all over the place.  If you have a shaman buffing you all the time, that won't matter quite as much, but whenever you are not grouped with a shaman, STA lost will mean lost HP.  Having armor that adds tons of it right off the bat is great!  As an ogre, you don't have to worry about strength at all, and can swap gear in and out more freely if you want something like saves or dex without really losing out.<br />
<br />
Fulvous has sold very well for me in the bazaar, or at least it did till ornate came out.  I got some ornate but haven't made it yet; I'm not sure it's worth it to replace a lot of the fulvous pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I picked Iksar because they are the most evil race you can play. Sure, Trolls are evil, but even Ogres and Dark Elves tolerate them. But no other player race tolerates Iksar. Well, not without faction work at least. <br />
<br />
Iksar the evilest of the evil. And I like a challenge. That's why I picked them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think that most of the advantage in leveling the ogre over the SK is related to 2 things.  1) ogres have slightly lower exp penalty, and 2) the better armor of Fulvous gives an advantage.<br />
<br />
For most of us that can't afford to buy full Fulvous armor for a twink SK (my SK is my main and has had to earn and buy almost everything on him himself, and he's still decked out pretty nice), you'll find that almost every class of SK is going to be approximately as easy to level with the exception of the xp penalty, which is a killer at higher levels (my cleric that I 2-box with is catching up with and will soon pass my iksar SK at the current rate).<br />
<br />
At lower levels, the regen doesn't make a difference, but when you get to higher levels, it can be a huge difference.  At level 51 is when regen first gets a boost.  When non-regen classes are getting 2 points standing and 5 points sitting, trolls and iksar are getting 6 points standing and 12 sitting.  At 56 we get another nice boost, and then finally at 59 we get another smaller boost so that while other races are doing 3 points standing and 6 points sitting, we are doing *12* points *standing*, and *18* points sitting.  That means that if you are 59th level and you use Deathly Temptation because you managed to die and lost your KEI but don't want to break camp for it, you are only dropping 4 HP per tick standing to gain 6 points of mana.  The other major advantage is that when you feign, you regen at your standing rate.  Once in a while I go running into somewhere that I really shouldn't be going if I were very smart.  I'll go charging in to check and see if Vindi is up, even though I'm completely KoS and all the see invis giants are up. (yeah, I like to have fun).  I charge in, get whacked within an inch of my life and feign, and sometimes I get stuck somewhere under a see invis giant with 10% health.  If you are a bit crazy like me and find yourself in a nasty spot like that, where one or two hits can kill you at 10%, then regen at 12 points per tick is enough that you arent sitting there forever trying to regain it.<br />
<br />
No, at the pre-51 levels, regen doesn't really make a difference that anyone really cares about, but if you are planning on going all the way with it, the regen is awesome and in my opinion well worth the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
One thing that no one has brought up yet though is the fattie crowded hall death factor.  My first SK was an ogre, and although I enjoyed the higher stats and being unstunnable from the front (don't think anyone brought that up either), I died a number of times in Sol B, Lower Guk, or other dungeons where people would be blocking the hall or sitting or feigned outside a dungeon preventing you from getting in.  One day outside Sol B, I gave up after 15 min of someone blocking me and being AFK and I had to go into Sol A and take the long way into Sol B.  Many times as I was trying to get out of a dungeon and escape a train I would be blocked by people and die when feign was interrupted or there were tons of casters preventing a good feign.  Trolls are the same size as ogres and have the same problems with size.  In my opinion, this can be a very significant factor in choosing a race.<br />

in the end game, it's not really going to matter which you choose between troll and iksar. the 40 or so points you gain in AC probably isn't noticable in a fight, and the extra stats you have as a troll probably won't be noticable in a fight either.  If you have regen, that isn't going to be noticable in a fight, but when you need to feign and regen or use one of our scaled down lich spells it can be a blessing in the post 50 levels.<br />

To sum up.  As others have said, play what you think will be the most fun and what you can get into.  I love playing iksar and although many like trolls, I couldn't play one.  Ogres were fun to role play with, Iksar I have a hard time really playing the role, but I love the race and how they look.  I think that the number one thing to look at when choosing a race is what race you think is the coolest, and the second thing to look at is if you want regen and nasty exp loss for troll and iksar, or higher HP and unstunnability from front from ogre and almost as nasty exp loss, and the third thing to look at is how much the large size issue is going to bother you.<br />
