Anyone know of anyone who actually lost the fight in the warehouse?<br />
<br />
I was all mentally psyched for the fight in the warehouse, and found that it was a ridiculously easy fight.  (And I *so* wanted to finish the slaughter of the remaining refugees.)<br />
<br />
I was wearing pretty much stock armor that I either bought off a merchange (woven rawhide) or quested for (back on IoR) and using a tin tulwar.  Don't think I had bought my spell upgrades yet either (Appr1 to Appr2).</div></div><hr />

I guess I didn't have ur luck, my gf went right after me with worse equipment but did better... Dont know about killing the refugees when you can just make them your worker slaves. Although I must say that a part of me wanted to see them dead too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the &quot;brawler&quot; part of the quest was pretty funny, actually.  Of course, I had to kill the people in the warehouse.  Probably because they aggrod on me :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorish</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I forgot about the bit where you run around and &quot;enforce&quot; the will of the overlord on unsuspecting merchants.  That was amusing... &quot;Here's a message from the overlord&quot; (punch).<br />
<br />
I think I used a single HO per mob and supplemented with my AoE attack.  Killed one, killed whichever one was most damaged, then finished off the third.  I fought over by the entrance away from the other 4 refugees.<br />
<br />
(Me troll, me no want slaves, me want blood on my steel.)</div></div><hr />
