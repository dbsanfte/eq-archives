<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caziel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got done reading the thread from general discussion about the warriors pissing and moaning about how we need to be nerfed so that they dont suck anymore. In the course of the posts are Voice/hate spells were brought up a bit and that gave me an idea.<br />
<br />
This may very well have been posted before so bear with me. <br />
<br />
The voice line makes the actions of the recipiant of the spell cause more aggro with his/her actions correct ? Warriors want better aggro control for raids, exp groups, etc. Why not just give warriors an innate &quot;voice&quot; effect for their attacks ? With that innate ability they would be causing more aggro with their attacks then any other classes (straight) melee and would therefore be able to hold aggro as well as was needed in said raid or group. Now then, they may argue that &quot;a knight can still pull aggro off of us&quot; and that may well be true but on a raid where the knight is not the MT why on earth would he want to purposely grab aggro ?<br />
<br />
All in all I think this (if possible) would make a happy median for the classes. The warriors can now hold aggro for their coveted tank position on raids or groups. While we can still hold superior aggro skills and have our utility spells. <br />
<br />
Warrior: high ac and hp, melee dps, plus can hold aggro with the change. <br />
<br />
Knights: Supperior aggro but less hp,ac (as it is now) , with wide array of spells that make us unique. <br />
<br />
Voila. Everybody is happy and nobody gets nerfed. <br />
<br />
Ideas , suggestions please. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought of something similar a while ago...<br />
<br />
Make an AA that increases the agro on each melee hit by 33% 66% and 100% per level of the AA (possibly make it a toggle on/off AA so they don't get agro when they don't want it).<br />
<br />
Possibly for procs too?<br />
<br />
Just 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only trouble is that there should be no such thing as 100percent aggro lock.   It would take the challenge out of the game.  There should always be that fine line of what you can do and what you can't do.  As a SK off tanking I seem to have to ride that line all the time.  I actually work at not getting too much aggro.   I think that other classes should do the same.  It makes you a much better player and as a former Shaman I know how rough aggro management can be.  I have seen so many classes going &quot;balls to the walls&quot; with as much damage as possible that it's hard for anyone to keep aggro.  Monks refuse to FD when they get aggro for some reason and wait for me to do all the work to get aggro back.  I won't even talk about rangers because they just suck and don't forget the wizard or shaman who nuke and slow then imediatley just sit on their ass to med and the mob makes a b line for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caziel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I perfectly agree that aggro managment is not just the job of the tank but those of the entire group, the fact still remains that warriors are horrible at gaining and holding aggro. <br />
<br />
They are so bad at it that the rest of the group (if they're smart) are constantly having to disengage the enemy just so the warrior can gain aggro. The melees rush back in to resume and POW! they have to back off again for the warrior. <br />
<br />
As it is now a very skilled and knowlegable warrior can hold aggro no problem with a good group at his side, but somthing needs to be done to give them a leg up in the aggro dept. Right now they're just more work to have in a group then they're worth. <br />
<br />
Giving them an innate ability to cause more aggro with their hits wouldnt allow them to &quot;lock in&quot; aggro but would give them enough of an edge to make them useful in a group.</div></div><hr />

What would I like to have as an SHD?   Well every thing I want to be a GOD but that not gona happen so what do I need. Really can’t think of much. In that most of it works mostly and why mess with it now. There are a lot of wild suggestions on this site so here are mine instead of grumping at the wars and them screaming nerf. Lets try and help them out so they want an shd in their group all the time, this ways it helps them and us. So SHD are the kings of AGRO let’s work with that if we are the kings let us control it some. How about redirect it. How about a spell that let’s us direct a portion of our agro to different party member. Like the old voice graft so that what I do comes out there or seems to. So when I cast a spear the mob see it coming from the war or whatever the MT is.  Now someone is about to bring up the voice spells im talking controlling agro not buffing some one who may or may not know a thing. Dose this help the wars only a little and if they in a group with us but hey if they want to be MT I want a seat in group one myself. Ok next foolish thought if the pal’ys are and should be the terror of the undead then we should be the terror of any healer! How about a self proc that steals mana or health whenever a mobs cast a heal in melee range of the SHD say half for them and half to the SHD or just a spell that suppresses the effect of a heal cast. And lastly how about a really really short fear proc spell /1 sort of a poormans stun make it last portional to the amount of health 100% tenth of second 1% 1 sec.</div></div><hr />

I think *this* is why we say nerf Paladins and SKs. Because you HAVE snap aggro and people don't learn to play their class, then bitch and moan when a warrior is tank and doesn't have snap-aggro.<br />
<br />
I think that warriors should be the best at aggro, but so much so it eliminates paladins and SKs as tanks. Because I don't want things to go back to Kunark era. AKA: fuck rangers, monks, druids, paladins, SKs. The &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; should never have been established.<br />
<br />
I think warriors *should* best tank over-all, but while still not being so dominant it makes you guys obsolete. Things should have never been that way. And things should never go back that way. Paladins should be preferred tanks in undead environments, and SKs should be preferred in other situations (I don't know a whole lot on Shadowknights, but I try).</div></div><hr />

Back when I was a noob, if you got aggro it was because you weren't controling your aggro and that person got yelled at.  Now it's viewed as &quot; the tanks fault &quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem i am seeing from warriors ( not trying to insult you be any means ) is that they expect tank and aggro to go together . <br />
<br />
While warriors will always be superior tanks campared to pall/sk's the challange for them is to get and keep the aggro . I'm not saying warriors should have 0 aggro capacity but it should be on the lower end of the spectrum . The main problem i am seeing is that all these &quot;aggro locks&quot; ( and that is a very loose term ) are being cause by spells that were supposed to provide some aggro , but when you use the lower lvl version you are makeing sure you get a resist and the provides even more aggro . Then they are also useing even less mana to maintain that aggro instead of eventualy running out .<br />
<br />
As for situational tank pallies do have undead and sk's , well i don;t think we spectialize in any one area but will do poor in a high dis resist enviroment .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zeratus Masamune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SoE's thrust for Shadowknights, as seen in SoL, seems to be: the class that can control the flow of aggro in a group or raid. They gave us Terror and Voice lines of spells to do just that. If an MT for a raid is having a hard time getting aggro, I just get as much aggro as I can, let him pound on me for a bit, then FD... aggro generally then switches to the MT (usually a warrior). I don't see why everyone is in such an uproar over classes having to work together to get aggro. Knights have been the battered stepchild of SoE until SoL, we were crap. Had no useful abilities for raids almost, couldn't tank, and had barely any DPS. Just because knights are know the preferred tank for a FEW MOBS, doesn't mean we need to be nerfed... we were always called &quot;tanks&quot; after all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A common practice to minimize heals in XP groups in Sebilis was for me, the puller to keep aggro on the mob (Shrooms/Reets/Juggs - they used to be hard for 1 person groups...) until the warrior felt that aggro was sufficient enough for me to feign the mob off....we even did this as late as Dragon Necropolis until our warriors got some Willsappers.... It motivates people to have some freakin' inter-class dependency...i.e I can't tank that well, so I feign the hard hitting mob onto the warrior...hell I still do the same in PoTact xp groups because I have gimp gear. :oO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GuuntherrRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure if this is a good idea at all, but i thought about an ability that increases the % of arggo over 18 or so seconds but takes away a certain amount of dps over that time also. the refresh could be 35 seconds or so enough to lock it each fight in an exp group or raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I can tell, they have one, if you need some proof of that watch an eb proc from a Warrior then cast terror spells, our top 2 terrors are 1050 hate combined, thats still quite a bit less than 1 eb proc from a warrior is, yet thats only 700, only answer for that is aggro mods on classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If a change is going to be made, it should be made to improve warriors' aggro, not to diminish our's. As stated above, knights going back in the drawer would really suck. I like the idea about the 35 second refresh button to help warrior aggro, like a second taunt. As a skill, it should be introduced in the early game, so all warrios can use it in EXP groups and raids. <br />
If you were still wondering about the voice line of spells, they grant an increased % of aggro to whoever they're cast on. With a 10% aggro mod cast on a warrior MT, he may do an average of 65 dps in melee, but as far as his aggro is concerned, is doing 71.5. <br />
Maybe earlier EnrageBlow type items could be implimented for warriors, too. Or gear with worn or right clickable EB type proc buff. Whatever can be implimented the easiest without having to turn the game around for warriors and knights entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They biggest complaint I have seen is that the items like this have charges, other than the EB weapons.  If a Sceptre of the Folorn was infinite charges, would we have these conversations?<br />
<br />
See it all really boils down to the start of a battle.  A wizard nuking a 6k crit is always going to get whacked, no matter what.  So, its all about getting the slower to keep from having aggro during the unslowed period.  Secondarily, avoiding the aggro at all would be even better.  LDoN exacerbates this as their are no horses in LDoN.  So having snap aggro on incoming is a bit more important.<br />
<br />
My point all along is that a chanter is the warrior's best friend in this regard.  Having extra aggro buildup comes from Horrifying Visage and Trickster's Augmentation.  The chanter can help themselves with Spell Casting Subtlety (a shammy can do this as well) and Boggle (a Jolt) type spell.<br />
<br />
So, what this boils down to is chanterless (or bad chanter) pickup groups.  The solutions are already there for everything else.  If your telling me that Furor can't get an xp group with FoH member, then I think that has nothing to do with aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Out of all the ideas I've heard about fixing Warriors the one I like the most and believe would be most appropriate for thier class would be a &quot; Force Proc &quot; skill.  <br />
<br />
Every 45 sec - 1 min or so give them the Ability to hit a button to Proc their main hand weapon ( Main proc, unless it didn't have a proc to begin with then an Augmented Proc ).  Make it have 200 range like spells ( unless it's not appropriate for the proc, like Earthshaker for example ) and 1.5 cast time.<br />
<br />
This will give them some Utility ( They can now slow, snare, debuff, pull with a taunt spell ), they will make better use of Procing weapon than any class, and they can get aggro right away.<br />
<br />
Also, you want to fix hybrid aggro?  Make it so resisted spells don't provide taunt.  I've always found this kinda pointless, why would you get mad at someone if your spell &quot; missed or had no effect on you &quot;.  SKs would be forced to use their less efficient Terror spells for what it was intended and Paladins could no longer use low lvl stuns to aggro lock.  Also classes like Shamans / Chanters wouldn't get pounded so much for resisted slows.  <br />
<br />
Finally, for the love of all that is Holy... Fix Duel Wielding.  DW is SUPPOSED to be more DPS than 2h weapons since the start of EQ.  That's why Knights never got DW and pure melee did.  Up the Main hand and Offhand Damage Bonuses to something that'll make using 2 weapons a viable option again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to agree with the force proc idea, though i think it should merely make the next swing have a 100% chance of procing....<br />
<br />
It should be an aa with three levels, requiring all three aa of ingenuity, with the first level allowing for the extra proc half as often as the normal proc rate of the weapon, the second level allowing it 75% as often as the normal proc rate, and the third level allowing at the proc rate, in effect doubling the proc rate of the weapon, and allowing half of the procs to be timed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Umm...so now we have warriors as the golf caddies of EQ?<br />
 <br />
&quot;Quick, Furor- get me a Putter of Defense!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Click-on-demand procs = bad idea. You now have one warrior tanking and the other ones pulling out various golf clubs for that phat warrior proc rotations.<br />
 <br />
Bonus: You just made the warrior even MORE gear dependant to be desired.<br />
<br />
No thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I believe the general idea is that one or more of their bags will look like a golf bag, as it will be full of all sorts of situationally useful proc weapons.  Want to solo?  Well, start every fight with a weapon that procs slow (such as a Willsapper) and proc the slow immediately, then switch back to a high damage weapon.  Need that avatar proc?  Switch in a primal weapon, force the proc, switch out and continue using a weapon with better stats.  Need to not be stuck in the bottom of Sebilis?  Here, where'd that Worker's Sledgemallet get off to?  That's all that is really meant by that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Most Warriors bags look like that anyway :)   It's just a thought though, I can't remember who posted the original idea and not like SoE would ever listen to the SK  boards for Warrior ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's certainly true that most warriors bags look like that anyway, I even know a Ranger that is on a personal quest to have a 10 slot bag full of different, but still useful, weapons.  My biggest problem with the &quot;force a proc&quot; idea isn't that it would inconvenience the warriors or make them too powerful soloing (soloing is boring, and everybody else is more than welcome to do it), it's that it does nothing to reduce their reliance on their gear.  No other class has the same magnitude of reliance on their gear that the warrior class has.  Certainly, no class is very useful without their gear, but nobody else is anywhere near as helpless without it.  Even rogues can still be invisible without gear, and monks can still feign death and dish out some damage, and anybody with spells can, at the least, do SOMETHING.  I'd like to see some sort of solution that at least reduces a warrior's reliance on his gear.</div></div><hr />

If it was infinite, you wouldn't have to spend ANY mana getting aggro.</div></div><hr />

New Voice line of spell, level 65.<br />
Castable only on Warriors<br />
Duration 2 hours 30 mins <br />
(beneficial type)<br />
Increases aggro by 75% (even 100%, I don't care)<br />
<br />
The benefits: SKs make lots of plat like chanters with C3 (level restricted to 46+ as well). Warriors stop wanting to nerf us - they become our best customer and totally addicted to what we sell.<br />
<br />
The downside: it totally trivialises raid encounters, but akin to say CoH, Levi etc. it could be automatically stripped when entering a raid-zone... <br />

I have no idea whether that can/could be implemented, but I for one would be smiling/laughing all the way to the bank!</div></div><hr />
