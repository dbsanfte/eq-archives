<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Specifically interested in if the Grimling High Commander still spawns at all since they redid this zone and the war, and if the Posessed Grimling Cleaver still drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have dropped Prince Garzemort twice and never seen the cleaver drop.  Keep getting a BP from it.<br />
<br />
At level 50 I am able to complete the war up until the final spawn solo.  Just using invis to go into the caves and kill nameds to start war, then pet to kill defenders and allow a race to win.  Takes a bit of time but if your well buffed and equipped its doable.  Then you just need to call in a healer for the last mob.  The final one is immune to snares and roots so be careful.  You can target him invis and go around the back of the outpost to pull him through the wall to limit adds.<br />
<br />
Best drop here is the FT 1 Eye of the Owlbear Mother IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah that would be a nice drop.  Who couldn't use more FT after all.<br />
<br />
I don't know anything about the Grimling war.  Any walkthrough available?  Anyone know the war really well?<br />
<br />
BRB gonna hit the &quot;search&quot; button and see if there is anything here already...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think Dregor might be talking about the grimling war in grimling forest and not the race war in hollowshade moor - and the grimling one is a little more difficult, just a little. Any level 75 with 4100AA could solo that one I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm interested in the Grimling War in Grimling Forest.  I'm not particularly interested in the race war in Hollowshade Moor other than as a way to farm smithing components.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok... used the &quot;search&quot; key for &quot;grimling&quot;.  Found about twenty pages of &quot;Grimling Crystal Ball&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tried search with &quot;grimling&quot; but NOT &quot;crystal&quot;.  Five pages.<br />
<br />
Tried search with &quot;grimling&quot; and &quot;war*&quot; and it crashed the search.<br />
<br />
Went back and sorted through the five pages of &quot;grimling&quot; NOT &quot;crystal.<br />
<br />
Didn't see anything pertaining to the war.<br />
<br />
Meaning don't bother saying &quot;use search&quot;.  It's not there.  Instead, if you do know of an existing thread, bump it or link it here.<br />
<br />
And if you don't know of an existing thread, please post what you do know about the war here on this thread.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the war relatively recently (1 month ago). I only did the last 5 or 6 missions though.<br />
<br />
What I do know is that that cleaver didn't drop for us.<br />
Also, the final boss mob was Claw of Khati Sha who dropped a very nice medallion (Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl, I believe) and a 100% weight reduction 10 slot giant bag.<br />
<br />
I can't remember seeing the High Commander but it is entirely possible we killed him. However, if he used to be the boss mob (i.e. last encounter) then he's been replaced by Claw of Khati Sha coz that was the last mob. Claw of Khati Sha isn't listed by Allakhazam btw and looks like a naked Vah Shir (a traitor hehe). <br />
<br />
There's also a trick for the last encounter. As you may know, you have to occupy every tent in the last camp (i.e. have someone standing inside it) to avoid re-pops (which happen really quickly) and to get boss mob to spawn. The trick is that it is enough to have a pet in a tent. The pets master will have to stay in a tent as well, because if he's aggroed pet will come to help (except with /pet hold command). We did this with 7 people in the end (had a beasty join later on) though we started the last encounter with 6. Cleric died twice, but I managed to tap myself healthy enough to take down the Claw.<br />

And for you d00d-speak nazis out there: it was gr8 fun!</div></div><hr />
