<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnayar</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question and I've heard many different answers<br />
from different class's and players.<br />
<br />
What exactly help prevent fizzles?<br />
<br />
Also I've noticed that sometimes when I'm<br />
standing perfectly still I get a message...<br />
<br />
Your spell was interupted....<br />
<br />
Most times I recover and cast but this is annoying<br />
when I'm not moving.<br />
<br />
So any input would be welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as far as Fizzles....Magic Skill (e.g.  Conjuration, Abjuration, etc....), Intellegence, Focus Items, Familiars, and Random luck...are the only things I know that affect this<br />
<br />
As far as the interupts..heres an excerpt from castersrealm FAQ<br />
Q: Why do I sometimes get interrupted for no apparent reason when casting a spell (i.e. I didn't move and I didn't get hit)?  <br />
A: Generally this happens if you begin casting a spell before you have come to a complete stop, even though it sometimes feels like you have. Give yourself a little bit more time standing still before you start casting and this problem should go away. <br />
that prolly doesnt help much...but its all the advice I can offer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnayar</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Flanders, yeah everything<br />
on casting skills is about maxed out<br />
(conjuration ect...) so I guess it's my<br />
intelligence that could probable use a lil<br />
help.. only around 110 ATM (lvl 52)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oragan</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Focus items may help a bit, but you need to understand that SKs are not true casters, so they will all-ways fizzle :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mynegon</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell level vs your level is a factor as well.   The fizzle rate of a spell is higher at the level you first get it and then goes down as you level, but never to 0.   The fizzle rate drops faster per level above 50.<br />
<br />
So level! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fizzles depends on:<br />
<br />
*Your skill in the magic type of this spell (ie 200 skill = less chances to fizzle than 150)<br />
*Level of the spell, if you try to cast a lvl 28 spell with 10 in the skill, you will fizzle it at least 90% of the time, if you try to cast the downgrade of this spell wich is a lvl 9 one you &quot;should&quot; not fizzle it alot<br />
*The single spell by itself, I noticed that some specific spells (like 54 banshee aura for example) fizzle alot more than most of lvl 60 spells, even with a maxed skill, I don't have proof of it tho, thats just an &quot;impression&quot;.<br />
<br />
About the interrupt thing, it usually happens when you run/walk and start to cast spell just after you stop, solution is to stay still for about half a second before cast, it also &quot;seems&quot; to happen sometime (rarely) when there is alot of action near you.<br />
You're interrupted when you &quot;move&quot; while casting, ie a mob pushes you, you're slipping on an icy floor etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I HIGHLY suggest you to turn a little bit before casting. For fear kiting. I just run away from darked mob and immediately turn a little while stopped then cast right away. It will send data to server that you stopped and turned. There are some time lag frame between server and your client. If you just stopped from running and then immediately cast, you will be more than likely to be interrupted. Turning around a little (like 5 degree ) will do the trick alot. <br />
<br />
For your case when you just stand and decide to cast. It didn't happen to me that it just interrupt while I was just standing. It sound like something that send signals to server that you are moving very slightly or jerky movement  like that up an down standing position that you sometimes saw from others that might happens or whatever. The point is that server seems to think that you are moving one way or other even though your client tells you that you stand still. A possible trick to solve your problem is to turn around and cast at the same time.<br />
<br />
I have no idea but I just want to let you know that I cast just fine without interrupt if I just stand still. Only thing that can prevent from casting is normal fizzle rates factored by INT, casting skills, spell levels, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mnayar</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, that seems to work best when I pull<br />
a mob I'll turn while casting and interupts<br />
don't seem to happen.  <br />
<br />
Seems most likely that I'm just not waiting<br />
a few seconds (or 5 or so) to start casting<br />
so the server might still perceive me as moving<br />
instead of how I see myself as standing still.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input guys, hope this helps<br />
others out there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brazzo</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've been in some places where if i am standing on a zone wall or near a corner i get interrupts every time.  i think the valley that leads to SK from LRathe was one of them.  if i stood on that sloped zonewall, i was interrupted 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finishing up 58th level, and one thing I've noticed that all the while up to the last bubble of exp, my fizzle rate was no where near what it is now.  There's been some patches in between when I first got 58 till now, but I have noticed the fizzle rate has, in my opinion, at least doubled.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing the same gear, except I now have Greenmist instead of Noc blade, but compenstated the INT with other gear to stay the same.  I'm a little lower in HP, but everything else is the same as before as far as the stats go.<br />
<br />
I think I need to do some some experimenting to be absolutly sure, 'cause I hate to give false or misleading information.  But... if anyone is coming up on their last bub for their level, see if you notice the same thing to confirm this.  It's probably nothing... but ya never know what stelth nurf Verant will pull.<br />
<br />
Edit:  some spelling and spacing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there's an AA skill that you can get to eliminate fizzles for all spells under a certain level... I'm not sure if it would be helpful enough to justify putting points into it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah.. I wanna pay 12 points so I can't fizzle anything below level 52 or 54... one of those is the cut-off at level 3 of the skill, I forget which one<br />
<br />
the 55+ spells are the ones that have fizzle issues anyway... so screw that<br />
<br />
basically, you just gotta live with it.. in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal most times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something noone mentioned yet is that Intellectual Advancement makes you cast as if you are 5 levels higher than you are, basically this means if your 60 its like your level 65 for resists and fizzles... personally I never get this buff as I have no room for it but for those of you who are your guilds pullers you may wanna consider it so you fizzle deathpeace less, also means your going to fail banshee aura, drain soul, etc less... and dont forget the other side effect of it being like your 5 levels higher... resist checks</div></div><hr />
