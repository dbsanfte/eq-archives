<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I started a Ogre SK.<br />
Last night I got him to lvl. 6 and got bash.<br />
<br />
Now the question:<br />
All the way from lvl 1, he had slam.<br />
When I dinged 6 with him, he also gained the abillity to bash.<br />
So, after putting 1 point into bash, i was able to make the bash key.<br />
Now, I have the Slam and Bash key right nex to eachother.<br />
When im fighting, everytime i hit either Slam or Bash, both keys gets activated, just like the range attack key.<br />
But funny thing is,  I noticed that all the suddon, I have gotten better at swing??<br />
<br />
Now, from lvl 6, does slam and bash combine into swing?<br />
And if so, will I automatically train slam and bash from now on, since I cant hit slam without activating bash aswell and the other way around.<br />
<br />
My second question: Are Ogres the only ones who gets slam, since when reading theese boards, I  dident notice any mentioning of it from other classes.<br />
<br />
Ill hope that someone can help me sort out theese questions  <br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadwe Cniht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if your using a 2 hand weapon you slam, if your using a shiled you bash.<br />
<br />
They are both more or less the same skill as using slam will cause bash skill to go up. (they use same timer)<br />
<br />
All large races get slam ogre, troll and barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xhadow Knyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just use slam.  It will work whether you have a shield on or not.  But make sure you have your bash hotkey handy if you're going to have an illusion cast on you.  You lose slam if you get turned into a wolf for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye, just hotkey slam, it and bash are basically the same exact skill, and both work and increase the bash skill itself, the only difference being that slam needs no shield.</div></div><hr />
