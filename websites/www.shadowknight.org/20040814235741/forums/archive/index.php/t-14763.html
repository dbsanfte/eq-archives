<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Askew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know how you iksar SK managed to continue to play SK.  I finally have all my factions fixed, now I have a serious problem  =)<br />
<br />
I can't seem to get from the ladder to the floor to start the various SK quest(Greenmist specificially).  I guess I'm gonna have to see if I can't get someone to levitate me once I get on top of the ladder and try again.<br />
<br />
So what iksar secrets do you all have for a Erudite SK looking to start his Greenmist quest?<br />
<br />
Someone told me using old models help to jump to the floor from the ladder, but I tried for about 20 minutes and with no success.<br />
<br />
Thanks from this dextrous challenged SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember there used to always be at least a few newby iksar SK bodies at the base of that ladder...   it sucks, and the new models make it way hard.  If you are high enough to cast bobbing corpse after you climb up that wil work.. otherwise hire a shammy to lev you once you are up top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zisnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There *is* a trick, sort of...<br />
<br />
/Sit down, open your /book, and memorize Shadow Step.<br />
<br />
Stand on top of the ladder, and cast it.  Might take a few tries, but eventually you'll bounce over to the other side.  No muss, no fuss.<br />

This PSA brought to you by Homer Simpson: Doh!</div></div><hr />

AWESOME suggestion, gonna try that instead of hunting down a mage for a lev ring  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Look up, then jump/run at the same time.<br />
That worked for me until I got my bobbing corpse bauble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harjon Baradda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look up as you go up the ladder and kinda turn a 180 real fast right when you hop off the top of the ladder. It might take a few tries but once you see how it's done you'll hop up there with ease!<br />
<br />
Although climbing to the top of the ladder and using shadow step or bobbing corpse works just fine. Or ask a shaman to lev you, they get the spell relatively low level and you might catch one in town. :D</div></div><hr />
