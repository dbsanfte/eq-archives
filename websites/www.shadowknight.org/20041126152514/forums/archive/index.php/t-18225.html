<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have no Idea how to enter the planes, I went to PoT and could not figure out get into the planes. thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They aren't books or labeled stones like in PoK.  Specific (non-labeled) items in PoT take you to the various planes.  It's different for every plane.  PoJ, for example you click on the big scales that the waterfall runs through.  For PoI you click on the broken gear behind the pillar in the windmill.  If you don't have the LoY mapping capability with the map for PoT, then I suppose it is just a matter of hunting the entrances down on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 52 you want to stay in first tier planes.  POD is by jumping in the sewer that is draining from the pipe.   First starting off, I would probably try POJ.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go to www.eqmaps.com or www.eqatlas.com and look at a map.<br />
<br />
If you have LoY, go to http://maps.eq-toolbox.com and download the LoY maps.<br />
<br />
Ask people how to get where you want to go.  Don't spam it in shout, just ask once in ooc if someone could show/tell you how to get to X plane.<br />
<br />
Like Stugein said, to port to a plane, there are items and locations in PoT that you have to click on (or jump in for PoD).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finally ventured into PoJ and was kind of boring, got into a PoN last night and it was awesome fun and XP, we were killing yellows and making good XP, nice to get away from LDoN, been there since high keep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FreddyJones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to say that i have been looking for the maps for a while. That site Ramgar was the answer... .<br />
