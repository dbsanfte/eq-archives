The following has apparently been attributed to State Representative Mitchell Kaye from GA. This guy should run for President: ~~~~~~~~<br />
&quot;We, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt ridden, delusional, and other liberal bed wetters. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
ARTICLE I: You do not have the unearned right to a new car, big screen TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone-not just you!  You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful; do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing.  Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people.  If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others.  If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure.<br />
<br />
ARTICLE VIII: You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.<br />
ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness-which by the way, is a lot easier if you learn the Country's language and are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.&quot; ~~~~~~~~ <br />
<br />
If you agree with the foregoing, share it with a friend. No, you don't have to, and nothing tragic will befall you if you don't. I just think it is about time common sense is allowed to flourish - call it the age of reason ---revisited.<br />

Its not free health care you idiot.  Someone else has to pay for it.  If you work and contribute to society there is no reason the government cannot help sponsor tax bonuses for your employer to carry health care for all its employees.  However, to provide it on the backbones and hard work of others makes it free-loading and nobody should be asked to carry that burdon.  I do not think the government should have the power to take the ability from me to provide a good living for my family because someone else did not take advantage of the education system.  You want free health care?  Join the military.  They will provide you with a good education, housing, food, and health benefits.  In trade you will work defending this fine country.  You want to free-load?  FUCKING DIE!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dkhar</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People in this country are so lame. Do you know a person on welfare makes more than the average minimum wage person ? Do you also know they will house, feed and clothe these people ? They also offer them educational services, such as free job training and work placement. Health benefits come also, not much but hey they're not gonna die from the flu. I pay for this. You pay for this. And what do these frags do ? <br />
<br />
Smoke crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wee my life sucks so I'm gonna suck it down this glass dick and complain that noone will help me, I live in a hotel and eat shitty food I buy with foodstamps.. wah wah wah.&quot; <br />
<br />
So they cry and complain and smoke their crack and have 10 little babies that they can't support in the first place (sex for drugs is commonplace, babies come from sex btw :P) <br />
<br />
I have seen children starve because their parents were so lame they would rather spend foodstamps on crack than food (50 cents on the dollar for a foodstamp exchange). I have seen babies sit in shitty diapers for 2-3 days, unnotices by their uncaring parents. I have seen a grown man offer a blowjob to a drug dealer, because he was out of foodstamps. I have been offered sex for drugs/money from toothless crackwhores, while their children looked on... I can go on and on and on. <br />
<br />
I pay for this. You pay for this. These people are offered a chance and don't even see it. They complain and whine and smoke crack, all the while people in this country sympathize with them and keep giving them hand-outs. I for one am sickened by it. I think it is time our country stopped helping these faggots. Let them starve. Let them freeze to death on the street. Let them see what it is really like to suffer. I see bums with signs asking for change constantly. 5 words I give them, and probably the best advices they will ever here.<br />
<br />
GET A FUCKING JOB FAGGOT.<br />
<br />
I can say this. I have been there and beat it. I don't feel sorry for people who are given a helping hand and spit on it. fuck off you bums.. .get a fucking job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krikk</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The desire every other american seems to have to constantly be unoffended and constantly secure, economicly and otherwise, has brought us to being up to our knees in lazy people. I'm not gonna go so far as saying &quot;Fuck you&quot; to a homeless Vet with a sign, but all these grotesque people thriving off the government, and my taxes, for years, because their husband died a decade ago, collecting motorcycles in their garage, cybering with other loser people all day while their son works, doing cheap drugs with shlep guys in their room while their kids sleep, wasting MY tax dollars, and more importantly, all of your's, too. All those people can suck a huge one, as they're abusing a system meant  to get them back on their feet, not to keep them on their ass. <br />
BTW, I'm not refering to my folks in the above paragraph. Just someone anonymous. Ohhhhh lord, if I could harmtouch in RL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunloc</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn freeloaders!<br />
<br />
Go to a grocery store and watch the people who pay for their groceries with food stamps. They're all overweight! They're eating better than I am and I have to pay for it! Gargh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen! I live by these rules, I just wish more people did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madwand</div><div class="date">02-04-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a problem with people who actually need help.. those who lost jobs because of the crappy economy but are trying to find employment, mothers who need assistance because the deadbeat fathers walked out on them all of a sudden, etc...<br />
<br />
People who have legitimate reasons.<br />
<br />
What does burn my ass is the people who get disability because they are too fat to work.  I work so these fat slobs can haul their lard butts out of their new cars, after parking in a handicap spot because they are &quot;disabled&quot;, then oozing into McDonalds to load up on Big Macs and fries till they damn near burst.  They get money because they are fat, and they spend it to get even fatter.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else see a problem here?</div></div><hr />
