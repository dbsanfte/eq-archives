I hit 59 last night btw, need to update all those sigs and things sometime...and I think Vis is just a 2-boxed twink from a 60+ Enchanter, who never plays him...so he doesn't count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kainzzothewindmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">63 here (been slackin:p)<br />

I'm not a gnome, but I am from Drinal. I think there's one or two 50+ gnome SKs on Drinal. Names? Don't know, don't care. Disgusting Bertos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vistol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've heard Erollisi has the highest population of Gnome SKs, weird :P<br />

On Tunare, there is me at 58, Raziiel at 56ish, and then one or two other ones around that too.</div></div><hr />

I was a gnome yesterday.  Thank Inny it was just temporary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think there are any serious Gnome SKs on Brell.  None that stick out at least....tho, I've been to doing who's alot in the past few weeks....there's only like 3 high Erud SKs (that are at least non-anon all the time.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Iumenka- 63<br />
Aftr- 57<br />
Rykor- 60<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm at least the highest MALE Erudite. :D  I think Brell isn't known for it's more exotic class/race combos :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PollieDarkearth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Damn groobash owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ickhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rykar,<br />
<br />
<br />
Slythern on brell ( Gnome ) is 63 and Culpepper is like 55ish or so, Gnut ( my SK ) hit 51 a while back, I think I am the next highest other than those two, im sure there are a few I dont know about though as I dont play my sk that much.<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of erudites, Flayh and Jhekkal are both 60+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>strucwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, me and Baxtin (65 gnome SK from magister) are the only 50+ SK mains I think on Emarr, although a guy named Aztal suddenly popped up yesterday when i did a who all and is 54, and Gnoxious is a 53 female gnome SK, but she's an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know of definately one 50+ Gnome on Drinal.  I would guess there are maybe more but I have not seen them.  I am usually the highest or second highest i ever see when I do a who, and I am only 47.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dinkum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&lt;-- 60 gsk on vaz. probably going to hold tight here till i get my horsie :)<br />
<br />
theres a couple other gnomes at 55 an 53ish, but theyre pretty much retired. and im guessing theres a handful in the 40s or so that are all alts or more casual players</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>zombieace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gyrnik, 54 sk on brell.<br />
<br />
  Zamp, Phantasmist (retired).  Gyrnik - Reaver.  Brell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>strucwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Vistol and Dinkum are you both alts-turned-mains or had your friends give you stuff?  Because your both in pretty nice droppable/chained expensive gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Velior -- L65 Gnome SK  Stormhammer<br />
<br />
(he dual boxes with a L65 Cleric so go figure how he did it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Esclava_Detristeza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Morell Thule only has 1 gnome sk above 50 that I know of and to be honest, I don't really know of many gnome sk's (thank innoruuk). Well, his name is Malignom and he's lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Erudites are just as rare...I know 1 that is lvl 65 and another that is lvl 60, and they are pretty much the only erudite sk's on the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uglugg Bloodsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There are a pair of level 65 Puntable SKs on BB that I know of, husband and wife team that normally stay Anon (Must be embarrassing to be a Gnome).</div></div><hr />

Vistol and Dinkum are you both alts-turned-mains or had your friends give you stuff?  Because your both in pretty nice droppable/chained expensive gear.  <br />
<br />
Neither, I quit EQ last December and then came back with nothing and started over when gnomes were able to be SKs.<br />
<br />
You can do a lot with a little motivation :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>dinkum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i started playing eq again in january with a gnome enchanter. got sick of being lfg and a good friend's main was a chanty anyway, so i started dinkum a day or two after the shorty hybrid patch. am i a twink? i guess so, if you consider a lvl 30ish using his funds to equip a lvl 1 to be a twink situation. i considered lightcrawler armor pretty uber till my 30s, and for a while i did a ton of daytrading to get to the point where im at now-- got my fungi in my mid 50s and it made it all worthwhile. ive never been in a guild that was really capable or willing to help me with my gear, so pretty much everything ive had, ive obtained on my own or with a small group of friends.</div></div><hr />
