<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the problem sometimes...there are many times I only have about 30-45 minutes to jump on line and play do to other real life responsibilities.<br />
<br />
LDONs = 1.5 hours (considering getting group formed, buffing, etc)<br />
<br />
CAMPING = Long time to get to location, get group, get the camp, etc....not really an option if on for 45 minutes...works for when you have longer time availablity<br />
<br />
RAIDING - takes 45 minutes just to get raid force together and organized.<br />
<br />
FARMING FOR TRADESKILLS - ugh, no thanks. I might as well go scrub the kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
I wish there was some kind of advancement process for those that can only get on for short periods of time, but could still get some xp, points. loot, even soloing.<br />
<br />
SWG (I know there were major drawbacks but...) had the mission terminals where you could get 2 missions, and complete them both in 30 minutes which was awesome. Then when you have longer time to stay on line, you could get a group and go for bigger targets.<br />
<br />
Somehow SOE needs to find something to entertain the casual limited time player to keep there interest. Maybe the Tribute Master could give quick missions that must be completed solo, and as you build up enough credit, it could be used towards a loot pool, LDON adventure points, tribute points, etc.<br />
<br />
There is so much focus on the &quot;power-gamer&quot; big raid stuff, how about some love for us limited time people?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought that was the whole point of them doing the 1.5 hour LDoN adventure thing.  Now, I think part of the regen thing might be geared to those of us with limited time.  The trick will be finding mobs that will give decent enough exp solo that they'll be worth hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even though I usually 2-3 box, I am able to solo the droga gobbies.  So, you could run there, kill a few, camp invis'ed in a safe spot and be there when you log the following day.  If it's strictly xp, then this would pretty good.  Named camping would be a little less profitable.  Fight the mobs on the spawn point, and watch out for gating roamers...they bring friends.<br />
<br />
Plat drop is about 10-20pp, which isn't half bad.  All mobs are dark blue, except the ones near Nurga.  There's a good map with named locations on the Shaman forums in the hunting section for 60-65.<br />
<br />
Not planes xp, but not bad, either.  Casters will beat you up unless you interrupt casting, but you'll survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I spose it depends on the defintion of what is 'worthwhile'<br />
<br />
At 62 I can aggro kite mobs in PoN and get 1-2% AA per kill, without a lot of effort. kinda sad for plat tho<br />
<br />
If you are used to grping and getting 4-8% AA a kill, then i spose that might seem less than worthwhile but then again, if you average out the time you spent parked on your ass LFG looking for the ideal grp, its comptetive, if XP is all you are after.<br />
<br />
If you just want something to sell for some quick plat, just go and blaze thru HS. The XP isnt great at 62 but you can pick up a LOT of spells, and a lot of items to sell for plat and tribute and gain a few %AA in the process. id call that worthwhile (not hard to walk out of there with over 2k worth of various loot for a cpl hours play time)</div></div><hr />
