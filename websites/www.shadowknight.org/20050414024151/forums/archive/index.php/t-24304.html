<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">USE BANDOLIER its nice for this one, make sure no one has rings equipped from the start, its too hard to unequip both before they get burned<br />

nonmelee start in center, everyone else starts at 1st dragorn (1st is not relavent we always start on one end) start meleeing burning one, when a move is called, we run to other side of the room, and work on that one, until another move is called, then we work on that one, if everyone pays attention, it works nicely, mobs don't summon, so its just a matter of when the move is called, everyone moves as a group to the next target and ALWAYS assists the MA, your MA is god in this trail, other then that, work your way around, until everyone is dead... NOTE for the  healers, you don't have to move across the whole room, if it says move west, you only have to move a few feet west, 50ish, our healers just moved east west around on the center platform, so they could concentrate on keeping their groups and the MA alive, the same applied when it says move for an archery shot, don't have to run like a crazyed madman until you get the he missed message, just get 50 feet away from the place you got the message<br />
<br />
in essence work on two mobs at ounce, on popsite sides of the room, so when a move is called everyone knows what mob their killing next, healers must know they don't need to move a lot, just 50 feet, bandolier is your friend, don't start with rings on<br />

Have fun kick the trails ass, our last attempt zone crashed when the last mob was at 9%!!!</div></div><hr />
