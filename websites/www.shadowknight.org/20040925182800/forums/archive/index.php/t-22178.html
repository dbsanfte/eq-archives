<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I'm behind the times, only recently setting foot in GoD zones.  I've kept up on posts here though, but my questions aren't about tanking or strategies (there is enough here and on the net that I can draw upon for knowlege) but my questions are more about the mechanics of trial expeditions.<br />
<br />
Because our small guild isn't VT/Elem+, sewer trials aren't trivial by any means, but are doable.  So, like many -- we want to start flagging others and advancing at least a little bit.  First reaction is to have a core group of healer/tank/cc/slower or whatnot and sub in a few players and do a few at a time that way (your basic flagging 101).<br />
<br />
But because these expeditions seem a bit more flexible than say, ldon hards; in that you can sub people in and out, and the fact that the temporary flag is received after the boss mob kill (or hand-in or whatever event), does this mean you can fight/invis your way to the boss room (speaking generic here) and just before the 'big fight' or final hand-in, have a previously flagged person leave the expedition, have the group leader run to the zone, invite a new person into the expedition, and either CoH them (if mage present), or suicide them (banzai thru some mobs) and have a rogue drag them back to the boss room for the final fight [and flag]?  Would that work?<br />
<br />
Also, what happens to the person who leaves the expedition while still in the trial instance.  Are they kicked out?  Can they actually still stay and help even if not part of the expedition?<br />
<br />
Can a cleric be camped outside the instance be used to help in CR in the event of a wipe?  i.e. group wipes, rogue runs in and drags dead cleric.  One person leaves expedition (preferably one that can run back to the zone in at least), invites camped out cleric into group, new cleric zones in and rez's dead cleric, new cleric zones out and leaves expedition, other group member invited back in.  Would this work?<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for any cheats or exploits or whatnot but I don't want to re-invent the wheel nor do things the hard way if there is an easier way to do things.  Would any of these ideas work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lots of ways to get people in to the trials for flags if you use your imagination. For example trial one, which for poorly geared players is probably the greatest challenge of the sewer trials - with a bard (other classes can sub in but bards own for this) I can usually pacify/invis to Ansharu who you hail, then pacify/invis/itu all the way to the end room, this takes at most about 20 mins. Then using strats you can find elsewhere on these or other boards kill 8 of the 9 stonemites. For my group at this point I can kill someone rez and decess to zone in to swap people in to expedition, they can run in, die and zone back in for summon, lots of time for the expedition - hell you can even kill all stonemites and evac to zone leaving boss up, invite peeps and then lull/invis/itu back to end room (boss mob does not see invis). The specific choice of how to get others in for flags depends on what classes you have available at the time obviously. Set up and have tank attack when everyone is ready - Ancient Kyserops does path kinda fast around room though so be ready if/when invis drops. Pretty much the boss mob is easier than the stonmmites you pull that have the ae rampage imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a tip too, do a /dzhelp to see all the expidition commands.<br />
<br />
/dzaddplayer &lt;name&gt; will invite a player anywhere to your expedition.  CoH and Drag works just fine.<br />
<br />
Make sure anyone wanting flags pre-hails the High Priest, it avoids problems later on.<br />
<br />
Yes, you are kicked out within about 30 seconds if you leave the expedition inside, so long as not agro'd.  Camping a cleric outside can save some time, especially on total wipes, where you don't want to run a naked cleric all the way from PoK or wherever he's bound.</div></div><hr />
