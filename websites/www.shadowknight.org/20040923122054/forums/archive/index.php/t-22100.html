<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">111 DPS with Greatblade of Chaos<br />
105 DPS with Glowing Hammer of Disdain<br />
97 DPS with the Cudgel of Cowardly Death<br />
<br />
Unhasted, no atk buffs, vs. the Ogguk Exterminator.  60 atk under cap, no Combat Effects or Accuracy.<br />
<br />
For the exact numbers, I would have to stop being lazy and check the parse logs.</div></div><hr />

Those weapons are not high end anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't say that they are the best in the game but they are definately high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They're from content thats nearly 2 years old</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They're from content thats nearly 2 years old<br />
<br />
While this is true. There is only 1 expansion that is giving out better weapons , and that is what 2 or 3 months old?<br />
<br />
PoP still has High End weapoons , just no longer End Game weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zeelot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">High end weapons are considered end game weapons. Some of the weapons in GOD are considerably better then the weapons from time, thus replacing time weapons as high end weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gwen + Zeelot 4-ever!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">when I see the top guilds on my server still running around with Time weapons I would still consider them High end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Saying Time and Earth weapons are from a two year old expansion is a bit deluded imo...guilds that got into Time were discovering content as it was made, so kinda hard to say that those items are two years old</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamiken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe woot gwen and zeelot...long time no see......yea high end weapons are more along the range of god weapons now......I know I stopped looking at time weapons as high end when I saw what was coming out of god......heck I still wield a earthspine staff and we been on god now for a few months...course I am far from as bad off as many of the knights in my alliance...though they are all going to sword and board....I just can't bring myself to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I bought and tested 5 top-notch 2h bazaar buyable weapons.<br />
<br />
Windblade: 50 44--About 90DPS<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff: 31 28--About 95DPS<br />
Black Bastardsword: 40 38--About 70DPS<br />
Velium Inlaid Warhammer: 34 28--About 105DPS<br />
Heavy Windriders Lance: 45 40--About 85DPS<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of DPS it went like this: VIW &gt; WMBS &gt; WB &gt; HWL &gt; BBS.<br />
<br />
So pretty much the best buyable 2h weapon in the bazaar right are the Velium Inlaids. With the 100hp/mana/end now, they're better than most if not all tier 1-2 droppable 2hers. Theyre also on par with some tier 3 droppable weapons. They're also pretty damn cheap, bought mine from a friend for 10k, but I often see them for 15k, thats about 2X cheaper than a WB for it's superior DPS and stats. Only drowback is that its req 61 or so, and rec 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I pull about 130 including pet (no dmg proc) with opalescent (WA5, 10 combat effects), and 115 with sews.  When I get a weapon taht dosent suck, i'll parse some more.<br />
<br />
I parse on the wyverns in skyshrine.  Not sure what level, but green, infinate hp, dont fight back, perma rooted, non aggro, no aggro mobs pathing anywhere nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">parse is prolly gonna be skewed more towards the opalescent on those greenies than what reality is on real, high level mobs due to super low AC.  As AC goes up, the slower SEWS is gonna close the gap... it'll lose less as AC goes up.</div></div><hr />
