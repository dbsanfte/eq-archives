<br />
thanks, welcome to our new home =)</div></div><hr />

You MIGHT be able to solo it at 35 with one:  kill frog, FD and regen for a few mins, stand and kill, FD, repeat.  You could probably duo him now.  I'm not positive though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have decent gear(yes twinked, was thinking about moving my mage over from povar, but didn't want to pay and lose all the memories in the items, etc), and yes a regen item:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess the only way would be to try it.  The regen item is the key, lets you FD and get hp back while you go get a drink or something.  As long as you can handle the entire room hitting you long enough to kill one mob (with HT) then you should be able to break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, thanks for your advice, i think i'll postpone it a bit.  this coming friday my spring break starts, so i'll have a few days to lvl like mad, hopefully make 40, where i'll get a little assistance from my friend in getting xp until i'm up to where i was with my mage =P  50/beginning of 51.  somewhere in the 40-50 range i'll probably try it, definately check the spawn each time i'm running to and fro guk.  i have a pre-nerf CoS, so think i should be able to do it fairly well, anyway, thanks for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pajita</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a prenerf CoS?  Even easier!  After you kill the 1st frog, feign, and then use the stand-invis trick so that you can med instead of just staying dead and regening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moolentheus</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After I thought about aquiring the GB from the Shin Lord I went there as level 51 and camped him for 20 spawns.  And his spawn is very random.  he spawned about 6 times during the 20 spwan period and the other 14 spawns were PH's.  He spawned once 3 times in a role and I had to use HT cuz i couldn't keep up.  He's on a 16.20 minute timer and he's a paladin and he does LoH which just makes him that much harder.  And he hits hard for him level.  Plus why would you want to camp him at level 30?  No offense but unless you're in a very Uber Guild which has nothing on their hands to do but do an SK epic, you probably don' need to do GB until you're in your high 50's.  <br />
<br />
As and alternative, there's a GB quest that can be done by class/race and I think takes much less time.  Shin Lord's drop rate of GB is just like 2% and very little and very long camp to get him my friend camped like 20hrs and still hasn't got one.  I actually did the GB quest and spent total of like 5hr in this quest but I had a druid port me evrywhere.  <br />
<br />
I hope this helps but i recommend you get to level 55 and then start doing Epic pieces.  but like I said, you can do epic if you have a lot of help =)<br />

If you keep the other trash cleared, you can avoid the LoH.  At about 2/3, drop every DoT you can on him and land a Darkness.  Then fear him once just under 1/2.  Burn your Harm Touch and get in his back pocket and waste him.  With Fear, he won't cast LoH.  The 500+ HT will slow him to a crawl and leave you with about 200 hps left to go to drop him.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can get unlucky and get a short fear.  But it's worked for me very well (once in 6 tries -- not a good sampling I know).  Incidentally, I've only had him make it out of his room once.  Once the fear lands, drop the HT on him and he'll barely move.  Often, the HT itself will drop his move to zero.  Typically, if I have HT available, the fight is over in about 10 seconds after the fear.</div></div><hr />
