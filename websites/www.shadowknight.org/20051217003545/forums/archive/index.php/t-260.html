<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kzan</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I`m 30 lvl SK exping in FM giant fort. I wear full crusty armor, 2x 6/65 ring, Blade of Xagloz or Moss + Clay Guardian Shield, Orc earings and neckle, Barbed helm. I cant remember my shoulder and face slot items.<br />
At this point i dont know what should i buy next. IMO Darkforge is too similar to Crusty. Maybe Sentinet ( sorry about spelling ) ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lizardium Soulstalker</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being that I'm a Iksar Sk, plate armor was out of the question for me. But at lvl 30, I had Dreadscale armor and a mixture of Ry'gor armor. Now at lvl 44, I have mainly Ry'gor, some GM event items from last Halloween and Dreadscale boots. Im doing my best to get to atleast lvl 46.5 so I can do Raids, to get more gear. <br />
<br />
A friend of mine is a lvl 56 Shaman, of a really big guild and says that when they go to Hate and Fear that the SK items, just rot most of the time. So hopefully, all that gear will have my name on it! :)<br />
<br />
I love the Magelo account, now I can just click on someome who is Level 50+ and has an account. And look at what gear I should be trying to get.</div></div><hr />
