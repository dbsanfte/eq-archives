<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here are just a few things I noticed, feel free to add more to it.<br />
<br />
Three types of npc's that I saw.  Goblins, Statues, Drakes  there may be more but this is all I saw.<br />
<br />
99% does not see invis, but it seems that an occassional npc has a chance of seeing invis.  I died 1 time there but I scrolled up and saw that my invis didn't drop until after it attacked, and not before prompting the attack.<br />
<br />
I haven't found any npc's that summon.  So any class that can kite or root/rot will be ok, at least in the wide open areas.  Mounts are NOT summonable in that zone.<br />
<br />
Melee/spell dmg isn't so bad.  I didn't encounter anything that hit for much higher than 300ish.  With Virtue/CoL I only have about 8k hp and 1600ish AC, 200+aa and was able to tank 2 mobs fine before having to sit to med up.   With my cleric bot I was able to tank non-stop.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice any special attacks from the mobs or any serious spell casting.  So  SK+Cleric  or SK+(any slower) would be fine.  Although I think SK+Shaman would be unstoppable there.<br />
<br />
I noticed some rooms with 3-5 mobs in it, and others with only 1 mob.   So there are multiple places to break and hold camp relatively safely.  Everything was dark blue to me at 65 and was giving me about 3% aaxp per kill solo (i didn't group with my cleric so i'd get the aaxp).<br />
<br />
Imo I think that 65 might be a bit overpowered for that zone.  I think that would be a great zone for 55+ in full group  or 3person group for 60-63.  70 is WAY overpowered for most mobs there.<br />
<br />
There is at least 1 Wayfarer quest there.  I belive it's called either &quot;overpopulation&quot; or &quot;population control&quot;  i forget.<br />
<br />
ok hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pathing sucks. My experiences in SMT were from instances, therefore the content was a bit tougher, but not by much. Trying to split mobs lead to mobs pathing back like worker bees doing their honey dance, and even once at their spawn, never truely reset. So, use caution. Also, IMO, hard as hell to tell the relation of distance btw the flying drakes versus other mobs.  Oh, and drakes gate...I can tank 2 at once easy enough, but 3-4 kinda hurt a lil...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Named's summon in here, and the statue guys upstairs see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a buggy zone...There are mobs under the world off to the right near a tree and a rock as you zone in and yes, the pathing here is horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gamma there is horrid. The ground is so bright you are unable to see the target rings. Very pretty zone, like a dojo, but the color of the floors need work badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the devs commented on this on eqlive.  The ground was inadvertently made to reflective, so if you go in there with a bright light source, it washes everything out and nearly blinds you.  Supposedly if you shut off the 2.x pixel shaders, it will tone the zone down while your there.  They plan on fixing this eventually, but I guess its not high priority. I ended up shutting off dynamic lighting... it improved performance a bit too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh and I'd be interested in feedback if you find posts like this useful or not.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
Not when they're in the wrong forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">bah that's your job to move stuff around.  lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I think when new expansions come out it doesn't hurt to put stuff into the Arena at first (even if only for a week or so) just to see how things shake out, but whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fuck you - not until you start paying me it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ah quit yer whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Being the slowpoke that I am, I'd never gone into Stillmoon except in an instance in a full group.  Due to pathing, etc. I found that for the instances at least, Stillmoon seemed to be a harder zone than the Ascent zone, even though the devs rank Ascent as being more difficult than Stillmoon.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I decided to try a Wayfarer's task (collect 7 meats) and headed to Stillmoon.  At 70, most mobs are still db with a third or so lb.  Maybe it's my unuberness showing but although I didn't find it hard soloing, neither did I find it easy.  My worst pull/add fight was 3 and by the time it was over I was dispelled all to heck, lom, pet dead, etc. and figured it would be prudent to head out and rebuff.<br />
<br />
All sorts of groups were at the ZI so I headed further in.  I agree with the posters above, range is hard to ascertain at times, and FD on statics that return to spawn point seems funky.  I split a single out of a room of 4 goblins; although I did not wait 2 mins to clear aggro, I was very generous in the time I allowed for the mobs to return and reset.  But after a few seconds into my fight, I had all 4 mobs plus another respawn drake and I had to pull the plug.<br />
<br />
The best task for this zone IMO is as was mentioned earlier &quot;population control&quot; (kill 20 stillmoon creatures) rather than collects.  Plus a bonus for this population control task is that unlike collects where drops in instanced missions do not count towards your task -- killing stillmoon creatures within instanced missions DOES count towards your task.  So, to speed up faction and for a little &quot;free&quot; xp, I'd recommend that even if you're not actively doing tasks, that you try to get that one if you can, for the reason I stated above.  Not sure though if a similar mission is available at the actual faction camps or just the wayfarer camps yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">....Some additional thoughts.<br />
<br />
Using my SK as a meat shield I've been slowly pushing my cleric through DoN progression. (Doing the good faction quests).  My sk being lvl 65 with approx 200aa and geared pretty much entirely in Aten Ha Ra gear and Seru blade.  hits approx 8k hp with just Virtue+CoL.  So as you can see he's far from uber by today's standards.  Anyhow, I've been able to duo all of the quests for my cleric  (both the first set of 3 and the second set of 3).  It's not crazy exp like PoFire or MpG....but I tell ya I'm really enjoying the zone.  There are well defined camps.  The mobs are reasonably spread apart to make it doable for single pulls.  (Some require fd/snare pulls or pet pulls)  The drops aren't unreasonably uncommon.  Sure I'd go 2-3 kills of a given npc before i'd get 1 drop.  but that's not stupid rare like shard needed to make ssra bane weapon in the ssra caves.  Npc's are fair to tank.   While I couldn't tank 2 of them unhealed, I can easily tank one without any heals from cleric, and can tank about 3 of them when I have a cleric healing.  (Keep in mind this is without any form of slow on them.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm really enjoying this expansion, I'd gotten so sick of mobs that hit for 1500per hit and are quadding only to drop a piece of meat that vendors won't even give you 1 gold for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">is it just me or does this expansion have way, WAY too many mobs that annul or complete heal?  perhaps they wanted to make these solo tasks easier on paladins, cause they're doable but some of the mobs and the pathing are fucking annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seems like at least a solid third of all mobs are clerics. It's not just you, it's annoying to have a drake CH itself like 3 times before you can get it dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moudis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like losing my top 2-4 buffs every other mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Izabadman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You probably already realize this, but 2 instaclicky junk buffs helps that annul problem a bit, you just have to realize that if you fight here, you will get dispelled.  It's annoying, yes, but if you've ever soloed fear, you're used to playing with only what you brought, buff-wise, or being very fast on the clicky trigger.<br />
<br />
The Complete heals are a much more annoying problem than the annuls.  To top it off, every single one of the drakes are immune to stuns, making interrupting their casting a hit or miss issue of using bash most times.<br />
<br />
Everything in the zone seems to have extended range on their spells as well.<br />
<br />
Pathing sucks horribly, and aggro ranges are bizzarre and incongruous.<br />
<br />
I miss anything?</div></div><hr />
