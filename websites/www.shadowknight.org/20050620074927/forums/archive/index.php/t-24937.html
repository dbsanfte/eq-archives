<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skpimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have noticed that the same people in the bazaar/ooc keep selling Discordant Scoriae and base augs (tourmaline/kyanite/sappherlite...etcetc) time after time. this begs the question of where are they looting the steady flow of them?<br />
<br />
are there spots around that drop these 2 things more often then other spots? do named ph's or named drop them more then normal mobs. do they drop off say murkgliders and not dragorns in NC? rcod? wos? or vise versa<br />
<br />
what camp/specific mob do u think is the best place to get Discordant Scoriae / base augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoS random mobs seem to have a signifigantly higher chance of dropping the DS than most RCoD mobs I've seen, though that's just personal perception</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>silanak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got all mine in the dranik instances.  I got mostly resist augs.  Also, when OOW first came out the scoria was far more common then they nerfed the drop rate there.  I haven't done them too much since I got DON but after they nerfed the drop rate I would say I got one scoria every ten full six hour missions by camping the first 10 to 15 spawns and I got a random aug every other mission.  I only did them for easy exp for my 4 box team and I could afk for a long time not haveing to worry about trains.<br />
<br />
I got max faction and I bet I got around 250 AA in them so I spent a fair amount of time there. <br />
<br />
From what I can recall I got around; 2 mana regen augs, 2 Hp augs (combine lost them though) 2 strikethroughs, 6 or so mana augs, shit loads of resist augs, dozen scoria or so, tons of treon flies and about dozen slugworms. <br />
<br />
There were a few times where I pretty much cleared the whole instance versus killing the first 15 mobs at the zone in and I would useally net a scoria or two and a few random augs.  I would bet there are about 70 to 80 mobs in the firepit instance and they repop on a 15 min timer so you have to keep on the move .<br />
<br />
I do beleive on Saryrn Scoria still goes for 100 to 150k and pure augs depending on the aug can go from 400k to 800k so there out of the reach of most players.  <br />
<br />
The only effect I would really recommend is dodge three since that effect is only on a few high end peices.  I could tell a pretty big differnce with dodge 3 aug.  Most of the other effects can be bought from DON now. The only two that come to mind is the Furane or whatever its called and dodge 3 which both are nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too, got the majority of augs and components in Dranik's Hollows instances (multiboxing like the poster above).  Distribution was about the same on type and frequency.<br />
<br />
After seeing the insane prices on the augs and components, we decided as a guild to not sell any whether we are solo, multi-boxing, grouping or raiding in OoW zones.  Yes, this seemed at first to hurt us on a personal level (e.g. I'm multi-boxing by myself, got a citrine which goes for 120k but I turn it over to the guild anyways).  Our tradeskilling peeps skilled up, our guild paid for the subcomponents and we all got decent augs out of it.  Although on Klotar I elected out of most augs (I think I opted in on one Kyanite), several of my alts benefitted even, including ID5 and FT3/MP5 augs (which I've seen go for 1 mil plat), etc.<br />
<br />
Base aug and aug component prices haven't seemed to have gone down in the Bazaar from what I've seen, at least on Prexus.  Drops are still rare, commanding high prices, which in turn make the finished product high priced.  I certainly can't afford shelling out 300k+ for an aug, so I basically ignore all those and if I need something I try to get a DoN equivalent.  Still, OoW tradeskilled augs do have the attractiveness of multiple benefits (double duty?) but the best combo ones are priced way high, and ones that have a crap base aug but nice secondary effect still are too pricey (e.g. +12 dis and stun resist or something).<br />

Ah well, mini-rant off, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a player like yourself, Klotar, OoW augs will have a big added benefit in that they can be used in the type 12 slot on GM DoN armor.  You'd obviously benefit from a few pieces of the armor themselves, and they can then be further improved by adding the OoW augs.  Most of them are rather worthless to most tanks, because they compete for slots with RSS and LDoN AC augs, but when you can bypass the slot issues and need the effects anyway, they're not so bad a pickup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a feeling I'm about to embarrass myself but... I'm not sure what you mean there.  I only have about 4 OoW tradeskilled augs to look at on my chars, and they all show as type 7,8.  I do agree that I could use some DoN cultural... just spotted the GM bp for 500k last night (down 350k from 850k), w00t!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When's the last time you actually looked at them?<br />
<br />
They should show 7,8,12.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was looking at my magelo, updated as of this morning.  I figured the magelo database would be as up-to-date as anything since it's live, etc.  But you're right, I haven't actually look-looked for some time ingame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>skpimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">stay focused on the topic..<br />
<br />
where are the best places to get discordant scoriae / base augs so that we can all work on great aug's.  what specific camps/ specific mobs can be farmed to greatly increase the drop rate of these items. what camp have people seen them drop often during?<br />
<br />
<br />
DON cultural and type 9/12 etc etc augs are very nice. however that discussion belongs in a different thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Klotar...Slein didn't mean the type of aug, but the slot.  AC augs from RS fit in all visible armor slots, and AC augs from LDoN fit in face/back/neck/waist/shoulder.  Unless you've got type 12 slots on your gear, there is nowhere to put them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">stay focused on the topic..<br />

Haha... wrong message board there bud.</div></div><hr />
