**********<br />
Drop rates are meant to be fairly low on an individual basis, but in bulk the upstairs area yields pretty good loot. The patrolling NPCs have the lowest chance of loot, and some loot you can only get from the statics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What exactly is meant by the &quot;upstairs area?&quot;  Are we sure these are notes for the new hate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no upstairs in Poh8B.  Just different areas with differen tier mobs with Inny's area being the highest tier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry if my post was misleading. the thread i got that from was around 2 years old. 'new' hate refers to the revamp. <br />
<br />
By upstairs he means the stairs leading from tier 1 to tier 2. <br />
<br />
I was just wondering if there was any truth to him saying static mobs in the houses have a better chance of drops (i.e. the hide) than the wandering mobs - and that tier 2 mobs have a better still drop rate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are no stairs seperating the &quot;tiers&quot; in the currnent hate (plane of hate b).<br />
<br />
There are just invisible boundries as you move farther from the port in area.<br />
<br />
tier 1 = Same old mobs that we all knew and loved from the old hate.  The mini bosses have been renamed and all have PHers. The PHers are all static mobs and always spawn the same modle as the named... ie the Brood Master is always an ashenbone drake.<br />
<br />
tier 2 = Same old models as the Tier 1 though thier levels are a bit higher, hit a bit harder ect...<br />
<br />
tier 3 = New model of Dark elves with names like &quot;Knight of Hate, Templar of Hate, Champion of Hate, ect...&quot; these mobs are level 61 +/- a level or 2, can hit for up to 600s and casters can nuke hard.<br />
<br />
tier 4 = Same new model of Dark elves though higher level, 65 i believe and have names like &quot;Grave Lord of hate&quot; hit a bit harder and nuke a bit harder then teir 3.<br />
<br />
I personally have never seen a hide drop, but after seeing everything else drop, (armor, quest pieces and stuff) you have equal chance off either a static or a roamer.  Matter of fact the mage epic staff droped off a common tier 1 roamer last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got 2 hide drops in 5 hours at zone-in,  in one night.  I know we were extreamly lucky,  but from the other hunting I've done it seems that the % for drop is pretty evenly spread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">500+ drakes and ive never seen a hide drop.<br />
<br />
I have seen every other class quest piece from hate drop at least 3+ times ...<br />
<br />
Cursed? I think so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Side note:<br />
<br />
The Evangelist of Hate isn't spaming the zone anymore.  He only shows up when you are playing with Inny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>osmunius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I miss old hate... no more climbing the wall.. buhu!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, my guild was just in hate the other day to try and get some marsinger quest items, while we were waiting, we pulled some stuff to zone in etc...  What I was wondering was, when we were in tier 2, I saw hatebone drakes, does the hide also drop off of them, or just the tier 1 ashenbone drakes?</div></div><hr />
