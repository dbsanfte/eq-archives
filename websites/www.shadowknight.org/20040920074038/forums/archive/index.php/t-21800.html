<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently Ive been talking with a few friends on the topic of switching to a new less crowded less expensive server..There are sever pros and cons to be conscidered, I will list a few and then look to see what you suggest..<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
1. Less crowded<br />
2. Cheaper prices on bazaar<br />
3. New folks to work with. maybe find a good guild.<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
1. Less crowded may mean not as many looking to group<br />
2. The guilds there may be just as retarded as the Drinal Server<br />
3. Its gonna cost me some loot to swap.<br />
<br />
Now, all this is on hold till my barracks gets cable internet access on July 15th so stuck till then enjoy Okinawa..Blech..I cant remember the servers but is there one called Cazic Thule?..It might be cool to be on a web site that is named after a god my sk worships.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having moved from Drinal to Stormhammer to Tarew, I can say... it doesn't make a difference.  There are drama queens and retards on every server.<br />
<br />
I like Tarew, but I liked Drinal as well.<br />
<br />
If prices on good are higher, so too are the prices on the goods you sell.  The same applies for cheaper goods.  On Stormhammer, I had a lock on mana vials which sell (quickly) for twice the price they do (slowly) on Tarew.  I made less money selling them but I need to spend less to buy the things I want.</div></div><hr />

P.S. As has been mentioned already, you will get idiots whichever Server you move to. In my opinion, Drinal is actually one of the nicest Servers around. And if it's the cost of gear that bothers you, that has nothing to do with Drinal, the market is screwed up everywhere.</div></div><hr />

The one GoD/time guild is Euro also, we are the only raiding euro guild on the server.  All of the others are on US time.  A PvP server isn't as bad as people make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ayonae Ro used to be a good server. There used to be tons of great guilds to choose from.  Sadly though it seems that everyone is moving on.  There are almost no really good guilds left anymore.  Its either join a casual guild that never goes anywhere or join a raid guild that raids every night, nothing in between.  The server boards are almost dead, the mods basically have no life really put harsh limits on what you can post.</div></div><hr />

Just relating my experience.  I moved from Prexus to Tholuxe to play with some RL friends.  I think Prexus is an original EQ server, is noticably more crowded,  and I found a lot of prices to be higher on Prexus, most likely because there is simply a lot of platinum.  Of course, some things like LDoN loots tend be cheap since there are so many people winning/selling them.  By contrast, a lot of tradeskill items tend to be higher (cultural, etc) on the newer Tholuxe beacuse there are less people farming components and less with the requisite skill.<br />

Hahaha! I have people on Tarew Marr all the time say they are the toilet of all servers. They admit to this, and enjoy being refered to that way. Like Odi said, people stand and wait for you to die so they can get the exp from your already dead mob. But at the same time, the top levels of TM are fun and exciting, just don't make too many friends, most are slightly greedy.  If you can take a flame, a beating, backstabbing, and a JOKE, TM is perfect. I loved my time on TM just for the fact the majority of the people there could take a JOKE!!!  I have a friend on TM who took my high level cleric name, and is telling all my friends who /tell him that I was banned because I tried to cyber my way out of a tight spot with a GM.  /snicker I love TM.<br />

-Just in case you wondered how my friend got a hold of my cleric name...(no I didn't sell my account, I just transferred servers because I was unguilded on TM, and my friends were in high end guilds and no longer had time for me, after I transfered out, he got the name)</div></div><hr />

I'm curious why you felt the need to bump a dead, month-old thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the top time guild Defiant which was neutral to pretty much everyone decided to start kosing like velious era guilds shortly after they entered time, complained they couldn't find enough pvp and such...<br />
<br />
Eventually the 2nd US guild Zephyros had a tiff with Defiant their ally at the time and they started kosing each other.<br />
<br />
Aerist still hides behind both of them claiming neutrality and Defiant leaves them alone. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the guilds you have AD (euro time guild) + Adue + DDW allied doing their usual griefing and such.<br />
<br />
You also have HECK (3team xteamers they dont like DARKS) who are kos to everyone and do their usual griefing. Along with Infectusandco (Dark purist) who do their usual pity tripping that the server should be hardcoded blah blah blah they are actually doing relativly well considering though.  <br />
<br />
So inclosing its not fun being in a guild trying to progress on VZ.</div></div><hr />

Wrong...<br />
AD is KOS to everybody except Aduentus, we are neutral them.  Defiant is neutral to Aerist and I believe KOS to everybody else.  AD has no allies we are only neutral to one guild.</div></div><hr />

Don't know of any actively recruiting SKs, the boat to catch was a couple months ago when all the highend guilds were suffering attrition and if you were a good player with good raid time you had a shot at making a home for yourself regardless of class.</div></div><hr />

Fo shizzle!<br />
<br />
seriously though, Cazic is rather top heavy as well.  You never see any lowbies that are not alts or getting PLed.  there is also an excess of noobiots in the `50s i keep dealing with in LDoN pickup groups.  given there are some awesome folks on the server, actually lots of em, but it's not the server I would reccomend someone to start fresh on...it's just going to be a painful climb up.  <br />
<br />
Prices are rather low, ornate Boots going for 120k last time I checked, but little twink gear anymore aince everyone is chucking it out to the tribute vendors.<br />
<br />
Really, go to a server for the folks and levelbase, not for economy.  Just do your newbie gear quests (yeah weapon too, they suck but are magic...so its kinda worth it), and then go kill stuff.  It's like the rolling stones song, &quot;You can't always get what you want, but if you try, you might find...you get what you need&quot;.  Basically you get what is needed for content at that point in game.  If your good with saving your plat and not buying any armor and doing your newbie quests...you might have enough coin to buy a darkedged two-hander...fiarly decent blade...goes for about 50-100pp on cazic.  It may be underpowered up until lvl 20, but hey...once you get up there, you'll hit nice and hard :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For one thing i've been playing for 5 years now, the rolls used to be 1-100 on mith marr, but gradually changed to 100-200, somehow everyone said that you could cheat doing it that way so it eventually ended up being 200-300.<br />
<br />
On Drinal you roll 200-500.  I'm not sure which I like better.  Although I always roll in the damn 200s &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I noticed a change in tone of the characters.  Mith Marr players were had more of an elitism attitude, like &quot;Yea we have Afterlife, so we're the best and we know everything&quot;  Whereas Drinal players were more modest, if they didn't know something they asked (what a fuckin concept)  and were quick to admit they were wrong.<br />
<br />
Drinal is a good server imho, and I would not switch back to mith marr if you paid me, unless you could bring back all the old players that I used to group with.</div></div><hr />
