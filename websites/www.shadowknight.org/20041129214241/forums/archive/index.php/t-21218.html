Beginning May 3, 2004, at 10:00am PDT, those interested in signing up for the EverQuest II beta can log onto the game's official Web site for application instructions. Longtime subscribers to SOE’s EverQuest Legends service will be given top priority in the application process, followed by qualified applicants of the Lords of EverQuest special offer. <br />
<br />
EverQuest II comes five years after the original EverQuest, the ultrasuccessful fantasy PC MMORPG that spawned eight expansion packs, two PlayStation 2 iterations (three if you count Champions of Norrath), and a real-time strategy spin-off. The sequel will feature an all-new world with 100,000 lines and 130 hours of dialogue, equal to about 65 feature films. The game will let players choose from 16 races and 24 branching classes and customize their characters' armor and facial expressions. The game will also let players purchase property in the realm and engage in in-game trade. <br />
<br />
According to SOE, EverQuest II will be released &quot;later in the year.&quot; GameSpot will have more information on the game as it becomes available</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I cant really imagine starting over after 5 years of EQ. But if a whole guild were to move together it might not be so bad. <br />
<br />
This might still be an option for those who really liked EQ but wound up leaving or are on the brink of leaving because they have &quot;capped out&quot; especially for the non raiders who feel that they cant achieve much more and are looking for something new to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's the first game that I actually consider leaving EQ for. WoW leaves me indifferent although I will it for sure.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of the game being aimed at casual gamers, doesn't require long session, doesn't require large raids, most content aimed at single group. Most boss fight being triggered and instanced as a result of quest...no more fighting for content.<br />
<br />
They might fail...but for me personally, the philosophy being the game is what attracts me to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The screenshots of EQ2 look horrible. I couldn't imagine a raid of 40+ people who all look like those craptastic models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah i like alot of the features like Enganging a mob, where no one else can help or attack unless you disengage. <br />
Voice dialog.<br />
<br />
My main problem that i see though is some of the models look really fake, plastic like, hopefully the beta people will complain enough and they will maybe change the skins or whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You won't see raid of 40+ people since raids are capped at 24 people.<br />
<br />
As for skin looking like plastic, that is long gone. recent movies and screenshots show the plastic is totally gone. The hair still looks pretty ugly though.</div></div><hr />

Wow, 24 people? Thats not very many people at all. I dont see how they could make encounters very difficult with such a low number of raiders expected to accomplish the goal. <br />
<br />
Unless of course people begin to raid together. So for example 2 or 3 &quot;raids&quot; get together to take out a target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't know, I think you could make an encounter quite difficult with a limit of 24 people on a raid.  And then you wouldn't have to worry about people beating the content by throwing more bodies at it, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can make harder with a hard cap limit then any encounter in EQ Live right now since right now people always have the option ot throw more people at an encounter.<br />
<br />
You won't be able to do that in EQ 2. Imagine any event in EQ live that sets a limit on number of people that can try it...plenty of them are difficult...that's how EQ 2 will be.</div></div><hr />

Where are these movies cause I saw a movie with the voice dialog and they still looked plastic</div></div><hr />

I would however like to know how the Iksar end up in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alecto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They don't look like plastic anymore. However, EQ2 is the spitting image of claymation. Retro-animation anyone? Sinbad and the Lost Temple of the Fist of Marr.  <br />
<br />
It's just weird. It's also SOE, so that's two strikes against it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fuck EQ 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">they fucked people over so hard in eq no way im going to get eq2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sinafay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No way I'll be getting it either.  My SK is only 53 and I only play a couple days a week anymore so I'm still having fun in EQ1.  But no way will I ever play another SOE game.  I'm just sick and tired of the lousy CS, the half done expansions, all the bugs and unfinished content at release, what appears to be a complete disregard for their customer base, and an amazing lack of knowledge about their own game.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm quite glad that I am at least two expansions behind the uber curve in EQ.  Maybe by the time I get to some of the newer content most of the bugs will be worked out and I can enjoy it.  When this game stops being fun, I will stop playing it.  I've already taken several EQ breaks, one for a little over a year long.  The others were just a few months here and there.  I'll do it again when I get frusterated, burned out,  or a few more friends leave.<br />
<br />
I would have tried SW Galaxies if it was done by another company, but since it was SOE I didn't bother.  I'm already playing one of their half done games, why pay to beta test another?  I won't be trying EQ2 for the same reason.  Has nothing to do with attachment to my chars, not wanting to start over, or anything else.  Has everything to do with a lack of faith in the company doing the game.<br />

<br />
I'd be willing to bet that will happen and SOE will change something about it. I like the idea of raiding though, that would be a bad thing for me...<br />
<br />
EDIT: And that would make alot of guilds...and would probably cause traffic jams if there is progression...</div></div><hr />

Yay, more UO-style trailer park worlds~  Actually I assume that they are going to work out something like FFXI's Mog houses, would be unrealistic to have placeable property in a 3d game world.<br />
<br />
I'll play it.  If figure, it took soE about 3-4 years to seriously start fucking over SKs, so that gives me about 3 years to play EQ2, assuming things go as well as they did in EQ1~</div></div><hr />

That's an awefully big assumption there, Kalendrox.  <br />
<br />
For the record, the only thing SOE has a finger in that I would mess with will be SWG, but only after Jump To Hyperspace is out for a while and the ins and outs of starfighter flight and combat are ironed out.  It'll be that expansion that'll make SWG worth playing in my mind, so that when SOE runs EQ into the ground and drives my guild out, I can move on to fly a YT-1300 that I'll modify extensively.  I'm assuming, of course, that they'll include a couple of the stock light frieghters with all the starfighters.  Otherwise, I'll have to do some interesting things with an A-Wing or a Tie Advanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As usual Europeans wont be in an American games beta, which does make me laugh cause if you took lineage 2's NA beta test i'd say it was 50/50 euro/americans on it.  Theres a huge market out there in europe thats marginalised, As a side note the buzz is SoE wont run any servers outside North america they will hand europe over to Ubisoft to run servers for.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else flashing back to old school raids where only the group that did the most damage actually got the exp?  (and BTW people worked harder on raids then)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Im pretty sure that most or at least many raid targets will be instanced in pocket zones.  So you couldnt group more than one raid together.  I think that this is a great idea.  Its much easier to design encounters this way.  The lack of a limit on the amount of people is one of the reasons sks got screwed over.  Devs had to design a mob to be so powerful that it could be chalenging to an infinite number of players.  That was to powerful for anyone to tank except the very best tanks, which we were never suposed to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Awruan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am not a fan of the smaller raid-type encounters.  I like having to have a full guild to do an event.  It is what makes guild members rely on one another and work together (or die together as can be the case).  My guild keeps about 120 members rostered at any given time so that assuming 50% of the members are there, we have a decently sized raiding force.  To cut that to 40 people would drastically alter the gaming experience for me.  I will not be playing EQ2 unless some very fundamental changes are made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blackfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Thank God none of you bitter whiny losers will be on EQ2.   Means more space for those of us who are not so bitter or whiny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Remember there's 420k people playing EQ, there's 1.6 millions who stopped playing it. Which group do you think it makes more sense to try and attract to EQ 2, keeping in mind that those already in EQ are already paying you money?<br />
<br />
EQ 2 is a different game, sometimes I wonder if they made the right choice in calling it EQ 2, and not just create a totally new fantasy setting for it.<br />
<br />
They are after the 1.6 millions who left, or are about to leave EQ. If you like EQ, then stay there...there are more expansion in the works, new graphics engine with new art....EQ isn't going anywhere for a very long time...they could loose 300K users and it would still be extremely profitable venture, and still worht putting out expansion for it, but then I doubt they'll loose more then 100k max to WoW and EQ 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">No EQ2 for me, SOE has proved that the only thing they care about is doing whatever makes them money, whether its screwing the content or screwing the players.   No thanks.<br />
<br />

Edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Raldath_Doodie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As a sk that has played for 4 years now, and still in the mid range game, I am looking forward to the instanced idea. This will mean that my guild of 20 to 30 characters will be able to atempt the bosses, and not have to be on ungodly amount of hours just to get to it.</div></div><hr />

LMAO  pretty straightforward<br />

Not moving into eq2 - sony jacked enough money out of me-- this is the only MMORPG i be playing for a while</div></div><hr />
