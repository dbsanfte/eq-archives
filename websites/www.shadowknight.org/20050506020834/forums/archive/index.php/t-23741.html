<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got coerced into trying EQ2 in the last few days.  I want to play an SK, but my friends want to start a good guild out of Qeynos.  Is there a way for me to play an SK main and easily play with them?  I've heard about the betrayal quest- is that the answer, or does that change my alignment to good and prevent me from developing as an SK?<br />
<br />
Or should I give up on an SK and pick a pally or warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hurst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not entirely sure about how limmited you'd be..... I mean, once you become a SK you'll be tough enough to meet up with yer guildies... as they are only (FreePort-&gt;Commonlands-&gt;NekForest-&gt;Thundering Steppes-&gt;Antonica-&gt;Qeynos) 5 zones away... <br />
<br />
Where they will all be gating home to qeynos you'll be gating home to Freeport. Not horrible but may be a tad inconvienent. From what I've experienced so far, us evil folks seem to have no issues getting quests in Antonica and Thundering Steppes.....which is tha good alighned 'continent'.<br />
<br />
You may have issues with getting 20th, as all yer friends are 'far away'. That run through Nek can be kinda 'bleh' if yer not high enough level (20th-ish). Maybe your guildleader will allow you to be a recruiter for evil aligned characters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think from whati understand is that the only thing that will effect you is that you wont be able to contribute or take advantage of Guild House and Guild Status pointsd quest/raids you can still take part in tho. Im a SK and atm im in a good guild, you do feel alittle isolated some times, so much so i made a Kerran Brawler/monk there just so i can join in some times heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grobobos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You won't be able to become an SK if you do the betrayal quest..<br />
You have to complete it before level 17 or 18 so anyway before you become a ShadowKnight... You can however be in the same guild as guys from the other side.. just ask the GL or an officier to come to the entrance of Nektulos (from qeynos) and you get into nektulos from Commonlands and then he can invite you..<br />
This of course won't help you play with them but you'll be able to speak with them. We created for instance a guild that spans on evil and good side with officiers on both sides. Officially the guild is a qeynos resident guild but we hope that the ways of our great lord will spread to sissy land..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I fail to see how people enjoy all these roleplaying restrictions in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah the moronic roleplaying restrictions are limiting my enjoyment of the game atm.<br />
<br />
So far I'm playing a paladin (well fighter destined to become a paladin), although I'll try to maintain the SK on alt status until such time as restrictions are changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play a SK, one of the only two evil toons from a guild that has over 140 members.  This dosn't really bother me that much, I know at higher levels it won't be a problem since the areas we raid won't be close to either city.  It is kind of annoying but at least now that I play an evil character the quests themselves are fun since they are, well dark and grim.  I feel like I really am playing a SK more just from the roleplaying aspect, even though I hate the new weak FD! :(  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another thing to remember, is that maybe one day, some mobs might be dropping SK only loot and whos gonna be getting all that?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not really looking at the high end game (and since the high end game is pretty much unknown, it doesn't really make sense to anyways).  I'm just looking at a toon I can use to group with my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild from SWG has moved on to either EQ2, or WoW.  Those of us that have done EQ2 started the Neon Knights in Qeynos.  I hate Qeynos, and all the happy people in it, so i started an Evil Sect in Freeport, call Knights Who Say NI! (yet to be formed due to lack of cash, but it will be soon.)  We have created a chat channel for both guilds to join and have our discussions, and its been pretty fun so far</div></div><hr />
