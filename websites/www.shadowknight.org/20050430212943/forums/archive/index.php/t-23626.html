<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has any suggestion on decent places to solo some aa's at lvl 70.  I typically live in MPG or Pofire.  I still have not found a better place to exp then Fire's camp 2 (near the table camp).  The speed and lack of risk makes that a prime area for grinding at least 12 aa's out in a full day or so. However, my experience soloing past lvl 50 is limited.  Now that im 70 and sufficiently geared, i would like to make an attempt :P  My magelo is listed in my sig (atm im 8100hp/2200ac unbuffed.. I have the 68 pet and 268aa's). I look forward to hearing some good suggestions</div></div><hr />

<br />
If one of the named happen to spawn, be really careful and have a cure for chaotica nearby. :p<br />
<br />
It's ok exp, but the reason I like it so much is because you don't have to aggro kite, I get so fricking sick of aggro kiting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fire soloing at the tables area is probably still the best solo AA per kill, in fact more so with the new pet and additional DoT upgrades. The thing that is so annoying about soloing in Fire is that you can't use your FR based DoTs, which are pretty much our most mana efficient. But I have found that with the 68 pet and the full complement of mage summoned toys that the time per kill there (and the mana regen downtime) has gotten a hell of alot faster. You can now complete a single kite in under 6-7 minutes, for example...and I think that the first time I soloed there it used to take me 10 to 12 minutes...<br />
<br />
It isn't something I'd want to do for more than a few kills to cap off an AA, but it is nice to go there when you need to do precisely that.<br />
<br />
Vxed isn't really worth soloing for AA if you don't wish to make a real commitment of time getting new instances when a summoning mob repops in your path...add in a zoning crash or two and the downtime won't justify the AA gain rate. But it is fun to do a few times for variety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What would be great would be a small table of 70 vs. 65 XP solo/duo (mainly diff is downtime of just boxing for me).  I'm a very casual gamer so one of my big conscerns against leveling to 70 will be the lack of easy/quiet XP spots to AA in while getting some minor loot.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have the latest ZEMs?  I know they have changed alot lately with the new , whatever the term is SoE uses, enhanced XP zones.  I'm used to soloing in Hate for a quiet and easy spot; but I'm wierd that way, I know there's much better at 65.</div></div><hr />
