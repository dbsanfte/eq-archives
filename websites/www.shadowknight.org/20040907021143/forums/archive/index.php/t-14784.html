<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PeteBull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Correct me if my assumptions are wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that Troll SK's take a 20% hit in XP and Trolls don't take a 20% hit on AAXP, is the following reasoning correct?<br />
<br />
Say I split my regular XP and AAXP in a 50%/50%.<br />
<br />
I make a kill and get 100xp.  <br />
40 xp goes to regular xp  (50 x .8)<br />
50 xp goes to  AAXP<br />
<br />
If added,  I'm really realizing 90 of my 100 xp, thus getting around the 20% hit and actually taking only a 10% hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hekk Fire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not exactly.  You're still taking a 20 pct penalty on your regular XP in your example, and none on AAXP, which is the same as it would be if you were on one or the other exclusively.<br />
<br />
 I've heard before that XP division is broken and that going for one or the other is best.  Even if everything is working properly, going 50/50 slows down progress.  You would be better off using X amount of XP to either earn a level or earn an AA point, rather than a portion of both.  <br />
<br />
  One of my guildmates said the other day that he's going for 2AA then level then 2AA then level.  Sounds like a pretty reasonable plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read that once your turn regular XP on and even if its 10% the XP Penalty kicks in, thus i would recommend allways 100% in one or the other. I have no proof for it and did no testing, just giving out what i heard and what seems to be logical to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 20% penalty is not subtracted from exp you gain, Trolls just require 20% more exp per level than the base races do.<br />
  <br />
So, no matter the split, the same exp would be going to normal/AA regardless of race, you just need 20% more normal exp to level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't work that way.  Everyone requires the same amount of experience to level - as a race with an experience penalty, each mob you kill gives you X% less experience.  See the numerous threads on racial experience penalties, like this one (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7484&amp;highlight=troll+experience+penalty).<br />
<br />
In answer to the original question, if you're playing a race with a substantial experience penalty you should always have either normal experience or AA experience set to 100%.  Due to the way racial penalties work, if you have experience divided between normal and AA you're paying the racial penalty for  AA experience as well.</div></div><hr />
