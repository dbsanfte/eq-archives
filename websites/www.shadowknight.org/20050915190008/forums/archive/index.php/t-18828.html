<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigwak</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you guys explain the abbreviations MA/SA and what that means?  I assume MT is main tank, and I can handle those responsibilities.  However, I'm not sure what I'm supossed to be doing when I'm not the puller and main tank.  For instance, if a bard is pulling, I assume I want to get and sustain aggro.  But, I was in a group were the warrior pulled.  So do pull aggro from him (if I can) to let him pull another, or do I concentrate on DPS.  Any thoughts about my role in different situations is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

They mean the same thing as Main Tank and Secondary Tank usually....i.e. they are the people that the group should set their /assist hotkeys to.<br />
<br />
As for your responsibilities in taking agro, I think that is something that your group needs to define.  If the puller and tank are going to be seperate people, then the tank should be taking agro from the puller as soon as possible once &quot;inc&quot; is announced.  If the puller is going to be the tank as well, then you should let him keep his agro and just worry about dps.  If you find yourself asking yourself questions about this, I think you need to ask the group what roll they want you to play because everyone needs to agree on this point.<br />
<br />
Not agreeing on rolls or having confusion about those rolls is a sure way to end up with dead toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MA = Main Assist (who the other group members take their assist from)<br />
<br />
SA = Secondary Assist (usually in the case of raids where the MA dies during the fight, or occasionally in the case of some scripts where a guardian or add is spawned that must be focused on by the rest of the raid while the MA keeps the main target busy)<br />
<br />
The best advice I can give you on responsibilities in groups is to iron this stuff out before you get situated in camp and start pulling.  Different people have different play styles, so what they expect from you in the group may be vastly different.<br />
<br />
What I do, whenever I'm MT but not pulling is to put myself between the puller and the rest of the group and then hit assist macro as soon as the puller announces he has one.  This allows me to begin casting a CD or other aggro spell while the puller is bringing the mob back and as he runs past me, I pick up the mob before he ever gets to the puller, giving me time to position while the rest of the group engages.  And when I'm MT, it doesn't matter who is pulling, be it warrior, rogue, paladin, bard or chanter.  That's just the way I do it.  However, you always need to define those roles with your group prior to starting.  Just because you CAN grab aggro off of the warrior doesn't mean you SHOULD or that your group WANTS you to do so.  <br />
<br />
If the puller wants to chain mobs, especially in the case of a warrior puller, sometimes they'll bring one back and engage, keeping aggro until 20% and then try and let someone else grab aggro so they can go pull more.  This is where you should shine, as you can grab snap aggro on the nearly dead mob and tank (if it doesn't run) until it's dead while he goes and gets something new.  However, you should ask if this is the way that he wants it to work.  Be proactive, communicate with your group and discuss rationally (without presuming anything about being a &quot;king of aggro&quot;) and you'll do fine in pickup groups.  And if you continue to play that way, you'll probably find several people who you'll end up regularly grouping with, as they know what to expect from you and you know what to expect from them.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

The person who is tanking the mob, and who all others assist.  Obviously you must take aggro from the puller.<br />
<br />
If you not pulling or tanking (MT, MA) then basically you are just dps - bring up GOBONER wohoooo!!!!<br />
<br />
On raids where the are multiple mobs being tanked at the same time, generallly I use the term MA (Main assist).  This person doesnt generally TANK a mob, but is the key person for the rest of the raid to assist.  Its also usefull to assign a MA when the tanks die alot, this way you dont have to keep changing your assist hotbutton.<br />
<br />
SA = is generally the warrior who is whining in the tank channel because he never gets to be MT (JK)</div></div><hr />

This is the Rampage Tank, basically some poor slob with lots of HPs who gets selected to be on the mobs rampage list.</div></div><hr />
