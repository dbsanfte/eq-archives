<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sithacult</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering how Narandi's Lance compares to epic in terms of damage output. Is there that big of a difference? The procs seem comparable in terms of DPS. So the question I have is the extra 4dmg with Narandi's noticable. If so you think its worth buying  for around 60k as an upgrade? I know the overall stats are better with epic and you can bash with it but I'm only concerned about the dmg output. I'm currently looking for a way to boost my dmg output on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
epic's better imho... <br />
<br />
you lose a few ac and a few hps, but the epic has better resists and stats... <br />
<br />
I can notice the 4 extra damage on my lance, but I think the bash makes up for it against non casters, and on casters, well, bash is nice against casters :)  <br />
<br />
the DPS from the procs depends on your dex really.. once you proc your lance, it'll be up 100% of the time for the rest of the fight, as long as you keep your lance equipped... it does 37 damage per tick.  Epic proc does 50 damage per tick (and heals 50 damage per tick of course :)) but epic proc is harder to keep up full time... I'd say around 180 dex or so, you can keep epic up 99% of the time without much trouble.  With 255 dex I can proc my lance, then switch to epic and do some manaless dot stacking, swapping back and forth as needed ;)  I get such a kick out of that<br />
<br />
soloing, epic beats the hell out of the lance, there's no comparison<br />
<br />
but, buff slots are a problem sometimes (a lot of times.. give me 10 more buff slots and I'll use em all easily, give me 5 more and I'll at least be happy) - in cases where I just don't have the buff slots to have soul consumption overwriting my grim aura or other things if my buff order gets mixed up, I switch to the lance</div></div><hr />

I am using it and feel high DPS. Beside, greenmist or epic which worth to do ??</div></div><hr />

I've tried this out a few times. Never really used it properly to see how good it is but it's sposed to be one of the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sithacult</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are really two resaons i'm interested in the Lance. <br />
<br />
1) On some raid MoBs that resist epic proc I get alot of unwanted agro which means I have to FD alot which is frustrating. It seems that resisting the epic proc is a huge agro booster to mobs:(<br />
<br />
2) I'm looking for anyway to increase my damage output on raid MoBs and I already have max haste and Primal or better is out of the question for a while.<br />
<br />
So for those of you that have both which do you use on raid Mobs other than ones that ae where epic proc sticks. Also I'm not concerned with loosing bash I can always blow some saved AA for it. If the extra damage output is only equal to loosing bash of the epic (as stated above) then I'm thinking it may not be worth it to blow 60k on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use epic or swap both in to do the manaless dot stacking on raids, depending on how busy I am, and wether or not I have buff slots to spare<br />
<br />
epic &gt; narandi's lance in most situations<br />
<br />
don't blow 60k on lance if you already have epic (as a side note, lance goes for 35-45k on my server, not 60k)</div></div><hr />
