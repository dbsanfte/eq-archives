<br />
So, i was wondering - Is it better to stay, say 51 and work on AA available at that lvl OR proceed to higher lvls and THEN work on AAs?<br />
<br />
I was planning to get to 52 for better STR and Pet and then hang there for a while ( Prolly long while LOL ) and work on all of my AAs I would like to have.<br />

What do you noble Shadow Warriors think?<br />

At 51 I started putting 10% to AA.  After I was safe in 52 and got the new pet and str buff I upped it a bit.  In 53 I am running 40% AA.  It still moves faster than level exp.  I am half way through 53 and have 1.5 AA points.  Personally my goal is to have the 6 points required for the level 55 skills when I get there.  From what I hear from others concerning slowness of level 54 now (after the &quot;exp smoothing&quot;) I think I will be darn close by the time I get to 55.  But that is just me.  I didn't want to be 55 and trying to get AA points.  This way I am working on both but I am moving a bit slower level wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO level &gt;&gt;&gt; AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run3 is nice but as for other aa's I think lvl's are more important. Aiming for 60 before I start on aa's again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id say get run3 as soon as you can.<br />
<br />
for me, id also get 3 more AA points for, oh, HP regen I suppose. that way id at least have the title.</div></div><hr />

I HIGHLY regret missing this opportunity. The XP was just too damn good in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyortsed</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me personal recommendation would be get run3 ASAP (maybe regen 3 too) then just work on gettin to 60.  There is alot of benifits to being 60.  ie-  easier to single pull in alot of places which makes it easier to solo (and get AA xp) and get a group (in places such as CT which AA flys!).  Personally,  I did run 3 then worked on gettin through that bastige of a lvl,  59.</div></div><hr />
