<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well me and two real life friends are going to start some characters to level together, for the classes we decided on, there were only two teams on TZ that we could play on and all be on the same team, because I refuse to play any short race, I chose to make an Erudite SK.<br />
<br />
My question is basically, where am I KoS? what cities can I at least use for binding in, if not selling? I am assuming I'm KoS in erudin, but am I KoS in qeynos? Are there any towns on faydwer I can bank/bind in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valorax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are definately KoS in Erudin, BUT if you start lvling in Warrens at 4-20ish (best exp for those lvl's IMO) then you will quickly become amiable or higher in Erudin. <br />
<br />
In Qeynos your KoS.... but not in the sewers around the Qeynos SK guild and stuff =). There is a passage to the sewers under the docks in Qeynos, so you can reach them even without invis. <br />
<br />
Neriak, I am not sure.... wish I could be more help there. I seen an Erudite SK though strolling through there, so I imagine if your KoS at first... killing a couple halflings in Nektulous should fix that. <br />
<br />
Grobb and Oggok... good question!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only other place I am sure of is the Outpost in Overthere, your perfectlly fine there and makes a good centerpoint to bind in for exp in 20's to pretty much 50's ;p. <br />
<br />
You have to figure out ways to get around the bind problem, I bind in out of the way areas of towns so I can still be closer to whichever I'm after. Some places you can't do that, but in most you can. <br />
<br />
On Faydwer.... I'm pretty sure there isn't a single place where you can bank in... but binding isn't a problem in Kelethin, I think you can bind under the town or at least remotely close to it safely. As for selling... well, there are gnome SK's... they gotta have vendors, if you can find them in Akanon... let me know if it works, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Old world:<br />
<br />
I'll start with Odus and move east.<br />
<br />
First of all, you are *not* KoS in most of Erudin and Erudin Castle. There are exceptions, such as the pally guilds (threatening) and possibly the caster guilds in the castle.<br />
<br />
You are KoS in Kerra Ridge.<br />
<br />
You will be KoS in much of Qeynos to start (threatening). However that's easy enough to raise, or simply use the catacombs for the bank/merchants/trainer.<br />
<br />
You are KoS in Halas.<br />
<br />
You are KoS in Rivervale.<br />
<br />
I don't know offhand about Highpass.<br />
<br />
You aren't KoS in Neriak with the lone exception of the ghouls outside of the necro/sk guild.<br />
<br />
You aren't KoS in Freeport for the most part, but there may be some dangerous spots. The tunnels under Freeport are safe.<br />
<br />
I'd expect that you're KoS in much of Grobb and Oggok, but the Bashers at least are dubious.<br />
<br />
You aren't welcome anywhere in Faydwar as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Kunark:<br />
<br />
KoS in FV<br />
<br />
Welcome in OT outpost<br />
<br />
KoS in Cabilis, but since you'll be following Cazic Thule you won't be quite as deep as most other factions. A lot of other threads discuss Cabilis Faction<br />
<br />
Velious:<br />
Non-KoS to the dorfs in Thurgadin and CC<br />
<br />
KoS to giants and dragons<br />
<br />
A lot of other threads exist on Velious factions<br />
<br />
Luclin:<br />
<br />
Non-KoS to Shadowhaven, Echo, Shar Vahl, the Seru guards in Marus Seru, and the outlying guards of these towns.<br />
<br />
KoS in Sanctus Seru and Katta Castellum<br />
<br />
That should cover pretty much most areas. You'll find some other mobs aren't KoS to Eru Sks to start with for some reason, such as desert madmen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dubious to gaurds, can buy and bank from vendors<br />
<br />
Thank you Neriaki, the twink baby Erudite SK.<br />
<br />
Dai</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An Addition: You'll be KOS to Highpass guards, but a couple nights Orc hunting for exp fixed that for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As noted above you are (barely) non-KOS in most of Neriak - however it will only take literally one or two PvP faction hits against the inkies (namely when you are attacked, and you will be, while in Neriak) before you will be KOS.<br />
<br />
So shopping/banking/etc in Neriak is a little...tricky.<br />
<br />
My current bind point (as a fellow Erudite SK) is Shadow Haven, and I either buy a port to where I'm going or use the Nexus ghetto ports. As an extra bonus, this makes the trip home to Paineel for supplies &amp; training trivial, even solo or broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The important Neriak factions will be easy to raise from low dubious though, by giving red wine to Lokar To'Briath (sp?) in the library in 3rd gate. For a few plat at most you'll be ally with Dark Bargainers (merchants) and at least indiff or amiable with Dread Guard Outer and Dread Guard Inner (guard factions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Itzena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just make sure you do the red wine quest before killing inkies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ubvman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">KoS in FV<br />
<br />
Can SK Erudites get un-KOS in FV to bank without screwing up every other evil faction in Kunark? Also, is it possible to get indifferent in FV without going KOS at the Overthere outpost (VS faction)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">maybe killing goblins, as I recall some goblins raise faction with sarnaks and with FV, and I think the only negative hit was with goblins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can kill Goblins in LOIO and Warsliks woods for Postive faction hits with Firiona Vie. This should get you mostly non-KOS, tho there seems to be a couple pockets inside Firiona Vie on Halas and Faydwer High Elf faction, so you won't be completely safe.<br />
<br />
Of course, why one would want to associate with those despicable nature-worshippers is beyond me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Remyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I have hunted in blac burrow and wareens and killed orcs.<br />
<br />
 did not think that i did that much but i can go into fp and queos front door. in qh the wizzy buy the tower hates me. cant go past him.<br />
 i can go all the way across and no guards attack me. i am now bound insied nerik by soulbinder.  I have not been to halas not crazy enought yet. and dont know about other places not sure about hk either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baelic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agree with pretty much every spot Katha said except Faydwer.<br />
<br />
You are only duboius in Kelethin and the high elf town, can bank in both, but I think you can only shop in a few spots in the high elf town, safe to bind in both.<br />
KOS to the dawarves of Kaladim. Not sure about the gnomes, never really had the urge to visit them.<br />
<br />
KOS in Highpass but easy to get faction up in a day.<br />
