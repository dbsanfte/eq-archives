<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what is dumber. Someone proposing that they ban Warriors from discussion, or someone generalizing everyone on a board by what one person there proposed. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eh, maybe, maybe not.  <br />
<br />
No need to spring to the defense of the other board when I make fun of a dumbass and his/her pathetic thread though.  <br />
<br />
If someone links a stupid post from TSW or the ranger's glade or something, we all laugh at the stupid post.  If I link a stupid post from the other SK board, I'm generalizing or attacking that board or whatever?   For fucks sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not generalizing everyone on the board by that one post <br />
<br />
<br />
And the title of the thread is &quot;Boy S-KO sure has figured out how to make things better&quot;. If that is not generalizing an entire board, I'm not sure what is. I feel like I'm posting on the Warrior board, trying to explain to them that not all SK's want Necro Rez...<br />
<br />
Lump any group together in an all inclusive statement, and it's a generalization... There is no &quot;Some of S-KO&quot; or &quot;A post on S-KO&quot;, you simply said &quot;Boy S-KO sure has...&quot;. Thats generalizing.<br />
<br />
No other way to interpret it.</div></div><hr />

That said, look at threads when the rangers, the monks, or the warriors' boards have had stupid threads about class balance or something and someone's posted them here to laugh at.  Nine times out of 10, it isn't &quot;Look at what some idiot on the warrior boards is saying&quot; it's &quot;look at what the warriors are saying&quot; - the only difference here is that it's two boards inhabited by the same class.  Whoopty-fuckin-do; it's the same damn thing for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Kiddie porn addicts who fled the country&quot; <br />

Does this refer to anyone in particular?<br />
<br />
Drax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's people referring to IGE (Brock Pierce) Draxious, however if you check the records there is no conviction, while I admit that it doesn't look good that he fled the country to avoid a trial that means that the proof could never be used against him in court so people don't really know what if any proof there is/was, and in the US you are innocent (or considered innocent by the law when you're found not guilty) until proven guilty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Draxious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks Brael.  I suppose that is a different Brock Pierce than the semi-unknown movie actor.  And ya, we are still innocent until proven guilty in this country.  (Unless you are dealing with the IRS, and then you have to prove your innocence to them...grrrr)<br />

And seeing as you still post here, glad to see you support kiddie porn addicts hat flee the country....dumbass</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no interpretation necessary. You made an all inclusive  Declarative statement. &quot;Boy S-KO sure has figured out how to make things better!&quot; You referred to a board, not a post. There was no interpretation done. You said it. Now if you did not mean it... Then you just spoke wrong. <br />
<br />
All I can do is read what you say, and take it at face value. And that is a generalization of everyone that posts on S-KO.<br />
<br />
Words mean things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Peasley Grunglefunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">fleeing the country to avoid a trial doesn't exactly look good in your defense and most people would assume that the accusations were true... looks like you have something to hide heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya, it does but you still don't know for sure without a trial.  Plus, a trial like that would get a high amount of publicity and even if you're found not guilty people would in most cases assume it was true anyways which basically screws you over for life.  So, there can be a valid reason for avoiding it.  But ya... it does make it look real bad for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Rhumba you are taking this far too literal. When someone has something to say about a specific thread on TSW, they'd likely say something like &quot;TSW sucks they think knight mitigation is fair!&quot; when it's usually just a few specific people. Boards get generalized all the time, it doesn't really reflect on the board itself usually, more often it's just a few active specific posters. Every board has its share of active morons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brael I've noticed basically anytime people are accused of anything these days it's automatically assumed to be true even if they're proven innocent, just the way society is working now. Or to paraphrase some dimly remembered political mud slinging trick &quot;it doesn't matter if he has sex with pigs, as long as he has to keep on denying he has sex with pigs&quot;</div></div><hr />

Wait, you mean you aren't addicted to kiddy porn and touch little boys?</div></div><hr />

In one of my first couple of posts on this, I said that I felt like I was over on the TSW board explaining that not all SK's want the Necro Rez... Anytime someone uses a generalization to drum up disdain for a group. I'm going to rip on it. No matter where it occurs, whether here or on TSW.  There is no reason that you need to misrepresent a group. Just Summarize it factually and I have no beef. The post on that board was pretty silly, but to cattegorize that post as the mantra of that board, is just as silly.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that anytime those type of generalizations occur, it does nothing to help arrive at any kind of consensus as to what the true problem is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">oh god damn, your pretty attached to that board for it only existing not even a week.</div></div><hr />

We sold sk.org to Yantis and all this crazy shit is going on wtf?!?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's 2 am and I'm tired and trying to process all of this and having no luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone break down what's going on please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Originally posted by Apokx <br />
Someone break down what's going on please?  <br />
1- Yantis bought SK.org from SoulVoid.<br />
<br />
2- Some people decided to make a new SK board because they do not want to visit a board that is owned by Yantis.  The new Board is shadow-knight.org.<br />
<br />
3- Um . . . there is no 3.  That is pretty much what happened.</div></div><hr />
