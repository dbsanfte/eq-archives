Exactly why did people feel the need to flame the original poster?<br />
<br />
Aside from the &quot;Wanna know more? Go there and find out&quot; which could VAGUELY be construed as a bragging-about-being-PoF-capable comment, the topic seemed legit (thought possibly one which should be moved to the Armory).<br />

The sword might even look better if it had a better proc like a fast DoT or DD.<br />
the plankton greatsword lacks a proc and is kinda slow.  once again another toy.<br />
these will probably be upgraded or changed in some way, like the luclin era stuff was.<br />

Even though this one wasnt designed for that, they still see &quot;havent heard of&quot; &quot;go there and find out&quot; followed by screenshots of equipped items. Anyone skimming will assume it was the same posts as always.</div></div><hr />

because that's all people seem to want to do here anymore.<br />

besides, flaming is easier than actually knowing what you're talking about :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
But it's not just flames, it's overall occasional 100% dumbass posts that seem to be bleeding over from sites like Everlore, et al.<br />
(Mind you, Everlore is a great site, IMO, less some of the people that frequent it).<br />
<br />
WOOT!1 1st POST - I fail to understand the meaning; WHO CARES?  Do these people go into convulsions if someone else is the first poster?  (I was the first person in my house to wake up this morning but I didn't spray paint that fact on the walls and run around yelling `frank-n-beans`.<br />
<br />
FLAMING - I personally think it is only constructive if it is validly applied to the argument, not just mindless crap that comes to you because you cant come up with something intelligent to say;<br />
I.E. &quot;You and that idea are just, umm...umm...gay!!1<br />
<br />
People coming up with stupid insults because they are insecure - (Relating to the last statement) &quot;What you wrote is stupid because, ummm....umm..., you're teh SUK and a loser!1.<br />
   I don't know about anyone else but it's hard to be insulted by something that's not true.<br />
<br />
Cluless people - Insisting on defending their own ridiculous comments when they have no idea what they are talking about in the first place only because they are trying to look cool and belittle others.  (Again, Insecure?).<br />
<br />
These are just my opinions that this thread prompted me to write.  Just something I wouldn't want the SK class board to become.  I am not a heavy poster here but am a true Shadow Knight; (my only char in 2+ years).  I have been reading here for quite some time and would rather not have to wade through stupid shit just to get to something meaningful or useful to me.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This was not directed to anyone in particular nor was intended to offend anyone, just my opinion.<br />
<br />
And those weapons are nice as far as I'm concerned.  Major upgrades for many people. Granted there are better but there certainly is worse to be had.  As far as the ratios are concerned, nothing a little haste wouldn't help correct.<br />

I have to say, a lot of them look very nice, but I won't be giving up my Palladius' Axe of Slaughter anytime too soon, which looks like a newbie weapon hehe. I think that they need to put a little more thought into these weapons, unless of course there is something better waiting for us in PoTime.<br />

Just because you are behind a keyboard and monitor you don't need to act like you have a big dick in RL. Because the mature people here (the few that are here) understand what an insecure little sniffling bitch sounds like. And many fit that category all too often.<br />

With all that shit said, the dude didn't even sound like he was bragging and as it turns out he wasn't.<br />

It's not my call, and it's not a job I envy, but the mods might want to hammer a few of the worst offenders, so the boards clear up for those who care to have intelligent discussions, or to see the nice new shiny loot.  Because we all know style &gt; all for SKs ; ).<br />

actually when people become obnoxious with their material wealth, yes people do get angry.  most people dont hang out with or like a person who waves the fact they make $100,000 more than another person at every opportunity.  there is such a thing as humility.  <br />
that being said i dont believe this guy's post was meant as bragging one way or another.  lots of people in the past have come here asking for pics of weapons, and to be honest alot of these weapons are works of art graphically.  <br />
usually you can tell when someone has a valid post/question and when someone is showing off that they are l337 or that they have the most uber twinked level 12 sk.</div></div><hr />

That is one of the new class weapons that drop in the elemental planes. Those swords proc a pet to the side of the character and as you can see, the SK version of it is weilding our epic ;)</div></div><hr />

So far, with the exception of one or two of the swords, the windrider's lance is still my favorite graphic.  It's less DPS than my Rocksmasher, but I like showing up somewhere and having people say 'WTF is that missile in your hand?!?!!?&quot;</div></div><hr />

 I like the stats on that one and have been thinking of picking one up from the bazaar, but still don't know what it looks like!<br />
<br />
  Also wouldn't mind seeing greatsword of discipline, thulian crusader's sword, or any of the other bazaar-buyable weapons with around 1:1 ratio.<br />

  I'm not in a high level or raiding guild, so all the stuff posted here so far is exotic and interesting to me.  Thanks for posting the pics.</div></div><hr />

Tell me something, did you like the sword better before or after the change?<br />
<br />
When I first got the sword, I was thrilled to death to find that the pets would random HT creatures.  It was a blast, in some cases there would be 3 pets HT'ing the mobs.<br />
<br />
I spoke with a dev two days later and guess what... The pet magically became a warrior and began shielding me, no HT, no rooting, no spells what so ever.<br />
<br />
It's a fucking shame the developer ignored the blatant exploitation of enchanters using CoD.  Oh well, anyone looking for the Opalescent Two-hand Sword, it's VERY easy to acquire along with a lev 65 rune.<br />
<br />
The mob which drops it is called Razorfin, he spawns on server up (along with the monstrous sea turtle)  both creatures are right by the zone in to Plane of Water.  <br />
<br />
Just have your favorite enchanter charm a Sea Turtle and pull the named mobs, there's absolutely 0 challenge involved.<br />
<br />
The Opalescent 2 hand sword is pretty, but sucks compared to weapons like Bloodied Berserker's Blade when it comes to raw damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understand you correctly, I'm a weakling because I prefer to argue in a civil manner and not to hurl insults and flames at my opponents.<br />
<br />
Actually, Groobash, as far as I know, in most sub-cultures or areas where men relate to one another - even gang culture, hockey games, boxing etc - this isn't how things work.  A person who insults someone in those arenas is considered a &quot;pansy&quot; and quickly punished for shooting his mouth off.  Men take the measure of each other, understand the consequences of cowardly insults, and a code of conduct develops.  (If you doubt this, strap on a pair of skates or basketball shoes, head out to a pick up hockey/basketball game, and follow someone around calling them &quot;pansy&quot;, &quot;dumbass&quot;, etc.)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, on-line posting doesn't allow for people to &quot;take the measure of each other&quot;, so a self-enforcing a code of conduct doesn't develop.  You or I could be the type of person who would never get away with insults irl, but flame people here anonymously because we can.<br />
<br />
The Forum Rules are supposed to substitute for the code of conduct that people would otherwise impose on themselves.  By enforcing the Forum Rules, the Mods keep the mouthy, dog-yappy types from bothering the other participants who just want to play nice and who know not to shoot their mouth off.<br />

If I ever bumped into anyone in all my years of being online who would try to talk their way out of a fight, its you...pansy.<br />
<br />
P.S. I played hockey for 8 years, as an defenseman, so don't lecture me about how things are done on the ice, or the way MEN deal with each other, cuz you ain't no man. Your own team mates would whip your ass before you even got out of the locker room. Sweet jeebus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shayde</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/snicker If you think hurling insults on-line is &quot;fighting&quot;, I doubt you've played hockey, tough guy.  You're sitting at a keyboard knowing you're untouchable.  How much courage does this take?  Insulting someone when you know you can't or won't really be punished is a form of cowardice.  What would be the point of my responding? I'd just be engaging in the same coward's game.<br />
<br />
On ice, you'd get smashed in the mouth for shit-talking (at least where I play).  The difference is, you can measure your opponent irl; on-line, well, we've only got someone's word that even though they like to smack talk on an EQ forum with impugnity, they actually play defence on a hockey team ; )<br />

actually when people become obnoxious with their material wealth, yes people do get angry.  most people dont hang out with or like a person who waves the fact they make $100,000 more than another person at every opportunity.  there is such a thing as humility.  <br />
that being said i dont believe this guy's post was meant as bragging one way or another.  lots of people in the past have come here asking for pics of weapons, and to be honest alot of these weapons are works of art graphically.  <br />
usually you can tell when someone has a valid post/question and when someone is showing off that they are l337 or that they have the most uber twinked level 12 sk.  <br />
<br />
I agree, but that is a rare occurence. I may have 1 or 2 neighbors that are total pricks. Even then, me having enough interaction with them to learn that would take time. If he asked the stated question after maybe 10 front yard conversations between us, unless he was a total grease-stain that said some really wrong things about what he wanted to do to my wife(or something like that), I'd have no grounds to tell him to, &quot;Fuck off&quot;.<br />
<br />
What you are pointing out I thought about, but it is such a rare occurence that the majority of people do not deserve to be cussed out for displaying some sort of wealth of fortune. That is called jealousy in most cases.<br />
<br />
Just look at Bick, did he even desrve that crap he went through? Obvously not since everyone now bends over backwards to help him.<br />
<br />
The problem with the Board is certain Mods, Not all, are more immature than a lot of the people that are annoying.<br />
