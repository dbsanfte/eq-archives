<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Usuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know this is a stupid as hell question and there are probably a ton of threads to answer this one...BUT I'll try it anyways.<br />
In the course of this long, involved, agonizing quest, is there anyway that an Ogre SK who worships Rallos Zek can complete this quest?  It appears on all accounts initially that this is primarily for those who worship Innoruk.  I'm willing to do the faction work, but I am not so sure that the scaleys will go for my energetic ass kissing.  <br />
I'd appreciate feedback on this one.  Several guildees and I have been debating the quest for sometime and I'd like your esteemed opinions on the matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm fairly certain that Rallos Ogres can manage to squeak through with enough faction, though I believe that they have to use illusion potions or something to get the last little bit of faction needed.  Do a search though, or just browse through the Greenmist forum and you'll probably find the answer several times with a detailed walk through and FAQ. :)</div></div><hr />
