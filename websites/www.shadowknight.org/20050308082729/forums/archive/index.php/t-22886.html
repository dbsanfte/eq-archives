(hopefully tonight i will have the maps for the 4 sk manhunt updated)<br />
<br />
Thanks !<br />

**Update**<br />
Updated the maps for the 4 sk hunt, (iceclad, oot, td, and swamp).  I still need to locate the WW loc of the paladin, and the Kith loc of the skele, then all maps should be marked.<br />
NOTE: some of these roam/wander, so I tried to make the area highlighted cover where they are in general.  Also, I have read some interesting strats on several of the fights, so I may go in and add those as well.  (will give credit to strat givers if I do, thanks again guys for all the valueable input!)</div></div><hr />

I'm bumping this up simply because it is a very nice guide. and would answer 90% of the questions asked...too bad people don't get off their lazy ass and actually read.</div></div><hr />

thanks  !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TinyDiabla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some named have to be spawned (like the Murkglider Breeder), and others seem to be on timers, though very fast (only  a few hours it seems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mordeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This may be a silly question, but just to clarify, when refering to the Fraga fight in PoV, when you say quad 2850 max, are you referring to the maximum damage as 2850/hit? or total damage of all 4 hits in the quad assuming they all hit for max.. (so each individual hit is 712)<br />
<br />
for some reason i'm never clear wich it is until i get hit, as i have seen it used both ways..<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />

2850 per hit, i.e capable of one rounding most knights .. but .. that doesnt neccissaraly mean he will come anywhere close to that kind of damage .. depends on his ATK.</div></div><hr />

I did a bit of testing with him, and his max hit is indeed, as the poster before said 2850. However, his minimum hit was in the upper hundereds, think 175. And it can vary greatly. And once he's slowed/crippled, it's much less, much less often. Best thing to do is to tell your healer to just demem CHeal, it isn't worth it. Spam fast heals, he'll go down fast.</div></div><hr />
