<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After bailing out of Frontier Mountains (hunting goblins) I passed the place holder for the VP skeleton in Dreadlands. He con'd even to me so I thought I'd give it a try. No pet and only grim aura in my buff box I figured it'll be a FD fight. As luck would have it, straight up duke it out. ED and a heat blood, tap tap tap......<br />
<br />
Finished the first one off with zero mana and abou 25% health.<br />
<br />
Made a pet, recast grim aura and waited until I was full health and mana. Loaded undead fear then pulled the next skeleton with ED. Sent Jobeker in, landed fear on it and proceeded to bash it, smash it over and over. Fear and darkness broke a couple of times, easy enough to reapply as necessary. Using this tactic I finished the fight at about 50% health and 30% mana.<br />
<br />
This is a 6 minute static spawn, never wanders. I killed 6 of them for a total of 22% xp at level 34. Reasonable gear, nothing stupendous (see magelo in sig). All were even, yellow and red con's.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps somebody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe I'm a bit behind the times...  Is this spawn point over in the hidden area by the Wizzy port?  And could you give a location, as this sounds interesting, and I'd like to check it out.  Could'nt find anything about a VP skeleton on Alla's...  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you zone into DL from Fm, hang a Left and stay high on the wall, you will see a Skele standing in the middle of a clering overlooking  the &quot;spider&quot; area..  <br />
<br />
Ph's are Plaguebone Skellies, the named drops a pice for the VP key quest.<br />
<br />
There are a few spawns that are undead for VP key quest.  Nice thing is the one in FV is the only Undead in the zone so easy for us Sk's to find.<br />
<br />
Ill see if i can find a loc for everyone.....<br />
<br />
<br />

Edit: &quot;(1) Middle Portion: Drops off a rotting skeleton at approximately loc 2250, -5140 in the Dreadlands (7 minute static spawn);&quot; pulled that from Alla's quest database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for adding what I forgot Rorthek.<br />
<br />
fyi, greater plaguebone hit me for up to 74 damage with AC825. Most of the time was for high 30's through mid 40's though.<br />
<br />
After looking at theRotting Skeleton (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11797), I don't think I'll try and take him on for at least another 10 levels. However for anybody hunting here, there's usually a powerleveller or two in DL that might be happy to take him out for a quick and easy VP key part.<br />
<br />
The main thing to worry about is if you do fear the PH and he does run down to the spider hive - have FD ready.</div></div><hr />
