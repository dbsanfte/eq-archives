<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderbumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Unlike 99% of the level 65 Shadowknights out there, I use a 1 hander and shield combo.<br />
<br />
As a result, these new bash enhancing AAs look somewhat interesting to me, if they provide a sufficient benefit.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any parses yet?  A rough idea how much of a % increase each ability gives to either bash damage or stun frequency?<br />
<br />
If Viscious Smash helps bridge the DPS gap between 1 handers and 2 handers alittle bit more, I will definately consider picking it up.<br />
<br />
I also wonder how much additional aggro is generated on a successful bash stun, if any.  If the stun generates aggro above the normal amount produces simply by landing a bash, is this aggro amplified by the &quot;Furious Bash&quot; effect?<br />
<br />
I know much of this will be nearly impossible to test, but any data that can be provided regarding DPS or stun frequency increases would be most welcome, thanks  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the bash AA's will work with the 2hand bash ability. but while in beta i was told that they worked even better with 1h and shield. so take that for what its worth. about all the info i have on this subject ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard that it adds 25 damage to bash, so 2H bash will be close to 45 damage.  Not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderbumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aress : 2 handed Bash (AA ability) does more damage than a normal Bash with a shield?  Huh?!?<br />
<br />
What Belize said makes sense, it SHOULD provide a better bonus when a normal shield is used (instead of slam).  Sure, the % bonus might be the same, but I was sure that the damage done by bashing with a shield was always greater than a slam done without (whether because of LARGE race status or AA ability).<br />
<br />
At any rate, I am looking for legitimate facts and hard data, not &quot;I heard your moma likes it dirty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone know how much of a benefit these abilities are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, Thunder, I do not have this useless (for me) ability.  A friend got it and I based my comment on that.  It seems you have not understood.  2H bash with enhancing equipent will result in approx. 45 damage.  A shield ALWAYS does much more damage considering the same equipment.  I heard that some people have seen shield bash in the low 100's.<br />
<br />
No, I do not have personal experience.  If you do not like my post, take the easy answer.<br />
<br />
Go invest your damn points into this, parse it, and post it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ZilshasisEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Max damage hit with Two handed Bash AA is 34, so adding 25 damage would max it bash for 59dmg if the current info is correct.</div></div><hr />
