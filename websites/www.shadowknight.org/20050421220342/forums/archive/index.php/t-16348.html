<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Soooooo, they changed CoM, Howling Stones, Dalnir (last patch)...are they trying to make it harder for us SK's to get our fun weapons?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm hoping to get a group and head to CoM today to get my last 2 scrolls, has anyone been there since they &quot;fixed&quot; it?  Anyone know if its harder or just better loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I say take a group downthere and clear out the stables and make sure to hit his 2 spawn points first.  The loot in CoM is so much better.  There is a 10 wis face that drops off the mighty golem  a nice ring that drops off the goos, wus quivering staff, MoSS, and some other nice stuff of named undead that spawn near stables.  So all in all it would be worth your while to go with a group and just clean up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>XebarisTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went there with a group a couple of days ago, and mobs went down really fast, so we were kind of cashing in the exp at a good rate. Most skels seem to be replaced by non-undead zombieish mobs, so you just need regular invis to get to the castle, now. That is, invis vs undead doesn't seem necessary. I get the impression the zone is easier (cheesier?) now.<br />
<br />
Also, the Captain of the Guard (very common spawn) now drops A Stone Key, which opens the first locked door to the castle, so there's no need for a rogue to kill the first Black Reaver. However, we encountered a door that needed to be picked, to get to our second Reaver.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went in there last night.<br />
<br />
Was there for all of maybe 2 - 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the Stables, going into the section on the left... the Spectral Courier spawned in the room on the left, behind the door.<br />
<br />
Spawned there twice.<br />
<br />
Uppn entering the stables, going into the section on the right, the Courier spawned once in the second room, through the door in the back-left corner.<br />
<br />
I got Scroll 4 and Scroll 2 last night, I already had Scroll 3 from camping there for 5 hours a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I also already got the Scrolls from Mistmoore, within 30 minutes of entering the zone.<br />
<br />
Now I just need to get that damned Failed Crypt Raider to spawn, he seems the hardest to get on my server.  Camped him for 4 hours once with some friends and we kept the Library and the entire area around it clean, and no Crypt Raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>armengarkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bah i been in CoM for 3 days 2-6 hours each and only gotten the one inthe west wing to spawn......did so 4 times in a row, and dropped same scroll each time, 1 time shammy book too, sad no shammy needed it and it rotted =(<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 60 you should be able to solo Kaesora.. I did at 52 but that was before the caster mob changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>armengarkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for your info yugg =)<br />
<br />
if youre clearing out entire stables be aware that the blue cons (at 60) are pretty nasty BUT have some nice drops =)</div></div><hr />
