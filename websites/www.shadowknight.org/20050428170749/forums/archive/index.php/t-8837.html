<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thank you for pointing out the Nuff Said and Plz crap. God I hate that shit. What the hell does nuff said really mean? you were done talking? Ok, then shut the fuck up! <br />
<br />
personally it just shows a decidely huge lack of personality and is the spawn of a mind lacking anything terribly interesting to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;plz&quot; is just laziness. unless you have mobs beating on you and have to ask the cleric for a fast rez 'plz' ... but if you have to ask, then its a shitty cleric anyway.<br />
<br />
dammit im getting off topic.<br />
<br />
yeah paineelians are cool. but im an Iksar who is allied with paineel. does that count? my forehead doesnt have quite the same reflective qualities of erudies, sadly. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Joke all you want about our foreheads, you know what they say about guys with Large foreheads...</div></div><hr />

Sorry just popped into my head ala the old joke about guys with big feet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DaginSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No Adikt,<br />
<br />
It means we frequently come up with catchy phrases..such as:<br />
<br />
Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DaginSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or Nnod,<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was meant merely as a troll....<br />
<br />
Nah..<br />
That would be too obvious...<br />
Or would it?..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaotik Von'Damon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I in no way look like Fraser. I also do think that Heretic Shadow Knights are a fine race/class combo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've never quite understood that helm design. If I'm pulling the last thing I want is a handle on the back of my head:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kensha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My son had an unpronounceable, randomly generated name for his Erudite SK, so we just call him &quot;Handle head&quot; for the sake of convenience. <br />
<br />
(Ok, that's not really the reason we gave him a nickname. It's just too much fun to poke at the kid sometimes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flatstompa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My Erudite buddy can reflect lasers if he polishes his forehead enough! no, really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Katha Ath'Nan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's definitely different, especially with ambient sounds cranked up:)<br />
<br />
Took a bunch of screenshots of different looks. Interesting that the coterie and fungal fiend images show sword and shield. Of the pictures I think the one that disturbed me the most had to be of Katha as a female halfassling with a mohawk. /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaotik Von'Damon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thats my &quot;oh shit&quot; handle. Usually someone in my group needs to grab on when I start fighting.</div></div><hr />

Way back when, I was waiting with a fellow heretic SK at the bottom of the EK -&gt; High Hold ramp, waiting for our guild to assemble so we could go and kill all the nonhumans in HHK.<br />
Some random character came up to me (full bronze + mino axe at that point) and uttered the immortal phrase:<br />
<br />
&quot;SOW plz&quot;<br />
<br />
After carefully explaining to him that, firstly - no erudites can SOW and secondly - no class in full bronze using a mino axe can SOW and having it sink in after the third or fourth iteration he immediately turned to my friend (Flayed skin + big 2-h sword):<br />
<br />
&quot;SOW plz&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was times like that where I wish I could hit fellow blue names.... :D</div></div><hr />

The only consolation I can offer you is even Darwinism takes time<br />
