No shit, &quot;Shurlok&quot;.  It's called an opinion.  This is the flame forum, I posted my half assed opinion that I don't care if anyone else agrees with.</div></div><hr />

Its still an accomplishment to hit 60.  You really don't see ding threads started by people who get their third twinked char to 60.  They really should have just stickied a Ding thread, where you make an announcement, and no additional discussion is allowed.<br />
<br />
You rank right up there with Gnome SK's by starting this thread Dachande.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like they're luring you in with a thread title &quot;Disparity between CA and CS from my parsed data&quot; and inside it says HAHAHAAH F00led u I'm lvl 60 now yo...<br />
<br />
Another one of those stupid fucking &quot;I did it first so it doesn't mean anything because you did it after me&quot; attitudes.  Go fuck yourself repeatedly with a pickaxe.</div></div><hr />

/sigh<br />
<br />
Getting lvl 60 during Kunark or Velious was something. Getting it before exp penalties removed was pretty huge for an SK. <br />
<br />
Yes, you were &quot;lucky&quot; enough to ding 60 before SOE changed things.  That gives you a little extra bragging room.  So 30% of the experience needed to get to 60 is um about levels 58 and 59.  There you go, when I hit 60 I will make a post the says Ding! 60 (58 old school)...happy?<br />
<br />
If you feel like you accomplished something major getting lvl 60 4 expansions late, atleast wait till lvl 65 to post it.  <br />
<br />
I guess you feel that people dinging 60 is no big deal and they are only after attention.  It is my opinion that you are an attention whore and the only thing that you wanted out of this post is another pat on the back because of something blind kids with 2 fingers can do + 30%.</div></div><hr />

Wow. Woopty do. You got 60. You're no longer &quot;elite&quot; being 60 is just like being level 30 now. Sorry noobies.</div></div><hr />

Well I was contemplating shooting myself because he had more phat lewtz than me, but then I realized  it's just pixels on a fucking computer game<br />
<br />
The only one that looks like noob is you Dachande, and we all know its you, acting like a god damn 14 year old with some superiority complex because you got Uber_sword_101.<br />
<br />
Well gratz on all your uber shit, you're still a fucking cock holster.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you dont care, and no one else fucking cares, why the hell did you post it?<br />

No where did I say I got level 60 during Kunark or before the exp penalties were removed.  I got lvl 52 a few weeks after Kunark came out and stayed that level until Velious came out.  That was a simple shout out to some real SK's out there.  I doubt many of them even play anymore even.  If you come from a very old or an original server I'm sure you knew of some SKs like that.<br />
<br />
Nice try, Dachande, though a bit beneath you, don't you think? <br />
<br />
You're absolutely correct.  ie: I didn't make another account here, and I have no idea who &quot;Sage&quot; is. <br />
