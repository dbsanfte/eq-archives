<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muggly</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi there.  just got one, retired my valiant Diamon Multimedia 16mb agp2x tnt2 (it still ran up to date games fairly well with some tweaking =P, but felt it was time for change).  anyway, i booted up, downloaded the drivers posted on ATi's website 8 days ago.  played some half-life, got the ATi overflow error, got the patch for that, works like a charm.  loaded up EQ, and EQ is telling me to get a different driver version from a while ago.  i found it, but couldn't get the older drivers to install completely.  EQ would still recognize them as a different version.  i re-installed the new drivers, and booted up EQ, and it works fine with the new drivers, just checked the box for don't show this message again.  any other Radeon 8500 users want to pool knowledge?</div></div><hr />

EQ will always tell you to use a specified driver for some unknown reason. I have spoken to both ATI and EQ tech support and they told me to just ignore the message.<br />
<br />
  Hopefully EQ Dev will try to get the most out of the drivers for us.</div></div><hr />
