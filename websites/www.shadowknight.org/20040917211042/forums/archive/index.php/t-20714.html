I generally tank in LDoN and tier 1 PoP (Haven't been to teir 2 yet) but have been in groups where I am used as dps. Also I would not be tanking for guild in any way, shape or form since I'm only 55. Also when is the best time to start getting AA's? All advice is well appreciated.<br />

First of all, decide what your main role is/will be, and then pick your aas from there. With Zendapus my main role will be tanking in singlegroup encounters or in duo settings with my shaman, so I decided to go for CA3/CS3 -&gt; ND1 -&gt; PE -&gt; ID5/LR5 -&gt; ND2+3<br />
This is suited to _my_ needs, and based on how _I_ play, but be aware your milage may vary.<br />
After this line is complete (I am starting my &quot;work&quot; on ID/LR now) I will choose some fun stuff, maybe Improved HT, SCF or CF, not quite close enough to start planning exactly how this will go yet.<br />
<br />
In case Newtank pops in a say that you should stay 55 and get ALL your aas, ignore him, and get your behind asap to 65 btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whenever you decide to do your AA, go defensive before offensive if you mainly tank... if you mainly DPS, go offensive first.  I imagine you tank more then DPS, but thats an assumption.<br />
<br />
When you get your AA is more of a question of how you will play your character.  I definitely would not reccomend getting AA at 55, unless its run 3 which will help you in LDON or other indoor dungeons. <br />
<br />
I duo'd with a 2 boxer for quite a long time in my journey to 65 - I dual box a shaman, and he would dual box a ranger / cleric.   I chose to go directly to 65 and he chose to remain at 60 with the ranger and work on AM3.  We killed the same mobs and pretty much only played together for several weeks.  He would get 5% AA per kill off level 60 mobs at level 60.  He had about 30 AA by the time I hit 65.<br />
<br />
At 65 I find I am hard pressed to find a mob that gives more then 2% AA a kill.  I normally hunt in HOH if this makes a difference.  If I get the right group together (high dps) then I can equal or slightly exceed the rate of AA that my ranger friend got at 60.  However, it takes a lot more grinding then at 60 to obtain the same results.<br />
<br />
So take that for what its worth and make up your own mind.  As a side note, if you have any trouble finding groups on your server, you might want to go straight to 65.  On Zeb, it was difficult for me to find tanking jobs in T2 planes without being 60+.</div></div><hr />
