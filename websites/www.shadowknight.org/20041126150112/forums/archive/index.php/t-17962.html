<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive done about 55 ldon advents, im 41 and 14 atm.  I have a new prick bard friend i group with every night and we do anywhere from 2-4 advents.  We win about 95% of the time.  We have about 8 people we cycle through that group with us.  We have developed a waiting lists for our groups.  <br />
<br />
1: Its true being the lowest lvl yeilds the best xp but is not the best idea when tanking as the mobs will be tough for the lowest lvl.(not to big a deal)<br />
<br />
2: If you want coin you must have an ML. I get from 150-300pp per advent.<br />
<br />
3: You must have a set of rules going in.  Basic.  Have loot rules, chest/interactive bodies rules(unless your group knows what they are doing dont touch),  When to zone into the dungeon rules. Hotkey these as you are picking the advent.  We also have a 1 good aug per person, usually pure casters get first shot at int/wis, monks/rogues get agi(usually) and str/dex, tanks: stam is should of course be in eveyones interest but if people pass more power to ya. We do NBG.<br />
<br />
4: If you do an assasination.  BE CAREFULL!!  No matter what have your cleric start the CH early, ive had ass. mission mobs hit me for up to 350 on normal and 700 on hard w/ 350 procs(we lost that one lol got him down to 20%):i was the highest lvl in this group and was lvl 60.<br />
<br />
5: When picking a rescue be prepared with a tracker; slaughter, assasination, and collects are the win.(dont do low collects anything above 23 and below 29 works)<br />
<br />
6: LEARN YOUR MOBS!! Mobs in ldon stay the same so mainly learn your clerics, enchanters, and heavy casters.  Keep disease cloud memmed and when you see that chanter mob coming  dc yourself.  Its not uncommon for entire groups to get mezzed.  Get that 1h/shield out for bash if you cant 2hbash.  Im fixing to throw in a stun proc into my GM for these sit..<br />
<br />
7: Get a damn bard, they are cocky and gay.  But they are ldon masters(or can be) .  If I cant get ahold of a bard I go chanter. I dont think shamans are very suited for this environment. The dumbass bard does not like pet classes and thinks they are low dps and we fight about this often.  We take rogues/monks when we can get them.  Let the warrior tank the named and ass. mission mobs.  I suggest you snap aggro the rest of the dungeon, things will go much faster this way.<br />
<br />
8: Once you recieve points in a dungeon(or OPEN item slots) you can buy that item again but you MUST be able to BUY it not just see it.<br />
<br />
9: DON'T SCREW AROUND, you'll pay for it in the end no matter how god you think your doing shyt happens: collects :obvious/Assasination: w/ and w/o a map it can be misleading to find the boss mob./ Rescue: you never know with these/Slaughter: i lied you can screw around if you are mowing thigns down pretty good.<br />
<br />
That is what I have gathered from ldoning so far.  If you have any more questions pls ask.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;We dont generally take shamans and chanters&quot;<br />
<br />
Why?.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't let the warrior tank?  heh.  If he's better than me at tanking, he gets the job.<br />
<br />
Good Enchanters, just like good bards are quite useful in LDoN.  Haste is a must IMO.  Slow is only a must in assassination missions.<br />
<br />
Pacify classes help immensely with CC pulling.  Just remember that mobs 56+ can't be Pacified with Pacify, use Wake of Tranquility(60), or Pacification(65).  <br />
<br />
I heavily agree that you must warn the healer ahead of time that the assassination target hits hard and fast until slowed.  Even telling the healer to heal me early I've died just before the heal went off.  Make it a loud and clear point before pulling the target.<br />
<br />
I also agree that slaughter is the easiest.  Assassinations, and high collects (25+) are ok.  I've been screwed too many times to take low collects.  They like to dry up near the end.  Had 5 left to go and killed 15 more mobs but none dropped, so we lost.  Next 5 drop one, and we get booby prize.  :P  I hate rescues, only because I lost once running the captive back to the entrance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have been fighting a weak boss. I've done as assassinate where the boss hit for 852 a round and hit hard and fast, on normal mode.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let me answer some of your questions:<br />
<br />
First off when did the ass. mission I was lvl 60.  So a mob hittin for 700 is pretty tough at that lvl unless your very well equiped which i am not.<br />
<br />
Let me correct myself with the warrior comment.  Let the warrior tank the big boss mobs and you(the SK) take the rest.  Things go by much faster with our snap aggro.  I have any slowing class and nuker go to work immidietly and we have no problems what so ever.  After one mission where we had a war( he wa was 2 lvls higher than me) we attempted to let him tank and after about 10 mobs we switched to me. <br />
<br />
And you are correct if a bard is not available move to an enchanter. My bad.  Although I aggree that shamans arent to good for this environment.  A bard/chanter can handle haste/slow/pulling/buffing&gt;shaman haste/slow/buffing, weak dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AadinyeDuathiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A couple of other notes:<br />
<br />
1) Don't let the mobs climb the walls.  Sometimes they go into the &quot;ceiling&quot; and can't be hit.  Don't worry, they'll come find you when you least expect it.<br />
<br />
2)/agree on the &quot;learn the mobs&quot;.  Fighting a cleric mob 4 times cause it CH will make you lose.  If you are fighting a non-cleric mob and it gets healed, pull it across the room.  It is probably being healed through the wall.<br />
<br />
3)Someone said that the first person into zone, sets the mob level.  I don't know if its true or not, but just in case, we have the lowest level person zone in first.<br />
<br />
4)Have your ML be one with highest CHA.  Splits go much better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;3)Someone said that the first person into zone, sets the mob level. I don't know if its true or not, but just in case, we have the lowest level person zone in first.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think so? Seems kinda weird it would be that way. Figured they would just average out the levels of the group and set it from there. Who knows though Ill keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taeluuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure but as long as cha is 120 you get max faction sell price or so Im told and believe i read somewhere in here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alontier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You only need 105 Cha and indiff faction to get the best prices</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zzketza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While most of what was said in here makes sense compared to what I have seen, there is one thing I will disagree with:<br />
 5: If you want to win dont do rescues; slaughter, assasination, and collect are the win.(dont do low collects anything above23 and below 29 is good) <br />
Rescues are extremely easy if you have taken the time to pick up zone maps and bring some kind of tracker with you.  You can clear up to the rescuee spawn, usually one of three spots in each dungeon, and lead them right out - often before they even start yelling for help (my record is a rescue finished in 26 minutes in Rujark after only killing 20% of the zone).  Of all the rescues I have done, only lost three; two when LDoN first came out and nobody had a fucking clue what they were doing, and the last one after Karana server crashed this afternoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The myth about the first person entering the zone is untrue.<br />
<br />
It calculates the average lvl of the group and sets the dungeon accordingly.  Kind of like this :<br />
<br />
I everyone is 52-59 you will get mobs around lvl 52/53. <br />
<br />
But if you have a group of 56-62 the mobs will be around 56.(and you will notice some will summon.<br />
<br />
This is why it is very important to watch out when doing a hard mission. EX. If you do a hard assassination  and your lvls are kind of spread(tank is 57, all others are 59-61) your tank is screwed.  But if its the cleric or say mage thats lower you wont have as much to worry about.<br />
<br />
Also carefull when getting a puller, thier pulling spells may not work on the mobs you are pulling.  Level is important to watch when grouping.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to keep the lvls within 5 of eachother.  Not the allowed 7.  Unless your doing a group below say 45.<br />
<br />
As far as rescuses go you are probably right we had about 3 rescues go bad on us before the patch cuz the rescuee was bugged.  It is probably fixed by now and much easier like are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*shrug* 3/3 on rescues so far (trying to talk groups into them is often more pain than its worth), haven't failed a collect since the patch (although I have only taken higher volume collects to be honest.)  Slaughter and assasination get boring after a while, so does always staying at the same camp.  I happen to *really* like Deepest Guk for its visual appear and mood and despise Miraguls because its so fricking bland.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why to avoid rescues:<br />
<br />
The rescuee will attack/be attacked by anything it sees on its way out.  This means you cannot pacify/invis by mobs at all if time starts to run out, like you can in an assassination.<br />
<br />
They will not also follow you directly, and will stop and wander in rooms on the way out.<br />
<br />
All other missions depend on the groups actions for completion, rescues depend on an NPC.  Cleaning out the whole dungeon will win all other adventures, not a rescue.  You can still fail trying to get them to follow you out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree with this.  I don't have nearly the LDoN experience that you do, but I've been the lowbie tank in some groups and it's a horrible experience.  Made the mistake of letting a 57 Necro into a group of 50-53's.  It was ugly.  First room wipe out, just a struggle to kill mobs, cleric CH'ing constantly.  It was the hardest dungeon I've been in.  Didn't come close to clearing it... this is after I was in a group of 50-55 that finished one with 35 minutes to spare... quite a shock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You really dont need a tracker for rescue/assassination (actually, once a tracker wanted us to go back but the map took a U turn.. so he would have screwed us if we have listened to him). Just get a map or get a caster with eye of zomm equiv. spell (or get both) and you should be there ASAP.<br />
<br />
 You also dont need CC if you know what you doing. 2 tanks, or 1 BST and you(tank). Just range aggro if your group is not that good, usually pulls singles (most of time) and rarely pulls 3s(no big deal at normal level). Heck you dont even need a slower.<br />
<br />
 I agree with 23-29 collects are good, more than 29 less than 23 is bad.<br />
<br />
 Slaughter is by far a guaranteed win.<br />
<br />
 Rescue is actually easier(faster) than slaughter if you have maps + eye of zomm (or a good rogue, to check). I know I did 3 rescues in a row each's duration was around ~18 minutes. Unless you get unlucky with a huge map(stay away from ruj) you should always finish rescue slightly faster than Slaughter 55+.<br />
<br />
 Of course Assassination is the same as rescue but honestly I've never done much of these so I dunno if the bosses are placed farther than the rescue hostages.<br />
<br />
 Dont quit and keep trying. I was in a dungeon where our 6th just discovered she doesnt have LDoN, so we were down to 5. Then our cleric started to train us with 5 mobs (at that group we couldnt do this much, she though she's &quot;uber&quot; and could handle it) after 3 wipes and we barely didnt move much she decides to bail on us, she thought we couldnt make it (well, we cant do it with her training us everytime). It was like 35 minutes to go, 4 players with no buffs, SK, Monk Mage and Druid in a rescue mission... we made it! Sad thing is, cleric got a win too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am 5/5 so far on rescues, and I have never seen a hostage path strangely or any mobs attack.  I did once see a hostage stop within spitting distance of a mob that wandered into the exit-path we cleared and refuse to move until we killed it (an orc in Rujarkian.)  The orc never attacked the hostage at all, although was clearly inside aggro range based on the pathing the hostage took.<br />
<br />
Slaughter: Easy and boring, but if the group refuses to do anything else its at least AP.<br />
<br />
Assasinate: If your group falls behind, you can pacify to the boss and still win.<br />
<br />
Collect: Kill everything, down every dead end, every nook and cranny.  Loot everything.  Takes longer than slaughter and assasinate but I have won far, far, more of these than I've lost.  Failures came pre-drop rate fix, and even then were largely due to disfunctional groups than anything else.  (Yes I know, we're about to see a dozen posts by people *swearing* how their group rocked and they still lost, I'm just saying what I've seen.)<br />
<br />
Rescue: Exactly like an assasination, but you can't &quot;cheat&quot; your way there if your group falls behind.  <br />
<br />
I happen to like Collects and Rescues over Slaughters and Assasinates because they seem (although this could obviously be purely coincidental) to provide more named mobs than the first two, and since you have to kill more also turn into better xp and loot.:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A couple of words about group composition....<br />
<br />
First off, some of the most succesful adventures I've been on (I'm still only lvl 52, so groups are generally 50-55) have had neither bard nor enchanter in the group.  <br />
If you have a good cleric, and at least two decent tanks, you can load up the rest of the group with DPS, although I usually try to get a backup healer (I prefer a shammy for buffs/haste/slows).  So long as someone can pacify, you can chain pull singles and doubles nonstop.  I've been in groups using this configuration where we've had ugly pulls with 4 or 5 mobs, and we still managed to keep everyone alive.<br />

 <br />
<br />
I feel for you on this one....  I've grouped with warriors 5 levels higher than me who could not pull aggro off me to save their life.<br />
However, it is worth noting that not all warriors have this problem.  I have grouped with several warriors that were able to pull aggro off me after a pull with little or no difficulty, and maintain it throughout the fight (without me ever needing to use FD to dump aggro).  Of course, my gear is mediocre at best, which, I'm sure, played a factor.<br />

Shammies are always welcome additions to my groups, especially if we don't have a chanter/bard.</div></div><hr />

watch out for enc boss mobs. they start out hasted, and holy shit do they hit hard fast.</div></div><hr />

Not a problem.<br />
<br />
/pet guard here<br />
/pet hold<br />
<br />
Sneak up to LoS of enchanter boss mob, pull by casting slow...run like hell back to group.<br />
<br />
Any amount of slow neutralizes haste.<br />

But if you have a group of 56-62 the mobs will be around 56.(and you will notice some will summon.<br />
 <br />
I wonder how the number of people in the group factors into this?  I tried two adventures with two RL friends, after they reduced the minimum group amount to three.<br />
<br />
First adventure, 49 PAL, 49 BST, 49 DRU.  Takish mobs were hitting in the 110-120 range as their max hit.<br />
<br />
Second adventure, 49 PAL, 49 BST, 56 CLR.  Guk mobs were hitting in the 110-130 range as their max hit.  Most fights we were at no lower than 80% health, often 90% or better.  Despite replacing a lower level character with a higher-level one, mob levels didn't increase much at all.  Mob density seemed about normal, but I spent very little time healing, and usually just cast remedy or celestial, didn't need a single CH even when we took down a named.<br />
<br />
All mobs were DB to the level 49s, as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rotarr Rok'Vodarna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Enchanter boss mobs don't just start hasted, and don't just mez, they also charm.  I nearly slaughtered my group when my ass got charmed fighting the chanter boss.  Some got mezzed, and I went to town on the others one by one.<br />
<br />
Be careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Assassinations are just way more trouble than they're worth, I won't touch them unless my group has a Cleric and a Shaman.  Even then I ask not to do them whenever possible.  I've just gotten wasted too many times by a boss mob that no one was ready for, then you try to CR quick and make another half-assed attempt before time runs out and you still fail again.  So much more trouble then they're worth.  I'm 65 with 120 AAs and assassinations still make me cry.  If some of the group is sub-65 I might reluctantly agree to an assassination.  Others have probably had better luck than me on these but I've just had one too many bad experiences.<br />
<br />
Only done one rescue but it went alright.  It's like doing an assassination except, instead of getting wiped out when you reach your objective, you turn around and leave.  Yay!  Our hostage got tied up while we were running back and someone triggered a spiderling trap; the group was spread out running back and the Ranger died (oh no!).  So keep your group together while running out just in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Question about rescues:<br />
<br />
Is it possible to love tap the rescuee and run him back to the dungeon entrance then FD and get him out quicker/easier like other encounters of this type (escort type like the one in neth lair for that earring)?  I've not done a rescue yet, but I'm getting ready to go on a big points run very soon, and would like to be able to just take whatever the adventure recruiter first pops up and zip through it in order to hit the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As far as I can tell, the hostage cannot be hurt or affected by mobs or players in any way.  No Shrewing them, no shrinking them, no nothing.  On the other hand, I can say that when I do convince a group to take a rescue, they have been always successful.  <br />
<br />
Since I play for points, and not named drops, mission type means nothing to me.  I've done enough to know they are basically all equivilent in difficulty, only some require differant strategy in terms of the approach.<br />
<br />
Collects/Rescues are my favorite because they typically require more killing, meaning more of the 90 minute timer being used, which means better cash split and xp in addition to points.  Slaughters are basically what you need to do anyway, making them simple, and IMHO the most boring of the mission types.  Assasinations I tend to dislike as people want to try to pacify to the boss, which tends to fail more often than succeed unless its a better-than-average group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Izus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here's what I've observed in LDON. I'm currently working on ~100 missions and I've only lost on collections(2 before they fixed drop rates) and two really bad pick up groups. With that said:<br />
<br />
1) 1st person in determines level.... NOT TRUE. It's all based on group average level. I know for a fact that if you get group average level to &lt;63 it will be the second highest dungeon (hard missions not included). If you get 63 or over you are in the toughest normal dungeon. <br />
<br />
2) Collections / slaughter are the easiest to win. Have fun with them.  Assassinate is one of my favorites but finding the mob can occassionally prove challenging even with my favorite ranger (I hate guk's layout - rarely a problem though) Eqtoolbox has some decent maps. Little lacking on good miragul maps though. Rescues are my least favorite. Had a few issues with the rescued mobs pathing.<br />
<br />
3) Not going to go back and dig out this gem of a quote about shaman not being set up for LDON but that's not really true friend. Shaman are pretty darn useful.  Quite honestly any group makeup works unless you are doing 65 dungeons on the hard setting. Then it becomes pretty important on who you bring. Even then some of my shammy friends are preferred members /shrug.<br />
<br />
Be clear about everyone's role BEFORE getting into the dungeon.  The original post had some great advise. Still not sure if his/her bard friend quite gets it about pet classes and DPS but that's not important .:)</div></div><hr />
