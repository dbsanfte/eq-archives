<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I know people are going to laugh that I bought this but I wanted to see how often it would crit and for how much so I bought the first level of it and wasted 3 aa.<br />
<br />
I have not seen the pet crit once in hours of play.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this broke or has anyone else got this and can verify it works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got lvl 1 of Death's Fury on GoD day one and the pet does crit.  Not that often, and highest I've seen is in the 70's I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i use my pet weapon often and bought this in hopes that my pet proc would crit also....needless to say i have yet to see one of my pros pets crit but my normal pet does crit abotu once a fight at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zagbok dagreat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pet is worth less then the bone chip it costs to cast :p, don't ever put aa towards your pet, unless u have 500 aa :)<br />

Check your filter settings in game.  If you have melee crits set to show self only it may not show pet crits.  Just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Matador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">maxed pet  crit out and the pet does often, not quite as often as it should thou.i woudnt recomend you get this only if your running out of AA's to buy.max crit damage is 92.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Claiming that the pet is worthless is a sign of ignorance.  Claiming that death's fury is a waste of AA's is a sign of being observant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually 2 reasons..<br />
<br />
1. Filter obvious.. (But bet Inferno already know that)<br />
<br />
2. You are aggro-kiting mob.. If you are far from pet, you won't see its crit. Just WATCH its dmg. If a hit go over 55 then its a crit. I aggro-kite and never ever seen the message scoring a crit but often saw it going over 55 dmg per hit. I only see crit if I'm close to pet. <br />
<br />
Hope it answers your question why it didn't give message of crit..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know who bumped this thread but its old.  I have seen the pet crit now but its not frequent, I have stopped watching it but it seemed like I got one or two crits a fight at most and max crit maybe ever 3 or 4 fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't know who bumped this thread but its old.  <br />

That would be Matador.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pets summoned by the Opalescent Two Hander definetly crit based on this skill. <br />
<br />
Max hit for sword pets is 162.</div></div><hr />
