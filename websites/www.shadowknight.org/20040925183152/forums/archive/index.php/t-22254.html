<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize that our (and other classes') Top 10 Issues lists are unranked; that is, not in any particular order.  I'm not sure if this is because it was the format given to the Class Correspondents or whether it was a format SoE put them in and we must accept it as unranked.<br />
<br />
As we know, we have various posts discussing SCS vs. Rez vs. Tanking vs. Raid Role, etc.<br />
<br />
No one is arguing that of the 4 listed above, that tanking is the most important; but many are missing that point during the SCS vs. Rez discussion.<br />
<br />
My apologies in advance for creating a new post rather than adding onto one of the existing 3 threads, but would it possibly be an idea for us to somehow rank our top 9, and THEN argue out the merits of the 10th issue?  I would imagine that would be an undertaking in itself, starting more posts / threads with perhaps a few more jabs and arguments -- BUT perhaps Brael could then present the result back to SoE but emphasising that it is now a ranked list.<br />
<br />
Someone had (my apologies for not remembering offhand) mentioned that all issues in that list are treated equally, even though we ourselves don't consider them equal.  That doesn't seem right -- but if it's true then I fully agree that rez (just an example) shouldn't be in there on equal footing with our tanking issues.<br />
<br />
But if we ranked our list (that is, if we are even permitted to or if it's even feasible to do so) and presented it to SoE as a ranked list, then SoE will at least know that the SK community considers say, tanking to be # 1 and rez/SCS to be #10 --AND -- that SoE shouldn't even be CONSIDERING #10 until enough of the issues above it in rank have been eliminated... in which case we are in BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG doody anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A) SOE is going to evaluate issues largely on their view of how they fit into overall game balance and how easy they are to code.  Something like &quot;fix our tanking&quot; is going to take much longer to evaluate than something like &quot;add a toggle for SCS&quot;.  Therefore, they probably aren't going to solve issues in order.<br />
B) It is quite likely that SOE has more than one developer working on the various class problems.  Our spell issues probably go to one developer, our mitigation issues to another, etc.  Therefore, issues will be evaluated in parallel so ranking won't matter.<br />
C) If we require them to solve issue #1 before moving on to issues 2-10, that is likely to mean that they either decide not to fix issue #1 because they want to move on to other things or they never get to issues 2-10 because issue #1 takes a long time.<br />
<br />
I believe that if we include our tanking issues on the list, they will get as much attention as they would if we ranked them.  Having multiple tanking solutions that might go to different teams (a spell based solution, an innate mitigation solution, and an AA solution) might speed things up by allowing multiple developers to evaluate the problem in parallel.  I don't think ranking things will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah, yes -- that does make sense.  I'd assumed a 'balance-type team' looked at them all first, and then decided what goes to what dev team after the initial decisions were made.  Shows how much I know of the process.<br />
<br />
Athough I can't see it detrimental that we pass on how important we think each issue is in relativity (via ranking), I do see now how the effort may not be worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
And from a purely selfish point of view; although I still see x.rez benefitting *ME* more than an SCS fix, I at least now see the light as to why one shouldn't be on the list while the other should.  Tho' I still like Gash's pally-like sacrifice idea.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd assumed a 'balance-type team' looked at them all first, and then decided what goes to what dev team after the initial decisions were made.<br />
<br />
I think this is partially true but I would assume the &quot;balance-type team&quot; just makes a quick decision as to whether it's worth looking into and then passes it along to the correct developer.<br />
<br />
To be more specific, I believe there is a &quot;balance-type team&quot; that assigns the intial &quot;currently being evaluated&quot; or &quot;will not fix at this time&quot; status to each item.  After that, I expect that any issue that the &quot;balance-type team&quot; deems worth looking into is passed off to the devs to figure out how they might code a solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They almost released the OoW expansion over a month ago, and now with it coming out in a few weeks it is hard to imagine the class suggestions making much impact until the issues surrounding the expansion and the new level cap are smoothed out.<br />
<br />
Alot of these SK issues might look different at that point, but also they may not. Every class has made a bunch of requests and suggestions, and balancing all of these against each other won't be a quick process most likely.<br />
<br />
The Devs might not feel like SCS or Rez are things that they want to change-- there is no Burger King &quot;Have it Your Way&quot; guarantee here...Class reps, guild summits, and lists of suggestions are a big PR stunt as much as they are anything else. SOE wants players to have something that they can look forward to, so that they keep playing...we can probably expect this process to go on for a long while.</div></div><hr />
