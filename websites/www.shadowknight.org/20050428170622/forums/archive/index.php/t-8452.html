48 SK erudite.<br />

30 SK gnome<br />

43 SK iksar<br />
<br />
9 SK ogre<br />
<br />
no troll. no dark elf, no human.<br />
<br />
Gnome &gt; dark elf human erudite in the area of int, WITH A GOOD BALANCE, of dex/agi/sta (put points into sta).  Erudite nor humans nor dark elves have any other significant advantages over the gnome.<br />
<br />
Iksar/troll, advantage is higher regen, fairly reasonable but to me I'm not cool with paying for exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Ogre, this is my first ogre that I'm currently playing after quitting gnome.  I like him alright 190 str 190 sta 95 int isn't that bad for the armor I got.  <br />
<br />
As far as cultural goes, self haste vambraces own for gnome.  <br />
<br />
If I was new I would pick ogre.  If I was a twink I would pick gnome.  If I liked the other races for their looks, then pick them,  iks and de are the coolest looking ones imo.</div></div><hr />

I continually hear this and am boggled every time I hear it.  There isnt a single SK I know of that has maxed every stat out, even buffed.  Hence, &quot;gear&quot; does not make up for it, even at the end game.<br />
<br />
Does it make a significant difference?  I'll let you barracudas argue over that.  However, more points has to be superior to fewer points; yes, even in the end game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">why does everyone relegate any shortcomings to being fixed at &quot;end game&quot; ... what the hell is end game? there is no end game. and if you mean having the best armor around, then very very very few people will ever see this &quot;end game&quot; <br />
<br />
to dismiss racial stats like this is lazy. sure we might see end game but what about in the meantime? isnt getting their half the fun? <br />
<br />
i dont know where i am going with this, except to say that claiming end game will fix racial stats is rediculous. in the end, it isnt so much race that will decide your fate as your class will. to compare races among SKs is like comparing different shapes of oranges. in the end, they all taste the same, but sometimes you dont need an orange. you need a watermelon.<br />
<br />
what the hell did i just type?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well..<br />
<br />
With proper buffs, my Erudite SK can have 255 STR, 255 STA, and 200 INT. <br />
<br />
Ogres or trolls may have 255 and 255 in STR/STA, but there aren't many buffs that are going to create a mana pool the same size as mine. <br />
<br />
Thus, while an Erudite has &quot;inferior&quot; starting stats for a stand-up/tanking class, at the endgame, it's irrelevant, because the playing field is leveled. That is what I think some people consider as fixing our shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Raid buffed last night my INT was 191, and I didn't put any points into it at creation or concentrate on INT gear...so 200+ INT is possible with a troll too.<br />
<br />
Troll &gt; All<br />
<br />
That is all you need to remember :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I guess for me, &quot;End Game&quot; meant the period in the game at which time I could achieve Max (or damned near) stats in STR/STA/DEX/AGI/INT (with buffs, of course). For me, that came right around level 60. <br />
<br />
Then they go off and raise levels (and stats), so here I thought I was at the end-game, and I found out that I'm not.<br />
<br />
Kinda like driving across country to your folks house for the holidays, you enter town and think &quot;Jesus, I am finally here&quot;, then you find out they moved to Canada.<br />
<br />
Stats don't make the game. Yeah, they are important, but the definition of a &quot;game&quot; suggests that it should be something you have fun with. Troll/ogres seem to have fun smashing things with low INT for a good portion of their levels, and for the smaller races, it's the other way around. If someone wants to argue hard, statistical stats, sure, we could look at the races nekkid. But when it comes down to it, how often are you going to find someone who is equipped EXACTLY as you are? In my early days I saw trolls with higher INT than me, and I've seen Ogres with less STR than me. There are too many variables, really, to definitively state &quot;Race_X is the BEST SK race without a doubt&quot;. <br />
<br />
The real problem is, every race has the ability to reach a max stat which can be reached by every other race. If for example VI made it so that ONLY ogres/trolls could go above 200 STR, or only DE's/Eruds could go above 200 INT, then I could see where racial stats would be enormously more important. But since each race has plenty of gear (and buffs) to choose from to compensate, really, does it matter?<br />
<br />
Not to mention, when you look really close and consider stats reaching 255 (or 305 now or higher), 20 points difference in STR between you and the next guy really doesn't mean all that much...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At high lvls gear fixes the problems for you.  If you make it to lvl 60 you will be able to aquire the gear pieces you need to up the stats that were weak in the beginning. <br />
<br />
I got my int over 100 after doing 1-50 with it under 70, and there is obtainable gear that I can afford to get to raise it higher with out hurting my more important stats like AC and HPs.  Money isnt really that hard to get once you are in the 50s and with the /bazaar it isnt hard to find some piece of gear in your price range that is better than something you own.<br />
<br />
Just a final observation, strength seems to be the easiest stat to raise with gear, which really helps out the small SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I normally don't get into these types of discussions.  But here goes.<br />
<br />
One thing you must note, is the added stats.  While all mistakes and shortcomings for races can be fixed through gear, there is one notable difference I've been annoyed by for a long time.<br />
<br />
Count up all the naked stats.  You will notice that Eruds are far bellow all the rest of the races (think half-elf is actually less, but they do get infra).  And, they have the most base CHA of all the SK races.<br />
<br />
Just an annoyance of mine, the CHA is understandable, but having (if I recall) 10-25 less stat points then other races, is not right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My Troll has a base INT of 82, which ain't bad.  Racial abilities, like Regen, and Slam, are the only things that come into play.  Tinkering for Footballs is fooking awesome too, and they are the only ones that can wear and activate the Clockwork armor.  Tinkering is just awesome, but in my eyes for my SK I didn't want tinkering, I wanted Regen and Slam.<br />
<br />
Here are the things which make a difference in what you play...<br />
<br />
Slam  What, 9AA points?  Can't remember offhand what 2Hand Bash costs<br />
<br />
Tinkering  Make sow boots, haste arms, buffing items...  Gnomes have some unique options availabe to them<br />
<br />
Regen  Trolls pay the price in lower fire resistance, Iksar in low end twinking and equipment.  BOTH have a harsh exp penalty, but regen is goowd.<br />
<br />
Impervious to Stun from melee  Not quite that great, except at the low end of the game, but Ogres have higher DPS when tanking because of it.<br />
<br />
None of the other races have a special racial ability that the others never get.  Regen &gt; Tinkering &gt; Unstunnable &gt; Nothing, IMO, exp penalty or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Minta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The 'end game', I presume... is the point where you can get planar armor, or nowadays Velious armor to make up for things.<br />
<br />
I also disagree that gear will magically max out everyone's stats, but ... so what?  What do stats really do for you? Much of who you are as an SK is defined by your class.  Even if your stats are not maxed out, it is your damage table and your damage mitigation table as an SK that accounts for a lot of your effectiveness in a group.  Give a wizard 255 strength and see how much good he does meleeing.<br />
<br />
There are however things to worry about. If your melee stats are below 75, then you take negatives due to that attribute.  Stamina below 75 is especially bad and, as I understand it, stamina below 100 will cause you to take penalties when your 'stamina bar' runs out.  The stamina bar being that yellow one between health and mana in the top right of the screen. If you're swinging something like a Black Acrylia Halberd around, that goes down really quickly.  With stamina over 100, even when the yellow bar hits the bottom, you should be okay.<br />
<br />
As for Int? Unless you're doing tradeskills that shouldn't matter too much.   Mana regenerates quite quickly compared to health, and other than for grabbing aggro or fear kiting, it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  If you're desperate, get clarity or sit down for a minute or something.<br />
<br />
As for strength, other than being able to carry stuff (a weight reduction pack will help much more than a stat boost)... strength seems to add 1 ATK per strength point or something like that.  Grim Aura adds 10 ATK and increasing your skill with a weapon adds much more.... unless you're talking about 100 points of strength, it doesn't seem like a big issue.  Getting a faster weapon or a better damage ratio will do more than maxing out your strength.<br />
<br />
As always, though... this is just my opinion. I'm probably wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">pardon my for repeating myself, but in the high end game, no ones gives a rats ass what race you picked. on a raid or even in an exp group, its your class that dictates what you will be doing, not your race. <br />
<br />
sure uber gear is nice, but even the uberest Sk cant out-tank a similarly equiped warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drak'Ur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the most important thing to remember is that you shouldn't create a character just so it will be fun for you when you are at &quot;end game&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously.. how many hours of tiring leveling does it take to get to &quot;end game&quot;.  To play all those hours in miserry just to get to a point where you can max your stats in order to have fun is ludicrous.<br />
<br />
I'd say the point on the stats being below a certain level is a very important point, and perhaps the greatest to remember.  If for instance, you choose to be a DE.. don't pour all your 20 points into Str.. becuase your stamina will still be 75 and you will suffer penalties.  Your agi is naturally higher than most of the other SK races, and so is your intelligence.  It would be advised to distribute those points between Sta and Str, just make sure both are above 75 when you are done.  <br />
<br />
Though it is true it is severly hard to completely cripple a character out of the chance of functioning normally in norrath due to poor starting decisions.. you don't want your poor decisions to make those first few levels harder for you.  <br />
<br />
I want those endless hours of leveling to be FUN for me.. based on how my character functions for me. <br />
<br />
In the end, race decisions should be made based on your own preference and playing style.  If you want to be able to slash more.. or want to be a more magical SK... or want to balance them equally or what have you.<br />
<br />
I think we can all safely say that no matter what level you are... or what race... or what class for that matter... or how you align your stats...  your character is only as good as the person operating it.<br />
<br />
One last note, all the people who want to solve any slight inconveniences by simply &quot;getting a quick clarity&quot; or &quot;twinking&quot;.  I spit on you!  You are blatently taking away from the game the entire point of why it was created.  When you can have a character lower than level 20 with better gear than most level 40's... then you are not playing the game the way it was meant to be played.. ..  I recently played with a level 29 Wizard who COULD NOT FUNCTION without a K.E.I. cast on him.. and he was one of the worst partners ever.  Just an observance.<br />
<br />
So pick whatever race fits your personality.. and role play it, that's what the game is for.<br />

why does everyone relegate any shortcomings to being fixed at &quot;end game&quot; ... what the hell is end game? there is no end game.  <br />
<br />
IMO there is an end game.  My definition of end game is where xp is no longer the be all and end all of the game and you have the ability to cast any of your spells or use any skill.  People here typically Raid 90% of the time and do the fun stuff, and only do the xp grind if they're making up xp for raid deaths and/or working for an aa skill.  <br />
<br />
What race you are at this stage means diddly except size.  You spend most of your time fully raid buffed, so stats are all through the roof.  What makes the difference is can you see your target or fit down a corridor.  An ogre or troll will definitely have a better view of things than a gnome for instance, but will have trouble negotiating round tight twisty places without a shrink.<br />
<br />
It's been said before.. Aesthics are the only thing that matter in the end.  Play a race you like the look of... all else doesn't really matter.</div></div><hr />

So if you choose an Iksar, you have already max'ed your FLA and PIZ, and can allocate more points to other stats. :)</div></div><hr />

anyway as more proof that end game the racial advantages are significantly less,  I would also like to say that members of the most powerful guilds have sk's/warriors that aren't all ogres/trolls as you would expect melee oriented people to be, the min/max'ers.</div></div><hr />
