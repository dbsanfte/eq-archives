<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like stupid SoE has done a great fix again with the 2sec recast timer.<br />
<br />
This happend a few times last night to me, probably bad luck, but it still sucks. <br />
Fighting a mob with MC on. My spear is up and ready for use. My hand moves to cast the spear, my MC procs when i am trying to cast my spear and BLAM recast time not met. So i have to wait the 2 secs to have my icons pop back up before i can cast my spear. My spear is in spellslot 4, so it wasn't refreshed with that spellslot 1 bug. <br />
Started by paying attention to it, and happend to me a few times last night. Haven't tried it with other spells, might gonna try it today.<br />
<br />
If this thread excist, i missed it, so SUE ME :p<br />
<br />
*edit my spelling sucks today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should be fixed pretty soon, it was originally a very badly coded fix for the right click refresh bug... amusingly enough, the fix to the recovery time not met yet bug will also fix the right click forced refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I understood the last patch message correctly, this is a two-part fix.  The 2nd half of the fix was to go in this morning (1/28).  However, they didn't specifically mention it in the patch message so I don't know if it's in... I guess we wait and see.  BUT, it wasn't supposed to be fixed until today at earliest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Derekor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still wasn't fixed.<br />

I made my post before going home to log in post-patch; but yep it didn't take long to find out it wasn't fixed.<br />
<br />
I also see now from reviewing the Jan 15th patch message that it did not specifically say the 2nd part would be in the next patch... my bad, I misinterpreted/misunderstood it.</div></div><hr />
