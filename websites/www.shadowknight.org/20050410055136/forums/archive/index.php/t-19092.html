<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">today i was considering spending adventure point to acquire one of the new spells that dots you and increases your atk. i wasn't really sure how much difference atk made so i decided to do some parsing with different ATK lvls.<br />
<br />
the easiest way i found to do this was by fighting first with grim aura and second, without it.<br />
<br />
i ran to kael and used the quest giver mob at the entrance as my dummy. he's great since he regens so fast you can't kill him and he doesn't really hit hard.<br />
<br />
i parsed around 800 swing using grim aura and then 800 not using it. my initial guess as to how atk worked was that it affected accuracy. however my parse results showed me something different and frankly strange.<br />
<br />
Without Grim Aura - ATK 1005<br />
<br />
DPS: 56.11<br />
Max Hit: 169<br />
Min Hit: 47<br />
Avg. Hit: 112.23<br />
Accuracy: 60.51<br />
<br />
With Grim Aura - ATK 1018<br />
<br />
DPS: 56.00<br />
Max Hit: 173<br />
Min Hit: 48<br />
Average Hit: 113.62<br />
Accuracy: 61.39 %<br />
<br />
these numbers come from Yalp from the Damage Tab. Grim Aura seemed to enhance my max hit , min hit and accuracy. That makes sense.<br />
<br />
The DPS number just doesn't. How could lower accuracy and fewer hits not add up to a higher DPS? Anyone have any possible explanations? Should i try a different parser?<br />
<br />
Also am I right in assuming that your ATK value increases your chance to hit as well as your overall dmg or is one of these numbers statistical noise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not certain but I suspect hitting a very deep green mob, you're so much higher in level, and your ATK is so much higher than his AC already that ATK buffs will make no difference?<br />
<br />
The results you got look to be within reasonable random variation for a sample of a few hundred hits.<br />
<br />
That's the way I understood it anyway; put me right if I'm wrong someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonkonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grim Aura is only giving you a 1.3% boost at that level, might not be enough of a difference to show up (especially when you add what Dakkin said). Perhaps you could try a lower skill weapon (or HtH) so GA makes a bigger difference? If the mob is green you won't get skillups (I think?) to mess things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How long did you parse for? With small dps change such as grim aura  you won't really see until you have a long parse run. Shorter parse are subject to the RNG in reguards to what your hitting for.<br />
<br />
Blah just noticed 800 swings which comes out to roughly 37 minutes of parsing. I recommend going for a bit long next time.<br />
Later<br />
