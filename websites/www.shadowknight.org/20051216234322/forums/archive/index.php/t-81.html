<br />
I recently re-started my SK as a Gnome (was an Ogre), and I enjoy him. He's always got so much mana, and never gets stuck anywhere.<br />
<br />
I've heard tell that in the long run, I really should stick with my Ogre because in end game, the ability to not be stunned is one that can't be inherited by any other race. Is that true?<br />
<br />
Also, what about mana concerns? He's got many of the main sentient pieces, so the INT can get to low 120s (w/ the MoSS). Do any of you high-level fatties ever have problems going OOM?<br />
<br />
And lastly... one of the reasons that I restarted was because I'm getting into the levels of Dungeon crawling and being a massive Ogre is rough in small places. Are there any cheap shrink items available at around my level (mid 30s)? I don't want to have to buy shrink potions either...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice (in advance)...<br />
Myxl</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say keep the Ogre if you group alot.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
He will have an easier time getting HP from stamina, and he won't get stun so will tank better, and pull sometimes better.<br />
<br />
If you are in a group alot, also you will have a mana regen up frequently, so the mana pool is less of a deal.<br />
<br />
If you solo a lot, the gnome w/ his bigger mana pool makes sense, but even then a regen-ing char would make soloing smoother.<br />
<br />
The int will help, but a troll or iksar would have regen to eliminate downtime.<br />
<br />
I think you should pick a gnome only if you like gnomes, or if you like their great faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the end game, sure being stunned might be nice in some situations, but its not the end of the world :)<br />
<br />
Play what you like.  Its more fun that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myxl Plix</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like my Ogre a lot... but what I dislike is the size. I like being able to RP him as an Intellectual Ogre (wikked smaat), but I get stuck in some places and it's SUPER annoying to go into a dungeon (like say Dalnir) without some sort of shrink.<br />
<br />
That's why I restarted... not really for numbers, but an annoyance that I don't want to wait 58 levels for Illusion: Skeleton for. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being an ogre is awesome.  Now that I haven't been stunned from the front in awhile, when I play some of my other characters and I get stunned, I'm like &quot;WTF?&quot;  thinking I must be turned sideways or something.<br />
<br />
It gets annoying fast.  Maybe if you're used to it, it's no big deal, but long before I played an Ogre, I hated being stunned. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Dalnir is one of the dungeons that's not ogre friendly.  There aren't a bunch of em, you just happened to pick one of the worst.<br />
<br />
I've had a 10 dose shrink for 3 months.  I still have 3 doses left.</div></div><hr />

made a troll shaman twink the other day for fun, and by level 17 I am already<br />
annoyed at how MUCH he gets stunned. Yuck! I cant imagine being any sort of<br />
tank and being stunned that much!<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp. His size can suck, and often I have so pay for a lot of shrink potions<br />
which is also no fun. But in no way would I trade him for any other race.<br />

 <br />
The numbers game is a pile of feces. Play what you enjoy because you enjoy it as an SK.<br />
 <br />
I have a human one. I liked having two starting cities instead of one (Neriak and Freeport) and the RP involved in being what I am. I have yet to see a gnomish shadowknight-but I expect to be amused when I see one until proven otherwise. So far,the most famous gnomish necromancer I know is famous for making tinkered underpants. :)</div></div><hr />
