<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently DoT crits increase the aggro generated from the extra damage done, if what I have heard is correct.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's a good question and the answer interests me too.  I'm at the point in AA's where what's left is Wisdom, First Aid, etc. --YET-- I have not gotten Critical Affliction 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
I don't use DoT's much in general, except of course Clinging Darkness and Festering Darkness; and neither do I use them for DoT damage specifically.  I know that Blood of... er, um -- I forgot, since I don't use it much, is pretty fast and decent as DoT's go.  I think I saw the necros state that Crit.Aff 3 is only 9% more DPS?  For 30 AA points.</div></div><hr />

In my experience, nothing is more efficient than chaining CD for aggro. Using a Spear or DoT on incoming might add a bit more DPS and will give some solid initial aggro. Personally I don't mem DoT's any more as mobs just die too fast, especially on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, basically, if you solo/duo ALOT, go for CA2 or CA3 and get BA4 aug to help you out better.. If you don't solo or duo at all, forget about CA2 or maybe CA1, etc and buy more useful AA..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CA just sucks. Its for people who want to max out their god aa heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, but it's chump change for maniacs like you who do 15aa in a sitting sometimes, Kharan...lol.<br />
<br />
It's a better buy than SCS 1-3 at least.<br />
<br />
But we're also getting alot more DoT spells in OoW, so maybe this aa will seem slightly less pointless then. DoT crits for SKs seem only good for minor amusement while soloing, all the same...kind of like watching for Stun Resist messages to pass the time in T1...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">These replies are more or less what I was expecting.  It would have been too much to hope for to find a decent use for this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well it does have some use once we get more Dots will be ok for doing some soloing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">True.  And also once we get an additional spell gem, I might be able to find room for a dot.  Or a spear.  Perhaps a terror.  Maybe.   ;) <br />
<br />
On a more serious note, I did get Critical Affliction 2 and am 1/3 of the way to Critical Affliction 3 now.  Once I get it, I will turn the dot damage filter off (will still go to my nul window) but will be able to log it.  Let's see what CD crits at!   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It crits at 10 !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mine goes up to 11.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use Miserable Bauble (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=4118) and it has BA4, I use the item cause its the best earring I have (with or without BA4) I havn't noticed any signifigant agro increase since I've gotten it, I know I'll keep it for pet kiting in the futute even after upgrade, BA4, nice to have but not manditory for anything really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Getting back to the original post--<br />
<br />
BA4 and DoT crits aren't especially significant in terms of increasing aggro for us, as they don't amount to any huge dps increase. Even then, dps is only a relatively minor component for SKs in terms of generating points on a mob's Hate List.<br />
<br />
Think about it. Hate is generated more from the snare component of the Darkness line, whether it lands or not. Debuffs, Stuns, Slows, and Fears are the same story. Weapon augments are another example...the additional stun component of the Ykesha augments is much better aggro than a straight dd proc augment.</div></div><hr />
