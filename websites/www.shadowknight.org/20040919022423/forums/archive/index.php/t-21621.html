<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have seen some basic calculations, but some stuff does not make sense to me.  Perhaps these calculations are out of date and need a refresh.<br />
<br />
Okay,  How much damage should an IHT do with UT3 and SCF3.  I read in a prior post of a calculation that led to 7200.  I did a 9k HT this weekend without my ID4 ring on.  I double checked the log and no focus affects went off.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how this adds up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They fucked with it a few months ago and now the damage can be larger and is random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">best focus it was like max of 10k wasn't it? i think with ID4 its 7400 or so to about 9700. Dont really recall seeing any 8k's though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Highest I've seen without rizlona is 10080 with fury of solusek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When disc timers got changed IHT got messed up a bit, instead of being +50% it gives +50% plus a random +1-50% focus as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maxxed it does 7200 + 36 * random(0,(50+focus))<br />
<br />
where random(1,(50+focus)) is a random number between 0 and 50 + max focus effect.<br />
<br />
the new unholy aura disc is an improvement of between 1 and 50% in slot 1 short buff box, so it doesn't stack with bard songs (rizlona's etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks, its sounds like I got (or close to got) a max HT without any focus affects.<br />
<br />
Been bothering me for a bit, because it annoying to take my War Crested Ring out to HT unless we really need it so I just HT without the focus effect.  Interestingly, the last few times I have used the ID4 effect I have had a lower IHT than when I have not used it.  So, I must have gotten near the minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah. 9k is max without focus, 9720 is max with ID4 focus.<br />
<br />
i'd guess war crested ring adds an average of 360ish damage.</div></div><hr />
