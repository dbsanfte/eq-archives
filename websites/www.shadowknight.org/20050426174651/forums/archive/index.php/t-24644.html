<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After spending 12+hrs and reading posts on Alla's I was able to controll the spawn points for the Kly Imprecator,I needed the Lab drop last, but it gave me time to confirm the church spawn cycle.<br />
<br />
2nd lvl spawn is as Allakhazams post say a 12min spawn cycle and easy to get but he does play a part in church spawn.<br />
<br />
Church spawn is tied to the undead armor PH/ 2nd lvl spawn point. Made him spawn many times.<br />
*note the undead armorer PH is NOT on a 12min cycle and would skip or up to 20mins to spawn- so sometimes PH will be on time to kill and sometimes not (which I think is why church PH is such a bitch)<br />
<br />
Lab spawn is tied the same way to PH/PH's on 3rd lvl past crawl space- used slaughter to kill all mobs past crawl space.I could never fig' out Lab spawn PH key - but suspect its the undead crusader/2 mobs off to the right in a room  before heading down hallway to Lab (these were the only mobs left out of previous attempts)- <br />
<br />
Now for tatics- Start a kill cycle from Ph1 thru undead armor PH, to church PH for first 2 drops. make sure Lab is PH as this is key. All Kly spawns are on 12min timer. Now depending which piece you want leave the other PH up. Church spawned on key almost enough I thought about running mules down there to loot.<br />
<br />
Now the Lab spawn never spawned in 10ish hours using the PH killing method above, killing just the PH or any other  crap i could up with,but pop'd 3 times using the slaughter method...*when I added those mobs in water area before entering hallway.<br />
<br />
Now of coarse nobody will ever know the precise method but this worked for me consently,use it as you will.</div></div><hr />
