<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">:confused: <br />
<br />
Playing EQ has been giving me headache lately…<br />
When I log my Character into the world, everything seems to run fine, until I zone.<br />
Soon as I zone, I start lagging out; well, lag isn’t the right word, as I know it’s not lag.<br />
I guess the best way to put it is that the graphics gets very slow and choppy.<br />
I’m not going to list all the component parts of my computer, as I have done a search on this board and have done most, if not all of the suggestions people have offered.<br />
My question is…<br />
From my search on this board, I have found all the “common sense” things people should do, like getting rid of any spyware programs, updating drivers, keeping the processor cool, turning all unnecessary graphics off etc…<br />
What I’d like to know is, is there any not-common things I should look at and adjust on my computer to give me the optimal performance?<br />
e.g what size should I set my virtual memory to? Is running at 16bit better than 32bit? What about graphic settings in-game? Should I bother using a custom UI, or is that part of the problem?<br />
<br />
I guess I should list some of my components, as it may be required.<br />
Unfortunately, I don’t have a great computer (cant afford a new one), but it has been working fine up until a few months ago.<br />
<br />
P3 (don’t know the mhz)<br />
512 P333 Ram<br />
Radeon 7900 32meg video card<br />
<br />
I know its crap, but it was running fine…<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe defrag your harddrive, make sure the cooling vents aren't clogged, make sure your pagefile is appropriately sized (and not fragmented), sacrifice a chicken.  Things like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting close to the sacrificing a chicken idea…<br />
Sorry but I’m clueless when it comes to computers. What is the “pagefile” and how does it affect your cpu’s performance?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The pagefile is the virtual memory, basically it's hard drive space reserved for storing data that your RAM doesn't have room for.  If you right-click on the My Computer icon and go to properties, it will open a &quot;System Properties&quot; window.  There should be an &quot;Advanced&quot; tab (that's what it is under WinXP), which has a Performance -&gt; Settings button on it.  There's a section there on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab of that window (under WinXP again) that refers to Virtual Memory.  You can change that file to be larger or smaller, and you can set high and low ranges for the value.  I would put the maximum at twice the amount of RAM in your system if you have the space, but put the minimum and default to a smaller number.  I can't guarantee that making the pagefile larger will help, but it's a possibility that your computer was trying to dynamically resize the file and was having problems finding the space to do so, which would result in a lot of extra swapping to the hard drive.  On that note, make sure you have a good amount of free drive space, in addition to making sure that that space is not fragmented.<br />

If the chicken doesn't work, try a small mammal, such as a rabbit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the information Sesshou, I'll try that tonight when I get home. (the virtual memory adjustment, not the small mammal thing)  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Virtual Memory size is usually dynamic and doesn't need to be manually adjusted.   I think your limiting issue is your processor.   Look at a new Mboard + RAM set up.  Keep the rest of your gear.  Can go cheaper with an AMD processor,  or spend a few more $$ and get a P4.   I used to play on a P3 550 with 512 mb ram with a ATI 7500.   Just upgrading to a P4 2.6 with 1 gig of ram doubled my FPS in games and allowed me to run full clip with no lag in bazaar (1 new model only though).    Your processor / ram / Mother Board combo is what's slowing you down.<br />
<br />
I've heard some good things about the latest ATI drivers, but with EQ that's a crap shoot on if they actually work.   If all of a sudden you are having problems and nothings changed on your system, try to remember if it was from a recent patch.   They like to dick around with the DX DLL about every patch and could of done something that screwed you up.  Read the EQ tech forums and see if others users are having the same problems, or what they did to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My ram (256) sucks and I was looking to the earlier advice for some help too, and I can tell exactly when I am going to get the &quot;virtual memory too low - resizing file blah blah blah&quot; message (which I get at least once per log on if I don't severly limit zoning).<br />
<br />
Not to derail, but I need to get more RAM.  I remember the max for my comp being 2 qty.  1meg cards.  Should I go for the max?  also how do I tell the type?  (P133, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree. I think it’s about time to upgrade my computer, since I’ve had the same one since Luclin. I guess I need to find a cheap solution.<br />
I was thinking of getting a new video card, but when I looked inside my computer, I realized the motherboard does not have an AGP slot  :( <br />
<br />
Keevel, the only way I knew what ram I had, was by the stamp that was on it. Don’t know any other way of telling.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No AGP slot?  Do not bother with the chicken and the rabbit, go straight to a sheep.  It certainly does sound like that computer is on its last legs, though.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you that the lastest drivers do work, at least they do for me crap Radeon 8500 SE.<br />
