<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Titulara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently lvl 59 SHD.  I started my epic well over a year ago with the killing of Kurran Nie, note to Duriek, and delivery of cough syrup.  After being extorted by Sony for over 3k I went on raids with my guild and got the Drake Hide, Rharzar Hide, Blade of Abrogation, and Cell Key.  Still no Soul Leech after multiple Fear raids and we're not raiding Fear much anymore.  No Ratman Guard either.  So I've tried a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1. decrepit hide side quest - NPC was apprehensive, talked to me, but ate my items (replaced by GM thank god).<br />
<br />
2. free Caradon.  NPC was apprehensive, talked to me, but ate my cell key.<br />
<br />
So I tried to run seals.  Im Iksar so first I had to spend a day in the warrens becoming non-kos to paineel.  Marl gave me the seal to deliver, but the NPC in Paineel verbally abused me and ate the seal.<br />
<br />
So the only thing I could *possibly* do by the book is kill the ratman guard first and turn in his book, but we all know how rare he is.  In fact the only time I've ever seen him was shortly after we killed Caradon for another SK (I think guard is a triggered spawn).<br />
<br />
I've even tried talking to the spirit doggies from the first part of the SHM epic quest, and aside from some amusing insults, got nothing.<br />
<br />
I don't *think* I've killed anything to hurt my Truespirit faction, though I did kill some Neriak guardss, so at this point I'm baffled.  I'd hate to have to go the NPC that resets my faction and start over again (I only have 5k to my name, and would have to buy the 3 pieces of darkforge as well as the rapeage of the cough syrup and money to Kurran Nie).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how I can get my faction up?  Does the invis thing still work?  I thought that was nerfed a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you have to hide with the trade window up to hand in the seal...rinse and repeat.  oh yeah and destroy the note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They ate your stuff because, like you said, you skipped a part.  The goal of seal running is to get the faction that you would have received from doing the other parts, but without doing them.<br />
<br />
Bring a friend.  Get the note.  Put up the trade window.  Have friend invis you.  Press trade.  The only part I skipped was ratman as well, and iirc it took about 6 seals to make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Titulara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've started running seals after getting the info here.  8 seals so far and still not indif.  I see Pain ahead of me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You dont have to be indiff afaik, a high level of apprehensive is enough. See the Epic Forum for details. When one of the NPC says a specific phrase the faction is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When the Kastane brother in Paineel responds to your hail with &quot;YourName!  My hero!&quot;, you've done enough.</div></div><hr />
