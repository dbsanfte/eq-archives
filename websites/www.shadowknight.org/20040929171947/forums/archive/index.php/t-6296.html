<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been playing a Human and Dark Elf shadowknight to try to figure out which one I want to make as my main SK.  My only problem is that I like both.  Dark elf SKs are fun in that they are born evil, have a huge manapool, and are the children of Innoruuk.:D   I like the ultravision too and the graphics to their armor looks nice as well.  The Human SKs are fun too.  They have some pretty balanced stats, they look &quot;knightly&quot; in their armor which is nice looking also, and the seem to be more evil than dark elves in that they CHOOSE the path of darkness rather than the path of light.  I wish I could get some idea of which one to make my main. Any comments from dark elves or humans that follow the path of darkness on why this race is better than that race might help a little.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
