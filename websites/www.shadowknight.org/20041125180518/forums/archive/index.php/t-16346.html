<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My improved harmtouch timer is still broke atleast for me... it show reset timer is running currently at 45799H 31min 12s ...instead of the 1:12 give touch of the wicked 1...<br />
<br />
and normal harmtoch working but  1700dmg with disc sucks badly compared to 8k improved dmg hts...inparticular on a pvp server.. where a 4k could kill people before the 75% of max damn nerf..which makes it kinda fair now - it does require some work to those 9500hp opponent paladins down to 50% to win... ;-).<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i hope they fix it soon...for more fun again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The timer just shows up bugged till you use the skill again, just HT something it will go back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well i camped, i zoned, i used normal harmtouch, i petitioned, i send a email to them and i dunno what else to do .. imprvoed harmtouch is broken for me right now and still broken for 2 days now. btw i am making new hot improved dmg hot keys very time i log on and try to use it ...<br />
<br />
but you cant press a key if its still down - doesnt matter how often i klick on it...how can i use it if it doesnt reset?<br />
<br />
nice try but thats certainly not helping...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried something like '/doability 8' or whatever slot your Harmtouch key is in?<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to try this myself.  Just wondering if you had tried this approach instead of pressing the HT key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i actually did that too... my old hotkey was like<br />
/disc unholy <br />
/pause 2<br />
/do ability 86<br />
/gu Deathtouch on %T...<br />
<br />
<br />
normal ht is working but - if you spend 26 aa points on maxed improved harmtouch (6+3+6+9+2) ... and got use to it - its just annoying not being able to cast it.. still some 48000h=2000ish  reallife days till it reset normally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Log on, wait for about 1 hour rl time, then walk up to a moss snake, target it and type /alt activate 86.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well amazily its now working... dunno how and why maybe the have include some fix when vz was down today...<br />
<br />
well i hope it stay working...</div></div><hr />
