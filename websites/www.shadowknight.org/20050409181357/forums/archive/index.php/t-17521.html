<br />
When I'm pulling in LDoN and snag a caster, I find they cast long-range, but if I hide around a corner they run after me. Do mobs have LOS casting as well? If so, this can help a great deal, as it reduces the number of landed spells per pull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.  More important than spell damage, it gets them into camp faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boodadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">very true, they need to see you to hit you with a spell. i've found that if they can see you they are likely to sit back and cast BUT if you can get behind a corner the mob will come right out of the room and allow your group to do what it does best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had mobs cast on me through walls.<br />
<br />
I think what it is, if a mob starts casting, he can still hit you from anywhere, regardless if you ran halfway across the zone or ducked behind 3 walls while he was casting.  But, he has to past range and LoS checks to start casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I Learned somethin on the boards here, tho i comepletely forget which thread. Anyway, While Said mob is casting  Stand there and Take the hit. After its done casting SIT DOWN. 8 times out of 10 they'll charge you instead of casting again..:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/nod  -- With more time spent in dungeons due to LDoN, I have started being more observant with LOS and casters (not to say I wasn't paying attention before, just that I'm paying more attention now).<br />
<br />
- For both PC's and NPC's, if the caster begins casting and the target goes out of LoS, the spell will still land if the target remains within range.<br />
<br />
- If the caster begins casting but the target goes out of range, the spell does not land (I realize this contradicts one of the posts above, but just my observation).<br />
<br />
- The best way to pull a chain-casting caster to your group is to duck around a corner.  (I haven't tried the sit-down thing yet).<br />
<br />
- Most offensive spells that didn't used to have an LoS restriction now do, but some spells (not a usual staple pulling/aggro spell) still don't.  ;)<br />
<br />
- A casting mob and a non-casting mob on a pull isn't necessarily a bad thing, it can separate the two to make for easy FD splitting (as long as you time the FD, of course).<br />
<br />
Many of you have known these since the Befallen days but I spent a lot of time outdoors (hung out with druids and rangers a lot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im pretty sure LoS only applies to mobs in Indoor zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nah. LoS applies to all mobs everywhere.<br />
klotar is also right about going out of range, you will not be hit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LoS was removed from mobs a while ago, I remember them announcing it.<br />
<br />
Range still affects them, but there were too many exploits when mobs required LoS to cast on you (i.e. players waiting for a mob to cast then jumping round a corner to avoid the spell etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cmdrbean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In my ventures into LDoN, I've yet to see LOS stop a mob from casting on me. I always do my best to obscure LOS, just out of habit really... but it doesn't do much that I've seen.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect.<br />
<br />
They fiddled with it a few patches in a row so you might remember the first one.  They made changes to casters a while back.<br />
<br />
OLD WAY<br />
NPC: didn't require a line of sight to start casting or land the spell.  Can't remember for sure, but thier range seamed to be HUGE also.<br />
PC:   didn't require a line of sight to start casting a spell but DID require a line of sight to land a spell.<br />
<br />
CURRENT WAY<br />
NPC: Requires a line of sight to start casting a spell.  Does NOT require a line of sight to land a spell, must be in spell range.<br />
PC:  Requires a line of sight to start casting a spell.  Does NOT require a line of sight to land a spell, must be in spell range.<br />
<br />
Yes sitting down seams to have them charge about 2/3 of the time instead of chain casting.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've never been able to outrun a spell once a caster starts casting. If that has been changed, I'd be very surprised. The mob does need LoS and range to START a spell on you tho.</div></div><hr />
