Depends on the fight:<br />
<br />
Varns - in the air, due to the revamp<br />
Olidan - Nasty, but we did it with a raid force of about 20. Tank was decently geared, but not uber warrior. If you can take the named Ocean giants that drop medallions, Faruek the Bold and such, you can take him.<br />
Hate - Camp camp camp away!<br />
Fraga- Get him slowed and crippled ASAP, and spam quick heals. Best to have two clerics. Once does HoT, quick heal, HoT, etc. Other just spams quick heal. Bring a tank with about 7.5k buffed HP, mayb 1500 or better buffed AC.<br />
<br />
That's about all I have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fraga and Olidan:  One good group.  Take two clerics if not well geared or using warrior to tank.  We did them with clr, sk, enc, nec, dru, shm.  Shaman on rampage for Olidan, and just healed self.  Ele level geared.  Fraga has low atk, so once slowed pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if I am reading this post right I should be able to tank both of these mobs (Olidan and Fraga) with my present gear and a good group then?<br />
<br />
I buff to 9.4k (Brells+Virtue+Focus) and about 2k AC (with Aura).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ttuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tanked both olidan and fraga w/2 clerics np. Buffed at 9k hp and 1700 ac.<br />
<br />
Olidan was harder than fraga, we used a mag to CoH a tasher/crippler/slower on fraga so it was pretty easy. Once he was slowed just had 2 clerics alternating Sup Light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tanked both at 10.5k HPs, 2300 (2400+ with AoP) AC buffed, with one cleric.  So you can see where a few 100 AC reduces healing needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With one cleric, and shaman patching, tanked Varns for 8 minutes.  Ran out of mana, and didnt have DPS with one group, and only got him to 75 ish percent.  2 rangers, would have given dps needed to kill in this amount of time I think.</div></div><hr />
