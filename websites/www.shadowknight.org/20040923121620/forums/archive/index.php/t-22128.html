<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morganti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The primary tank classes in EQ have each had their advantages and disadvantages in the past.  I believe the current problems associated with Shadowknight tanking is due to improper scaling of our advantages in comparison to Paladin/Warrior.<br />
<br />
It is unclear to me when this problem really kicks in, perhaps elementals + unless the SK in question is equipped in gear surpassing the content they are tanking...but lets have a brief review of how things USED to be.<br />
<br />
Warrior: Mediocre DPS, best mitigation, best hit points, no snap aggro.<br />
<br />
Paladin:  Less DPS than warrior, snap aggro and mitigation via stun, moderate healing ability for self and group.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight:  Slightly better DPS than the above, capacity for pulling with no CC present, self sustaining lifetaps which could be quite effective at reducing burden on healers against slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
This is of course a highly simplified list.<br />
<br />
Currently, we have warriors who have aggro on command, and I believe this is a good thing.  We have paladins who can stun up to what, level 68?  I believe this is also a good thing.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights, however, have no further progression besides the tools they had to begin with...our strength was our better dps combined with lifetaps...<br />
To simplify again:  The mob dies a bit faster, we can sustain ourselves fairly decent, thus we have a balanced trade off.<br />
<br />
I believe with a substantial lifetap upgrade this could help our survivability in higher end content.  Now, I am not thinking say, huge DPS upgrade here, just a slight boost...however I think the recourse of lifetaps should be larger, think theft of life AA on a greater scale...<br />
<br />
For example a 750 point lifetap, which has a base recourse of 1250 health gained, which theft of life could also affect...and of course the super rare crit-lifetap-TOL.<br />
<br />
Now I have not given any thought to the actual numbers we should look for in this spell/ability line, I just used the above numbers as example.<br />
<br />
Perhaps another Theft of Life AA line (Advanced Theft of Life) which could triple the healing recourse instead of double?  <br />
<br />
Creative implementation of this concept would be steps towards restoring the high points of having a SK tank.<br />
<br />
On a side note, while I understand many SKs do not like the feeding mana concept, I do wish Zevfeers and Mental Corruption line would stand a chance to gain double mana back also...heck make it another AA, Theft of Mind.<br />
<br />
The damage for Zevfeers and Aura of Hate/Pain should probably be bumped up a few notches as well...its a huge trade out to keep buff slots open in some cases.<br />
<br />
In my mind this is all in a Beta stage of thought, lets hear your thoughts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only problem I can see with lifetaps, even as you mention them (with something like a 1250 base recourse along with added healing AAs or whatever) is that you can only cast lifetaps once you have aggro firmly established. Granted, this doesn't take too long, but it is also the most crucial time for tanking. This is the time debuffs are going on, so the mob is hitting you for his best.<br />
<br />
Paladins are much in the same boat as us with regards to that, though, on mobs that aren't stunnable. Their advantage remains pretty big on stunnable mobs, though.<br />
<br />
It also won't really help against huge damage spikes, though I'm not sure this was something you were trying to address.<br />
<br />
That said, it would certainly be better than things are now, for sure. Still, I'd like to focus on existing problems now, such as getting Aura of Pain a higher resist modifier so it's actually reliable. It doesn't have to be -500 like ToI, but I've had tipt trash already resist it.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm not in a cutting edge GoD guild or anything, so I haven't tried tanking KT+ mobs, just elem and ferubi/tipt/vxed stuff. Offtanking for an uqua raid is something I don't experience to feed into my thoughts on this, for example. :p I'm just barely getting into the trashheap of knights in GoD, I end up advertising various offensive measures of SKs to hope get people to bring me along as a backup tank that doesn't do abysmal dps, which I think is true, though it's still ultimately relying on friends grouping you just to group you, rather than because they think you fit in really well. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mitigation &gt; healing ALWAYS<br />
<br />
Its been said a million times before , lifetaps can not and will not ever be the solution to our tanking issues. <br />
<br />
Mob in quads for say 1000..thats err 4000hp per round.<br />
<br />
Paladin stuns mob that is ish 6000hp hes just saved (quellious lasts 10 seconds). Can you see SOE giving us a 2 second cast , 24 second recast 6000hp lifetap for just 200 mana ? Err nope<br />
<br />
Then say you move to harder content. Mob is now hitting for 1500 a pop... 6000hp a round.<br />
<br />
Paladin using the same stun just saved 9000hp and even if they gave us such an uber lifetap as the above one we have still been healed for 6000hp<br />
<br />
Lifetaps do not scale and can never ever ever surpass mitigation when it comes to tanking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The solution is always to prevent damage, not heal it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">healing != mitigation<br />
<br />
try and heal someone/lifetap after being 1 rounded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about a Displine that works along the incite line style allowing us a self Displine rune that heals for the incoming damage.  Example Sk cast snare get hit to 80% health click displine next hit for 800 instead of taking the incoming damage it would in fact heal us for 800 making our life jump up to 90%.  This displine based off endurance it can be chain but not for long wihtout some serious downtime.  It follows along the sk idea taking the enemy power and turning it against him like alot of our spells lines.  wouldnt be too overpowering it would help alot in my mind.  I got 4 displine i dont use fearless anymore.  I can now see my endurance I have, and i would like to use it on something i like to go ooe.  It been 3 years since we got a displine right. Also maybe giving us Spell line like bounce might help.  SK need a nitch i would like to be called upon to do heavy aeo weak melee mobs.  Having Fearless is nice aa but it doesnt give us a tanking advanantage often at all.  These are just ideas please tear into them and laugh.  Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is probably a stupid suggestion that's already been put forward and has been explained away as unviable for one reason or another, but, if they don't want to give us stun spells, and lifetaps/healing obviously isn't the key, why not invent a new class of debuffs?  Say an extreme attack debuff, one that lowers the ATK, STR and, if possible, max hit of a mob by a percentage?  Certain mobs would be immune of course (to start with all stunnable mobs would likely be immune).<br />
<br />
This could be given to us as a new spell line entirely, or could be added as a component of our currently mostly useless Terror line.  It makes some role-play sense to me as well... you scare mobs so they get all nervous and jittery, they get weak in the knees and are intimidated, even as they are enraged, so they attack much less effectively.<br />
<br />
Is this not doable for some technical reason, or is a balance concern over the fact that if another line of percentage mitigation debuffs is added (slow + stuns + SK attack debuff) it could trivialize some encounters if all are used in conjunction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's a good idea... if you wanna become a debuffing bitch. A debuff ability won't solve our tanking woes cause there's nothing to stop a war from tanking the mob that you've debuffed.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, an atk/str/whatever debuff isn't really that good of a solution cause while it would reduce the average dps of the mob, you can still get 1 rounded. I'd much rather see a clearer stratafication between war's, knights, and non-tanks(DI -2 for warriors, -1 for knights, something like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Then how about a avoidance recourse rather than an accuracy debuff on target?  Same effect, will not be buff bitch.<br />
<br />
edit: I realize the biggest problem with this that it will consume precious buff slots.  Can't win them all, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Change avoidance to something like shielding/-DI buff and it'd be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...or that too.  You know what i mean... something useful, like something they would never implement =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the idea of a huge melee debuff, accuracy or something... maybe even make it a tap (reduce mob accuracy 30% for 20 seconds, 10% accuracy recourse?).  Play with the numbers so it's more or less balanced vs pally stuns and give it the same type of level caps (we wouldn't be debuffers vs raid mobs...).  Make it pretty heavy aggro and frequent recast so we're not likely to be using it vs mobs we're not tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, my idea was to make the spell very high aggro (possibly tying it to the Terror line--fixed so it actually does what it's supposed to do, in addition to this other debuffing part) so as to make it difficult to let anyone pull a mob off us for the duration of the spell.  I don't think it'd be much different from a paladin chain stunning a mob to mitigate the damage for another tank.  You'd have to have a serious aggro machine to keep the mob from ping ponging between the debuffing knight and the other tank, so in most instances you might as well go ahead and have the SK tank.<br />
<br />
I'll take an shielding recourse, discipline, ect.  The problem with the recourse, as mentioned, is buff slots, I really would not like to have to deal with more of that, but if I did, yeah, it is a small price to pay... and as for the discipline, I have a hard time seeing us get another tanking discipline that paladins don't... fair or unfair.  But it could happen.<br />
<br />
As for the one-rounding thing, here I'll have to confess to ignorance.  I've never dealt with content capable of one-rounding me (except the earth mini in BoT, with his 1500 damage procs), so apart from abilities that prevent attacks or entirely block them, I don't know how this can be remedied... my thought was that if you were to lower every offensive melee-oriented attribute of an enemy by a sufficient percentage it would have an overall negative impact on their entire offensive capability, including their capacity to one-round you.  But I can kind of see how that might not be so.<br />
<br />
Just trying to throw another idea out there.  If it really sucks that much... I know I can look forward to SoE implementing it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lowering the offensive capabitlity of a mob (accuracy debuff, atk debuff, etc) will reduce the probability of them landing multiple hits in a round for max, and reduce the probability of 1 rounding, but won't eliminate it.<br />
<br />
In order to get 1 rounded frequently anyways a time level SK is going to have to face off against a mob that hits for 3k+... ie, raid bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A debuff doesn't look like a good idea to me.  Everyone benefits when you debuff the mob.  So giving us a Debuff that makes our tanking viable only makes tanking for the warrior or paly trivial now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">but then we still have a spot in the group! wuwu~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, my idea was to make the spell very high aggro (possibly tying it to the Terror line--fixed so it actually does what it's supposed to do, in addition to this other debuffing part) so as to make it difficult to let anyone pull a mob off us for the duration of the spell.

<br />
<br />
if we were pallies that might work(even then guilds would just prolly throw a sacrificial pally at the mob to get it debuffed).<br />
<br />
but we are sk's, and we get this thing called feign death. yar.<br />
