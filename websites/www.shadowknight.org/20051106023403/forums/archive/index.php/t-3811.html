Let me know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fendor stonesmith</div><div class="date">07-23-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The great spear of dawn is the only peircing weapon that I know of that is worth anything to an SK. But at lv38 I dont think you will be getting that. If I were you I would start looking for a 2hs&gt;all.  With out knowing what weapon you have now or the amount of cash you have it is hard to make a sugestion. <br />

To the south of the Kejekan Village in the Stonebrunt Mountains, there is a small grassy area where a shadowknight spirit spawns. Talk to the spirit and it will tell you that it was killed by a Kejekan. It then mentions that it would love to destroy this Kejekan but cannot do so in its current form. The spirit will then mention that it lost a very powerful weapon in the past, but if you could find this weapon, it would reward you greatly. <br />
<br />
Head off to the Temple of Cazic Thule and kill the Lizard Spiritualist to obtain the Grimy Lance. Return and hand the spirit the grimy lance. The spirit then transforms [at least it says it does in the text] into an Erudite and you'll receive the Idol of Cazic Thule. Now head into the Kejekan Village and kill the Disciple Okarote. Once she has been slain, the Ghost of Ridossan will spawn and ask for the totem it handed you. [The ghost will despawn in less than one minute so you do have to move fast]. Hand it the Totem of Cazic Thule and you'll be rewarded with the Soulfiend Lance.</div></div><hr />

But that depends on what faction you are on for Velious.  It's 17/27 1h piercing, +5 int +5 mr, proc: sicken (50 DOT).  somethin' like that anyway.  Check it out on everquest.allakhazam.com.<br />

<br />
Light Velium Warlance  30dam 39del<br />
Honed Velium Warlance 32 dam 40del<br />
Hardened Velium Warlance 30dam 37del<br />
Heavey Velium Warlance 32dam 39del<br />
Crafted Velium Warlance 30dam 36del <br />
Tempered Velium Warlance 32dam 38del<br />
Etched Velium Warlance 30dam 35del<br />
Folded Velium Warlance 32dam 37del<br />
Exquisite Velium Warlance 32dam 35del<br />
<br />
I started with a light velium warlance and eventually got a crafted warlance.  The light warlance cost me 3k and the crafted cost me 4k.  These weapons look very nice and are good weapons for the cost.  On my server though they are not very commonly up for auction.  I reluctanlty banked my crafted warlance when I got a 33dam 36del tae ew war maul, damn those lances look good.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the Soulfiend Lance...<br />
<br />
A previous poster copied-and-pasted some text I suppose, but remember that CT is now a 55+ zone.  If the mob you want is still in there, you're done.  It's probably is a spawn in the Feerott now.<br />
<br />
You can bag a 30 40 weapon for 1k on Druzzil Ro now, one of those Velium weapons.  That should do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the Soulfiend Lance after the CT change.  The grimy lance you want is found on the Tae Ew Spiritualist who is now found at the north point of the lizard &quot;island&quot; in Feerrott just outside CT.  He spawns in the same location as Radiant.<br />
<br />
Funny thing about this quest now.  If you have one person with the grimy lance, you can do this quest over and over again.  &quot;A spirit&quot; becomes Ridossan the Undying who happens to be wielding the grimy lance when he appears.  When I did this quest, I left Ridossan to kill the Disciple and someone shouts a little later, that they just got the Grimy Lance the &quot;right&quot; way by killing Ridossan.  I burst his bubble by informing him that Ridossan would never have appeared unless the Lance was given to &quot;a spirit&quot; in the first place.  Problem with killing Ridossan, though, is he is on Heretics faction which you need at amiable to start the quest.<br />
<br />
Another decent piercer for a mid-30s is the Stalagterror Spine Spear that drops from one of the 'boss' Terrors in Crystal Caverns.  I used one of these to get my skill to 200.</div></div><hr />
