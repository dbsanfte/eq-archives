<br />
currently have 218 spet AA's and 3 saved.  am looking for a little input as to what i might most benifit from next.  my current AA's:<br />
<br />
General<br />
stamina 5<br />
run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
<br />
Archtype<br />
spell casting fury 3<br />
combat fury 3<br />
combat agility 3<br />
combat stability 3<br />
natural durability 3<br />
mental clarity 1<br />
<br />
Class<br />
2 hand bash<br />
unholy steed<br />
improved harmtouch<br />
physical enhancement<br />
pet discipline<br />
soul abrasion 3<br />
<br />
PoP Advance<br />
planar power 5<br />
planar durabilty 3<br />
<br />
PoP Abilities<br />
fury of the ages 3<br />
knight's advantage 3<br />
speed of the knight 3<br />
innate defense 5<br />
lightning reflexes 5<br />
theft of life 3<br />
unholy touch 3<br />
touch of the wicked 1<br />
<br />
GoD Abilities<br />
none<br />
<br />
i am not a chain HT'er so i didnt bother with TotW3, i only wanted 1 rank to get the HT timer closer to Unholy Aura's.  i also haven't bothered with Leechtouch given that the timers are linked.<br />
<br />
i have Mental Horror also, so have not had mana issues in ages.  otherwise i'd say Mental Clarity was the most obvious choice.<br />
<br />
i am currently considering the Fearless line, run5, ripostes, leechtouch, or mental clarity/natural healing.  can anyone comment on what they feel are the most useful ones for me at this point?<br />
<br />
if content is a consideration, my guild is soon to reach elementals, and i spend the majority of my group time doing GoD instanced zones (sewers, vxed, tipt).<br />
<br />
thanks for any input.  i've pretty much finished all of the AA's i felt i needed and am just trying to figure out how to plan my progression next.</div></div><hr />

Get fearless by the time you're in PoTime.  MC is good, but more regen isn't really.  Double Ripost 1 isn't bad, but the point cost scales horribly - same is true of Intense Hatred.  Weapon Affinity isn't bad, depending on your weapon.  With something like a GBoC it's definately worthwhile, but the point costs don't scale well on that either.  SCE1 isn't a bad place to dump 2AA's either...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Slein here, I wish that I'd seen the value of Fearless before being in Time. It is a matter of annoyance more than that of actual merit perhaps, but given the amount of times that you will do CT and Inny in the end, it is a worthwhile choice in the end.<br />
<br />
Run 5 is a no-brainer as well.</div></div><hr />
