<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cadem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any ideas on where the quest for the Black Bastardsword starts. Any help would be aprreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carshail Shel'rac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Black Bastardsword drops during the &quot;Hedge Maze Quest&quot; which grants you access to PoNb aka Lair of Terris off the Construct of Nightmares (quests name is Thelin's Torment if you wanna look it up at Allakhazam, you'll end up protecting an Erudite in a maze). Good luck on it, the sucker has around 400k HP and hits around 1.1k ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its more of an event than a quest.<br />
<br />
You have to enter the Maze in Plane of Nightmare (some pre-flagging required, although I forget exactly what).<br />
<br />
The event consists mostly of following an NPC around as he collects parts of a dagger... in each room he reaches an increasing amount of mobs pop.  Finally he reaches the end and A Construct of Nightmares pops, boss hitting for around 1000+ ... he can drop the Black Bastardsword along with a few other items.<br />
<br />
I believe the max amount allowed into the quest at any 1 time is 3 groups, and you'll need all 3 to beat it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cadem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks that is a big help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um..the construct hitting for 1000+? He hits for like 400. He went down in like 45 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">His MAX hit is around 1100, but like a lot of the pre-elemental PoP bosses, he has low ATK so he dosent often hit for max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">His dps is rather low for a max hitting 1100 though, 3 groups is most certainly enough. bring 2 chanters. one will be on mezzing duty for the erudite similair to gnome walk. make sure that everyone is ready each time the mobs pop. make sure all melee are in room, casters are outside, then unmez erudite, let em pop, kill, follow eru, rinse repeat till you get to boss room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foor Twinty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so its pretty much exactly like the &quot;quest&quot; in CT where you follow the gnome around?<br />
<br />
protecting a gnome rules, but i'd rather let the erudite die :P<br />
<br />
stupid erudites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigormortis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just got mine the other night. was my 4th hedge walk and had been waiting for one to drop. This sword has replaced my Disease Imbued Greatstaff as my main weapon. Unless of course I'm not MA and I don't want the proc drawing attention to myself. Not that I still dont get aggro on accident anyway. Have to feign outta aggro like a damn monk. Anyway, great weapon for the not so uber guild SK. we went straight from the walk, which was to get the rest of our lazy guild flagged, to terris thule, and got a nice ass beating from her, rather not from her, from the damn butterflies. We only had 1 chanter and 1 bard present though, so I guess it was expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nixpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tanked the construct at lvl 63 with no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can use the BBS when you're not the MA- I used to do it on raids all the time.  That thing would have to proc assloads for you to take aggro from an MA (or you'd have to have a pretty crappy MA).<br />
<br />
As for the butterflies in the TT event, leave the MA and Healer on TT, and the rest of the raid kills the butterflies.  Best thing is AE stun and shove them into your chanters.</div></div><hr />
