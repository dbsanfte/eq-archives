<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>strag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just pick one that uses periods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkcorruption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">strag what do you mean uses dots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not sure what was better, strag's comment or the response to it.<br />
<br />
Make a Dark Elf, we look the best in plate armor by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">seriously they all have their perks...most of which fade away in the high end game exaecpt for stun from front which ogres have.  but ogres look like a pile of shit walking on pirate stumps....so it makes up for it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you're gonna go Ikky make sure you can use all the gear off of your brothers character. <br />
<br />
I agree with the Dark elf being the way to go.</div></div><hr />

No, not dots, periods.  You know the things you put at the end of paragraphs?<br />
<br />
My advice to you is to cancel your account.  In the time that you will gain you can do all of that homework you've been ignoring and read a book or two (maybe).<br />
<br />
edit: Why the hell was this posted under &quot;Spells &amp; Skills&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, we've got the grammar nazi posting above me....<br />
<br />
Anyway, on subject.  Make a gnome, nothing looks cooler than a gnome stabbing at a big giant's toe!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I play an ogre personally.  Ogres have a greater xp penalty then dark elves, so if thats a factor for you, choose the dark elf.  End game, I feel Ogres have a somewhat small advantage.   Ogres are unstunnable from the front by PHSYICAL stuns...  I still get the crap stunned out of me (from the front) in valor by the bugs, by mobs in upper sands in BOT, etc...  It seems like I get stunned several times a night nowadays - though I am sure its much worse for non-ogres.  Anyhow, if its not obvious, a lot of mobs have stun procs and those hit us :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkcorruption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">first off its my char but is on my bros account and i know its the wrong forum lol but im not gonna remake him i played him to 63 and dont want to start all over its a big waist of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, not dots, periods.  You know the things you put at the end of paragraphs? <br />

<br />
Periods are the things you put at the ends of statements, slugger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, darkcorruption puts his at the ends of paragraphs, chief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If it's your SK why the hell ask what race to make? It seems to me you have a DE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yah whichever you think looks best most of my stats unbuffed are only around 200 but with normal buffage i hit 305</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkcorruption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the reason i want to know the best race is because my DE SK sucks at level 63 he has decent bazaar gear and whatnot but still sucked. and i thought you ment perido or whatever not period lol. and so what i cant type a sentence or spell one right for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is no best race. It all depends on how you are going to play your toon and who you tend to group with.<br />
<br />
If you anticipate tanking alot, make an Ogre for the stats and non-stun from physical stun ability.<br />
<br />
If you plan on aggro kiting make a Troll or Iskar for the regeneration abilities (helpful with pact of hate)<br />
<br />
If you plan on casting more and fighting less, make a dark elf, gnome or Erudite for the higher INT.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, look at other players and decide which graphics you like the best an go that way. Also, if you have a 63 SK and you think &quot;he sucks&quot; perhaps you would be better suited playing another class. You may not be happy with any SK race. (Btw, I don't think 63 DE SK's suck - I have seen some pretty good ones even without &quot;ubah&quot; gear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you thinka 63 DE Sk sucks in bazaar gear then you are gonna think any 63 sk you play sucks in that gear...go make a zerker.</div></div><hr />
