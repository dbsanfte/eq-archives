Just another troll telling us that he's &quot;l33t3r d4n u$&quot; as if he/she/it thinks it will make a bit of difference.  I can go on about the same thing as ogre, trolls, humans, whatever it's not important.  Iksar's don't &quot;pwn&quot; anyone, no one does.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phenotype</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wow holy shit<br />
i wasnt expecting to get flamed by some of the people that had posted some pretty decent and good reading posts in teh past but wow now its my turn to unload<br />
number 1 why the hell would i PL its lame <br />
as far as that i see its obvious that i forgot to tell you the druid is retired 54 levels of charkiteing fear kiteing snare kiteing and dot rotting kinda messed my whole veiw of the druid up<br />
as far as you retards out there flameing me i actuly thaught you where nice guys  heh tell today<br />
one of the best combo's in the game is a sk/druid combo<br />
druid snare/dots/debufs vs a sk's melee taps ect<br />
<br />
next time you knock some one make sure They are in deserveing <br />
if you dont know what the 7 khukris are for you definatly are a retard<br />
you have to do them to get the lord of pains khukri to get greenmist<br />
<br />
and yes i SOLOed all of the 7 khukri's<br />
from CoM to droga at level 50 down<br />
as far as pita learn some freaking abreviations pita= pain in the ass<br />
<br />
now thak you thank you KISS my ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Makk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But.... <br />
<br />
Swimming can be raised, and the first 100 or so points after it gets going isn't too bad, just put on a EB item find a corner in a pool in neriak, or what ever go out and have a blast, come back 6 hours later, swimming deficit should be next to gone.<br />
<br />
Trolls get regen as well so even there.<br />
<br />
AC bonus yes you guys do have that =).  But after 1250 AC who really cares how much extra AC you have (admittedly it does help a lot for the lower levels but the little bit doestn' make em invulnerable or godly)<br />
<br />
Forage (yes you can forage)  But I perfer to be evil and kill stuff, instead of prancing about the woods collecting nuts and berries.<br />
I guess that is why you went with a foraging class to remember the good ole days of being a druid.<br />
<br />
You guys do have decent stats, but not as decent as some other sk races, imo more a middle line of stats with a good mix of physical and int, but not excelling in any of them really (unless you hose up your starting stats and do something weird like all points into agi/dex).  Personally all SK races have strong points and weak points in starting stats, and one should pick the race/look combo to his or her own particular play style.<br />
<br />
And I got to level from no exp to level 51 in about 11 days solo (admittedly I am a twink, but this is my 4th sk I have started and I feel that after the first 3 I can endulge a bit). I guess trolls are better than iskars according to your logic.  But it really comes to what gear you have and not what race you pick.  So with gear in mind everyone is pretty much even near the end.  No matter what race you pick.<br />
<br />
So with final statement.  Plz LnS from l33+ +h3ad.  And remember nothing is more evil than a troll making you toss the  troll salad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>phenotype</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one more thing PLEASE tell me how you can pl a shadowknight that is on the same account as the druid...<br />
i'd be really impressed to find that out<br />
gawd some of you guys that flamed me are n00bs<br />
i have been on eq sence beta test no i dont know everything but yes i know obviously a hell of a lot more then you do<br />
....... with that you retards have a nice day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>phenotype</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">omg haha you guys just proved my point<br />
you need all the gear availible to you i.e  cultral to twink the piss out of your charecters<br />
<br />
when i started my sk he was in BANDED armor tell level 34<br />
then i started him on dreadforge armor<br />
then from there i started getting really decent armor here and there<br />
now im set <br />
what im saying <br />
is that you refuse to play a class that is/was damn near impossible to twink<br />
because that would have to actuly take tallent to play a untwinked class<br />
go home n00bs you almost lit my fire</div></div><hr />

Your post could have been taken seriously if you had not written it so arrogantly and without care for structure. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your Shadow Knight, just your obvious contempt for those who don’t share your point of view.<br />
I love my Dark Elf Shadow Knight and chose this race because of my preference, not because of irrelevant stats that can be compensated for later on in life.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its also called Darkforge, not Dreadforge.  I assume the &quot;7 khurkis&quot; refers to the progressive weapon quests that eventually culminate in Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Iksar are a nice race, no doubt about it.  Nicely balanced stats, nice perks.  Faction doesn't matter anymore, not really anyway, and forage is nice if you are a tradeskiller or get lucky and forage a rare item.</div></div><hr />

At any rate, it doesn't matter if they pose good point or not, any thread saying &quot;this race is the best&quot; is stupid. Even if there was a superior race *cough*humans*cough* we would all have decided upon it at this point. And pointing it out would be like saying &quot;Most people have 10 fingers&quot;.<br />
<br />
So.... yeah.<br />
<br />
And I think that this marks the first time I have seen someone chop a sentance in half for no reason and start it on the next line.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Adding my word to thouse saying that you should do something about your spelling Phenotype.<br />
<br />
My expirience is that there is no best race for SK. Gear will define most of your perfomance. There are three races that have specific bonuses which cannot be covered by gear that easily however.<br />
Ogres have bonus to HP and they cannot be stunned by melee attacks incoming from front. This makes them better tanks then others.<br />
Trolls have increased regen rate. This makes them better at soloing.<br />
Iksars also have increased regen rate.<br />
<br />
Darkvision isn't an advantage because most races have it.<br />
AC bonus isn't that big to give you an edge over others. However, you'll have to pass on big chunk of equipment because iksars do not wear plate.<br />
In addition to 100 swimming iksars can hold their breath longer then other races (with exception of frogs now) but it easily countered by EB item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pesonally, I don't think he's ever played the game.  Just gleamed some info from this site and shot off his big mouth.  What server you on, Pheno?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Originally posted by phenotype <br />

As has been pointed out, the armor you are referring to is Dreadscale armor, it is SHD and IKS only.  The icons are typically the icons for chain armor, but the worn armor uses the Iksar plate graphic.<br />
<br />
And yes, Iksar are the superior race for a shadow knight, because they are cooler than the other races, and only l00sarZ and h4t3rZ will deny this.<br />
<br />
And yes, you should be beaten with a baseball bat for such horrific writing structure.  Come on, man, you can do better than that, unless you're being home-schooled by a three-year-old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xsil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This guy makes me feel ashamed to be an Iksar shadowknight...<br />
<br />
Ok first of all phenotype, fix<br />
the stupid, random<br />
places where either you've hit return or your computer<br />
is fucking messed up.<br />
<br />
Second...<br />
<br />
Please don't post entirely in run on/rambling sentences it's stupid and you're a moron because you're stupid and I'm right and you're wrong I like cheese you're stupid stfu n00b but he liked it You suck.<br />
<br />
Third...<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO DREADFORGE ARMOR YOU IDIOT<br />
<br />
There is DARKforge, mid-level PLATE sk armor unequipable by Iksar...<br />
There is dreadSCALE, mid-level CHAIN sk armor equipable only by Iksar Shadowknights.<br />
NO DREADFORGE<br />
<br />
p.s.  Lizarde - Dreadscale Armor does not use &quot;Iksar Plate&quot; graphic, as Iksar really CAN'T wear plate.  It shows the Luclin graphic design of Iksar Cultural, which happens to resemble plate...which I still am pretty boggled about...<br />
<br />
And as a reminder, Iksar and most other races have INFRAvision, DARK ELVES have ULTRAvision.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;regen of 6 hp a tick!&quot;, sitting down it gets much higher than that at high levels....<br />
<br />
Also, learn how to spell WHINING, HAVING, DESERVING, AND EVERY OTHER WORD YOU MISPELLED (approx. 1/4 of the total)<br />
<br />
Let's see...what else...oh yes if you really have been playing since Beta, I would've hoped you had developed some sort of decent typing skill playing the game...<br />
<br />
Ooh and I do agree with the home-schooled by a 3 year old...<br />
<br />
Excessive use of the term n00b...<br />
<br />
And as for &quot;yes i know a hell of a lot more than you do&quot;....SHUT UP<br />
<br />
And now that THAT part of the reply is over...<br />
<br />
I would agree that Iksar ARE a good race for shadowknights, however each race (this has already been said) has it's own strengths and weaknesses.  In the end, (this has already been said) any race can be just as good as another with the right equipment.  Frankly I believe that the flamers (might have) agreed with most of your point, the way you presented them was just immature and rude.  (looks at his own flame) Whoops...<br />
<br />
So um....<br />
<br />
<br />
SHUT UP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Amen.<br />
<br />
Going thru 30 levels, I think it was, in BANDED?  You had it good.  I went thru 30 levels in LEATHER.  Yes. LEATHER.<br />
<br />
Do you know what PUNCTUATION is?  It`s these little dots and strange sqwigly marks we use to indicate a break in the sentence or the end of a sentence.  &lt;== notice that? It`s called a period.  Say it with me now: per-i-od. Very good!  Now just relearn the english language, its punctuation, and its spelling and we MIGHT listen to you... or not... probably not.<br />
<br />
Bye-bye for now.<br />

I call it plate because the armor that bears that look always uses the plate graphic when plate-wearers get it (like the Velious stuff for example).  Frankly I think SOE just got lazy about the 'can't wear plate' part because they realized they would have to make a whole new set of plate armor for IKS SHD, and it was going to be a lot of work to do that instead of just giving up and making Velious plate Iksar-usable.<br />
<br />
I'd rather it used the chain graphic anyway, I much prefer that graphic to the ugly-ass papier-mache' look we get from the other armor.</div></div><hr />

and yeah use punctuation I only read about 7 words of your post say Ultravision (its infravision DElves have Ultra) and I saw a lot of 3's in places of other letters didn't both to try to translate, oh and yeah I agree make a monk you'd fit in quite well</div></div><hr />

Ok i had a iskar sk long time ago did the dreadscale quest and you all that hve done it, knows what a freaken pain it was to do. how many days i wasted trying to get them damn boots off that snarkie in OT i think that was the zone.  And the armor look like blackish green chain mail when i played last unless they change the graphic's on it.   Soon hope to be playing EQ again and i well make a iskar SK again they rule:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well the other day I decided to make an Iksar as I have played every other SK race except them. (But not always to levl like 30 my human went to 13 before I got annoyed, my gnome is 26 now and my ogre never got passed Ferrott heheheheh.) So Iksars where the last. I had an Iksarian monk awhile back but...he kinda annoyed me too so I deleted him. So I make this SK right? And I'm thinking that With this Iksar I'll get to 20 and be blown over. So First few level are standard. Scaled Pups, beetles, Pups, Beetles. So I get to lvl 4 and I do the first Khurki (I can't remember exactly) quest. I get these sarnak heads and put em in a bag of sorts then give em to this guy. Well, I can't say that it was a wase of my time. It's actually a really nice newbie weapon with a cool graphic. Basically for those who dont know it looks like a Fer'Esh. So I got him to around lvl 10 and send him to Kurns where I'm actually haveing a great time. My monk was here and he kinda sucked. But my SK seems to own the mid level. (Figure of Speech). So my &quot;Lowdown&quot; so far is that SKs that happen to be Iksars have nice fun-time on their newbie levels. But when I get to like Marus Seru we shall see how much fun it is. I'll post you guys. But they are reallly fun and I havnt noticed the xpen on me yet like I did with my troll in Befallen.</div></div><hr />

Its not even about iksars...its about using spaces and good paragraph spacing.  <br />
<br />
While your at the typing why dont you guys just leave out spaces between words and any punctuation.  In fact, just put alot of random letters up there so I can treat it like a word search.</div></div><hr />
