<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fankel</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 32 Iksar SK and a 15+ Gnome SK. I really like them both but I want to decide on which one to play from now on. Could some of you old timers give me a few pros and cons about each race in how they would do in soloing, raiding, ect.. at 50+? I plan to solo a lot, much perfer it in fact.<br />
<br />
Any advice/tips you guys and gals could give would help me more then you can imagine. It's so hard to decide. :( <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would figure the gnome would be less constrained by faction issues than the iksar. I've not checked the starting stats for a gnome, but I know that in general they're higher int and lower melee stats than other races.<br />
<br />
Due to high int (more mana) and easier moving around due to faction, I would say the gnome would probably make for an easier soloing SK. However, the iksar's regen and AC bonus, not to mention the 15 level advantage, are certainly not to be discarded lightly. Note I say I think the gnome would be easier to play, not necessarily better.<br />
<br />
When it comes right down to it, it's how you play the class that will make you succeed or fail, the race of the toon is pretty much just style. The different races may go about things in a slightly different manner but they're all using the same spells, weapons, etc. There is no right or wrong choice, play the one that you like.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm guessing you'll stick with the gnome, because if you had a 30+ iksar and were able to play a gnome to 15, I'm thinking you like the gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruze</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another advantage to being a gnome is that you'll be able to use the Blood Ember clicky armor that Iksar aren't allowed to wear.  Having the mana free Engulfing Darkness, FD and Fear would be especially nice and I don't think these are available on any other piece of armor.  I don't know about anybody else but for me swapping spells in and out all the time gets old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are interested in having the best, most powerful SK, then of the two, no doubt Iksar is the better choice.  They will have better ac and regen of course.  Gnomes, while statistically better than Dark Elves and Erudites, still can't match up to Iksar, Trolls, Ogres and even Humans imo when it comes to pure ads/disads.  Bottom line though it doesn't make a big difference either way.  Gnomes are the twink du jour however and that alone would make me shy away from them but again, that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fankel</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the imput guys. <br />
<br />
Going to stick with the Iksar SK. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotik Von'Damon</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For soloing id say go with the more int one..the Gnome. Im a Erud and Ive soloed up to 41 so far, we arent the best statiscally and I messed up on my base stats too. But soloing is just easier when you have less faction issues in zones and you have the mana to work with. Plus at 46 my BE armor will be FREE no mana spells to improve my soloing abilities even more. If you want regen etc, there are items you can buy later down the line to help with that. And most Gravelords Ive seen are doing just fine as Dark Elves. Think you have better starting stats as a gnome. (if you are worrying about the high end aspect of the game) Just have fun all sks are good to solo.. I figure Gnomes would be more &quot;fun&quot; though.</div></div><hr />
