<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">wondering if my memming the right spells for the occasion. in exp grps where i tank i mem :<br />
<br />
FD...Volatis...ZB...Torrent of Fatigue...Spear...Spear...Shroudof Chaos/MC...Festering Darkness.<br />
<br />
<br />
i tend to be low on mana a good chunk of the time. relying on mostly Mental Corruption to keep me at a steady spot so i can cast DD's and end the fight sooner. am i really memming the best lineup for tanking?<br />
<br />
if not tanking i usually keep the same lineup just change out Shroud for a Blood of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personal opinion here: I never have my self buffs memmed- just drop and mem 'em when they need refreshing. You get used to knowing when MC is going to drop and there's plenty of time to drop and mem real fast as you head out to pull or whatever. Use a miscellaneous slot so if you don't have time to switch it out before the fight you're not doing without something you need.<br />
<br />
Festering is a mana hog if you're doing it more than once. CD should be fine- MC makes up for it easy.<br />
<br />
Also- leave the nuking to the wizzies if it's draining your mana pool. I'd rather use the mana for a dot and be procc'ing or regenning back my mana while the dot ticks. I'd have BoH up instead of one of those spears for sure. I always grouped with as high a DPS makeup as possible so instead of 1 spear I'd rather be giving ATK to my rogue for instance.  <br />
<br />
Also, you're 63- have AoP up if you're tanking, I never step up to the plate without that tap.<br />
<br />
At 63 for a tanking lineup I had:<br />
Lifetap<br />
CD<br />
Fear<br />
BoH<br />
AoP<br />
Zev<br />
FD<br />
misc<br />
<br />
p.s. Why Torrent of Fatigue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should be close enough to max stam after shammy buffs that Torrent of Fatigue is essentially doing a lot of wasting a buff slot.  Also, as Ashrai pointed out, you'd be better off dememming Festering and instead just popping off CD instead (barring of course that you are fighting somewhere with runners).  Two spears is terribly mana efficient for the most part, though I had a phase where I did that same thing.  You'd be better off getting rid of one, and instead using Aura of Pain, especially while tanking.  At 63, and even now, unless I get flat out nuke/lifetap happy, I rarely have any mana problems.<br />
<br />
lineup at 63 was:<br />
<br />
FD<br />
MC<br />
BoH<br />
Spear<br />
Volatis<br />
AoP<br />
CD<br />
ZBite<br />
<br />
and it hasn't changed much since then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im short most of my 63-65 spells so my line up is basicly the same.<br />
<br />
Torrent of Hate<br />
Spear<br />
Harmshield<br />
Lifetap<br />
Zev<br />
Festering Darkness<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
FD<br />
<br />
If im not pulling ill change out the Harmshield sometimes for more DPS.<br />
If im not tanking I usually drop one of my darknesses for more DPS.<br />
<br />
Dester</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i havent bee able to get a hold of Aura of Pain as of yet. i will prolly switch that out with Fatigue when i get it. i always have 2 Spears memmed. with ID4 it does good dmg and my mana puddle can take those spells np. as for the self buff slot. i pull most of the time so i guess i could put something in that slot more with more of a group benefit. thx for the input guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you don't have Aura yet, use Torrent of Pain.  More AC helps you, less AC on them also helps the party.  Throw down the cash and get Aura, it's very much worth it.<br />
<br />
I only use Torrent of Fatigue when my str and sta aren't maxed from shammy/BL buffs.  Load up Torrent of Hate instead.  It's good for a nondamaging caster pulling tool and all melee classes will get a boost.<br />
<br />
I leave up MC all the time when someone else is pulling and we always have a mob in camp.  Especially in LDoN.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big FD advocate unless I'm pulling.  Most of the time I put Bond of Death in it's place for more healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mdiyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have two different spell sets setup one called tanking one called DPS<br />
<br />
Tanking Spell Set:<br />
<br />
FD(Force of habit)<br />
MC<br />
ToT(Terror)<br />
AoP<br />
CD<br />
Fear<br />
ZB<br />
ToI<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
FD<br />
SoC<br />
AoH<br />
CoD(Call of Darkness)<br />
Spears<br />
ZB<br />
ToI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nephtu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just dinged 64, but it doesn't alter my spell lineup that much.  I have all pre-65 spells except the LDoN ones, the level 49 quest spell and the Pacts.<br />
<br />
My constants are:<br />
1) Best Lifetap (Touch of Volatis at present)<br />
.....<br />
7) Harmshield<br />
8) Best feign (Death Peace)<br />
<br />
The spells between I have in a variety of sets, depending on what I'll be fighting, which I tweak a fair bit.  I have a low mana lineup, a Spear/Nuke, a DoT heavy,  etc. but a generic spell lineup I typically have up would be:<br />
2) Bond of Death<br />
3) Zefveer's Bite<br />
4) flex-o-spot DoT, spear, tap, what have you (most self-buffs swapped in through here)<br />
5) Blood of Hate<br />
6) Darkness (usually clinging, occasionally festering, if I'm fighting somethiong with mucho HPs and I have loads of mana)<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Of course is really situational but I would use this line up when tanking for the most part. There is absolutely no point in keeping shroud of chaos in a spell gem, as it lasts an hour.<br />
<br />
FD<br />
Mental corruption<br />
Touch of volatis<br />
Zeveer's bite<br />
Blood of hate<br />
Spear<br />
Aura of pain<br />
Clinging darkness.<br />
<br />
Forget terrors, just say no m'kay not needed in the least. This line up will give you far more agro than you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at 65 i use<br />
<br />
zevfeers<br />
Touch of inny/54 or whatever spear/deny undead<br />
aura of hate<br />
aura of pain<br />
clinging darkness<br />
fear<br />
touch of volatis/64spear<br />
feign death<br />
<br />
i also always use soc because of the duration. now how i use the lineups is kinda different say tanking a named/mini or small raid mob then i cast cd/fear till i have agro lock then i chain zbite/toi/tov/zbite/toi/tov repeat till its dead or im oom. <br />
<br />
On say BoT minis i can do that and self heal most the fight.<br />
If im doing an ldon and i feel like seeing how long i can go self healing i do the same thing just you know not changing it and using tov sparingly. Then again when i would 3box ldon's with my cleric/bst/sk i would load up both spears or deny undead if in guk. and chain them till i was oom cuz there my dps mattered alot more, and to be honest except when doing hards my cleric is fm the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spears.  I use them occasionally, provided:<br />
<br />
1.) I am not tanking.<br />
2.) I only get resisted 1/3 times on average. <br />
<br />
With those provisos, I think it works out that spears do more damage.<br />
<br />
Ie, ToI is 350Mana 470damage.<br />
     ToV is ~250Mana 350damage.<br />
     SoD is ~250Mana 660damage.<br />
<br />
(I can't remember my numbers precisely, sorry.)<br />
<br />
Regardless, with those general numbers I think it works out<br />
that it is pretty much a wash with damage if you are resisted 1/3 times, and saves mana by several 100.<br />
<br />
Of course, it is rare to find stuff that is not resistant to disease anymore, so it really is only situational at 65.<br />
