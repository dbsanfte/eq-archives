<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really need some help with my disc timers.  If I use one and then zone before the timer refreshes, it turns my wait time up to like 2 hrs.  After sending a tech support ticked ingame they told me to reset my bios clock or call their tech support for help with that.  Well, I don't know much about screwing around in my CMOS or BIOS settings, so after trying to change the time there I called up tech support.<br />
<br />
After 20 min on hold, 5 seconds realizing the tech guy barely speaks english and has never played EQ, and finally waiting for him to pull up his onscreen help file... he tells me he can't help me out.  He said I have to reset my BIOS clock but he can't tell me how to do it.  I would have to call my computer manufacturer.  Problem is, I originally bought my Gateway pc like 4 yrs ago and my free support expired a long time ago.<br />
<br />
So, I was hoping someone here had some idea what I'm talking about and can help me out.  This is driving me crazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In short, to set the correct time in the BIOS you need to enter it while your computer is booting up.  Typically you'll see something along the order of 'Press Delete to enter setup,' or F2, etc.; depending on the BIOS manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Once in the BIOS, the focus should be on the Time/Date and you can make the changes accordingly and then choose 'Save settings and Exit' or similar.<br />
One thing that could be affecting it is if your CMOS battery is low and needs to be replaced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply.  I had tried changing the time in my BIOS by a minute or so, but it was displaying the correct time to start with.  I've had my computer for like 5 years now and have only upgraded ram and vid card so no idea about the CMOS battery.  I did see something online about that in some help files, but it was talking about laptops.  I guess I'll have to take a look at it.</div></div><hr />
