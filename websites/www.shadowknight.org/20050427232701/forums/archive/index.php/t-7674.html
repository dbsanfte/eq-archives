<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Strider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets say you have access to a level 44 Necromancer and a level 44 Shadow Knight, which would you chose to play as your main, and why?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in the long run the shadowknight is a more versatile class, even though necros are a close second.  as a necro you can solo more and really do some nasty stuff with your spells.  as a shadowknight you can survive 2 rounds of combat with a PoP mob :p <br />
just depends what you want, powerful caster or melee with some useful utility and combat spells.  personally id play the shadowknight as a main any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Strider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me add more data to my question.  What if you were a casual player (2 hours, 3 times a week) and usually soloed?  Does that matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, then the Necro will be more efficient in that amount of time, Strider.  However, if you're only playing a few hours a week, you should go with the one you like the most. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sk prob better. more group friendly and you can get twinked for under 2k now days. necros can solo but its really not more effective any other class till the later levels and group wise they basicly damage dealer with snare and ghetto crowd control.<br />
i remeber with my iksar bp and dn weapon combo i was tearing up mobs in ot non stop while them necros were shouting  for reses hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
personly i would make a sk and shaman, or ranger and cleric and 2box or eqw it:). soloing not as good as it use to be with the exp changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a casual player of a social game myself I would pick the shadow knight.  Melee are more fun to play and SKs can do more imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pick whatever you enjoy the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Medzgaleer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">neither quit the game and save your personal life.  .....run while u can!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've tried playing pure casters but the closest I can come is a mage.  Must... melee...<br />
<br />
SK is versatile, hard to kill, soloable and group friendly.  There are issues at the high end raid game, but they don't concern the casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Umm, you just might get some biased opinions off this board...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darksithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have played both classes into the mid 50's, and I would recommend the Necro.<br />
<br />
While I enjoyed playing my SK, to me they just where not fun to solo, though they where alot of fun to group with.  Pretty much the opposite for the Necro, fun to solo boring to group IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
But bottom line is what others have said, play what you like the most.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this. If you are going to be soloing go Necro because they are uber at soloing. If not soloing go SK cause we are not that great at soloing contrary to popular belief. Yes beter than most melee classes but nothing compared to necros druids wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Buy the Necro, higher resale value.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PLW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would aggree with any of the previous posts that mention personal preference (ultimately thats what it boils down too).<br />
<br />
But let me add:<br />
<br />
Necromancers are just plain bad ass, until a mob gets their hands on him/her. Sk's are far more gear dependent and take more patience to play effectively, imo. If you are just a casual player then go necro. <br />
<br />
Their DPS is much higher than a sk, unless of course that sk has a weapon yanked from a dragon's ass. I can think of at least 5 spells a necro has that do 1000+ damage. <br />
<br />
I regularly slaughter the guards in Paineel (all of them) and the necro can do it in 1/3 of the time or less.<br />
<br />
My personal preference is the sk as i like to engage melee with and cast a bit as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Umbra_crux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Let me pose this question..<br />
<br />
Which class can solo naked?<br />
<br />
I find that as a 60 SK, without my gear I would be soloing every 15-20 minutes 1 mob and barely live...  with my gear it is every 2-5 minutes.   a necro needs bone chips lich and go ...  <br />
<br />
so if you only had 3 hours to play and cant raid in massive amouts of time you arent going to get the real decent gear an sk would need to solo with.  The necro could solo effectively all the way to 60 with medium gear a SK would be hard pressed to get to 60 with some banded armor and a Moss.<br />
<br />
All of this is of course just my opinion<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All real sks are masochists.<br />
<br />
If you pose the question of which is better, then the answer is never sk.  If you pose the question of which is more fun, the answer might be sk.  If you pose the question of which should I play......<br />
<br />
the answer, for you, then, is the one that isn't sk.  I played an sk because I wanted to play the game on &quot;hard&quot;.  People aren't wishywashy about playing an sk, and they don't ask permission so they can blame the advice when they don't have fun playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caithris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">unless of course that sk has a weapon yanked from a dragon's ass <br />
<br />
lol, I just like that line for some reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are really only playing a few hours at a time, a necro would be better suited for you.  You'll solo easier, still have fun, and not worry about looking for a group.<br />
<br />
As far as, which is the better class?  Pick the one you enjoy most.  I've played both at 60, and while I loved my sk till death did us part, a necro is still alot of fun.<br />
<br />
I had this urge tho, while being a necro to run up and start tanking =((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xanyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you are a casual player Necro is a good way to go.<br />
SK can solo nicely until about 50 then it becomes much more time consuming, unless you have KEI all the time downtime can be very annoying.<br />
Getting in a quick group with a SK is not always easy since we don't bring anything flashy like uber damage, buffs that benefit the group or extra healing.<br />
That said SK is a very fun class to play but in 61 levels I only got one tell from strangers saying &quot;would you like to come to ____ we need a puller/tank.&quot;<br />
If you are a necro you really don't need a group and you can do great just duoing or soloing with whatever class you please.<br />
If you are a Necro you will have massive mana regen and the only problem you have at high levels is to get certain spells, but you can live without.</div></div><hr />

i always seem to come back to this god forsaken SK i have, and i hate it more and more each time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AkumaShreddies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Is there a way around researching spells as a necro? I started a mage and quit because of the spell research, what/are there any options on buying, or the like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daeneb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sure... buy them in the bazaar or get the words and have others do the combines for a fee.<br />
<br />
-Daeneb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nexen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I recommend the Necromancer.  Much more powerful, versatile, and can solo for far more levels than the SK with minimal downtime.  Eventually they get great travel spells, escape spells etc.  They are fragile since they are a caster class but they get lots of toys to overcome this.<br />
<br />
The SK is a fine class but the necro is a special one.<br />
<br />
N 'a retired mofo'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think thats a pretty loaded question. After all, you're on an SK message board.<br />
<br />
I haven't read any of the replies though so maybe I'm wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Someone said Necros are Fragile. Blah self buffed I have close to 2k hps.<br />
<br />
I tried a couple of different classes. Ranger, Cleric, Dr00d, Wuzzy, Pally, Sk, and Necro.  With my play style I picked a Necromancer.  I can log on an in side 5 mins be killing shit.  Getting groups have not been a problem for me.  I've spent my time in Seb, Velks, Fungus, ME, and now PoN.  Getting a group as a Necro is 70% ability 30% rep.<br />
<br />
So if you can play 5 hours at a time go Shadow Knight.  If you have only a couple hours at a time go Necromancer.  I just started a shadow knight last week.  I'm having a blast.  Nothing like getting your hands dirty.  Plus its just enough of a change to make me want to play my Necro more.<br />
<br />
Any who GO Shadow Knight.... No need to have another Necro getting in my way. :evilsmile</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thank goodness necros don’t have spells that can give others mana or hp, and that they can’t mez mobs or cast effective debuffs or stun or rez or slow undead. Otherwise, they might be more group-friendly than SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pannonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have access to my girlfriend's 42 Necro and my main is a 40 Iksar SK.  From the information you have given I would recommend the Necro.  Great soloing class that can bring on the heat.  Playing a SK is a huge investment in time.  Plus SKs are totally gear dependent and if you don't have the time and/or plat it can get frustrating.  SKs are great in their own right but I don't think it is a good class for a casual player.  I myself play about 4 hours a day, everyday- sick I know lol;) <br />
<br />
Just my opinion..<br />
