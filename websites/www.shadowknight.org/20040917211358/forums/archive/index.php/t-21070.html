<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 50 and am interested in soloing some of the LoY stuff a bit.  I am currently weilding the fabled dark reaver.  Do you think I should sacrafice some dps and use my old black acryla halberd for its 45 pt lifetap proc.  Between that, the 25 pter self buff, and the occasianal life tap will I be lowering my downtime, or increasing it because the fight will last longer? <br />
<br />
I could always use the Fabled and just lifetap between every swing, but that is a pain as weel as a mana drain<br />

EDIT: I could have sworn I posted this in the armory, sorry for posting under the wrong topic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 50, if you're soloing at all, you should be fear kiting and not getting hit. anyway... <br />
fabled dark reaver &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; black acrylia halbred.<br />
with FDR the mobs should die about 10% quicker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know of at least 3 spots in Dulak where you can fear kite to your hearts content.<br />
<br />
Trick with some of them is to use Fear instead of Invoke while clearing.  Then once you have path clear you can switch to Invoke.<br />
<br />
As far as life taps go.   You should have been a troll.  No need for life taps when fear kiting cause even when you get hit you will heal it all back up by end of fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Something I noticed. You don't have an eyepatch of plunder. If you are going to be fear kiting alot it is definately a quest item you should look into. 20% haste + worn haste adds up to a lot quicker fights. Sure, Stormfeather is one hell of a crappy quest but after you do it, the pain will fade from your memories and all that will be left is the Eyepatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azmod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fear Kiteing In Dulak is easy ... been a while (like since that expansion came out)  but that 3rd ship down has alot of room outside of it to fearkite..mobs go down fast</div></div><hr />
