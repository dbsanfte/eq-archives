<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to post a SK-unrelated topic, but tech support isn't being very responsive. If you wanna read on, here's my problem. I've finally gotten EQ hooked up to my new computer, on cable connection, 256 MB ram, and a S3 Graphics ProSavageDDR video card. I've gotten a driver for it, and have instaled DirectX9.0 and am still having the following problems:<br />
I can't see any name, PC or NPC unless it's against the sky. Same with spell effects.<br />
I can't see ghosts, or anything which would normally be semi transparent. IE Particle effects on epics, or half-invisible blades, like velium crap and Noc blade, ECT. The ghost thing isn't very cool in CoM and the like.<br />
There isnt any text on the char select screen, unless, once again, my character's being displayed by an open window and I can see part of their name and information in the char select screen sky.<br />
I've crashed to desktop a couple times REALLY fast, might be unrelated. <br />
I've gotta hunch it's just that this 3D card isn't compatible with EQ, despite the fact that the computer's brand new, in compairson to the one in my living room from 1996 which ran EQ alright. however, I'd rather know for sure before I go and blow cash on a voodoo5 or something. Email me or somethin please, or post if ya have any ideas. Thanks again for reading about my problems :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am by no means a computer expert, but it sounds to me like you've got a softward conflict somewhere. If you are crashing to desktop, as you say, REALLY fast, it's usually because the program has hit a &quot;run-stop&quot; or something along those lines, and the program just stops.<br />
<br />
I would make sure your driver for your video card is:<br />
1) the latest version<br />
2) supports directx 9.0<br />
3) compatible with EQ<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Medster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My suggestion is to get a video card that's listed on the EQ supported video cards page with the exception of the voodoo series.  You can get one of the GeForce cards at Best Buy from under $100 and if you dont mind waiting goto Pricewatch.com (http://www.pricewatch.com) and you can find a cheap EQ compliant card there :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks guys, I think I might look into the Gforce 3D card, sounds simple enough. I gotta get back to my other comp, gonna make 51 in less than an hour I hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sadyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's the S3 card man.  I have that same chipset on my laptop.  Rocks Quake 3, but I have that same issue in EQ and have tried pretty much every possible solution.  Get a different card, problem solved.  Not an option for my laptop of course. . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, got it fixed a couple days ago. My comp's original 3D card sucked, and the GEforce 2 PCI I got wasn't compatible with my computer (despite its PCI ports) so I got an AGP, it works fine. Cept this one point in CoM, right before the temple, when I turn to the left I go link dead and get sent to desktop without any dinner. It still says I have an active character, so when it doesn't, i'm gonna make sure I didn't die and then I'm gonna log for the night.<br />
Ive died two times too many today.</div></div><hr />
