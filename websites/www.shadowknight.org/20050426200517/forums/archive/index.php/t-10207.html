<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>igun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
  After performing a weighted average on the stats, and adding 932,332,123,123 points for having a tail, I've decided Iksar SK is the way to go for me.  <br />
<br />
  However, I plan to duo with a friend, who wants to play a human cleric.  Even if we always partner/group after lvl 15 or so, will she naturally level faster than me?  Meaning, will I find myself at level 30 while she's at level 36 even though we partnered through the entire process?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The penalty isn't that noticable I partnered/grouped with an Ikky shaman most of the way up and the most I got ahead was 2.5 levels. <br />
<br />
Your exp penalty takes away from the group(I believe) so they won't level too much faster.</div></div><hr />

While I admit up front that I cannot speak with 100% assurance, I am very skeptical of the xp penalty working this way.  Logically, the idea would be to slow down the advancement of races that have inherit abilities over those who dont, not to penalize any race that groups with a race that has an xp penalty.  <br />
<br />
If that were true, I shutter to think of what the overall XP penalty would be if an IKS grouped with another IKS or TRL....<br />
<br />
I just have to believe that it is related to the individual race only.  It just cant kill the groups overall XP.<br />

<br />
If you chose to take on a race that has an exp penalty (As I have) you made that choice for yourself. I can't imagine VI making that penalty effective to all members of a group or raid.<br />
<br />
However, stranger thing have occured.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The last i know of it that the xp penalty in group was gone cause troll's and iksars sucked up all the XP. Once you go back to soloing or dies (even in group) the xp penalty kicks in.<br />
<br />
I am not entirely sure tho...been a long time i heared stuff about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaoogaa Soulhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Old system<br />
The exp penelty was take out before the group exp was divided.  This system screwed the whole group and was completely unfair.<br />
<br />
New system<br />
The exp is divided for the group and then the experience penelty is removed from that individual.  Only the individual suffers for selecting the more powerful race. <br />
<br />
Due to the harsh exp penelty given hybrids and the additional penelty give certain races experienced EQ players shunned those hybrid/race combinations.  Once people realized what was going on sony changed the way this worked so people would not have issues about getting a group.<br />
<br />
To answer your question she should get roughly 20% more exp than you not 20% more levels than you.  This may only account for 2-3 total levels by 60.  Rest assured you will not be causing your friend any undue camping because she is grouping with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remember the days of the original xp penalty.. used to be real hard to find a group of non-iksars who would take an iksar SK.   It was a good day when they changed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup I remember them too, <br />
:flashback: <br />
Shadowoal: Sk LFG<br />
<br />
Alikiran: Hey man we might need you<br />
<br />
Shadowsoal: cool where are you guys? ledge?<br />
<br />
Alikiran: umm yeah, what race are you?<br />
<br />
Shadowsoal: Iksar, why?<br />
<br />
Alikiran: oh crap sorry man we just got a warrior maybe later...<br />
<br />
had that logged =P walked over to their group they only had 5 people... but now thats all changed Lol, as an Iksar SK I have found that exp penalty really doesn't affect me much at all.... I don't notice it, and Iksar are best class for SK's ever soooo! just ignore it, wont stop you much at all</div></div><hr />
