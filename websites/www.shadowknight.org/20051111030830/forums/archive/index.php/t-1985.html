Not sure how much faction they give but I doubt its realistic to raise your faction this way heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zuuk</div><div class="date">05-26-2002, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Step one : Go to Fear plane..kill assorted demi's until you get puppet strings (charged item with a version of the spell charm)<br />
<br />
Step two : Hire a debuff team - Malo, tash, OOC, etc and bring them to OT to debuff the quest giver(reports are he is pretty MR)<br />
<br />
Step three : Use a charge of item after he is debuffed and hope charm holds long enough to give him the gems so you get your hammer !<br />
<br />
Reason this works is that you need to be amiable to do the quest, all charmed critters are amiable, but to their master only ! Thus you can't have an enchanter charm him, only brings him to indiff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thonatos</div><div class="date">05-26-2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an undead foreman standing nearby the outpost shipyards. Just give him a jade (when you are amiable to him) and he will give you the OT hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">05-26-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I dunno if you nessisarily need the debuff team. I've heard of mid-50s bards simply pullin him out and kiting him around with the Magic-resist Debuff DoT (Fufills Curtailing Chant) then charming him with thier song. I've actually been meaning to do this with my level 52 bard for a while.<br />
<br />
So I would imagine that you really don't need to drag a whole team, just one person with a decent MR Debuff, although of course with a limited charge item, you might wanna anyway just to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarnorth</div><div class="date">05-26-2002, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanx for all the help so far..still some problems though...when u port i i hear ur right under a lvlv 54 or so skele =) if your not admir or at least non kos he will attack...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manslayer</div><div class="date">05-27-2002, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually is only one skele that sometimes aggros and he is a greenie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabazios</div><div class="date">05-27-2002, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, as long as you aren't KOS to the outpost you can kill sarnak beserkers and turn in the warbraids to captain rot.  You need to turn in 4 to get faction up.  Takes a while to do this though, but eventually your faction will get to amiable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">05-27-2002, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm an iksar sk and I have good faction at the outpost.<br />
<br />
I've posted extensive replies to no less than 5 or 6 threads in history giving info on it. search function to find them if you can.<br />
<br />
Briefly,<br />
Unless you haven't done a lot of kaesora/hs/etc hunting and recieved many neg VS faction hit, AND your able to get at least 2 earth elemental illusion potions from the clay golem in old CT, I don't think it is possible anymore. 1 potion might be sufficient to get a OT hammer (old posts will explain this in more detail).<br />
<br />
I don't think the puppet strings thing works.<br />
<br />
if you are kos but with ot hammer, porting in during the night hours (8pm to 8am gametime) and you'll only draw aggro from 1 green skele easily feigned off or killed. during the day times, a wandering dragoon will likely add, seriously complicating this, and making it very risky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks can get faction at the outpost without too much trouble using the sneak trick, but sks, shams, wars, and necros are out of luck now I think.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else used teh skele form method?</div></div><hr />

Resists on charm are VERY high, and afaik debuffing the mob's MR  won't change anything.</div></div><hr />

Yes, getting an OT gate hammer IS possible for iksar.  Please read my thread and give it a shot.  :) <br />
