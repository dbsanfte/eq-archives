<br />
Are you able to cast/channel it effectively when 2 or 3 mobs are on you (splitting)?<br />
<br />
What is the fail rate?  1 in 10 perhaps?<br />
<br />
Recast time is 15 sec is that right?  How do you cope with failures?<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordeth</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As your skill increases in abjuration (skill required for FD) your fizzles decrease. With good channeling you will be able to FD with multiple mobs hitting you.<br />
<br />
Fail rate seems to vary.. 1 in 5 is probably  closer to the mark though.<br />
<br />
Yep, recast time is 15 secs... There are two things you can try and do when i fails.... 1) Run like hell 2) keep wacking away at the mob until you can try again and pray you hold up to the beating... So if things are lookin a little grim FD at around half life, should give you enough time to try again. Once you get to high level mobs though you may only get one chance. A couple of things mitigate this though. When you reach 60 if you keep both FD and Death's Peace loaded you have 2 chances... or if you are lucky enough to have Blood Ember legs you have a second chance there... Otherwise you are SoL</div></div><hr />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarshaaz Dreadbones</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FD is FD no matter what you use to pull it...only the aggro will stay as long as mob is DoTed, so in case of a mem wipe, a mob with DoT isn't mem wiped until DoT is gone...At least that is the way it works I think...<br />
Also, turn of auto-attack before casting FD, seems to work better that way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">following from the hot key thread a while back on TKW i have an FD hotkey set-up with...<br />
/sit on<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 7 (where i have FD on my gem set)<br />
...this works nicely as it stops you dead on the run preventing that annoying &quot;your spell has been interrupted message&quot; because you haven't been still long enough, switches off auto attack automatically as a by-product too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utterance Unholy</div><div class="date">03-28-2002, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like that idea to stop movement. <br />
<br />
That's very clever and I will use it.<br />
<br />
In fact any hotkeyed spell, that would make sense, if it didn't slow down the casting. It doesn't does it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakvar Shadowstalker</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be wrong but it seems like mobs hit me much easier and for more damage when I'm sitting.  Often in a FD situation you need all the HPs you can get.<br />
<br />
Any time I am running and need to cast I always turn.  Changing from a forward direction to a turn will avoid interruptions.<br />
<br />
I still have a smile on my face from the other day in perma when I had 4+ Icegiants on me and I got a FD off with less than 50 HPs.  Thing that made it hard to cast was the fact that they kept stunning me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghob Owar</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea on the sit/stopping!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not turning attack off has caused me more problems with FD then anything else.<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/cast 8<br />
<br />
 Now if I would just remember to use this hotkey more often, DOH!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">googaba da troll</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could be wrong but it seems like mobs hit me much easier and for more damage when I'm sitting.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They do.  Mobs will hit you for max damage 99% of the time while sitting with less than a 1% chance to miss you.  Using /sit on /sit off in this manner probaly wont make much off a difference anyway because you will do it so quick, they'll probaly not notice.  personaly, if running, I use a trick a gm taught me:  Stop, turn, (just a tap on the --&gt; key will do) cast.  Gives the client time to know you stopped in case of lag.  Also having BE pants is a good idea if you are puller.  If FD fails you can stand up and click, long cast time, but beats standing there waiting for FD to cycle thru.  Now I have both DP and FD up if I am pulling in a dangerous area in case one fails.<br />
<br />
Currently, I am more worried about the FD bug where you dont get a failure message and everything seems fine for a few secs, then you all of a sudden get rampaged or beat to death while on a sucessfull (attack off, no DS, nothing dotted, no lag) FD.<br />
<br />
Also the Complete Heal kills you bug.  It happened to me and a few others.  I get CH message ....you have been healed for 3982 points of damage...health bar is full red...you have been slain by mob that hit you for 5 points of damage.... LOADING, Please Wait.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember that if you have any number of casters on you do NOT cast FD if you see &quot;Mob_kicking_your_butt_01 begins to cast a spell&quot;  or it won't help you.  The spell may succeed, but after you FD the spell will land and they will re-agro on you.<br />
If you see the above after you have started to cast it, hit &quot;D&quot; to duck an interupt.<br />
<br />
You heal and regain mana as if standing also.  This was a big pain for me 2 weeks ago.  I had 3 caster mobs (necro, cleric and an invoker) on me in Dalnir.  I barely got off my FD (i was praying) and had 6 HPs when I hit the floor.  Due to a pathing bug the Invoker got stuck in the doorway and stopped right next to me instead of going around the corner.  Took me 30 minutes before I had enough mana or HPs to back off and FD again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing to note:<br />
Once you get Hide at 35 you can try to &quot;ctrl+s&quot; and immediately hit your Hide hotkey.  keep your mob targeted and then hit &quot;C&quot;.  If indifferent, sit and med.  It doesn't matter how close the mob is either.  I had a mob standing on my head and I did this successfully.  There is a &quot;lag&quot; between it registering you alive, but it is very short.<br />
<br />
What I don't know is if you can hit the hide hotkey while still FDed.  I haven't been willing to try this yet as I am normally pretty desperate and low on health when I try the method I do use.  I have been 80% successful on the &quot;ctrl+s&quot;/hide method so far and no deaths. *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on the sitting thing you just bounce basically so i've never been too comcerned with picking up damage from it<br />
i used to do the turn but find the &quot;sit-bounce&quot; quicker because of that lag you get where the game is thinking &quot;hmm ok guess you've stopped moving...well now...ok i suppose you can cast a spell&quot; <br />
at least that's what the lag always seems like to me heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viconia deVir</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can click hide while FDed, I've found this to be especially useful if someone is near you and can confirm that you are hidden or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracsoul</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, recast time is 15 secs... There are two things you can try and do when i fails.... 1) Run like hell <br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, best thing I have ever been told =)  hell running in circles helps some times!!!!   <br />
<br />
Also make shure you turn OFF attack, I hav e ahot key set up, make one it will save ya a ton as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaeluur</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was having fun in runnyeye with my favorite cleric a bunch of levels ago, and i tried the hide trick.  works good, of the mobs cant see through hide that is...i remember hide never working in cazic but invis would..<br />
<br />
<br />
my favorite fd / hide thing was when i was at a corner in a hall...i fd'd hide, then stand and was able to strafe (broke hide) around the corner before the mob aggroed again.<br />
<br />
so can we call this the poor mans CoS?<br />
(i dont have one so i can talk about them all i want :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Okami</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coterie mask adds another FD for a total of 4 for sk's.<br />
ALthough it is nerfed now to be charges, it still comes in handy.</div></div><hr />
