I suppose I'll have to keep a closer watch on my HP and have the shammy not heal me so I can tell if it's going off on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vanian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the reason that the epic/greenmist procs are taking 30pts of health as opposed to 50pts is that the game is viewing it as pvp and therefore applying pvp spell damage reduction to the dot, so I guess things could be worse. Hopefully they'll fix this soon, I don't like my weapons kicking my own ass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">its not that its doing less damage than usual as per a pvp bug, its that when the procc goes off it does full damage (50 for epic/30 for greenmist) to the mob, AND it does that amount to you instead of healing you. <br />
<br />
so instead of 50dam to the mob, and 50 health to you, its 50dam to the mob 50dam to you. kinda poopy when most mobs have 10 times the health as you=).<br />
<br />
<br />
and if you want to test it working, go to a newbie zone and make it procc...spear the mob dead, and watch the effect eat your health when no monsters are around to hurt you.<br />
<br />
and i'm left without a weapon for a while hehe. i still use it, but its kinda crappy that in a PoP fight, my looooong quested, pinical of iksar quests, semi epic sword, eats a 300+hp a fight. hell if i didn't stack regen when i fought life would be poopy=)<br />

&quot;My SK epic has been broken for 12 days now and I have no suitable weapon to use.  At this point this is unacceptable.

I was using a soulbinder to get my 2hb skill up and it was definately taking health away from me.(/cheer the magical patch that gave us the dot message but fubar'd our weapons)  I was curious if anyone with a Blindfoe was experiencing the same problems as the IC/GR, anyone want to test it out and let us know? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I see a lot of are saying you spoke to a GM, are you sure it was the actual GM?  If you use the /petition feature in-game then you're talking to a &lt;b&gt;Guide&lt;/b&gt;, not a GM.  Guides get the scoop on information and have access to technical and bug boards so they can see the current issues and respond accordingly; but they are not GM's.  A &quot;GM&quot; is an Everquest CSR (people working for and paid by S.O.E.).  You used to see GM's around much more often, but now you're lucky to see them on for a few hours a day.<br />
<br />
I am not saying your petitions don't get taken care of, however.  When you /petition a Guide will read it, then contact you regarding the issue.  Guides have rules they must abide by (a very big binder full of them) and procedures to follow.  For matters concerning a NPC, item, or zone bug the Guide will escalate the issue for a GM to look at &lt;i&gt;when the GM is next online&lt;/i&gt;.  When a GM reviews the bug petition they will either contact you via email (if your email under registration is still correct), contact you in game, or hand the bug issue to the developers.  In every case they'll delete the petition.<br />
<br />
The /bug command sends your information directly to the developers.  Their emails to you are not canned, and they are telling you the fastest way to get the issue resolved.  Whoever said that &quot;It's not on the top priority list&quot; should be kicked in the pants as improving the gameplay is #1 priority.  I do not have an IC yet, so I personally can not /bug for it but everyone here that has one &lt;b&gt;needs to log a /bug for it&lt;/b&gt; if you want to see it fixed.  Think of EQCS as a mob...you have to get high on their agro list.  :D<br />
<br />
--Oh, don't ask me how I know these things...ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.</div></div><hr />

Please tell me you're kidding... Please please please tell me that some fuckwit didn't tell you that animations are more important to them than fixing a major issue with the rewards from extremely long and often irritating quests.  You know, I'm not a violent man by nature, but I'd strangle that piece of shit and grin the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">No DrMobius,<br />
<br />
I sent my petition's sent my /bugs  then i said fuck it,  and sent the gm a tell and he responded!!!   Not a Guide heh,  OUR GM on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Vinnayeny,<br />
<br />
If you send a Guide a tell they'll respond as well.  Its good to hear that the GM responded to you, but the process they have to go through remains the same.  If you petition, send a tell to a guide, or send a tell to the GM (who, by the way, can not be located with the /w all gm command.../w all gm only displays guides) your issue will all be handled the same way.  Whoever takes the petition or receives the tell will first determine whether the problem is a known issue (known meaning development already knows about it and is &lt;i&gt;planning&lt;/i&gt; go fix it &lt;i&gt;sometime&lt;/i&gt; soon) or a new issue.  For known issues, like Innoruuk's Curse, they would apologize for the inconvenience and post it on a bug board for the developers to look at.  If you were to just use /bug in the game it would go directly to the developers, which would save you having to be weeded out by the Guide's or GM's discretion.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, contacting a GM or Guide directly is not the best way to go about complaining or reporting anything in game.  The reason is all the petitions are tracked and recorded, tells are not.  For the most part, if you contact a Guide or GM directly they'll ask you to petition with the issue so there can be trail of information.  Another issue you may run in to by sending the GM's or Guides tells directly is they may tell you, &quot;Yeah, I'll be sure to let the developers know of your problems&quot; and then not contact the developers at the end of their shift because there wasn't a petition to remind them.<br />
<br />
As I said, using the /bug command is the &lt;b&gt;best&lt;/b&gt; and most sure fire way to get any issues of game mechanics or physics taken care of.</div></div><hr />

But i was wondering if anyone else has had a problem with the spell Drain Soul. I<br />
<br />
 was fighting in the arena the other night and I (forgive me Inny) let a warrior get the upper hand on me. So i promptly doused him down with festering darkness and kited him around tapping his HP using Drain soul. BUT on any cast that I shadowstepped outside the centre area of the arena and cast (it was lake rathe arena if you have been there you will know where i mean). The message on it changed to &quot;Fedarov groan's and grow's weaker&quot; and seemed to take about 10 % hp (350ish hps) off me.<br />
<br />
I have not had a chance to check this elsewhere but beeing in a pissy mood ever since the epic got broken i /petitioned then /buged and then / feedbacked (this one got a little sarcastic and fruity to say the least)<br />

If anyone else has had similer problems i would be keen to know <br />

Odds are it will be broken on test with the next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>auurie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">DAMN, i quit eq a month ago and that shit still isn't fixed?? <br />
Wait a minute... why do I find that to be suprising?<br />
Good Luck on getting your epic back all... I had just gotten mine about a month before i quit and it started acting like that about a week before i quit... supreme disapointment.  It made it alot easier to delete my toon... /shrug.. again, good luck on getting you epics back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ueuelr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I'm glad I'm not using my epic anymore, except for show when walking around. As far as GM's go, they are still there I was lucky enough to talk to one the other day regarding a small surname issue. I wish I knew about the Epic issue, I would have passed it along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>DrMobius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">A little bird told me there's a pretty big update tonight, lots of things fixed...but nothing regarding IC or Greenmist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">SK epic IS working correcty when I logged on, now it is giving me back life and IS a blue icon in buff window that you can click off at your will. I assume this is the same for greenmist, WOOHOO very nice to see its finally working correctly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Gopx101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">The epic is still not fixed after yesterdays patch like it was supposed to be.  I spoke with what I think was a GM and he said <br />
1.  He cannot give me a replacement weapon &quot;Yet&quot;<br />
2.  He's not sure when this will be fixed.<br />

I sure hope cak is right and gopx is wrong..  This bitch better be working, i just dont think i can wait any longer *sniffles*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">lol they just changed the proc so it wouldnt damage you, how fuckin lame.  i gave up bought something else and banked greenmist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Jabanrny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">As of last night (7/11) Greenmist seems to be working properly, with one major difference.... the proc effect now shows up as a beneficial buff (blue icon, can click it off, etc) and can no longer overwrite your existing buffs.  I only noticed it by accident, but then ran around smacking things without any buffs on to verify....<br />
