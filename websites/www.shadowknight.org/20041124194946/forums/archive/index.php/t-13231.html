<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been thinking since I started Zaith that our HT really loses alot of its umpf as we gain seasons. Im 35 at the moment and 350 hit points makes a diffrence on occasion, but not a make or break situation, compared to say, LoH. <br />
<br />
LoH is a complete heal from lvl 1. <br />
HT is based, far as I can tell, level*10+1. <br />
<br />
Now, is this balanced in each of your opinions? Should they maybe change the math to level*20+1? I think it would make more sense. It wouldnt make our HT over kill either. <br />
<br />
Also, having our HT do less in PvP is kinda stupid. I HT for 351, but I duled a paladin today and HTed him for 280. I lost 71 damage from my HT. Of course, I dont know if his LoH healed him full, he used it but he didnt go back to 100%. Maybe they did change thier LoH for PvP as well..<br />
<br />
Anyway, Im more concerned about our HT in a battle vs MOBs. Shouldnt it do more damage? I mean, my HT hasnt killed anything straight up that gave me experiance since about level 6. I know for sure not at 10 and damn sure not now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We get AAs that can boost Harm Touch to 8k damage assuming max AAs and certain focuses/songs/buffs.<br />
<br />
I doubt we can expect much more. <br />
<br />
 I mean, my HT hasnt killed anything straight up that gave me experiance since about level 6. I know for sure not at 10 and damn sure not now.<br />
<br />
And your point is? The Skill is called Harmtouch, not Deathtouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LoH is not a complete heal until you buy the Class ability that makes it so.<br />
<br />
You will be lucky to heal 2 bub on a lvl 60+ tank with the regular LoH. Its like a buffed up Supernal Light with no cast time. Useful, but hardly that powerful.<br />
<br />
Regardless, yes, HT sucks if you compare to LoH until you gain the ability to turn it into a 7200hp unresistible nuke. At this point HT becomes pretty solid. Dont expect anything else, this is the fix to HT we were looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Instead of comparing abilities, compare the class as a whole, cause the class as a whole is what counts.<br />
<br />
And at lvl 35 sk and pal are pretty much equal, both have crapy spells. Paly has crapy heals and buffs, sk has crapy nukes/dots, and a crapy pet.  Both have same skils.<br />
<br />
So since both classes are equal there is no need to compare HT to LoH at lvl 35.</div></div><hr />

Ironically, there's a  thread  (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=424.topic) on the Paladin boards discussing how overpowering Harm Touch is. *shrug*  <br />
<br />
First of all this quote has nothign to do with the original question of the thread.<br />
<br />
Secondly, who listens to fucking jelous morons and newbs?<br />
<br />
Lets see here, we pay 30AA for our imp HT.<br />
<br />
Paladins pay 6 AA for CH LoH (which is still kinda bugged cause it heals for 10k like the old CH, instead of 7.5k like the new ch)<br />
<br />
So to make our HT usefull, and in some ways simular in power, with the &quot;bugged&quot; LoH we pay 5X exp.<br />
<br />
So basicly like i said who listens to retarded newbs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Erasmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*laugh* You learn to keep your mouth shut around here.  So let me clarify...<br />
<br />
I agree completely that the abilities are out of syncrenicity. If the two abilities are conceived of being on the same footing, the AA costs to perfect the abilties should be on par. So, I guess the question becomes do the abilities have a 1=1 equation?<br />
<br />
It seems the developers felt that giving a tanking class an 8K DD was qualitatively different than giving a tank class a complete heal (is loh capped at 7.5 K like the spell? Not that it matters for most of us). I suppose I quoted that thread, because it illustrates that perception of imbalance (though it is in aimed at PvP sitautions). <br />
<br />
I'm not entirely convinced this is incorrect. It seems to me that for a tank class being able to do this kind of damage to a mob can make far more impact on game play than a healing spell and, as such, the maxed out ht should not be available easily (for instance, ht provides an instant kill of a mob; with loh the fight will still rage on). Beats me, that at least seems to be the rationale behind it.  And, I'm not completely convinced by it. The cost still seems a bit out of wack but I can at least appreciate the rationale. I don't really look at it as being a grevious imbalance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um yeah, a insta cast LoH that saves a raid by healing MT when ch chain messes up, is not nearly as powerfull as a nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think The Quon said it best when he described Pallys and their gay LoH.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Self proclaimed &quot;Holy Warriors&quot; of EQ. First off, these 2nd class meat shields have the sweetest scam in the whole game short of the whole &quot;Rez in my pocket&quot; thing. Lay Hands is mad brilliant. &quot;Hey, get your hands off my tits!&quot; &quot;Awww girl, I've gotta touch ya to heal ya.&quot; <br />
The problems start when they do that shit to everyone. Male, Female, Ranger, whatever. For that reason, if there was a big ass shower in EQ and we all had to clean off after fights like it was gym class and shit, The Quon sure as hell would have his soap on a motha phuckin rope around The Paladin. It's all Truth, Honor, Integrity and shit until some young half elf exposes the Brown Eye, then its like a prison movie. Don't be all like &quot;But The Quon, I'm really not gay, you're just looking a little under the weather, let me rub it better...&quot; I swear to god if you ever inspect my equip, I'm gonna light your shit up, Yo. Oh, and if the shiat really hits the proverbial fan and The Quon looks like he may die, don't even THINK about Lay On Hands for The Quon. You'll just get a fist full of Divine Aura to grind up on.<br />
<br />
The Quon's healing strategy for Paladins: The Quon keeps these phucks alive, he just does it from a distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZaithFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats fine for the high end game. Yay for you guys, but Im talking about midlevels. <br />
<br />
I was fighting a 40 paladin the other day, got him down to a single bubble of life, I HT and almost kill him. Dude hits his LoH and he is back up to almost full health, 80% of his health. <br />
<br />
Why should thier LoH almost completly heal them and my HT doesnt even kill them when they have a single bubble of life? <br />
<br />
Point is, in a dueling situation a paladin can just wear your mana down, then you gotta head in to talk em to death. You come within a inch of killin em, LoH and you gotta kill em again. But if you HT em, you wont do more than a bubble of damage at best..</div></div><hr />

Time your HT better next time :D<br />

And anyways everquest is not a PvP game, its not even remotly close to being balanced PvP wise, and it never will be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont expect anything else, this is the fix to HT we were looking for.  <br />
<br />
I disagree. Is this REALLY the fix we wanted, or just a fix? I choose the latter of the two. I still think the timer AA should be moved to lvl 59 ( in line with AM for rangers ) and the damage adjustment AAs spread over levels. I cannot blast off but about a third of a bub of health using UA + HT at lvl 60 on lb / db con mobs OUTSIDE of the planes zones. Getting AAs to pump-up HT for a potential crit of 8k at lvl 65 isn't really a fix. So what? With all AAs, you MAYBE nuke a bub off of XP mobs in the planes? Raids you say? Raid targets in the planes, for lvl 65s, have *just* a bit more than 8k HP...just a tad.<br />
<br />
So basically, our HT becomes nice at 65, and is almost useless in serious situations. Hey! Its great for aggro. =/<br />
<br />
I think the improvements, timer &amp; damage wise, should be spread out amoung the levels a bit more.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Please post what expriance you have to comment on such matters, cause your statement has no validity with out proof.<br />
<br />
The statment does show a compelete lack of understanding of the SK class, the end game, and the game in general.<br />
<br />
HT is usless before AAs are trained, but so is loh, HT is NOT USELESS when u can do 8k+ instant unresistable damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bakatengu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I disagree that HT and LoH are useless before AA's, but I know for sure HT certainly becomes alot less usefull after the 30's. LoH is much much more powerful. Thats ok, Pallys need it. LoH just means that you almost have to dish out enough damage to kill a pally 3 times, (heals, loh, and hp). This lets them survive situations that would make a Warrior bend over and grab his ankles. Sk's have FD and other means of surviving bad situations, so let the little lighties get touchy feely. I see more pally's lfg than I see SK's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">First off, it is NOT unresistable - play SK, and put away your druid to find out. Secondly, useless in serious situation equates to its not gonna save your raid's ass. LoH is an uninterruptable CH, for the most part. CH chain missed, LoH can save the day. 'A Construct of Nightmares ' has ~400k HP...8k is 2% of that. And that's not the raid targets a 65 with a ton of AAs should be hitting if in a decent guild. A ranger hitting for 1k+ damage on %30 of hit shows with EQ &amp; bow haste with ONLY AM1 produces so much more damage over time than the instant HT. And that's not with true shot. And that's only if you crit do you hit 8k.<br />
<br />
Low melee DPS and a one time 8k blast vs 30% of attacks at 1k or more....hmmm...lets see...I think I'll let you figure out who is under powered. And don't even mention the aggro management - I can hold aggro better than any warrior I met, but when you fight the likes of Grummus, etc, you want a warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
So maybe 'useless' was the wrong word, as we can run off and kill old world targets easy, but increasing our HT damage, or asking for better will definitely NOT overpower us, and is not something to say we do not need. We do need more balance. Do we have more balance than before? Yes. Are we balanced? Hell no. The fact is that HT, the way it is now, is a nice flash or afterthought, which is never a critical or as sought after as say a ranger with AM3. And HT with discp etc is still on a long ass timer.<br />
<br />
Please play an SK before stating someone does not understand it - not as an alt to your druid, but as a main character. You probably still think you outdamage a ranger in melee bc your 2hs hits for 200 and their 1hs hits for 40-60 don't you? Did you ever figure out how much they do in a round of combat versus you, ya know, add all of their hits up and compare to your own? Of course you haven't...also, at least get your SK to the planes before talking about the high end game. Your ignorance is something you can correct - I do have hope for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Improved HT is unresistible, there is no resist check whatsoever on this HT. UT3 HT is a garanteed blast for 7200hp (w/o focus).<br />
<br />
Please, try again when you know what you're talking about~<br />
<br />
To compare our damage output with the rangers is silly. We are a tank class. Being SKs our roles are to tank, pull and deal damage. The rangers only have dealing damage for them (they can tank and pull to some extent, but they are far from possessing the tools we have). Its totally normal for them to have a greater damage output than we have. For being a tank class, we dish out a hell of a lot of damage if you compare with warriors and paladins, nothing to complain there.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, typically, the xp mobs in the tier 2-3 planes (and even most elemental plane mobs) have 20khp. UT3 HT is a very noticiable blast on such mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">TheDarkness, listen up moron ill only say this one time.<br />
<br />
Max ht with out focus: 7200 damage<br />
Average elemental planes fight length, less than 5 mins (300seconds)<br />
<br />
7200/5*60=24 DPS<br />
<br />
Keep in mind with a decent focus and bard song, and on a normal fight that lasts less than 5 mins that number goes up up up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Funny....get a LOT different reports from 65 SKs in game. That, and the unresistable bit coming from the same folks report UA gives an auto crit...my lord...McFly! We need a clue here!<br />
BTW...please tell me what servers you are on...I know NOW why ppl think SKs are all dumbass gimps - fucking idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey genius, its not UA (unholy aura) that give an auto crit, its UT (unholy touch). Slight difference there.<br />
<br />
All UA does it to increase the base damage of HT by 50%. Are you even lvl 55? To not even know that is shocking.<br />
<br />
Regular HT is done on a -200MR check<br />
Regular disc'ed HT is done on a -200DR check<br />
Improved HT has no resist check, be it disc'ed or not.<br />
<br />
You obviously never experimented first hand what you are arguing about. Get a freaking clue, most of us have been using Unholy Touch HT's for over 6 month.<br />
<br />
Are the so called lvl 65 SKs you ask in game even using UT HT? For saying its resistable, they obviously dont have this ability trained.</div></div><hr />

It is so clear why the perception of SKs is soooo low across so many servers. &quot;Thanks&quot; for the rep you have provided SKs; the damage you have done is almost unrecoverable.<br />

Ignorance can be cured, but stupidity is inbreed. I will cure my ignorance ( that being I thought this might be a place with ppl having IQs high enough to sneeze...some have proven that to not be the case ) and avoid these pointless banters, while just facing it...the SK class will never experience players uniting to make it better, bc a lot of the players are, well, dumb.</div></div><hr />
