<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>robertelee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail sirs, im a level 50 SK that has soloed all the way up. Im starting to do dungeons and other types of group leveling that require me to be puller ( which im not fond of , but im a SK nonetheless and thats what my duty is .) I was wondeirng if any veterns could pass along some FD pulling tips that would assist me in groups. Example, I pull 2 mobs.. FD, but then im not really sure when to stand up or when to tell someone to tag one... Sorry if this seems stupid but i'm just sort of lost on this subject =/ Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have a look at the guides on Monkly Business, some really great advice there, though SK pulling is a little different.  Some general advice would be:<br />
<br />
If by dungeon you mean LDoN, don't FD pull if you can avoid it, it's too slow.  Get the cleric / chanter (or at your level paladin / necro) to lull instead.<br />
<br />
Keep your group at least one room behind you, so you have space to FD split without aggroing them.<br />
<br />
If you're concerned about maybe pulling more than the group can handle, always stop a little way off from them and turn to check.  If there's too many, try to FD and if that doesn't work, die.  If you do get a successful FD close to your group, wait till one or two mobs are left with the others well away, and call for tag.<br />
<br />
Pull roamers first.  Wait till they path close to you, preferably where they'll pull single.  Roamer aggro doesn't usually clear when you FD so if one aggroes you then wanders away you'll usually have to wait for the &quot;enemies have forgotten you&quot; message before standing up. <br />
<br />
For easy mobs, snare the mob you want to pull (dooming darkness at your level), then feign when they're close enough and wait till the other mobs go back to their spawn points before standing up.<br />
<br />
For tough ones, arrow pull then feign once they've run out of aggro range of their spawn points but before they get to you, then wait for all but one or two to reset on their spawn points.  Arrow pull means you don't have to wait for spell recast time before feigning, and gives you a much better chance of feigning before they reach you and start hitting on you to interrupt your FD cast.<br />
<br />
Try not to use FD splitting on multiple casters.  If you have one caster to split, pull a non-caster mob then immediately run round a corner, wait for the spell (if it cast one) to hit you then feign.  With luck the caster will still be out of sight of you so it won't be able to break your FD.<br />
<br />
Bit wordy but I hope it helps :)</div></div><hr />

Attack/Pet Back, voila, single</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Several threads about this already, one as recent as a couple weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure how pet pulling would work at level 50 with no pet discipline, the level 49 SK pet and the average just-learning-the-class level 50 healer?<br />
<br />
Never tried it at that level myself but I guess it's worth a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you don't &quot;need&quot; pet discipline just spam pet follow me once then spam pet back off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2nd trick for FD pulling is to use snare, which can be used in a couple different ways.<br />
<br />
If you've got 2 mobs to split, get in snare range and cast darkness on one.  If it sticks, the 2nd mob will get to you faster so when it gets close you FD to stop the 1st from coming too, and have the group tag the nearby one.<br />
<br />
If there are more than 2 mobs to split, snare your target like before then FD when the fast ones get half-way.  The faster mobs will both get to you faster AND get to home base faster - so stand up again and slowly reel in the snared one like a fish.  It'll take you 3-4 cycles for a clean pull and takes more room to work in, but it's fun =)<br />
<br />
Final point is that even roaming mobs will forget about you if you stay FD for about 120 seconds, you'll see a message about how your enemies forgot about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dakkin covered it really well.<br />
<br />
Stand up when they get back to their spawn point if they are a static mob.  Wanderers don't usually forget you, and will come running unless you wait for the &quot;Your enemies have forgotten you&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Little more on tagging:  Once the mobs turn and start walking back to the spawn point, you can call for a tag.  This means someone else hits the mob with a ranged attack.  Done correctly, this will only bring the mob hit, and the other will return to it's spawn point.  This is ideal done with another PC that can also FD in case more than one comes.  Stand up when the second returns or has forgotten you.<br />
<br />
As others have mentioned, don't do this in ldon.  It takes way too much time and you'll end up failing normals.  CC the mobs with mez, root, off-tank, or snare kite.  And kill kill kill.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was in an ldon saturday..  i was pulling and MT'ing..  <br />
It dawned on me &quot;fek this.. sic em bones!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the first time i had ever used bones to pull and it worked like a charm. Only a couple times did my lil buddy not come back, but it sure as hell beat pulling 4 mobs... :-)</div></div><hr />
