<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beyr</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need some ideas on how to take down a 65 bard as a 63 SK. We know eachother, and were just goofing around but some of my other friends put money on me. I can get my MR to ~140 with items, and 170 with the resist tap that I just got, problem is the resist cap doesnt last very long at all, and doesnt work in PvP so I have to tag a mob with it in the middle of a fight (not a big deal). Is magic resist the only thing I need worry about? If I can resist the slows, mez and mana tap I don't see him winning. If I can land a clinging thatll overwrite selos until he renews it, but if hes twisting then thats like 18 seconds I have to hammer him down.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
only way i can beat a bard is to sit on my horse and chain touch of inno (volatis resists even on non uber bards), then ht when im oom, and even that wont kill some of them... no point even trying to chase someone who can outrun even your horse and has better manuverability</div></div><hr />

Everyone gives them a high reputation, one day I dueled a 65 bard (who was very confident) it is true that my gear is much better and my AAs are like 100 more.. but she didnt even &quot;touch&quot; me. If they have few HP they die fast and yes you can kill them.<br />
<br />
 I started with BoH, then Spear+ToI, pet was on her already she was running around like an idiot. ToV, then ToI.. her HP dropped really fast I couldnt believe it, she died in ~30 seconds. I have to admit that her HP sucked, like around 3k unbuffed but it proves that you can kill them.<br />
<br />
 I think she also lacked the skill too, which you have to consider that not all bards know what they doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ophis</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how to take down a bard?<br />
<br />
thats a good question. i totally agree to Brael who said the only way to take down a bard (when the bard is skilled in pvp, when hes not, its a cake normally) is to bring him down with touch of innu to 50% hp and then have the luck to get him in DT range, which is a great problem, cause bards have much better maneuverability and can outrun the sk horse easy. u also need alot hp cause when the bard is not dumb, he ll dot u hard and run away and u cant even get a lifetap from him. on the other hand u need svm 200+ unbuffed to resist his stuns, means it ll dont work when he lowers ur resists with a song. when u are stunned u need to have the luck that the bard misses the recast point u can mostly get away with shadow step.<br />
<br />
so my tactic against a bard is: sit on horse (cause of regen), stand with horse on a hill (cause of shadow step), click touch of innu like mad (all other spells are a waste of mana), watch the hp bar of the bard, when its down to 50% try to chase him and have the luck to DT.<br />
<br />
all other tactics can work, but this one is the most effectiv to kill a bard, but must not work if u have a bard against u that is hardned in pvp. try to kill agrul, volaki, kanni or dirmainian on SZ and u ll notice that bards are nearly unkillable. ever tried to target a bard with AoN and shrink running around u in circles?<br />

<br />
 If not, the best way to kill a bard is to choose your battleground carefully so they have limited space to run, and then invite about 100 people to come and watch and pray the lag screws up their twisting.<br />
<br />
 Getting people to spam them with tells and &quot;good luck mate&quot; also helps to put them off.<br />

 duelling: theres more to it than casting and hitting.</div></div><hr />

From then try and lure him into a small area like say in pvp i try to lure bards into the white building by gy in there he has less room to run chain TOI+zbite+TOV hope you get him to 60% before he drains all your mana and then run at him on horse and hit ht...dead bard, beware of DA song though...</div></div><hr />

You need to use the environment to your advantage by either fighting in a cramped space or near water.<br />
<br />
One time for example I killed one in everfrost, he was on me when I was in the middle of nowhere, I did not feel like running to the pok book or port to another ldon camp and I wanted to fight but he had those 3 annoying dots on me for quite a dent per tick in my HP, and he was draining my mana... so what I did was run towards the gap in the ice and dive in. At first he dived in too but since I was hacking on him pretty hard under water and he could not run away there he jumped out again and selo'ed up (I was OOM from his drain at that time or he would have been dead). So I used pact of hate to med up. When he got close I jumped out and bashed to interrupt his song a few times, casted and if he was still above 50% I dived back in. This went on for a long time. Since I did not have ToI yet I needed to make sure his resist song (psalm of veeshan) was down before I hit him with a spell. This went on for a while (the moment I jumped out he ran away every time of course) till I was FM. At some point I jumped out and bashed right in time (I think his resist song was just fading), gave him see invis with my bracer of the hidden (so his first slot was full) and cast darkness on him (it landed in one of his last slots so he could not dispel it easily), then a volatis + spear (even that landed now) and some more melee and he was at 30% then HT and dead bard, I don't think I even would have needed DT in this case but I just did not want him to get away. It was pretty cool after like battling him for over 30 minutes to still win, as bards are usually more destructive the longer the fight lasts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be offensive, as neferti said the longer fights go with bards they are more likely to win, you must drop them in a very short amount of time or they will beat you if they are good at PVP.<br />
<br />
Neferti fights different from most people, because she had an old PVP ENC that she really wanted to be good at PVPing on, and she was because she learned little tricks to squeeze out every advantage, you must do this as a PVP ENC, as you can see in her post her little tricks worked, and they will work, you must know these little tricks in order to throw the bard off his track and confuse him/her.  Otherwise unless you are indoors you have to be lucky or they have to be stupid for you to win.<br />

I am surprised nobody in this thread has mentioned shadowstep as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razs Meows</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 65 bard and currently have only 1 loss in PvP (I don't PvP often though, so /mneh)... and that loss was at 47 against a 58 BST heh<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways<br />
<br />
Key to killing a bard is speed.  If you don't take us down fast yer toast.  Also, if they have ancient mezz it'll go something like this:<br />
<br />
Mezz (unresistable, but really rare)<br />
Mana drain (Commonish song, unresistable)<br />
Slow (resistable, but since we're mana draining we can spare resists).<br />
Reason not chain mezz-manadraining is that they are some of the few songs with recast times.<br />
 Once that's done, yer finished via chants and HoS, and maybe even snare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if they don't have ancient mezz, it'll be more akin to PoV / Regen / Mana drain, Regen being swapped for maybe OoS or something.  Your only chances would be:<br />
A ) Try to spear him before he gets up PoV, if he's not bright and starts a duel with it down.<br />
B ) Use any unresistable or hard to resist damage spell you can.<br />
<br />
Then hope you get him further then he gets you and HT him...  And pray HT lands  :p <br />
<br />
Otherwise bard might chant you to death, DS you to death, or might do a crazy melee dance to death*<br />
<br />
*Crazy melee dance is a strategy I devised, and while it only has a 50% success rate (It works exceedingly well on some but not on others) it can be devestating.  Basically involves a lot of backwards running and turning around.  Can't give out my secret ;) <br />
<br />
Anyways, my duel song line up goes like this:<br />
<br />
Mez (not ancient, /bah)<br />
Mana drain<br />
2 DoTs (I find 2 is the most I ever use, often swap 1 out with RoT, dispell, other misc. songs I need)<br />
PoV<br />
DA (really annoys certain classes, sometimes I swap it out with slow)<br />
Wind of Marr (regen, non-ae)<br />
Selo's<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest fear for duelling classes are wizzies, sk's, and necro's.  Those 3 can waste me if I make the slightest mistake, and wizzies can MB = required DA.<br />
<br />
P.S.  3k hp isn't bad for a bard.  I only have 3200ish unbuffed and I am told I have good equipment.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />

With that said Dont use a lich line to stop MEZZ they will see the skelly form and right way Know I DEBUFF till skelly comes off. Use DIEASE CLOUD on your self 1DMG/tick ANIT gonna hurt and it last 6mins :() Depending on clicks you have it should be 7,9or11 in your buff Slot. Second MAKE The BARD twist defensivly IE Get instant click nullify magic line items form Potion Vendors Forcing them not to have Twist Selo's to avoid or Not use it either way it works to your advantage. Then KEEP your DPS HIGH if you have horse Dont Show it till you have them in HT range Then hop on it cancle magic AND BLAME DEAD BARD :P.<br />
<br />
 Bards honestly are just the person that gets to eat IHT when im dueling in the arena.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if most bards would do that though.<br />
<br />
Also, if you just keep debuffing I'll just keep playing PoV and selo's til ya stop.  Eventually you'll stop or give up, and then I will begin my offensive twist.<br />
<br />
Don't depend on HT.  I have resisted it 2 / 3 times (with PoV) and the third time he had max HT aa's :p.  Might've had something to do with them being lower though /shrug ;) <br />
<br />
A perfectly played bard, no matter what, is unstoppable.  However, no one is a perfectly played bard.  GOOD bards are out there; and you MIGHT be able to beat them if they mess up.  So just hope they mess up :cool: .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested that with a druid and my enchanter in the Kunark era, so it has worked like that for a long time and possibly since the beginning of EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, if I find they are breaking mezz I load up dispell really quick and play it 8 times (takes 2 buffs off / shot, 2 x 8 = 16). I don't know if most bards would do that though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone on a PvP server has at least 2 instaclickers, so no buffs will be stripped that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't depend on HT. I have resisted it 2 / 3 times (with PoV) and the third time he had max HT aa's . Might've had something to do with them being lower though /shrug <br />
<br />
<br />
While there are some resist rollover bugs I am not aware that an ability which is flagged unresistable can ever be resisted, because it completely skips the check. So either this was another bug or (more likely) it was not a disced UT super HT. Regular HT can be resisted quite easily with high MR.<br />
<br />
Tuyen's Chant of Venom, Tuyen's Chant of Ice and Tuyen's Chant of the Plague stacked are an annoying drain of HP when they land, bard manadrain is their nastiest ability imo (I don't understand why it does not take some of the bard's manapool also to 'cast' it).</div></div><hr />
