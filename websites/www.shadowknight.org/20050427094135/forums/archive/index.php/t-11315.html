<br />
Ok for those of you completely new to the game I would advice you start on blue walk around though the zone learn where you can and cant hunt then move to PvP if that is the path you wish to go.. I have found that I am more aware of whats in most zones that most PvPers(not all) do not because I started out on blue..<br />
<br />
just my opinion...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally feel that playing on a PvP server since I've started has given me more knowledge of zones than if I had started blue.<br />
<br />
 I poke and prod every zone I've ever entered looking for safe resting areas and out of the way unused spawns or looking for the poor unsuspecting soloer/group to kill. If I had started on a blue server I probably would have just stuck to the main xp nipples and wouldnt have bothered looking around as much.<br />
<br />
 I do however find myself lacking in knowledge in most of the PoP zones because of the uber guilds and 3 team zergs claiming and protecting them vigilantly. The dark team on VZ has been at a major disadvantage for getting to know zones as they have generally been held to only a few zones in which they can xp in relative peace though this seems to be changing with the widespread epidemic of 4 team guilds.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm the exception sir. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Antihero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont doubt that there are exceptions.. But most I have found just dont roam for one reason or another.. And I hate Xteamers.. I hope to help change that DR disadvantage..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Method</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">X teamers =&gt; The reason I'm on sullon. No way in hell I'm playing on a RACE WAR server to Team Up with them. They are just bluebies with an increased ability to hold everyone else back. Screw that! I don't need a paladin's brells or a rangers atk. I got my own, and we will get it done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rallos Zek is where the men play.  Me and my guild pwned Kurns last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sadicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when u get higher up in lvls get use to being manaburned life burned or death touch and insta killed most of the time. On PvP its who ever can hit there insta kill buttons first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unfortunately sadicious I could not agree with you more and in the current state of high end pvp im pretty much done with the game.:( <br />
<br />
 Everquest was never really made for pvp in mind though they still threw in the option for those that enjoyed that type of game. PvP has always been quirky with the balance between gear levels and classes. SoL injured PvP with the insta kill AA points (manaburn) and PoP just completely destroyed it with the extremely high damage spells that PC's are not designed to handle.<br />
<br />
These spells and abilitys were needed additions for the pve game to progress beyond velious unfortunately the end result is a completely broken high end pvp game.<br />
<br />
I for one will be looking forward to Shadowbane simply for the competition and excitement that only pvp provides. EQ was and is still a great game and has held my attention far longer than any other game I only wish that more people shared the enthusiasm for pvp that I have so verant would balance things better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sadicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use to play on vallon. Hell I even use to beat up your cleric to :) <br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite was when there was the Manaburn bug with casting it in PoN or whatever other zone then casting it on someone. Then u zone out and its refreshed. So you have wizards who have no skills with pvp, zoning out and doing that shit because they are tards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Should have been a chanter and told my friend to be a wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i thought they were nerfing the insta kills.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I played on Rallos Zek for a while but got tired of getting zerged on my corpse runs.  Played PVP on a blue server for ten levels but I wouldn't recommend that.   Once you are PVP on a blue server you can't get heals and buffs from anyone who is blue.  Unless they changed that recently.  Was fun for a while though had our little SK gang go around and gank light race PVPers.  Most fun I had was when this lame level 19 druid couldn't kill me even though I was only level 15.  Loser kept running to the guards to med and heal himself up.</div></div><hr />
