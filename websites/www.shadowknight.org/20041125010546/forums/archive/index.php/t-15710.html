<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey dark brothers,<br />
<br />
Right now, we all know that aaxps, drop rates, power level of 2h weapons are overly weighted against 1h/shield option for knights and I am 1h/shield knight all way due to RP reason and still use the combo.<br />
<br />
Last summer, VI was working on upping bash damage and block ability. Increased bash damage went thru that used n dmg/60 delay where n is AC of the shield up to 25 max. 25/60 is the max you can go. That was a significant upgrade.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, block ability didn't go thru cuz VI didn't like what they saw on test server and shot it down.<br />
<br />
Basic idea of 1h/shield over 2h is:<br />
1. More damage mitigation.<br />
2. Block ability of incoming blows<br />
3. Reduced offense power<br />
4. Best defense against missiles<br />
<br />
Right now, only #3 is true for most cases. #1 is reversed. You have higher damage intake by using 1h/shield combo (see below). #2 and #4 are non-existent.<br />
<br />
Often, 2h offers good AC bonus/stats attached to it that could be better than 1h/shield combo. <br />
<br />
Sad but true, You get more damage done to yourself by using 1h/shield if you are tanking over 2h especially in POP! That is disgusting.. Know why?  You will get more repostes in same time frame over slower 2h would and you ended up losing health quicker than using 2h. For example,  1h of 20 delay vs 2h of 40 delay. That 1h of 20 delay will get repostes from mob twice over what 2h would receive. Ripostes of 600 hps 2x more against 1h/shield knight hurts. Warriors solved that somewhat by having tactical combat aaxp to ignore some defensive power of mobs. <br />
<br />
Common sense shows that you should have more defensive benefit by using 1h/shield. Right now, you get better defensive benefits by using 2h while enjoying good offensive power of that same type! <br />
<br />
For some reason, VI shot down block ability. I thought up of one great solution that should not affect game in any way while upping defensive power of shield in certain situation such as tanking only.  <br />
<br />
I propose that wielding shield should grant BLOCK ability only against ripostes of mobs significantly! VI tested block against all type of attacks that can be overpowering. Blocking only against ripostes should be best solution and I strongly believe that VI would agree with that. It should solve the glaring drawback of using 1h/shield. My goal is to use 1h/shield exclusively by tanking so you can enjoy better defensive benefit and reduce damage intake over 2h in exchange for reduced dps which was supposed to be. That way, knights can have more viable choices..<br />
<br />
I am just sick of getting more ripostes by using 1h/shield over 2h knights and I still refused to have 2h cuz of RP. I don't even have 2h in my arsenals cuz I, as raidleader, kept giving 2h weapons to all other knights first before me. <br />
<br />
That's all about my proposal. :) If you all like, I could send it to VI..</div></div><hr />

I got that sword yesterday and I have also a windblade, if the 1h is equal or almost equal in dmg I would prefer to use it myself.<br />

<br />
I feel you know what you're talking about - go man go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Peye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bro, I like your idea, and I still feel that, with a shield, you should be able to block ANY attack (not just ripostes).  It's pretty funny, but when I use my 2-hander, my AC is higher than when I use a 1h and shield! Because of that, I've thrown out the idea of using my shield, even though I keep it on me in case I wish to use it against casters (for bash).  I think you should send in your idea to SOE and keep nagging them for a response to your idea.  You'd THINK that SOE would take a lot of the ideas and suggestions posted on websites like Sk.org into serious consideration, seeing as how they have this and other websites listed on their own official site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mystina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with the idea, but if it would ever go live it should be balanced by a slightly increased 2H delay and ratio (or maybe atk instead of ratio).<br />
<br />
I find that like it is now, 1H-shield combo is not defensive enough, and 2H not offensive enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hardly use 1handers cause i like the way 2handers look. (dont talk to me about the animation tho)<br />
<br />
The point you make is a good one, and i would support it. I would like to see using a shield with a large amount of AC allmost immune to riposts and every shield should have a good chance to block riposts.<br />
<br />
Something like the damage on bash, the higher the AC, the better the chance on a block. Or just add block modifiërs on shields, bigger onces.<br />
<br />
Something like an uber shield should have about +60% on block. Works also for those classes without a block skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baowuuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree that unless roleplaying, one hander/shield is just not a good option verses most 2 handers right now. The AC of most shields is not high enough since most good 2 handers have AC on them. I would like to see shields gives a massive AC boost, not the average 30ish AC of shields. Either increase available shields to at least 100 AC or, more fair I think, would be to have shields give a 10 percent AC boost. This way the shield would be consistant with your other gear (ie no twinking) but hopefully would be worth  giving up the 2 hander damage output. Add that to the block of repost and I might dust off the old shield and one hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This exact same thread had been on PoN and the FoH boards for the last month almost: http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2199.topic<br />
<br />
http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=8051<br />
<br />
Couple myths id like to address,  1h vs 2h is done on a cases basis for me atleast, 1h dont all suck, infact ive been using a 1hander for more than half of pop.  There are quite a few very formitable 1h weapons in the high end game at least, gea, hb, cvh in many cases they out damage most 2handers in their class, and still give the benefit of opening an extra slot worth of stats (shield)<br />
<br />
The riposte thing is not always true, because with pop many 2handers have got super low delay, in some cases lower than a 1hander, and with our 2h abilities granting extra 2nd and 3rd attack you may end up taking more rips with a 2hander<br />
<br />
The problem with boosting shields is that it gives knights an advantage in tanking over warriors.  Knight 1handers are much more powerfull than warrior 1handers, this was originally designed to compinsate for a lack of DW, however if shields grant a significant boost to tanking, a tanking warrior would want to use a shield there by giving up his DW bonus, but still retaining the peanalty for it by using his not as powerfull 1hander in the main hand.<br />
<br />
Also there is the problem of trivalizing even more content at a faster rate when tanking becomes even easier than it is now.<br />
<br />
IMO if change is to be made it should invole an aa that insures immunity or partial immunity against ripostes when an the offhand slot is filled by either a shield or an offhand weapon, this aa will only be available to pal/sk/war and would provide a slight advantage to shields without trivalizing alot of content nor unbalancing the tank classes.</div></div><hr />

Bro, I like your idea, and I still feel that, with a shield, you should be able to block ANY attack (not just ripostes).   <br />
<br />
For Diablo 2, sure. ;)<br />
<br />
But it won't cut cuz SOE tested that before and shot it down and only had bash damage increase went thru.<br />
<br />
It was rather overpowering if you can block any attack then you would tank better than warriors. If warriors can use shield to block then their MA role would be solidify and trivialize encounters even more and less work on CH rotation.  I only suggested a water-down block feature designed to BLOCK ripostes to GRANT 1h/shield knight to enjoy ACTUAL reduced damage intake OVER 2h REGARDLESS of AC on shield and 2h. <br />
<br />
Shield MUST have inherent block ability of AT least 50% against ripostes to be comparable against 2h for total damage intake.<br />
<br />
THEN, add AAXP shield block that would grant further % on blocking reposite AND missiles such against rangers and bolts from spell casters.  Max aaxp skill out would be immune to ripostes (add another 50% at 3rd level maybe) while wielding shield and greatly reduced damage intake from missiles THEN 1h/shield combo would be better off used for tanking while using 2h for NOT tanking such as in raids.<br />
<br />
With that maxed aaxp,  Enrage would finally become nothing for you and you can still swing even though you don't cause any damage but it would be nice way to avoid any silly mistake for not paying attention to enrages. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">good post noc. lota good points.<br />
<br />
i noticed when tanking a big PoP once when useing my sheild and greenmist (i was using that setup for more hp to survive), that i took alot less damage when i turned auto attack off and just speared and darknessed.<br />
<br />
it was a fairly rude awakening to learn that board and swords was worthless in PoP. as it is i much prefer using my reaver over my greenmist and blade stopper. it makes me tank better and dps much much better.<br />
<br />
i'm not big on sheild toteing. i prefer 2handers, but options never hurt noone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Darke, Thanks for the link! It is useful. ;) Sure, 3x attack from 2h cause more ripostes than 2x BUT 3x = more dps in exchange. Good trade off. My point is WITHOUT aaxps, 2h receives less ripostes over 1h/shield assuming that 2h delay is slower than 1h one; THEREFORE, 2h receives less damage intake over 1h. Most of the time, WITHOUT 2h aaxps,  2h gives more dps over comparable 1h most of the time. AAXPs only increase their dps; therefore, damage intake got increased as well approaching 1h/shield level. But we know that MAXED 2h aaxps using 40 delay will STILL get less damage intake OVER 1h/shild using 20 delay because dps with maxed 2h aaxps isn't doubled.<br />
<br />
Slag, yeah I HAD to turn auto attack OFF in POP exp group when I was at very low health to slow down damage intake to me to buy time for CH to land if I see it was casted tad too late. That trick worked.  It would be cool for maxed aaxp for immunity against riposte then I would NEVER needed to turn auto attack to buy time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good thread and interesting idea Noc.<br />
<br />
I say go for it and see what kind of response you get. <br />
<br />
The reason I bagged my 1HS/Shield combo was because of the amount of ripostes I was getting. Figured I may as well go with  2HS for slower delay but good DPS. <br />
<br />
While some 2H have nice AC on them to off set no shield, not all do. I find myself using stormwatcher horn more and more, but I can make up for lost AC just using AoP in combat.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the idea its a good one, but take those CAPS OFF!!! <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kharzhoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am acually with Darko on this one.<br />
<br />
I have been using a 1h/shield option for awhile as it is both greater DPS than an other solution I have, and it gives me additional stats with the shield.<br />
<br />
I believe that the 1h / shield option is very very viable - the problem is that it doesnt kick in until you get into the elementals. I.e. I dont know if there are any 1h / shield options that are better than 2hander before elementals. So that would be an itemization issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the big issue, it seems to me, isn't that the 1handers are just poopy stat wize, the issue is that you beat yourself to death.<br />
<br />
a mob that reposts for 700+ can give your cleric nightmares, and when you swing every second rather than every 3 seconds with similar dps(or usualy better dps on a 2hander due to damage bonus) being thrown out, the difrence in tanking actualy pulls you down often times when using a 1hs. entirely due to repost.<br />
<br />
again back to the origional post. with a resistance to reposts, better stats could win the day when you needed tankishness over dps as it should be.<br />

Sorry for some captializations. I edited my original post to uncap some words. It's not even my style. I guess I typed it with expressive emotion trying to make point that wasn't needed to do. I hate captializations myself. Hehe.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you listed many good 1h especially from elemental planes. Also, great 1hs you listed isn't SK usable anyway. Powerful 1h ratio for casters mean jack anyway.  Most of us can't go there yet and those 1hs aren't that good pre-elemental plane while we can get many good 2hs. Itemization is the problem for sure. But my major point in this thread is damage intake itself. Need to remove that drawback. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I see alot of Paladins (not many SKs) using the Two Tined Corpse Pitchfork in Tier 1 and 2 planes lately. Usually, they end up being the main tank. And thus, die faster. I've seen it happen just the other day against giants in PoS. Pally got basically double riposted for 600+ each. He died, so I had to finish off the mob.<br />
<br />
But anyway, it seems to me that having a shield in your hand should naturally block more melee hits. Riposte, rampage, regular melee, whatever. Afterall, it is a big sheet of metal that you are holding in front of you. The whole point of a shield is to block more incoming hits, and 35ac just doesn't do that a whole lot. <br />
<br />
I use 2 handers 99% of the time, lately only switching out to either get my skill up a little more (both 1 hand skills are around 205 while 2 hand skills are 220+), or trying to use Bash to interrupt a spell caster. But I'd love to see 1hs/Shield being a more viable option for people not for increased damage, but for decreased damage you take. I think it's a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">how about if blocking repostes with a shield was a skill that you could train in after you obtain a certain lvl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Iskander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I prefer 2H weponary from RP point of view, but I would like to see 1H/shield combo usability increased both for knights and warriors.<br />
<br />
In my opinion no extra skills needed. Equipped shield should give natural boost to parry and riposte skills. It easier to block incoming attack with wide slab of wood/metal then with thin blade/stick and your second hand is always free to retaliate. That way no one will be hurt - warriors have higher skills and priests/casters have no such skills.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you listed many good 1h especially from elemental planes. Also, great 1hs you listed isn't SK usable anyway. Powerful 1h ratio for casters mean jack anyway.  Most of us can't go there yet and those 1hs aren't that good pre-elemental plane while we can get many good 2hs. Itemization is the problem for sure. But my major point in this thread is damage intake itself. Need to remove that drawback. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Imo weapons like windblade where a mistake all together, infact we still see repuctions of these 2handers, since rogues and monks cant stop whining about how their dps dont scale in pop.  The problem isnt that mid/low end 1handers suck, its that mid/low 2handers are too good.  Ask yourself how often do u see a well geared ranger/warrior or even monk (pre-elemental) using DW, and you see where my point comes from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">1. Any benefit we get to shields to improve tanking needs to be applied to warriors to (or else our tanking abilites start getting unbalanced).<br />
<br />
2. If that were done, then Warriors would need something to improve the power of a 1h/shield combo for them.  (See idea 4)<br />
<br />
3. Riposte damage really isn't that bad on exp mobs (tanking hard hitting stuff like xegony, coirnav, phase 3 bosses, gods, etc... you can hold aggro without attack on anyways so riposte there is pointless to bring up, and even then all it can add to you is a damage spike which you should live through in most cases), in groups lets say with haste factored in your delay is 14 with a 1h weapon and the mob has a 5% chance to riposte you.  That translates to 1 additional riposte every 280 seconds, now assuming the mob hits you every time it ripostes and hits for max which using your example is 600, that comes out to an additional 2.14 dps from ripostes, your shield will mitigate much more than that.  You do tank better with a 2h than a really good 1h'er but not for this reason.<br />
<br />
4.  I brought this up awhile ago, but if you want any improvement to shields Warriors need a viable upgrade to them as well.  So for Warriors only, heres an example of something I think would work, when using a 1h/shield combo the shields ac is also added to the weapons damage bonus and they gain a stackable aggro mod of ac/5 on everything they do (like how voice, echo of anger, horrifying visage, etc work) , so instead of a 13 bonus with that 17/19 weapon and 65 ac shield combo, you have a 78 db, plus an additional 13% aggro mod.  This could encourage Warriors to use shields more often which means all 3 tank classes are then able to stay relatively balanced and get shield improvements.<br />
<br />
5.  If you want to fix shields then, make using one change your parry skill to block while it is equipped.  Give you immunity to riposte or even reduce the damage taken from a riposte by x% since I'm already basing alot on shield AC I wouldnt want to base everything on that but short of adding additional stats to shields which wont happen it's the only way... say a 65 ac shield reduces riposte damage by 65%, 50 ac by 50% etc... (a mob could still avoid the attack with a riposte but your shield would absorb the damage) <br />
<br />
Darko, even a Cudgel of Venomous Hatred is outdamaged by a SEWS, not to mention a fucking Emp Sword... The only reason to go 1h right now is if you dont have something better, in my case its a choice between our pet weapon or a gem axe, the gem axe is barely better, would ditch both of those weapons for an Emp Sword without a second thought, thats how bad our 1h weapons are, but thats a seperate issue the main problem right now is shields not being worth equipping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">brael, i realy dig number 5. it puts a stress on not just using any sheild to tank, but a GOOD hardy sheild. <br />
<br />
and they could make war only super high ac sheilds and stuff to scale it up and give them a tanking edge.</div></div><hr />

How could u possibly argue that cvh is out damaged by a emp sword, emp sword being shitty even in luclin days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Because I've had my friends who have them parse them, for comparison a gem axe is approx 90% of an emp swords damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Here is some parses done from solro by a person i know:<br />
<br />
Gemaxe 93dps<br />
Sword of ssra 95dps<br />
Cudgel 103dps<br />
Sews 105dps<br />
<br />
This didnt include SoC procs etc, just melee and weapon proc.<br />
<br />
With this being said imo CVH should be parsing higher, it does need a tweak cause as it is now its dumb for a weapon droping from PoTime to be parsing lowers than a quite easy to obtain elemental weapon(mudwalker ring is one of the easiest elemental ecnounters imo.) However cvh is far from being useless, although it is due for a small upgrade :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brahms</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Started out with 1hs with sword, but wasn't hitting that hard, then I switched to 2hs, which seems much better especially to get those spells off.  I like to use 1hb and shield, which is a good alternative to 1hs and compliments 2hs well. <br />
<br />
Usually, what I do, and this is by far not the end all solution, but I usually start with 2hs and get in some good hits, as well as land whatever spells I need, and then quickly switch during the battle to 1hb and shield to prevent casters from casting etc.  Also if I need to give up aggro because the warrior is complaining like a little bitch, I usually switch to 1hb and let him have his bottle.  <br />
<br />
Nothing better than stealing aggro from a warrior and having the mob turn all the way around to hit you.  CD might be getting nerfed soon I here though.  That would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Senidryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll support this idea.  I've always wanted shields to mean something more than a bit more ac and stats.  Now that 2handers have stats that beat the crap out of a lot of 1hander+shields, I really feel for those people who are forced into 1handers (for whatever reason).<br />
<br />
The idea of lowering damage on ripostes if you're wearing a shield is a very nice one.  IMO all shield-users should be allowed to take advantage of that, but I wouldn't complain if it's just the tanks. =)<br />
<br />
BTW, I like using caps too...I mainly use it to emphasize certain words, since text doesn't carry voice tones and stressed words very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>sarumuen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The real problem is that 2hs is overpowered. You should take double damage when you get riposted using a 2hs. It only makes sense. when someone throws a bigger sword back in your face, you take bigger damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sounds spot on, Nocifer.<br />
<br />
2hs is only overpowered if everything else is underpowered. You only take more damage with a 2hs than a 1hs/shield combo if the AC isn't the same. <br />
<br />
Should weapons have AC? No.<br />
<br />
I would assume the logic is that added AC to a weapon is a sort of &quot;block with the weapon&quot; skill, and not an actual damage absorber/avoider like something worn specifically for the purpose of defense is. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm too conservative in my vision of what defense with a weapon should be designated as... but...<br />
<br />
...perhaps weapon AC should effect stuff like parry/block/riposte effectivity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Peasley Grunglefunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">so we should be able to get hit for 6k+ from raid mobs? right, sounds like a great idea sarumuen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">sarumuen somehow thinks riposte is to get your own weapon deflected back at you.<br />
<br />
<br />
what a riposte is is a counterattack made after you parry your opponent's weapon, thusly the weapon you, the defender, have shouldn't do a goddamn thing to the riposte damage, as it's your opponent's weapon riposting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've got a nice,simple idea.<br />
<br />
Give us a bonus to parry skill checks with a shield in hand. Make it a % multiplier of the AC of the shield in question-say for a knight 50% of the AC.<br />
<br />
For example,an AC 4 buckler is going to give you something like +2 to parry. My Ashenbone (AC 25) would give me a healthy +12 to parry. And so on. Give us AA skills that improve that multiplier.<br />
<br />
Or heck,make it a separate check on attacks instead-that way it'd give us a small additional chance to stop a shot coming in and not cap out parry skill instead. Same way parry works,just a second chance with a shield in hand at a lower level,based on the AC of the shield. In this case,make it something like AC x2 ,rather than a bonus of AC/2.<br />
 <br />
As it stands,there's no reason for big races to use a non 2H in most cases, ripostes kill you if you're a small SK going sword and board. Basing the benefit of a shield in some way directly linked to AC (other than the simple protection)  is IMHO the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">skill mods on useless skills are useless, espically with a 252 cap, 21 ac shield at 60+ and your at 252 , this is where the problem with 1h's is also, any random shield will put you at the cap, theres no benefit to better shields at all... anyways those extra 42 points of parry are good for oh... .1% more attacks avoided give or take .01 or so, this is why i suggested to change parry to block when using a shield, it goes off more with equal skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Alehop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Actually they are rethinking on implementing block for all the shield users. This would come along with the &quot;melee balancing&quot; update that soe has to release soon. While soon can mean up to one or two years :D<br />
<br />
About the covh vs sews. Both do very similiar dps, in fact no sews user in my guild outdamages me with covh. So  using 1h/shield I have 200+ hps 100 more ac, 5% striketrough (yeah!), and the drain proc. There is no way I would switch to a sews.<br />
<br />
The only weapon I might consider for replacing the 1h/shield combo would be vanazir, and we got one in 20 kills, figure ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Alehop lemme find the parses a bit later, they show less dps taken using an sews over a covh (yes the rune proc made up for that much), plus quite a bit more dps, btw your magelo up to date? would have expected to see fearless trained</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Something I'd like to see as a shield advantage is stun immunity.  Also adding weapon / offensive mods ( 1h slash, dbl atk, etc ) would make them more attractive as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Brael - I agree that warriors should get the same benefits as us for using a shield if it becomes improved - I think for the most part they could give a shit about a even blocking a few extra hits - they would trade it all for a little extra hate building..<br />
<br />
There was a thread floating around about having shields helping block ripostes and whatnot - I thought it was a good idea. I realize you don't have to even click attack to keep aggro on a mob (think we've all forgotten to do it &amp; not noticed cuz the mob was still on us heh) but you lose DPS..with my soul defiler I get the shit kicked out of me for ripostes.<br />
<br />
I just think shields should help with ripostes and whatnot..the idea of equipping a shield and having it just hanging dead on your arm is pretty ludicrous, from a combat /roleplay standpoint. Not that EQ combat is exactly the most finely developed concept around..</div></div><hr />
