I would like any help I can get in solving this miserable zone.<br />
<br />
We have solved Kelekdrix.<br />
We have solved Stonemites.<br />
we are stuck on cursecallers.<br />
<br />
First of all, I'll tell you how we have had the least lopsided annihilation:<br />
<br />
-we put all the casters on DPSing the coffin mobs (the rooted ones with almost no DPS) one at a time while other 5 are tanked by a pet (even SK pets can tank these)<br />
-all the melee are trying to DPS the cursed mobs and keep things under control.<br />
-anyone who gets the emote kites the mob counter-clockwise inside the room. (we have considered trying the ramp because the golems don't seem to repop)<br />
<br />
We have yet to even come close to winning this in about 15 attempts.<br />
What are we doing wrong?<br />
Any tips?<br />
What comes after Cursecallers?<br />
<br />
We desperately want to win this event and move on, but it's just not cooperating.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information you are willing to share.</div></div><hr />

If you want to post about raid tactics, do so at thesafehouse.org. The other option is to use PM's and in-game tells, there are many people that won't mind helping.<br />
<br />
The minute you post public spoilers here, it ruins it for every person that has not yet done that content. Robbing someone of the challenge of one of the best designed zones in the game (Inktu'ta) would be a shame.</div></div><hr />

Without spoiling, let me just tell you its an utterly simple step that you are missing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uuuarius</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my appologies Siilvir.<br />
<br />
I mistook this for the proper place to do just that.<br />
Please do not spoil anything for anyone else, that was not my intent.<br />
<br />
Everyone I've talked to says this zone is just &quot;wonderful&quot; and &quot;classic&quot;, but we all hate it. I desire nothing beyond getting it over with so we can get to the other things the game has to offer.<br />
<br />
The intrigue and mystery for this zone are dissipating, all that really remains is disdain.  I hope that once we finally solve this nightmarish event, it will be fun again.<br />
<br />
I will move my request to the Safehouse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, after the anal fisting commonly known as Uqua, anything can happen right?</div></div><hr />

It was so much fun solving the puzzle of each fight. You have to think outside the box and forget all your 'normal' tactics.</div></div><hr />
