<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just came back from a year off and was bring out a lvl 52 DE SK from retirement.  My problem though is whether I should keep this one or start over with a new DE or a human one.  The reason I asked is that I had put my starting points in the first character into STR instead of STA.  I know that STA is the key thing now and wonder should I just start over again.  If I do start over again, how long do you think it would take to get him to the level of the first one?  I'll probably be putting in about 35 to 40 hours a week on the character.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I created my SK, I divided up my points between STR and STA, and haven't regretted it.<br />
<br />
After having been 60th for quite awhile now, I've noticed that the availability of geat to supplement STA and STR is quite abundant. <br />
<br />
Also, at 55-60th, if you're raiding regularly, you're going to be buffed to max STR and STA anyway.<br />
<br />
So basically, I'd suggest you enjoy your current SK and save yourself the time of levelling again. I really don't think you'd notice too much of a difference if you went back and rebuilt your character.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you really enjoy the levelling-up process and the lower levels, then by all means, remake your character and enjoy levels 1-52 all over again! :)<br />
