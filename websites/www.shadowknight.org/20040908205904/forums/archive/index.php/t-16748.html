<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok .. I was bored today, so I took a 65 druid and 65 shaman in to do the hole part of my epic, everything was up, and we cleared way all the way to city by the ratmen and chests and whatnot, but I had to log .... I was thinking of going back later when I had more time to play, and was wondering is me (65sk) 65 druid and 65 shaman enough people to kill the chest or ratman guard for key, and then kill caradon / kyrenna ? If not what else would I need? I'm assuming I would need more for Ghlonor , not sure though, heard he is in the harder part of the hole..? Any opinions would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">may want another melee to add-tank caradon/kyrenna. otherwise they are gimps...just chunky. Ratman guard was a bit tougher back in the day, but I dont know about him now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have about 108 aa, pretty good gear (at least i think), druid has about 40 aa or so, shaman probably 50-60, both average gear... may help a little. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can make it to the city you have plenty of power for the chests and the ratman guard.  I know a 65SK who just did the solo FD flop run down to solo chests.  The ratman Guard is tougher but not that much harder than the other mobs around.<br />
<br />
When you give the key to Caradon run back up the stairs and FD.  Wait till you are sure Caradon has pathed back to his cell (or have somebody stand there invis to watch) and then get up.  If Caradon has forgotten you then you can kill Kryenna alone.  This also leaves him up for other SK's.<br />
<br />
Did Kryenna back when I was 60th and she was tough.  At 65 with defensive AA's she hits like a wimp.  However she is still almost completey magic resistant.  Couldn't land spears although lifetap line worked.  She aslo runs on low health and can't be snared.  So you usually need some melee power to take her down.  With a druid and shaman for healing I would suggest a rogue for the extra DPS to drop her when she starts to run.<br />
<br />
Getting to Glohnor is another thing.  The mobs get harder down near the undead tower.  Had 2 groups and had one almost wipe there this weekend due to a bad pull and repops. (gotta keep moving).  But 1 good solid group could clear it.  You only need to clear the left side not the right.  Glohnor pops in the same place each time now or did for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I Did Glohor about 2 weeks ago and found the ghost on the RIGHT side grave yard, but when I did the hand in his Mummy spawned on the left side. Which is odd cause my prior failed attempt I found him on the LEFT side and he spawned the mummy there as well..<br />
<br />
Was worried a few moments there that the quest had been broken....<br />
<br />
NOW all I need are two &quot;little&quot; items - Decrepit Hide and the Soul Leech (anyone got one or the other for MQ sale on Brell? Ill pay in phat plat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, thanks everybody for the help, gonna hope to do it today/tomorrow and finally finish up my epic. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guess we got lucky on the spawns on the left side 2 in a row.  Didn't see all  the PH's you use to kill to spawn him so thought they had gotten rid of them.  Mummy always comes from the left side.  he spawns in the basement.  I usually clear the basement and then wait down there to make sure I get him and take him where I want him. But he will come after the person who did the hand in.  Planning a trip back for my 7th kill of glohnor for another SK in guild.</div></div><hr />
