<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mokrok Elitech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wonderin if my 40 Shammie is too low to effectively group with a 56 troll sk just yet, or if there is a place I can that I don't know about.I mean I guess it would be possible to power level SHM a few more levels .. but what does experience tell you guys?<br />
Thanks im still new at two boxin and this question bugged me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The limiting factor with a 40 SHM and a 56 SK is zone access initially, as you will need L 46 to get into any Planes. However, this does not stop you from working on the SHM's levels in some other zones. For grouping, this really means that the SK won't get very good exp for the most part, and you should probably try to feed the SHM exp with the SKs help, in order to hit 46 faster on the SHM. After that you have more choices of zones to exp together.<br />
<br />
A good way to feed exp to the SHM with this pair is probably to essentially snare and then either aggro or fear kite the mobs with the SK, allowing the SHM to DoT and send its pet in to kill. (A L 40 SHM has a pet, right?). Speed per kill is the optimizing factor, so low HP mobs of a level higher than the SHM are good. Natimbi comes to mind as a newer possibility, but older zones with fear kitable content like Echo Caverns or whatever else is on the stickied list above in this forum are worthwhile also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloodmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Dulak and camp the zone scouts or the crew on the first ship to the right. Good exp and tha zone is currently even better expwise due to a &quot;hot spot&quot; rating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Over the past few months, leveled my ogre shaman from the mid 20s to 45 with my 54 ogre SK main in the Overthere. Before I could group them I would beat stuff down with the SK, FD and finish with the shammy. After they could group together (39 I believe), I just killed tons of mobs that were green to the SK. I have junky gear on my SK and newbie quest gear and several empty slots on my shammy, but with the 2 pets and the shammy healing and buffing, I could easily pull a bunch (4 - 6) at a time and finish them off fairly quickly. Plus if you're evil, or have a method to get into the OT outpost you can turn in 4 of the sarnak war braids to get some decent xp. It was a really safe and fast way to go for me since both characters were evil. I think it's hard to beat playing in a zone with a bank, merchants and a PoK book. Also, if things get really bad and you are liked by the outpost, look for the cleric goon when they go on patrol and he will CH you.<br />
<br />
This isn't the way to go if you want the SK to get xp, I probably got ~10% from random light blue mobs during the whole time I did this. Now my shammy is 48 and I have a decent duo, though I have found myself mostly playing one at a time.<br />
