<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cozzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">our guild had zone crash at 75% saryrn hps after few mins zone came back up and only sorrowsong was there untargetable ....<br />
this happened at sunday 20.7 ...so if someone gets it to work..pop a msg :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, Saryrn is bugged, old news really. You will need to wait for a patch to occur before attempting her again, till then she is broken. I think the best that has happened is a guild on Povar got her to 36% before the zone crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Confirmed Saryrn is still bugged as of today (7/24/2003). My guild tried her and zone crashed. That is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for being quiet on this for so long. <br />
<br />
We've got a potential fix for her that we're going to try to roll out tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Long story short is that there was a pretty bad memory corruption bug that occurred as a result of some optimization that had to happen as a part of Lost Dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you leave one or more of the set of three adds alive, the event won't crash the zone. Some memory is being overwritten on the server when the last of the duplicate creatures dies. Any time after that, the zone is primed to crash.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all the folks who mailed in their experiences that helped nail this one down. <br />
