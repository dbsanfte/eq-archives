<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got a quick question about combat stability.  I recently got CS2 and was duoing with a mage friend of mine who has no points in CS.  I had read that CS2 gave a 5% bonus to mitigation so, my understanding was that if a mob was going to hit me for 100, instead he would hit me for 95.  I tried to test this out on an Underbulk in The Deep by letting it beat on me for a long time and then having my friend sit next to it and let it hit him.  The Underbulk's max hit on me was 135 and it was the same on my friend.  Now, I am missing was CS is supposed to do?  Even with CS do you STILL get the message telling you what the mob WOULD have hit you for had you not had it, but actually take less damage than what the message says?  In other words, even though I got a message saying I was hit for 135, did I actually take less damage than that?  For some reason I was under the assumption that the message itself would be different (in this case instead of saying 135, it would have said 128).  Hopefully someone can clear this up because I am a bit confused.  Thanks.<br />

nm...I found a previous post I had somehow overlooked on the same subject and looked over the spreadsheet by Romidar.  Makes sense to me now.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
