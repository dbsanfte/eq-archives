<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vengyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild recently broke up, which has left me with a lot of spare time, and so i was thinkinh of starting this quest. But then i checked the Stacking issues on it. I'm not sure i'm reading it right, but am i correct in saying that the effect will NOT stack with the Fiery Might effect which i have on my legs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgonbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It wont stack with most of regen spells. Including rng/dru spell as well as fiery might.<br />
<br />
But the dark phylactery can target others and cast the regen buff onto them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Phylactery is MUCH better than Dark Phylactery.  And if you do the quest, you can interchange the two with the quest NPC at will.  I've done both.  I use Phylactery to buff myself, and I use Dark Phylactery to buff my pet and my group and noob buff beggars that think I'm a shaman for some reason despite my carrying the shadowknight epic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dark Phylactery just casts the basic regen spell that druids and shammys get.  The plain Phylactery, however, is FT2/regen2 and stacks with most mind buffs of note.</div></div><hr />

Even with a big-ass 2 handed sword in hand some dweeb will always come up in PoK asking for Virtue or some shit. Or get pissed off that I won't rez their friend. Never wondered why my name didn't come up when they /who cleric.<br />

Go figure...</div></div><hr />

I always got port request when AFKing in nexus.<br />
And once I was sorting out my bank item in Thug with 2 epic1.0 wiz. And a nooob wandered in, hailed me, and said &quot;can u port to cs please?&quot;..  :D  Those 2 wizs must look like oger in his eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yslaath-RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unfortunately this quest was recently changed and will no longer be given to hybrids, see the write up of the quest on Allakazaham's.  Why after all this time they did that I don't know.</div></div><hr />
