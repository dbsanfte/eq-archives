<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tranquilized</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Neriak is the coolest looking it has all the evil symbols and whatnot and you don't need a key to get out....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So?<br />
<br />
The Key is a sign of our superior Intellect. What would rather have, a Wide open city like Neriak with only two men guarding it's entrance, or a City on a rocky cliff with only a narrow defile and a magically locked shaft to get into?<br />
<br />
That, and we a Skeleton Band :D<br />
<br />
Paineel is the pwn. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Paineel is very cool, but the Shrine of Bertoxxulous under Queynos is pretty nice....not as good as paineel tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dancing skeletons. I could watch them for hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SK and necro guilds in cabalis both look awesome from the outside...SK guild looks like a big castle fortress...necro guild looks like a big marble tower.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zanix The Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">here's my .02<br />
<br />
Cabilis looks cool from the outside. but attempt to make that retarded 180degree-turn-around-jump-off-the-top-of-a-ladder to a platform 5 feet away, damn, 60+ levels later, it still takes me 10 tries at least<br />
<br />
Neriak all looks the same to me, I still get lost in there, plus the neon/blacklit symbols and decor remind me of cheesy low budget night clubs with bad music, and ugly girls<br />
<br />
Qeynos or wherever human SKs starts no interest here, cause i see 0 fun in RPing or attempting to RP a human, while you can RP a human in RL... if you can start an &quot;evil&quot; SK in a guild building that once you leave you hear pretty music, and a beutiful sunset, then more power to you...<br />
<br />
Oggok ok, its a cave on the side of a rock, woop-de-doo<br />
<br />
Gobb *see above<br />
<br />
Paineel great SK/evil atmosphere here, the skeletons randomly doing random people things make this area a winner, plus the idea that the whole city is locked underground, the only thing i dont like about paineel is the ugly conehead people walking around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Neriak is the coolest city, with Paineel a close second, but i'd say coolest sk guild is in Grobb. The others are either just blending in with the surroundings or a dinky room. The trolls actually have a great primitive design.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rayd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Qeynos guild underground is cool. Blood red. etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Synd D`nys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Paineel is definately the best looking city in the game.  The Evil guild area in the Qeynos sewers is pretty sweet as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">in cabilis I found with luclin models off I can make the jump about 4/5 with luclin models on I make it about 1/50 =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gothmohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Neriak - I like the look of Neriak's &quot;Lodge of the Dead&quot;, looks like an ancient japanese fortress, except blood red.  I was in awe the first time I saw it.  Ghoul guards and abbatoir feel make this place a home away from Grobb for me.<br />
<br />
Paineel - Pretty cool city and far less traffic due to the fact it is locked away.  As stated before, dancing skeleton minstrels kick ass.<br />
<br />
Grobb - Pretty plain until you note that us hardy trolls built their guild on top of lava, pretty ballsy move for a race with a base fire resistance of 5.  RAWR!<br />
<br />
Oggok - Boring.  A big cave with a few ogres.<br />
<br />
Freeport - Boring and ugly.  Oh look a tunnel with people scattered around in it.<br />
<br />
Qeynos - Pretty cool looking, but they had to include it in Epic to get people to go there.<br />
<br />
Cabillis - Also very cool looking with the castle except we have to share it with the Shamans.  Iksars should be eradicated for that ladder crap though.  For some reason I can't jump on the top of the ladder anymore, had to bum a levitate to get up there.  Maybe new troll models are the cause? Dunno.<br />
<br />
Ak'Anon - Never been, not do I intend to unless it is a &quot;fun raid&quot; to waste lighties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Reshen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Qeynos hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My SK guild is from Freeport. It sure is ONE OF MOST PLAIN SK GUILD of all!<br />
<br />
I like Qeynos guild the best. Of course, I am baised cuz I am human but too bad that I don't worship Bertoxxous. :)<br />
<br />
It is so funny to see 2 human SK guilds to be on its opposite side for fashion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Qeynos Shrine of Bertoxxulous wins it for me.  First entering the world, your summons sends you underneath the gorey arena to find the secret passage maked by a trail of bones.  Inside, you find passageways marked with blood runes, and a sickly green mist hangs in the air.  Spectres guard the main entrance, waiting in alcoves along the path to ambush travelers too curious or too stupid to heed the warnings on the sewer walls.  Everything is in ghastly reds, purples and greens,  with glowing runes on the floors, and the requisite pool of blood in the main temple area.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Krazix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Qeynos and Paineel tie it for me.<br />
<br />
and if anyones wondering, Ak`Anon is just a system of tunnesl with 1 SK guild leader, and 2 spell merchants for SK's.. like 5 necro leaders, and 1 for each other class that has the option of following Bertox.<br />
<br />
Oggok was always boring, but it lost point when luclin came out and the snake head above the door to enter, was turned into a parot.<br />
<br />
Neriak is plain and boring to me, as with Freeport, and Grobb.. Cabalis is a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ive never been able to go that deep into Paineel, but the Iksar SK guild is nice. A big menacing tower that we share with the shaman. the Sk guild is on top because, well... we like it on top ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I love Paineel. Walking through Neriak makes me think I'm in some 1980's movie with chewing gum, motorcycles, and pink hair. It's the neon parts...while not bad looking colorwise, it doesn't have that fantasy appeal that I look for. <br />
<br />
Paineel, to me, is great because it's natural. Everything just seems to fit. Skeletons and ghosts walking around naturally..old stonework..secluded, private..elegant yet not ostentatious...<br />
<br />
It's very solemnly haunting, and I find it the most peaceful city on Norrath. <br />
<br />
It's home. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That goddamn jump in the Cabalis guild...I do sorta like it because it foils the attempts of many doods to play iksar SKs.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've found that by climbing the ladder in the Iksar SK guild and then turning and facing the room and then cast Shadow Step will get you over most of the time.  I don't think I've had to cast it more than three times in a row to get acrossl.  Just a bit of advice from a Leezard that got damned sick and tired of jumping and falling so damn many times ;p</div></div><hr />

in cabilis I found with luclin models off I can make the jump about 4/5 with luclin models on I make it about 1/50 =/  <br />
What I've discovered:<br />
<br />
If I have SoW, I fail 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
If I don't, I fail 0.0001% of the time.<br />
<br />
Best looking SK city?  Of the ones I've seen, probably Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">While I do like Paineel, I actually like Neriak the best. Sure, I am biased: I am a DE. But right from the start, you know in the city of Neriak, no one messes with the Lodge!<br />
<br />
Ghoul guards keep out the riff-raff! Indigo punks and all the other silly pajama-wearers KNOW they are in the wrong part of town when they see these guys!<br />
<br />
Blood-red walls beckon the initiated, and frighten off the uninitiated. Who can count the number of screams these walls have heard? Who can count the number of rituals these hallowed walls have witnessed?<br />
<br />
Upstairs, various experiments (fools would erroneously call it 'torture') have been undertaken through the ages for the eternal study of the miracle of undeath. Tables perfectly tilted to provide maximum blood-flow are blood-stained from the countless number of victims disected there.<br />
<br />
Below, the leaders of the Shadow Knights and Necromancers gather in the main chamber to discuss the guild's course. Resplendent in their robes and armor, these leaders represent the most intelligent and powerful masters of death that the world has ever known.<br />
<br />
Conventiently located in small alcoves you find various merchants prepared to buy and sell the goods you need, whether it be the trinkets of gold, silver, armor and weapons collected during your conquests, or the left over remains of your latest kill. <br />
<br />
Yes, the very air of this fine guild is permeated with the aroma of sweat, blood, and death. No finer scent shall you find in all of Norrath!<br />
<br />
Leaving the guild always lowers my spirit, for when I leave it, I leave a place of ultimate reverence and inspiration. <br />
<br />
Now, my journeys take me far and wide away from my ancestral home, and often I long to see the blood-red walls again.<br />
<br />
And of course, I miss /con'ing the ghoul guards, ever present and ever watchful.<br />

A ghoul judges you amiably. Would you like a hug today?<br />

However, the Bloodsabre domain under Qeynos is cool enough to make me think about a Bertoxxolous human.<br />
<br />
Neriak is nice enough but you never get a real feeling of it being the last refuge of the Dark Elves.  And the neon signs just suck big floppy donkey dick. :/<br />
<br />
Freeport, in a word... bland.  In another... pfft.<br />
<br />
Ak'anon, no idea never been there and never want to go there.<br />
<br />
Grobb/Ogguk, dear God those places are ugly.  And poorly layed out.<br />
<br />
Cabilis, from the outside it looks pretty cool.  The sub-levels are also quite nice, unfortunately the ladders are stupidly annoying and there's no real sense of anyone living or working there.<br />
<br />
Paineel, I've only been there a couple of times but it was nice from what I recall.<br />
<br />
Qeynos, it's atmospheric, well designed with the low level hunting in the sewers and is, perhaps most importantly, believable as a place of evil festering beneath the streets of Qeynos.  The Spectre sentinels are also pretty cool.<br />
Sort of ironic that the followers of decay and change live in a well maintained and organised stronghold while their freeport brethren live in caves beneath the rat enfested ruin of a shanty town.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow Step works great for this, much easier than trying to make the leap over.  Also I used to never be able to make the jump with a SoW on, forcing me to click off a buff that I would really much rather keep.  This was my main reason for using Shadow Step over the hop-over.</div></div><hr />

Also when they had the message as soon as you stepped on arena grounds. You didn't fuck around looking at bloody walls and ran your ass off. A low level who asked where his guild was didn't want to follow me. Ah ..trust me , I won't hurt you , I'm a SK..muhaha<br />
