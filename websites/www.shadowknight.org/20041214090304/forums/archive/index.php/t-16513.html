<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salaiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can you do the coldain rings 1-8 using invis, i recently got up to 6th using invis..but i've heard it doesn't work past then. can anyone confirm that it does or does not work? thanks<br />
<br />
=Salaiin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will be very tricky, if you can do it at all.  Harder since the harmony nerf.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't risk it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Salaiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got 7th ring doing it. During the 8th ring i dunno what happened. I turned in the marching orders, went and DTEd chief looted head. ran to hill, invis and turned it in. Garadain said &quot;sorry Salaiin, i don't want this, you can have it back&quot;. then i had bad timing on invis after that and never got another chance before he died. Im thinking i did it too fast. I needed to wait until he was preparing armor before i could turn it in. I think its kinda unfair that it didn't work because i did the quest too fast. but i guess better luck next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It must take what, 10 minutes to become non-KoS to the dorfs?<br />
<br />
I used to wear a lot of RVF armor, so I ruined and rebuilt my dorf faction a number of times, it's cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salaiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know where you are hunting, but i cleared kael with a group of 4-5 people for a couple hours, and i didn't budge. Max kos isn't fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkWyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only the Frost Giants give faction for Coldain, so depends where you were clearing in Kael.  I personally think it's much easier going into GD and commiting genocide on all the giants and the Drakkel Dire Wolves.  Once you get enough faction to do the rings (apprehensive to start if I remember right), you will pretty much keep your faction high enough - as long as you don't go hunting dwarves again. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, if you are clearing Kael, you probably killed a bunch of giants that did not give you +Coldain faction.  4-5 hours in GD killing the wolves and the easier giants should be plenty of time.  Save toes and heads, and do shawls 1-2 over and over for more faction hits.  It also helps to find a giant group and tag their kills.<br />
<br />
10 minutes was an obvious exaggeration :D but I rebuilt my dorf faction three times and it was not too painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">maybe you tried turning in the head too fast for the 8th ring.  if you kill chief too fast, you'll get to garadain before he repops in war form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Salaiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">nope im sure I was getting + coldain hits. I was killing all giants from zone in at EW, to Chanter house, and back again. <br />
<br />
<br />
and yup atlis, thats what i did.</div></div><hr />
