Any Information would be Appreciated, and if there is a Blade, i am willing to buy on the Tunare Server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talura cwn`Zeylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no skipping faction, you can't do the turn ins if you aren't amiable or better to the Crusaders, dubious or better to the necros, and I'm not sure what faction is necessary for the shamans since they went up with Crusaders (hence, amiable currently).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can apparently buy the Hero's Khukri.  Ask Window in PM, he apparently has the scoop on that particular tactic.<br />
<br />
As far as factioning and such, no skipping unless you use illusion potions, and then you only get to skip a little bit of the factioning work.  You'll want to be at least dubious with residents to keep from getting into trouble in cab, and this will max out your other factions anyway (except for necro).  I don't know what the jump in faction is with an illusion.   /shrug</div></div><hr />

I tested it myself when doing my Greenmist.<br />
<br />
Went from Threatening to Amiable with the Necro's.<br />
<br />
Maxed on all other Factions, which I had already been doing work on, and was already non-kos to most.</div></div><hr />
