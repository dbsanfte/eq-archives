<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">welly321</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got a new hard drive  and i figured i would just re-install eq. When i ran the patcher, it said it will take 20 hours to download everything... I have a 56k connection. Is it just me or is this just ridiculous . When i first installed eq, I remember it taking 1 to 2 hours to patch. Has anyone else has this happen to them or knows how to fix this please respond .   Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiyn</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had to reinstall everquest a few times on my 56k connection, but it has never taken me 20 hours. As I recall it did say that it would take 20 hours, but it decreased significantly every few seconds. I would just let it run and go do something else hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paynreaver</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, just remember that when you first installed EQ you had to DL every patch untill that day, now you have to download that plus EVERY SINGLE PATCH RELEASED AFTERWARD, which means every single patch, ever. In 3 years of EQ thats a LOT of patches, so it makes perfect sense to take so long. <br />
<br />
Though, it makes sense that they may have a blanket &quot;fresh install&quot; patch that will get EQ up-to-date with a smaller file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, not quite, EQ's patcher like all patchers works in a much more efficient way.  The patcher will look at all the eq system files on your computer, then queury the hard drive for either the creation date or the file version.  If it finds a file thats is out of date or missing it will add it too a list to be updated.  Once its finished analyzing the files it will request the files on the list from the patch server, thus making every eq file up to date in one patch instead of downloading every patch on top of one another.<br />
<br />
Now on the subject of it taking so long, it could be a few things.  Even though you are using a 56k modem, you could still be connected to your ISP at 36.6 or worse.  On top of that some where in the connection from your house to the eq patch server there could also be another weak link causing the download to slow down further.  Also, keep in mind when the patcher says 2 minutes it usually means 30 secs or less.....my 2cp :D</div></div><hr />
