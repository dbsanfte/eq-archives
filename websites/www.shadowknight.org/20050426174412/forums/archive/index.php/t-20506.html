<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a searh and all i came up with were people hinting at charming the quest mobs for turn ins *may* work.  Has anyone done it? I have maxed faction with all but Necros. I want to skip killing greenies for hours on end for weeks so i got a crazy enchanter friend who is willing to try it.  Im gonna try it tonight but i would like to hear some input or some experiences on this.  I havent even started the quest cause i have been working on faction by turning in Veksar steel weapons.  maybe i can even pull the mobs to the zone by using the pet trick and try to charm them? any ideas would be helpful cause i know there are plenty of people who want to do the quest but are a bit taken off by all the factioning involved with the necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thaleles Darkshine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about charming, I worked Necro faction while I was fixing everything else.  Granted it took a lot longer than fixing guards and merchants but the whole process was only five days at best.  <br />
<br />
Between the cave in FoB and running the camp cycle in Warslik Woods it only took me two - three days to fix Necros.  Maybe less I don't really recall.</div></div><hr />
