Hey have a ability - leg attack or such, which cancels my DoTSnare. <br />
Great Job, SoE.<br />
<br />
Asking them several times dont to use this ability. Sure, they didnt heard anything, the keep using it.<br />
<br />
60 % Snare at lvl 30.<br />
well done, cancels mine. Cancels a lvl 22 Spell, which does a 110 Damage after running out. <br />
<br />
They do quite a damage. Have a fight to keep the aggro, and this as a sk. <br />
casting spells all the time, running faster oom then i can type oom.<br />
<br />
Great Job, SoE.<br />
<br />
The Ber told me, they are a DSP Class, not a tank class. <br />
<br />
So what now ? <br />
<br />
Greetings <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Justjoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if the zerker is still casting his snare after you've asked him twice, pull 9 mobs, let him snare one, then FD.  that'll teach him to listen to a superior.  if that still doesn't work, drive to his/her house and insert your foot into his anus and break it off at the ankle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SOE didn't do anything to us IMHO.... there are already plenty of classes that can cancel out or prevent us from using some of our high-aggro spells.<br />
<br />
Heck, I used to ask enchanters to not cast their &quot;choke&quot; line of spells because it wouldn't allow my Greenmist to take hold. (or at least wait till they see a cloud of green)<br />
<br />
If anyone's to blame... it's the idiots that don't listen to you when you ask them not to do something so that you can keep them alive, and efficiently use healer mana.<br />
<br />
I'm sure with time, we'll see either a lot less of these &quot;noob&quot; berserkers, as more people learn more about them.  You have to remember, EQ is still selling new accounts to new players... and some of them reach high levels way too fast.</div></div><hr />
