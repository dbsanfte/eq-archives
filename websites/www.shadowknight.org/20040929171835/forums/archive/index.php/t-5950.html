<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having a hard time trying to decide between going with a dark elf or a human SK.  These are the two races I have numbered it down to and have no interest in the other races.  I  like dark elves because of their ultravision and good int but they are really weak  in the STR and STA department plus I can do a /who dark sha all and the request is always cut short by the sheer number of DE SKs that are on my server.  They seem to be a dime a dozen.  I like humans cause of their balanced stats and they have a better look with the new luclin graphics but they are night blind, their INT is a little lower than DEs, and I'm not sure how hated they are compared to dark elves (if I mske a human he will worship Inny).  I can though do a /who human sha all and they are only at most 7 or 8 on at a time which is kinda of nice to be a little different then the norm.  So I'm hoping people who use this forum can help me with a choice.  Thx. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
A year ago night blind was a problem but now it is not.<br />
There are all kinds of items which are also a light source;<br />
Split Paw Hide Mask has a light source, there also shields with light sources on them.<br />
<br />
I have a low lvl wizard (human) in PC and he can still see when his Infravision drops. (just not as well)<br />
<br />
Also if all else fails use a GLS til lvl 22 then cast deadeye.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulvyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, you pretty much have the info you need to decide, you just have to decide what's most important to you! :)<br />
<br />
If your main concern is NOT being &quot;a dime a dozen&quot;, don't be a DE. DE's are most likely the most common SK in the game. <br />
<br />
However, even though the human might start out with a couple extra points in STA and STR, don't let that fool you. After a few levels, stats start to even out between humans and DE's when you figure in spells, equipment, and other factors.  Same goes for Int, as well. I have known some Ogre SK's who at 30th level had equal INT scores to some 40th level DE SK's I've known. It all becomes a matter of gear selection as you gain levels.<br />
<br />
Both &quot;look&quot; cool in my opinion, but if &quot;looks&quot; are another important factor, then use that to help you decide.<br />
<br />
Yeah, humans are night-blind, but as Shad just mentioned, after a short time that won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
So, really, which race REALLY interests you the most?  :)<br />

I agree with this alot, the gear anymore in everquest is so stat-boosted that even the shadow knight race that starts with the lowest intelligence can have more then the the shadow knight race that starts with the highest intelligence.<br />
<br />
I also agree that you should pick the race that suits you, I hate the idea of playing a race of a class that is so popular when you do a &quot;/who all RACE CLASS&quot; it says &quot;list was cut short&quot;.<br />
<br />
People tell me though (i dont know if its true or not) that their friend with a Dark Elf SK could get up to 6k hp buffed, and over 200 strength, and with the strength siphons we get throughout life you really shouldn't base making your character off what the starting strength, or stamina is.<br />
<br />
I would suggest going with a Human SK if you had to pick between a dark elf, just because they are rounded race, and they aren't as popular, so you would be some-what unique in the world of Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With good gear any race SK can hit 7k hp buffed, and 255 to all relavent stats.  But that happens way down the road heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I furst want to thank those who made a reply to my topic.  As of right now, I decided to try both out.  I made a human shadowknight and a dark elf shadowknight and I am playing each one every other day to get the feel of how both races play as a shadowknight.  I'm hoping that by playing this way I can get a good decision as to which one best suits me and my playstyle.  I find the new luclin graphics for humans very nice and they look quite awesome in full plate armor thought the helm could have been done a bit better ;) .  I also find the dark elves fun to play also.  They have the pure evil look down nicely and the armor graphics on them look exquisite too, even with the helm :p .  I'm gonna try to get the newbie sk armor they both can quest for and get them to lvl 9 so they can get their spells.  By the time I do this, maybe I can come to a final conclusion on the subject.  I'm kinda leaning toward DE cause of their manapool which is nice because I like to solo alot but if humans can solo it'll be a tough decision.  If anyone who read this has more comments or ideas please feel free to respond.  Thx for the help.<br />
