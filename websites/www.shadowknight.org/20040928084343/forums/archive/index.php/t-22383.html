<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings dark brethren.  First things first, I dinged 54 last night!   :D I'm stoked. <br />
<br />
Now, I would like to venture into the realm of 2-boxing.  I have an old account (my wife used to play) that will serve me well.  Though I have various older PC parts laying around and could probably put together a new machine, it wouldn't likely amount to much and require upgrades to perform well.  My other option from what I understand is to run two instances of EQ on the same machine.  My rig isn't anything spectacular, but I think it can handle running EQ in two-fold.  My processor is somewhat weak at 1.5G, but have 1G DDR Ram and 128MB vid card.  <br />
<br />
Might anyone be able to offer suggestions as to how to set this up on one machine?  Specifically, those of you who run more than once character/account per machine, how do you have your set up.  Please include rig specs for comparison.  <br />
<br />
I'd be happy to compile any/all responses and present them in a guide type format for reference here.  Thank you very kindly for your time and consideration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that program helps a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recently built a new pc but up until about 2 weeks ago, I was running 2 instances of EQ every night on a 1ghz 640mb ram machine with an OLD hard drive and a 32mb geforce 2.  So your machine will work fine.<br />
<br />
Here are some pointers:<br />
1) Create a seperate eq folder for each instance.  You can install once and then just cut and paste the entire folder to a new location for each instance.  If you have multiple hard drives on seperate channels, then put each eq folder on a seperate hard drive.<br />
2) Put a file called &quot;nosound.txt&quot; in all except your main instance.  Having sound coming from multiple instances causes problems.  You can do the nosound thing for every instance if you don't care about sound.<br />
3) Start out with the abolute minimum graphics settings.  Go into options before log in and turn off everything that uses system resources.  Turn off all new character models.  Then, in game, turn off all particle fx, 3d sky, and lower your clipping plane as far as you can tolerate.  Once you make sure you can run with these minimum settings, add the things you want back in one at a time to see what you can handle.<br />
4) WinEQ and EQW are both widely used.  I have tried both and both work well for running multiple instances.  However, they often break with new patches and you have to do most of your own technical support.  EQ comes with a default windowed mode and yesterday's patch increased the performance of the default windowed mode.  I suggest giving that a try before bothering with 3rd party software.  It works well for me.<br />
<br />
That's the main stuff I can think of right now, other than using macros and stuff for controlling 2 characters.  If you have other questions though, please ask.  I 3box every time I play and know several others who play multiple characters fulltime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for your responses.  I don't listen to the sound much, so I'll be sure to turn off the sound in all instances.  I'm going to try the default windowed mode you suggested (with two separate EQ folders).  Last night I was trying to play with the windowed mode, but for some reason I couldn't get my mouse to &quot;leave&quot; the EQ window.  Then again, it was very late and a sleepy mind isn't always the most asture/perceptive mind.  Have you used the default windowed mode since yesterday's patch?  Which third party software do you currently use?<br />
<br />
Thanks again to both of you for your responses. I appreciate you taking the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a command to release your mouse from an EQ window.  I want to say &quot;Ctrl-shift-S&quot; but that might not be correct.  If you look in your keyboard settings in the options menu, you will see mouse release as one of the options.  I can't remember the default because I have my mouse release mapped to the ~ key.  As an alternative, you can hit your windows key to open your start menu, this will also release your mouse.<br />
<br />
EQW and WinEQ both have their own mouse release commands.  Check their documentation for details.<br />
<br />
I believe WinEQ is currently more popular than EQW and the message boards are more active.  Of the two though, I prefer EQW because I've had fewer issues with patches breaking it.<br />
<br />
I am currently using the default windowed mode though.  I used it last night after the patch and it worked great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sweet.  I'm going to give the default window mode a try tonight.  I'll remap the mouse release command to a less complicated button (like say ~).  Thank you for your insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's Alt+Shift+R to free your mouse, default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">use Ctrl+Alt+S it's default window switch it's alot faster then having to unlock mouse. i've 2boxed on the same comp with a 800 megahytz/512 mb sd ram comp and it runs just fine make sure you have all option low and clipping plane low and all models off and it runs like a dream</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gordrach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With all options off and lowered settings, do you find that you have trouble auto-following?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With all options off and lowered settings, do you find that you have trouble auto-following?<br />
Yes, I did with my old computer.  Huge problems; I gave up on auto-follow and ran each character everywhere seperately.<br />
<br />
I recently built a new computer with a 2.8ghz processor, 1gb ram, and 7200rpm 8mb cache hard drive.  Auto-follow now works quite well.<br />
<br />
My guess is that your hardware is too slow to allow auto-follow to work correctly.  I'm not sure if there is a way to correct this without buying new hardware.</div></div><hr />
