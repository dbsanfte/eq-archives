<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild is working on Corinav event...and are very close (we believe) to getting him)....<br />
<br />
On some attempts, but not all, we are having issues with the Named on the 2nd wave ending up in camp, and disrupting our rhythum in the event...and as anyone who has done the event knows....timing and rhythum very important...<br />
<br />
We had thought it might have been just poor pulling on some trys....or social aggro from one of the 1st wave mobs being pulled to camp....but last night we were comlpetely done with 1st wave for like 20 secs before 2nd wave and named spawned....with no one other than puller inside compound...2nd wave spawned and Named went straight for camp ignoring puller....<br />
<br />
wondering if it might actually be a camp placement issue?<br />
<br />
We are setting up in the SE corner of the zone, where the compound wall to the norht and the zone wall to east and south make a good ae kill spot....and is also convenient for puller to grab trash and pull over wall to raid camp...<br />
<br />
I have seen a link to the Veneration x strategy...which has camp on the middle of the north wall, directly north of compound gates ( i presume bewteen the rock and the column, which make a bit of a cul-de-sac)...<br />
<br />
Is our position in the SE corner causing us extra difficulty with pulling out the named in the first 3 waves of trash? are we better off moving to a spot like the Ven-x Camp?<br />
<br />
Anyone had similar issues? Anyone have a suggestion and rationale for a different camp site?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never had the nameds aggro the raid straight off, but I could see that happening with your raidcamp placement I guess. We tried south and north of gate (on south and north wall respectively of course), north somehow worked better for some reason.<br />
<br />
We just took him out a few weeks ago and got him once again since, handling the nameds is key and root is your friend. They corpsecamp too, if you can manage to pull them with noone aggroing them but the puller, but root is at least easier to pull off with the limited amount of time available. I should hope you know this already, just making sure.<br />
<br />
To answer your question: I'd advice moving the raidcamp so you minimize risks of named aggro off the bat. Have your contingency plans ready.</div></div><hr />
