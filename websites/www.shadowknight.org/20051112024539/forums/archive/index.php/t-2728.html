I have a reasonable start but there are still many questions, holes and uncertainties.<br />
<br />
I am submitting the following pseudo code and would greatly appreciate any discussion, corrections, observations that support or contradict it, so that we can all get a better knowledge of how this thing works.<br />
&lt;pre&gt;<br />
Result feignDeath {<br />
// is cast successful?<br />
	if ShadowKnight or Necromancer {<br />
		If outOfMana<br />
			return Result(Standing,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Insufficent Mana&quot;);<br />
		If fizzles(abjuration)<br />
			return Result(Standing,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Fizzles&quot;);<br />
		If stunned<br />
			return Result(Standing,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Casting Interrupted&quot;);<br />
		If interrupted(channeling,distance moved,damage taken?,dexterity?,?)<br />
			return Result(Standing,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Casting Interrupted&quot;);<br />
	}<br />
// was feign successful?<br />
	if Monk {<br />
		if (feignFailed(feignDeathSkill))<br />
			return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Fallen to the Ground&quot;);<br />
	}<br />
	if ShadowNight or Necromancer {<br />
		if (feignFailed(abjuration?,charisma?))<br />
			return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Fallen to the Ground&quot;);<br />
	}<br />
// Does this step exist?<br />
	for each mob {<br />
		if mob is agroed {<br />
			if mob makesSave(Magic Resistance?,?)<br />
				return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Dies&quot;);<br />
		}<br />
// Or maybe is it this instead<br />
		if mob is within somedistance(?) {<br />
			if mob makesSave(Magic Resistance?,?)<br />
				return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;Dies&quot;);<br />
		}<br />
	}<br />
// Now for some bugs that Verant didnt feel like fixing:<br />
	if mob started to cast before FD and spell lands then<br />
		return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;No Longer Feigned&quot;)<br />
// And I had suspected, and has been more confirmed by the recent changes to pets that are still breaking mezzes:<br />
	if mob started (or had decided) to swing before FD and swing lands after FD then<br />
		return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive)<br />
<br />
// Oh and one last thing...<br />
	if character gets hit by AOE spell<br />
		return Result(Fallen,SeemAlive,message=&quot;No Longer Feigned&quot;)<br />
<br />
// Wow congradulations you have succesfully Feigned<br />
	for each mob {<br />
		if mob doesnt makeSave(mobs level, Magic resistence?,?)<br />
			agro=0;<br />
	}<br />
<br />
	return Result(Fallen,SeemDead,message=&quot;Dies&quot;);<br />
}<br />
<br />
after the initial feign further tics:<br />
tic {<br />
	for each mob {<br />
		agro = agro - deltaagro(feigned?,distance away?,amount damage done?,?)<br />
	}<br />
}<br />
&lt;/pre&gt;<br />
Any information relating to this is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">06-18-2002, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly convinced that most of the oddities with feign are a result of lag, rather like the bug where people died after being completely healed, but before the healing was recorded by the server.<br />
<br />
For instance, I have never once feigned out of a melee situation and had a monster come after me once the fight was over.  Likewise, I have never been feigned and had something attack me as it walked by.<br />
<br />
If I was running away from a train and feigned successfully (i.e. no fallen message) without mobs catching up to me, they have never attacked me unless they break feign with a cast in progress.<br />
<br />
What I have found though, is that if I'm in a high lag situation, it becomes almost impossible to feign with multiple mobs on me.  If I turn my field of vision towards the ground to decrease my lag, I have far less problems.<br />
<br />
Personally, with the exception of a few bugs in the past, I think feign is intended to work 100% of the time, assuming that...<br />
<br />
You don't fall to the ground.<br />
You don't get hit with a spell while feigned.<br />
<br />
I recall Verant stating that some things had a chance to see through feign, but I get the distinct feeling that was just bullshit intended to cover up the fact that they just didn't know why it failed some times that it shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

The Avatar of War has no respect for FD... he does see through it. You can turn attack off, FD, con indiff to him and he will *still* kick your ass.</div></div><hr />

Nice summary, Krazaak :)<br />

- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sakazadroz</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about having a pet while FD?  I thought for a long time that was just a rumor, but a couple of times lately I've been smacked down while feigning with a pet up, and I'm starting to wonder again if the pet makes mobs more likely to see through your feign someohow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasasaz</div><div class="date">06-21-2002, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last couple of times I have had to FD with a pet up, the pet got the aggro. Soon as the pet is killed the mobs just wandered off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">06-21-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a pet alot and have many many times had to FD while Jaboner tried his hardest to inflict as much damage till his death.<br />
<br />
 Mobs then just wander off eventually.<br />
<br />
 /salute Jaboner</div></div><hr />

<br />
so turn off attack before you FD!</div></div><hr />
