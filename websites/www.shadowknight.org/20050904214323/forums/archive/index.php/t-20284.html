<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vincente</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres this cocky monk I always run into in the Bazaar arena. He's a member of the best guild on my server and he has about the same HP I do, if not more.<br />
<br />
He resists all of my spells, sometimes even my lifetaps.<br />
<br />
Basically, only thing I can get to stick on him for sure is my 5k HT. But the thing is, He can kill me before I can take 50% of HP from him. (He mends when I get him to 75% for the HT, so I need to take another 25%)<br />
<br />
He has crazy DPS and he often disarms me buying valuable seconds to pound on me more. <br />
<br />
<br />
He never actually killed me though thanks to my harmshield + running away like a pussy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyfe</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some ideas:<br />
<br />
As much DS as you can get, including shammy potions, on your pet too if it is targettable (I don't remember).<br />
Dispell the hell out of him using items or Nullify.<br />
Get fully buffed prefight, and get your pet fully buffed prefight. He won't have the same hp as you if he's buffless and you are raid buffed, and a raid buffed pet won't be so easy to kill.<br />
<br />
Your goal will be to kite him, either by running or with shadowstep, and never really engage him in melee.<br />
<br />
Shadowstep, dispell, shadowstep, dispell, until it seems clear he's lost his buffs, then just shadowstep, ToI until he's low enough for HT to kill him, then kill him. Meanwhile he'll either be chasing you around or trying to kill your pet, if he does attack your pet, melee him from behind. If he turns to melee you, run or SS away.<br />
<br />
ToI will definitely land, use ToV too if it tends to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DS + Pet + Shadowstep + ToI + Ignite Blood = dead Melee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyfe</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the monk is from the top guild on the server, ignite blood won't land, and prob not ToV either. Ignite is neg 100 adjust fire, you'll never touch a time person with that.<br />
<br />
Dispell, junk buffs, clickies, raid buffs, SS, pet, ToI, DS, HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DConquest</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd be surprised by how often Ignite lands... even on &quot; time geared &quot; people.  Ever fought EP mobs with neg 150 resist AoEs at 500 to all resists?  .  They also would have a ton of clickies at their disposal, our weak / rather long casting dispell isn't going to do much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyfe</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's possible the dispell could work because it takes a little while to even see where someone is when they shadowstep, especially if there's a pet getting in your face. Also, if this guy just hangs out in the Arena, you can actually set up 100%, run in fully set up, sic pet and pop off a dispell or two before he even notices you :) .<br />
<br />
It would also help if you got skelly illusion via a borrowed AoN or chanter because it would add to his confusion with you looking exactly like your pet and shadowstepping around. Also, shrink yourself totally whether you get skelly or not and shrink your pet too for additional confusion and targetting difficulty on his part. Make him fight two tiny skeletons :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the casting time on Pumice stones, anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
Our dispell cast time is horrid, but clicky wouldn't be bad.  You could also pick up some crystalline silk nets for added annoyance factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saveaux</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zbite is nearly unresistable it seems, use it. You would also be surprised how often bond of death lands.....heh theres not alot to it, just kite him. Only cast when your KNOW you have enough time to have it land. Shadowstep until you DO have enough time, if you wanna stretch it a bit. He will use discs. HS and laugh at him when he does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowblade</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless your on a pvp server bond of death and zbite wont work</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToI and pet would prolly be your best bet heh, i dont really use any other spells since they are most of the time resisted.  But ive never had a problem dueling people with just ToI and SoC up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dyrkk</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faking a unholy aura emote might get him to respond by triggering stonestance -- or whatever it is called -- prematurely. Look out for when he pops his damage disc also, this is a great time to move away asap...in terms of dps, his endurance is like what mana is to us...<br />
<br />
Also, if you are really determined...you can always just go pick up a DI buff before the fight...or will this not work in arena/duels...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">UGLA</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you jousting himi or standin toe to toe?   Since his weapon is prolly a lot better then urs, you've gotta joust'em.  <br />
<br />
You can also make urself a macro that hits disarm and bash everytime you hit the auto attack button..that makes things a lil easier against melee. <br />
<br />
Don't forget to use lich also when duelin...mana regen vs melee is the wins.  Of course ya gotta use shroud of choas and whatever cloak buff you have, and banshee aura and whatever dmg shield clickies you have available.<br />
<br />
As for spells...vs melee I'd use ignite blood and just touch of inny since its the best health for your mana.   Spears and blood of hate and ToV gets resisted too much to be tossin around vs peeps with high resists.   <br />
<br />
Oh, and when fightin in the bazaar arena or any flat surfaces..forget shadow step...it just teleports ya 4 feet away and not worth casting. <br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vincente</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips, but I'm not going to spend 2k+ on potions just to beat this guy.<br />
<br />
Also, he has this weird cancel magic item with a casting time of like .1, he dispells all my buffs by the time I reach him.<br />
<br />
DS wouldnt really matter anyway since he uses a 2h weapon, dreamer's despair it looks like.</div></div><hr />

SS around and fire taps until he's low enough to HT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From your magelo you have enough mana to cast ToI over 13 times not even counting mana regen. Without having one single crit OR even considering ID4 thats over 6110hp that your draining him. You should be able to stay over 90% the entire fight. <br />

DT shouldn't even have to be used...</div></div><hr />

He's using the pumices to debuff you, you need to have click/crap buffs on first and then spam clickies to refill those slots. Am. of Necropotence won't work with Pact of Hate, but you should be able to use jboot/coldain ring/gob earring pretty effectively during this phase.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For disarm, left click your weapon slot and an empty bag slot and put them next to each other in your hotkeys.  When he disarms you it will fall to empty bag slot.  Without having to open inventory just place weapon from bag slot back to weapon slot over in hotkey area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lufan</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Judging from what you say, just use Shadowstep and ToI. Forget about the other spells because he will resist everything. If he knows how to PvP, dont even bother wasting mana to dispel him, because it won't work. <br />
<br />
With SS, ToI and confusing him by jousting, there is no way he will beat you, with or without HT, unless you take a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks with really high resists can be nasty.  He might be using the wrist slot item that removes 3 or 4 buff slots at one time.  Can't remember what it's called.  And if they have that stun staff from time it can be tough becuase it seems to proc alot and is hard to resist.  Monks can be scary to fight because they can make your hp bar go down real fast if they have all the 2h weapon aa.  I've seen time geared monks take out time geared necros using the lt tank method.  Kinda funny to see a lifetap do an exceptional heal of 200 when you are being quaded for 300 a shot not counting the critical hit for 900+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">necros that try to lifetap tank you usually piss their pants when you straight out resists their lifetaps :o<br />
<br />
no PC is going to resist touch of inny though.<br />
<br />
if you're full health, run in and joust him, when you get down a bit, try to avoid melee and ToI him.  if you get back to full, joust again<br />
<br />
a stun-proccing 2h combined with their quad damage disc can be nasty.  not much you can do about that other than try like hell to get out of range fast<br />
<br />
if he has significantly better gear than you, you won't be able to simply lifetap him down to nothing, you need to do some good melee damage too.  he will destroy you in a stand up fight though, so you need to joust<br />
<br />
regardless of his gear, ignite blood is worth a shot or 2.  no other damage spells will be though, stick with IB and ToI.  have a hasted pet to start with as well.. the monk will probably simply demolish it near the start of the fight.. run in and smack him while he does.  also keep banshee aura up.. him using a 2h will probably hinder it's usefulness, but every little bit helps<br />
<br />
good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breaenna</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used these to kill a 65 monk...<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet with Velium Weps from GD, Augmentation of Death, and a DS.<br />
Send pet in, dispell monk, cast dark, blood, bond of death.  Shadowstep if monk is on you, if hes on pet, start using spears, and lifetaps to get him down a bit, then use leechcurse to gain some health and lower monks.  Bout 50%, I hit unholy aura and IHT.  Leaves monk flopping around like a lifeless chicken...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganaith</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, he wont catch you if you are trying to evade him, his dps is pure melee based.<br />
<br />
SS, lifetap. Thats all you need. Not getting into combat=win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ourok</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">vry nice idea kyfe.. heh.. when i fought a warrior i shadowstepped dispelled then dotted and then nuked the hell out of him... then when i knew i had him low enuff i went in and meleed him and harm touch... maybe thats why the warriors want us nerfed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakko</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems like a hard fight you cant win fast. IMO you should wear him down to 50% (after Mend is used) or so, and finish with HT....<br />
<br />
Pretty much do what Ugla told you, get a high Damage weapon and joust him.<br />
Your primary damage weapon is Touch of Innoruuk (Cant be resisted) and Ignite Blood if he doesnt resist Ignite blood to much (neg100 fire). You can also try Blood of Hate if he is close to the health you can HT him dead at (Blood of Hate is neg100 poison).<br />
<br />
If your under 90% mana and at less health than ToI will heal, dont use ToI, do a joust round more.<br />
Joust him, get a little space to him, start ToI while turning to see what he does. <br />
If he doesnt like to advance on you, sit and get mana for more ToI casting.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raven of Doom</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shadow step is one of your best friends while dueling a melee. joust right through him, keep running and shadow step before he closes the gap. lifetaps are tough to resist so keep them pumping when you've got the range for it. ignite blood is hard to resist also if i recall...so throw that on him just to negate his regen, which im sure is insane. ive beaten a few 65 melees with far superior gear to mine using hit and run tactics like this. also put up the crappy rune...it only takes like 350 dmg or so, but it may buy you a second or two in a tight spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vincente</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally kicked his ass yesterday. I used my horse to joust him like crazy. I ran around in circles with the horse and turned on attack right as I pased him. Then I would get off the horse when I got just out of cast range wait for him to run to me and lifetap him then quickly got back on horse and rode around in a circle again. At one time he just stopped in the center and proceeded to throw shurikans at me, heh. Got him down to 64% or so and HTed him, HT only hit for like 3.9k and that bastard still didnt die, took him down to like 9% or so, and he ran for safety like a little bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raven of Doom</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh...yeah ive noticed that too. Uber players are rarely willing to fight to the death...unless its someone elses death.</div></div><hr />
