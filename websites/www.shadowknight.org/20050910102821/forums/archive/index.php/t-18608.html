<br />
My friend has taken an extended break and has left his level 61 SK in my charge. Trouble is, I've never played an SK before...<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me to some good SK play guides? I've had a little look around here and, while there are some good specific hints, I'm looking for something that pulls together all of the main tactics and spells.<br />
<br />
In fact any help/hints/advice at all is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

leave your friend's SK alone.  Be a shame to ruin his good name on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
You wouldn't just pick up someone else's bard and try and play it at a high level without having gone through the learning experiences of lower levels.  Twisting is just way too precise to really be any good without having practiced for quite a while, and at 61, there who will be people very much counting on you to do your job well, and who will be seriously pissed off if you flub.<br />
<br />
If he's your friend, and you want him to stay that way, leave his character and his reputation where they are; at the log in screen.<br />
<br />
If you want to play an SK, roll up your own and play, or go to Test and /testbuff one to learn with if you can't stand the thought of leveling up to 25 again on a new toon.<br />
<br />
No class in the game is really all that difficult to play, but all of them take practice and some very specific knowledge that doesn't necessarily port over to the other classes.</div></div><hr />

Definately mess around with death peace (sks 60 fd spell).  Learn which spells get you agro.  Do a search on agro and or pulling and you should find all the information you need.  Those 2 thing would be the biggest thing to teach to a new sk IMO.  Oh and some SK board advice, A) always search 1st and if search doesnt turn up with what you need B) ask specific questions.  People dont like repeating info, but will gladly share on new topics.</div></div><hr />

Come to think of it, just delete the char, you'll be doing your friend a service by making sure he isn't tempted to come back.:D</div></div><hr />

And if it's not an Iksar and didn't have to learn to sneak rides on boats to get to Antonica and move through the sewers, he had it way too easy anyway and should rebuild ~~~~~p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyfe</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reality is that what some folks here are saying is true. It is phenomenally easy to destroy a character's reputation. One single group in which you stunningly suck, and you can have five different guilds of 100 people each discussing how lame you are.<br />
<br />
I was in a group with a 60+ pally who was horrible, I still remember his name months later, and will never group with him again.<br />
<br />
So, if you seriously want to play the character, have a long discussion with your friend about how it works, do some reading around here, ask specific questions, and practice solo before you inflict yourself on others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saveaux</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to give you the normal sk.org asshole talk but figured that since you went through the trouble of making a screenname that you deserved something.....<br />
<br />
Yes, &quot;search&quot; here at sk.org is your friend, but unfortunately if you don't know what to search for then I suppose your back to square one. I would recommend:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/ --- For class spells, familiarize yourself with the sk spells to begin with.<br />
<br />
            If you've played eq before, which it sounds like you have then you know that sk are good at tanking because of the aggro that we can generate and keep. You will hear many people argue whats the best aggro spell we have. we have the &quot;terror&quot; line spells (terror of terris, terror of thule, terror of darkness) which generate decent close range aggro. We also have &quot;Clinging Darkness&quot; and &quot;Fear,&quot; both of which generate good aggro. I personally use clinging dark unless I am with a chanter that is mezzing, in which case I will use fear.<br />
         I would suggest getting pickup groups in the Plane of Valor and be dps to start with (using slash, spear of plague, festering darkness, as well as the torrent spell lineup if you need extra stats, and whatever else you want to use depending on mana). When you feel that you want to be puller / MT go to the right or left castle out in pov and learn how to pull singles. I personally pull with festering darkness and then hit with clinging dark before it hits the camp. That will be enough aggro generated that the slower will NOT get aggro, even with a malos/tash + slow. I would suggest overkill on the clinging darkness at first. Cast alot so that you don't lose aggro and let the mob ping-pong damage in the group which will just make you look bad. Overkill on the aggro and then lighten up untill you find whats perfect. <br />
        bah I'm bored now......go level your own sk =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Learn the ropes as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexa</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Log on to the test server and /testbuff yourself a level 25 SK.<br />
<br />
Play around with that character until you are comfortable, browse sk.org for random bits of information <br />
<br />
Once you feel you are comfortable, find a group in a mildly-challenging environment, i.e. low blue mobs that come single.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be a brain surgeon to play a SK contrary to what some people here will have you believe.</div></div><hr />
