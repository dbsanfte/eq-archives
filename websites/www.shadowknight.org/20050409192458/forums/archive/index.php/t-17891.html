<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit level 31 and with LDON going on, FD pulling seems to be a lost art and no need. Basically Im looking for some advice where I could take a shaman and enchanter to go practice some fd pulling. Both are my friends so they wont mind but I dont want to be killing groups with my lame ass no good sk FDing at higher levels. I know Cazic Thule used to be great for this but times have changed and that place is a no go for 30. Ya, I know I got an enchanter but I need to learn this stuff if I want to be a well rounded SK with all the skills :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since CT moved out to Feerott, FD split there.  The lizards are close together on the pyramids and you can work on your Darkforge while there.  The money isn't bad there either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In a couple levels (35 or so) pack up your crew and head to the Tentacle Terror tunnel in Crystal Caverns.  That was where I practiced indoor FD pulling.  Plenty of mobs for you at that level with a couple of groupmates, they hit fast, and occasionally hard, so you have incentive to get it right, and they're scattered around the tunnel in unfortunate configurations that make getting singles a real pain in the ass, but when you've figured it out, you'll be set for just about anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I learned how to do it in Crystal Caverns, Camp at the bottom ramp, leading to the ice caves that lead to the dwarf town.  Practice FD pulling all the orcs down there.  You'll get good xp, velium for loot, learn how to fd pull and faction for the dwarves down there.  Fear kiting works down there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try a spec camp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kromglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the advice. Didnt dawn on me either to pratice outside on camps too soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chozzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try the two rangers at the Druid spires in WC. Thats where I learned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I learned alot of splitting, aggro, and terrain techniques when I used to exp in the Hole.  Kael Arena is good too.  To be a successful puller you need to know all the &quot; monk &quot; tricks ( using proximity, walls, stairs, warping, as well as other terrain ), as well as the SK ones ( snare, using pet, cancel magic, etc ).  Put them together and you can get almost any tough pull down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Once you get Engulfing Darkness, you'll be able to Snare pull. <br />
Clinging works too but often fades before the unsnared mob(s) walks away.<br />
People will think you are uber once you get to PoV and bring one each time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GROKKITT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Youll get a feel for it. Kind of like the way you know a mob is in spell range before you cast. Its mostly a matter of room, you need enough room for your spell bar to refresh so you can cast FD after dark. But of course you wanna get your drop n flop off before the unsnared add gets to you as the regular feign death is a bitch to cast when mobs are beating you. Theres other things, like pets cause problems sometimes if the mob gets a hit off on you. Theres a few basic things like that and the rest will just come naturally. Make sure that your casting spells are maxed.<br />
It will become second nature. <br />
<br />
Just choose a spot with alot of room to start out and as you get better you can move to tighter quarters. Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
