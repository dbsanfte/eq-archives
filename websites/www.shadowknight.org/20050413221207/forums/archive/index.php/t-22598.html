<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mittens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, I am returning to EQ after a year or so off, never played a SK before and wanted to give one a go (iksar).<br />
<br />
At anyrate, I am now level 19 and grouping a lot - the SK is quite different than I am used to -- never had a pet class before (played a bard and cleric).<br />
<br />
My ultimate goal is to gain enough power to kill dwarves in their home lands... good yes?  That unfortunately is still sometime away... in the meantime, I am wondering if there is a good solo guide around I could check out?  Do you guys fear kite, or just get a pet up, cast and melee toe to toe against mobs?<br />
Wow, lifespike for 11hp (lvl 15) sure seems feeble :)<br />
<br />
Is there a common tactic that is used by SKs throughout their levels? ie With a bard swarm kiting worked marvels throughout all levels.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I must be a retard or something then as I made sure I did poke around before posting that.  Though most of the messages I read were people chewing out other people for not poking around :o<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link and sorry in advance to the others who read this and it boils their blood!<br />

Edit: ok, now I feel even more stupid :)  I clicked that link and it took me to the hunting ground page.  I am trying to find out info about tried and true methods of soloing / spells etc.  ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Branuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, old thread but this is a topic I'm interested in.  And if your looking for step by step, sorry I'm much to random for that.<br />
<br />
Right now with Omens that task system is great because it will point you to mobs that you can solo.  So if you can, do a couple of those to find the mobs that work well, also use that hunting guide on these forums.<br />
<br />
First thing you do, is do the quest for the antique ring.  It's a mana preservation 2 ring that's simple to get.  Shouldn't be a problem.  It starts in Plane of Knowledge and all the bits for it are easy to get.<br />
<br />
The tactics I use while solo'ing are pretty standard fair.  Mind you I'm new to SK's, and haven't been in more then 4-5 groups since starting the class, so I haven't a clue about pulling without mez/pacify/croud control.  And I most always work in outside zones.<br />
<br />
For solo work I use three spells on myself, vampiric emprace (whatever that proc'ing life tap is), grim aura, and scream of hate (the atk drain/buff).  I don't use the strength tap to buff myself though since I don't have the spell slots.  I also have FD mem'ed.  That's four out of eight spell slots.<br />
<br />
The other four slots are invisibility (since I'm hunting around Dreadlands/Frontier Mountains/Overthere other wise it has the life tap), engulfing darkness (for snare/dot), heart flutter (dot), and fear.<br />
<br />
I start by finding a safe spot to pull to, adds suck when solo'ing.  For the Dreadlands the sides of Karnor's is good, or up as far as you can go on the east wall (with the FV zone).<br />
<br />
I cast invis to avoid some mobs.  I go and find my mark, say a stonegazer cockatrice, I look around for a good path between mobs to my safe spot (up the zone wall).  I get some distance between myself and the cockatrice, cast  engulfing darkness, run a little bit cast heart flutter, quickly look around for mobs, then run to my hill.  I stop every once in while to make sure the chicken is still there.  Once I get to the hill I sit and med (I hate medding and since I use bandages for healing 70% health is full health so I med when I can).  Once the chicken shows I cast scream of hate, and then I start the beat down.  If mana's good I'll recast heart flutter.  I try to have mana to recast engulfing once the chicken's at 40% because he'll take off at around 20% or so.<br />
<br />
That's my kite to kill spot technique.  Yes you could have a pet, with taunting turned off.  But then you have to remember where your pet's parked at.  Don't bring him along for scouting because he just gets agro, and you can't be invis so you have be more careful scouting out.<br />
<br />
Over in Burning Wood I've hunted cinder hornets using a combination kite (agro kiting they call it) and fear kite.  Starting at the hornets nest I tag a cinder with engulfing, heart flutter, and heat blood.  I kite the bugger up west wall (I think that's it) toward Skyfire.  Reason being is that there's lots of agro in Burning, and Skyfire is my safe way out of the zone if things go bad.<br />
<br />
So I'm kiting this hornet from the hornet nest up to Skyfire, I do stop and recast the dot's.  I do this until I get almost to the ruins south of the Skyfire zone valley.  Once there I fear the hornet with dot's and me beating him.<br />
<br />
After he dies, it's med and bandage time.<br />
<br />
That's my tactic's for soloing.  Find a safe spot, pull with snare/dot, add another dot if mana permits.  If you can toe to toe, cool.  If not, then kite it to a safe area, then fear kite it.  If it looks like it's going to run across another mob, by all means don't pursue.  Let fear break and he'll come back to you.<br />
<br />
That's about it.  Use what you learned with the bard kiting and it's the same.  Snare, dot, run, run, snare, dot, run, run.<br />
<br />
Now the group stuff I don't get.  I know how to get agro an all, but the rest I don't get.  That's the tactics example I need.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps somehow.</div></div><hr />
