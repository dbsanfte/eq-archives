<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ruj &quot;Dark Temptation&quot; 36 points. <br />
<br />
Thats not really 36 pts is it? heh if so maybe i should go complete a rujarkan dungeon and get it for pvp mez breaking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi there,<br />
<br />
I've been away for a long time and have some question about those spells =)<br />
<br />
I got all my spells till 65, except those Ldon thingies.. What are the stacking issues with Call of Darkness ? It looks like the winner but I am cautious with those stacking issues.<br />
<br />
Does it stacks with Call of bone ? Aura of hate ? SoP ? FAvatar ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">doesn't stack with PRED line, went and made a rujarkan group and got my dark temptation spell heh too bad it doesn't break mez though =\ well still its nice for when i 3box with bst+cleric and will hold me over till i get 1492 in miraguls and can start spending those points i have saved from other dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you have to outdamage your regen in order to break mez.  neither of the ldon atk buffs does enough to outpace standing regen on a level 60+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any dot will break PvP mez, even our LDoN atk buff spells.  I have a decent amount of regen from aa / EP gear effects, and Dark Temp still broke mez when I dueled a chanter friend.  <br />
<br />
Call of Darkness is 50 &quot; raw atk &quot; comes out like 70 ish atk when I use it.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't always group with rangers to get SoP.  Yes, it stacks with FA, Pact of Hate, etc.  Anything SoP would stack with.  <br />
<br />
The undead nuke is extremely nice... with focus I land nukes for 1k+ quite often, not to mention the 1800 - 1900+ crits.  Not useful for most raiding, but it does boost your LDoN DPS quite a bit since you can use it and Spear of Decay as a combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I only have the 2nd Scythe atm &amp; I cant wait to get them both :)<br />
<br />
I will mem 2 Scythes and 2 Spears just so i can chain crit some undead mob to hell and back again.  (the annoy our wiz)<br />
<br />
If i get 4 crits in a row with those four spells on one mob, thats like.... 1500, 1900, 950, and 860, or something along that lines... in about 10 sec.  Woot I can almost be a Rogue/Wiz!<br />
