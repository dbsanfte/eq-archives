<br />
1. Spear of Decay (nearly Always here only replaced Bys Scythe of Innoruuk in zones like Veksar)<br />
2. Touch of inny    (always)<br />
3. Festering Darkness (always)<br />
4. Death peace (ALWAYS!)<br />

Normal Configuration... Slots 5-7 change to reflect situation.<br />
<br />
Mosty i have Cloak of Luclin, Shroud of Hate and Call of Darkness up. If no chanter available PoH too, and i still have serious mana problems if i always cast my spell if available. I have Druids/Rangers/Necros do the snare job for me in the last week and that makes me mana last a longer but it still goes down way to fast for my understanding. Any tips from the Pro's ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At a quick glance, you seem to have decent INT and mana regen.  <br />
<br />
All I generally do, in xp groups, is cast enough spells to hold aggro (using CD) and cast taps only when I need it (more than 1 bubble of health down).  I don't use spears much any more but when I did, I would save it for killshots on gaters more than for anything else.  I generally don't use dot's in xp groups either.<br />
<br />
My philosophy for xp groups is that I'm not a damage dealer per se, so I don't try to do spell dps (doesn't mean I'm right) and leave the dps to rogues/rangers and nukes to wizards/druids.  I just try to keep the mob's attention so the rest can go all out.<br />
<br />
A fellow guild SK and I (both 65's) sometimes alternate pulling and MT'ing in adventures and xp groups.  He undoubtedly puts out more dps than me via spells but he's usually hovering around the 20% mana mark; whereas I would be at 80% doing the same job.  No doubt we are at the extremes and it's no doubt best to be somewhere in the middle (me add dps, him hold back a bit).  Usually the only time I expend a lot of mana is while duoing (no use me being FM and my alt being LOM) or when the crap hits the fan (i.e. bad pull or imminent wipe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see no mention of it, but... It is pretty common practice to use Mental Corruption as you proc buff. I don't see that mentioned in your post.<br />
<br />
If you can average 2 - 3 procs a fight, that is an extra 200-300 mana per fight.<br />
<br />
I often have a BeastLord (10 mana regen) and a Bard (20+ mana regen) and a Chanter (18 mana regen) and I still find myself using Mental Corruption at times, over SoC. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>strag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I often have a BeastLord (10 mana regen) and a Bard (20+ mana regen) and a Chanter (18 mana regen) and I still find myself using Mental Corruption at times, over SoC <br />
<br />
good lord, how do you use all that mana with mental corruption proccing?  Chain ToI?  With bst, brd and chanter in never sitting always killing groups and SoC I have trouble using my mana fast enough if I'm tanking.  (in ldon that is, in the planes is a bit diff)<br />
<br />
Crot, try swapping Festering with clinging, and maybe give MC a try.  And maybe only use Inny when your lower on life/have spare mana? Not sure if you are using it as a nuke a lot or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ToI has a base mana cost of 330, Festering costs 175 mana, and Spear costs 225...using all 3 of these as much as you can is really inefficient.<br />
<br />
If you are getting healed reliably in your group, then the benefit of constant lifetap healing from ToI is negated, leaving you with just a costly dd.<br />
<br />
With Festering, you are using a spell with a 2 minute duration on mobs that die in 30 seconds sometimes (LDoN easy groups especially). Clinging darkness is 20 mana for a passable snare and solid aggro...and you can cast it basically 9 times for the cost of one Festering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only use SoC on Raids... any other time that involves fast pulls and lots of taunting, MC is the key.  Also, Festering Darkness is a mana killer.  Learn to appreciate CD.  Try to use ToI as little as possible.  BoH is your best DPS spell, but also very mana intensive.   SoD is your best grouping DPS spell imo.  I have a pretty good mana pool / regen and a 30 percent DoT mana reduction focus and still can't keep up with BoH on every exp mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My usual setup is<br />
<br />
1. Festering Darkness<br />
2. Touch of Inny<br />
3. Aura of Pain (I usually tank)<br />
4. Zevfeer's Bite<br />
5. Death Peace<br />
6. Blood of Hate/Spear of Decay/Aura of Hate (depending on general mana usage, grp composition.)<br />
7. Pact of Hate<br />
8. Mental Corruption<br />
<br />
I usually duo box, so as little spell swapping as possible is one of my aims, and I get to spend all the mana I can, and festering is a lot better for splitting mobs that for sure will one-round jobober, not to mention CD will let the mobs walk back to spawn anyway, so that's hardly usefull for darkness splitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Use CD instead of Festering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saveaux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have the INT and MANA regen but your still having a problem then maybe your not rationing your mana effectively. Theres never a point to use mana untill your 20m and then start conserving just to hover over 25m. If your going to hover over anything why not 80m? If I start to dip below 75m I might tell myself to not cast anything untill MC procs. This is a decent way to conserve mana so you can use it more effectively. <br />
<br />
The only way that I can stay over 90m while being DPS is to put on all my pvp gear (which has alot more INT.) <br />
Looking at your gear you lack any worthy mana on the following items:<br />
Bracer - try a bracelet of comprehension? (15int) <br />
Neck - try a amulet of unseen horrors? (10int 75m)<br />
Waist - MM ldon 510ap Belt of gray flesh? (12sta,10int,10agi,55hp,45m)<br />
<br />
Sometimes you just need a bigger mana pool. You will only drop around 80hp for a gain of around 305m with these changes. 300m is enough to get one more spell off that you normally wouldn't be able to. Even 500hp isn't a big deal to drop to me even while tanking. Whether you have 6.5khp or 7khp while tanking your still going to get healed (supposing your doing a good aggro job which EVERY sk should not have a prob with) by the healer....<br />
<br />
<br />
I bored now....</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are good reasons to hover at 20-25m instead of 80m.  If you lose a group member (death, group turnover), end an adventure, or are just travelling to another area after fighting for awhile, why not use that time to gain back mana?  I hate being FM because that only means I've missed an opportunity to earn some more.  So why not burn down 80% of your mana pool during the night?  You earn it back when you camp, travel, lfg, bank, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My normal LDON spell setup is now:<br />
<br />
Touch of Inny<br />
Blood of Hate<br />
MC<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
Augmentation of Death<br />
Pact of Hate (swap out for Spear of Decay if I have KEI/VoQ)<br />
Zeefer's Bite<br />
Death Peace<br />
<br />
I am normally puller and MT on normal LDON missions (my gear is crap, so no way I can tank hard missions), and I always keep myself buffed with MC, pet buffed with Augmentaion of Death, cast Clinging Darkness 2-3 times per mob for agro and snare, and one Blood of Hate per mob when I have mana to spare, and leave it out if not. I have a Ceramic Gavel of Justice (saves 25% of mana cost on DOTs) and I find if you pull with Blood of Hate, it wears off just a few seconds before the mob dies (meaning it lasts the full length of the DoT), which means it's a very efficient use of mana for DPS. If I'm low on hp and the cleric/druid can't heal me fast enough I'll use ToI to keep alive. I'll use Zbite when needed too. The ONLY times I have mana problems are when MC or Pact wore off and I didn't notice, then I recast them and am gtg again.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From your post I assume you're talking about grouping, which means you're usually tanking so your main mana expenditure is on holding aggro and/or snaring.<br />
<br />
It looks like you're using Festering and spears as your staple aggro; both are relatively inefficient in terms of the aggro they give you for mana expended.<br />
<br />
On level 55+ mobs (i.e. exp groups), your best overall aggro spell is fear (100% resisted but still gives great aggro), and your best snap (quick) aggro spell is clinging darkness for when you don't have 2 seconds to land fear, or an unslowed heavy hitter might keep interrupting fear (or when some mobs might be lower than level 55).<br />
<br />
Use these and you can drop Voice since you won't have a problem holding aggro.<br />
<br />
The ideal in exp groups is to land fear while the mob's inc (or pull with it) then cast it whenever it refreshes.  If there might be fearable mobs around, do the same with clinging darkness but slow down on the cast rate after the first few seconds.<br />
<br />
Additional sources of mana regen are:<br />
Druid Bot9 if available (8 mana per tick)<br />
BST SD if available (9 mana per tick)<br />
Mental corruption<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'd suggest you put 2 points into Spell Casting Expertise AA (so fear and CD won't fizzle) and some more into mental clarity (every little helps).<br />
<br />
Just my own opinions though; I know other people use different methods of holding aggro and do very well with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>newtank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">your dex is 174<br />
<br />
If you not getting it to 305 you are losing mana<br />
<br />
305 gives about 2 proc per min at 100 mana recorse at lvl 65.  See Window's proc parse posts  <br />
<br />
So 10-15 dex==FT1 with MC<br />
<br />
You may be able to increase your dex for more mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Like others have said, ditch Festering for Clinging as a huge start.  I run a setup similar to yours, and I very rarely have problems with mana, and that is only when I have crap healers forcing me to tap all the time.  Typically I use my spear every time it ungrays until I am below 50m, then I'll lay off until procs from MC/mana regen get me up to 80m or so, then I'll lay back in again.  Normally though I can go to town with that one spear and still not have problems for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spears for aggro is bad<br />
<br />
<br />
I will figure out some way to be at about 20m by the end of an adventure, no matter what buffs I have,   not like you get extra points for being FM at the end.<br />

Did 3 normal ruj last night with soc over MC,  MC wouyld have been better, but it was a nice experiment.<br />

I only have FT2 and usually don't get into mana problems. If I dip below 50% I hold back aura of hate until the next mob, or something similar to that. I like to stick around 50%m, so if I start getting Mind Wrack or MC starts proc'n like mad I use the extra mana I just gained for extra DPS. I feel sticking around FM is a waste, you are wasting you regen, MC procs, and Mind Wracks. I try to utilize all the mana I'm getting.<br />
<br />
I think there is a skill, in knowing how to hold aggro with out using too much mana, and efficiently using your DPS spells so you don't over do it and get low on mana. At the end of adventures, when I pretty much know it's going to end within 5minutes I use all my mana.</div></div><hr />

Because I don't use spears or dot's (a topic for criticism in itself hehe) during adventures, it does mean I have ZB + 2 taps (ToI and ToV) up at all times.  I also hold back on HT and discs (old mentality here) meaning in an emergency, I can: use maxed Leech Touch for 1500 insta-tap (with chance to crit/exe for 3000 and double crit/exe for 6000), Leech Curse disc for melee hit heals for 30 secs, and chain ZB, ToI and ToV (generally one of those will always be up when I have to chain tap).  Now, I can only sustain that output for a couple minutes to go from FM to OOM but can unload when I have to.  The thing is, how often does this occur?  Honestly, not very often -- but I like to be ready 'just in case'.</div></div><hr />

Make that 1 or 2 proc per fight, even less in LDON as mobs tend to die so fast... Other than that I totally agree with Rhumba, in the same situation I always use MC over SoC. <br />

Am I using way to much mana ? Sure sir ! It's called DPS isn't it ? I am chain casting Zev and Aura, and very often using ToI as it's never resisted. I lack on the FT side =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Are you using festering every fight? Even if the mob doesn't run?<br />
<br />
I tend not to use my lifetaps unless i think the healer need a spot heal, or they are dead or close to dead. Sure it's DPS, but I'd worry more about aggro and tanking than DPS.<br />
<br />
Also I find CD to be an ok snare even if the mob takes a few extra steps when trying to walk away. At one time I used festering for aggro and snare, but now unless I'm kiting, I rarely even mem festering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I only us festering if the mob runs (or im not sure if he will) or to gain aggro very fast. im not a friend of DC cuz it lasts ony 30 seconds.

LifeTaps will only be used if i have lost Hp's or if a mob is runnin and i need a finishing nuke and my spear is down.<br />
I usually stop usin spells when i drop 40% mana to keep some reserves. With MC i can keep my mana from dropin to fast so that i can do and adv where i have to snare and get out with some mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naeldaar Blackhearted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">CD isn't really a spell you cast for the snare (though it does stop movement entirely once the mob drops below about 9%), but rather for the aggro. If you're tanking, the 30 second duration shouldn't really matter, since chances are you're going to be casting it more than once every 30 seconds. Personally, I like to hit with at least 3 clinging as fast as they refresh, and then a clinging every 15-20 seconds as necessary to hold aggro. Early in the fight (usually after the first clinging gets the mob's attention) I'll generally toss my spear in for a bit of extra quick aggro, depending on my mana. This is especially useful pre-slow when interrupts on a longer cast like CD are more likely. My normal set up looks like this:<br />
<br />
1 ToI (always)<br />
2 Festering (always)<br />
3 Clinging if I'm MT, Terror otherwise (when offtanking adds waiting for mez, dot = bad)<br />
4 ZB<br />
5 Spear<br />
6 Aura of Pain if MT, Aura of Hate otherwise<br />
7 Aura of Hate if MT and grouped with a chanter, switch between Aug. of Death/MC/Pact of Hate otherwise<br />
8 Death Peace (always)<br />
<br />
If I'm fighting 100% disease resistant mobs like in CoD or BoT south/NW tower, slots 4, 5, 6, 7  get set to Blood of Hate, Ignite Blood, Voice, MC.<br />
<br />
I like to stay around 50m when tanking so I can tap 5 or 6 times before I OOM should I run into trouble, but I'll burn down to 20m then lower my mana usage over the next couple while I regen back up if I'm not. I generally use MC over SoC, depending on role and what I have in the way of mana regen - more is obviously better, get 9/symbol instead of virtue when you can, beast crack etc. I also have VoQ almost all the time, but I'll normally use pact instead of kei if VoQ isn't available and if I don't have other mana regen spells on - every point helps. <br />
<br />
Generally I do more pop than ldon, so I stay mounted most of the time as it helps med between pulls without having to bother with sitting and standing (hard on food but easier on mana) - tanking while mounted takes some getting used to but it's pretty easy once you get into it.  As for HT, I burn it as soon as it's up unless I'm raiding. The group I normally hunt with is dependable enough that we're always safe without me having to do anything exceptionally heroic, and having HT sitting doing nothing becomes nothing more than a waste of good dps.<br />
<br />
Also, if you hate clinging's small snare and can't keep mana up with festering, consider using dooming as your hard snare instead - it's only 1% less movement reduction than festering, only costs 2/3 the mana, and lasts a lot longer than the average life expectancy of most pop exp or ldon mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The CD verses festering debate is a decent one. Im in the festering camp. Mainly cause I have logged my dps and for me, the loss in dps of continual CD'n is greater than the dps increase from being able to cast an extra spear (or &lt;insert yer fav dps spell here&gt;).<br />
<br />
On LDONS I fester/fear then beat the crap outa it.<br />
<br />
On the very rare ocasion that i have agro issues I just bring up a vissage and its fixed.<br />
<br />
I like using a pet as well, cause im pretty sure some of the pets agro is passed to you (50% since the great pet agro nerf according to the stuff i read).<br />
<br />
When I do ldons stuff dies so fast I need to be ready for the next incoming mob once the current one is around 10%, cause bardy blast past usually cant take a lot of a beating and runs around screaming &quot;ouch ouch, get it off me&quot;.<br />
<br />
The extra surety of snare and agro makes it all worthwhile for me.<br />

I only have FT2 but i find no problem keeping the mana up, although that will be fixed soon as i begin to aug up my tak armor.<br />

Anyway, you save mana by ensuring that anything that comes near the group hits you and no one else, and thereby allowing the healers to do more nukin.<br />

 <br />
<br />
You say that you lose dps having to continually cast CD instead of your spears (or &lt;insert &quot;yer&quot; fav dps spell here&gt;) Do you have a different spear than me? My spears take 45sec to recast. Zbite, and both auras take awhile as well. Supposing that your using both spears, zbite, and both auras thats 5 spells. 5spell gems that are grayed out. 2 spellgems left open. ToI for myself and Clinging. Considered over half my spells are grayed out I have no problem casting CD however many times it takes to keep aggro (which is not many.) <br />
<br />
Assuming that you have an assist set to the puller, you should be able to get CD cast on the inc mob before anyone else has a chance to hit it with anything, 2 more chain clinging and I keep everyone aggro free the rest of the fight. Even if you /assist to the inc mob when your current mob is at 10% you should be fine as most ldon mobs don't attack under 9% (unless enrage)</div></div><hr />

Ive had a stab at parsing a few adv's and known camps (like beeeez in bot) and trying to figure out the best way, but its a hotly debated topic, and people have many oppinions.<br />
<br />
Cause sometimes higher dps for you = lower dps for everyone else, its a ballancing act, and a tough one to get right.<br />
<br />
However, for burst dmg cast yer arse off.<br />
<br />
My current strategy Festering + Fear + Pet.<br />
<br />
KEI or etc: Chain zephers.<br />
No KEI etc: Hold Zephers in reserve for when the mana is low, the chain it for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
How do you know when your ahead of the game?<br />
<br />
The cleric will ask for a haste 8P<br />
<br />
In any case, its a lovely opiniated area that is open fer debate.<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Oh and another thing, its amazing the diff 10 points in MR will make in a ldon. I went from 90mr (with std buff) to 118mr with my tak bp + aug, and the difference it made was great.<br />
<br />
When yer stunned and slowed agro is hard.<br />
<br />
I tend to always tap MR, so i sit on about 140 in adv's now.<br />
<br />
I think for me, this was the most significant agro holding step ive really paid attention to so far, case it matters when the action is frantic, and the casters are trying to nuke yer down.<br />
<br />
I think the sweat spot for MR in LDON's seems to be around the 130 - 140 mark.<br />
<br />
Has anyone also moticed any significant MR points of difference in other zones?<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />
