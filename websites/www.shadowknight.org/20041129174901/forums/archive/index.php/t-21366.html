Anyhoo, what's the deal with the quests you get at the Tabernacle. Both time's I've complete one, I get some item I can't even use. Most recently, it was a Lore, No-Drop item - and I can't even use it! WTF!<br />
<br />
Any advice on this issue, plus any general advice for total SK beginners welcome.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure which quest you are doing either, as I'm not familiar with the Tabernacle or the NPC's there.  If you could list the quest giver's name that would help.  Or the item you are getting when you complete the quest.<br />

I'd recommend talking to Faratain, the newbie sk armor quest guy, and doing those.  They are fairly easy, close by (Toxx Forrest and Warrens), and it will be good armor into your 30's.  Plus you'll gain exp doing ther quest and should be around 15th when you complete it.</div></div><hr />
