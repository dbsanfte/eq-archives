<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lochnes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a 37 SK and DSP solo xp seemed to be getting pretty slow so I headed to DL only to find that I was still a few levels low for the area.  I since have visited crystal caverns, but there are rarely ever groups there and I'm afraid to go too deep for fear of having to retrieve my corpse in the case of death.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone offer some advice on hunting grounds for my level?<br />
<br />
Thanks!:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">best bet would be to check out the &quot;list of hunting grounds v2.10&quot; thread at the top of the page.......   <br />
<br />
As for me i solo'd all the way to 50 with my sk.. try OT Fear kiteing down the SF tunnel that works well if you cant find a group.<br />
<br />
I always hated sitting around LFG so, go LFG and fear Kite =) youll get exp and not wast time sitting around.</div></div><hr />

Kill and enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with the above poster who said the old world zones rock. Try grabbing a druid and go duo in Kaesora. Awesome xp, loot and very managable pulling. I say druid cuz it will make getting out a lot easier, but can be done with any type of healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can also do cave basilisks in Jaggedpine Forest in the caves. not far from where the TP gem from Blackburrow will bring you.  Just hang a right when you get to the gnoll fort, it's not hard to miss.  You can single pull the basilisks, just watch out for the genitors, since they will aggro if you get too close.  Genitors also drop eggs which sell well in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shriva Akheva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd say Gunthak beach of undead.  No running makes it easy to focus.  Have gained 50% in about a half hour solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kaesora.  Fun zone, fairly consistant mob level to facilitate crawling start to finish, awesome exp, good loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Killing in Kaesora will hurt your VS faction, if you are planning to quest the OT Hammer, which is one of the best quests for our class.  At your level, you can gain decent xp killing the Sarnaks, and the Bezerkers drop the braids for the hammer.  There's no reason not to be in good with the outpost by level 40, and have the hammer, unless you're a lizard SK, which will make the quest difficult.  <br />
<br />
That hammer is is still great, and saves making gate potions with my Shaman.  Those puppies still cost about 160 plat to make.  I just duel him in a zone to gate, or use it on a mob.<br />
<br />
You didn't say which race, but unless you're a lizard, there's no reason not to get the xp killing the Bezerkers at your level, and get the hammer as well.  Later on, you can dump the faction and invis when you land on the boat, or just train the PoK book, which always makes friends with the HE cleric or pally medding next to it.</div></div><hr />
