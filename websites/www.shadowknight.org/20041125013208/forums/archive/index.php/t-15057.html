<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been looking at various fear spells sks get and have experience with the druid line. My thoughts on them are &quot;why the hell don't they all have the same duration?&quot; Is it so hard to just have them all at say 45secs or a minute, with a chance for resists like root, and just level cap em at the level at or before you get the next one? <br />
<br />
Would that be gamebreaking? I know it's not fair as in the mob won't be able to hit back. Kiting does the same thing so I don't see how it would be. It would only encourage fearkiting earlier. <br />
<br />
Ps I did a search and found no topics on this and noting within the first page of all the results. So if it was mentioned I looked kinda;) .<br />
<br />
edit: changed title to fear thoughts as it's just the musings of a newb sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well they don't have the same duration because you're meant to increase with power as you gain levels. So Invoke Fear is an upgrade to Fear. Simple as that really. <br />
<br />
There was something of a movement to get the Fear cap lifted so people could fear-kite in PoP, but that appears to have pretty much died a death due to lack of response on the dev's part, and using Fear as a useful aggro spell on the players part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DiggleDoggyfeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The upgrade thing is why I said add a level cap to the level you get the new fear... I see nothing wrong with having them all the dame duration, then again, I'm not too experienced in fearkiting as I usually just outright kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elraxes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I have used Fear over Envoke Fear, when kiting in a tight area.  I'd rather have to recast, and keep the mob close to my camp, then have it move into a pathing lane, and pick up adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just about to say that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this mean that mobs in PoP are unfearable? Is this all mobs or just some. What exactly is the &quot;fear cap.&quot;<br />
<br />
I ask because my best weapon is a Polished Obsidian Great Axe but obviously most times it sits bagged due to the proc. Should a mob be unfearable I could use it without worrying about problems. <br />
<br />
Along this same line does fear have a large agro effect? This could also be a nice side effect for me using this weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think level 58 is the cap for fear working. Normal mobs, anyway. So anything over that is unfearable.<br />
<br />
Yes, fear can be used as an aggroer. It has the same +hate as a tash or malosi or snare type spell. But don't use it unless the mob is immune! (duh) It works great in BoT for the giants (all above 62), but the lessers (whichever) are below level 58 (they are Dire Charmable, so under 46?) and are fearable. Made that mistake a couple times, just instinctively hitting my fear spell hotkey and nearly training my group.<br />
It can be dangerous if you get complacent or don't know what you're doing, so use fear as a hate inducer with caution.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was 55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would love to see a fear spell for us that works on mobs over lvl 55. Or even an aa type thing would be good.</div></div><hr />
