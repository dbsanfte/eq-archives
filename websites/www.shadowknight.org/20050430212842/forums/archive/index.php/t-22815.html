<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find myself enjoying the task system in Omens, perhaps just because it gives me an excuse not to deal with idiots, but I was wondering if anyone else had done any tasks and what they have thought?<br />
<br />
I've done 1 short, 2 medium, and 2 long tasks all taking place in the temple of Droga or the Mines of Nurga.  Having soloed there it was a great help knowing a little about the zone.<br />
<br />
I can say that at lvl 65 a medium task will get you 1 gold AA exp and 116 plat, whlie a longer one will get you 8 Blue AA exp and 175 plat.<br />
<br />
Although I tend to get distracted by names and things, the typical longer task i have been doing involves visiting 2 or 3 locations ((invis)) and killing about 20 light blue to dark blue mobs.<br />
<br />
Being as how we are the only tank class that can self invis, it seems to me that knights are built very well for the new task system, we can invis past everythign we dont need to kill, and assassinate what we do need to kill.  In addition the aggro radius of gobbies in droga/nurga is fairly small, so you can usually get single pulls, with the occaisional add only causing you to lifetap a little more.<br />
<br />
As i do a few more tasks I'll try to get an average time spent to complete, so far the biggest problem is finding where what you need to kill can spawn, and a little knowledge of the zone can solve that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't done any tasks yet but it's good to hear that the system is viable at 65+.  I'll be interested to hear how long each type of task is taking you on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only task master I've found so far was in Overthere, he told me I was too powerful or some such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've foudn 3 taskmasters for sure at 65 that i can use, 1 is in OT, the other 2 are in the dreadlands.  I have been told that tasks are messed up for cahracters in their upper 50's, I can only say that my friend who is 57 can only get tasks that require her to enter veeshans peak ((for which she is not keyed for))  hopefully they fix that soon.  On a side note hopefully i'll have IC by the end of the day, so i might not get to any new tasks til tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how long it taking per task?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only task i have attempted today was in Charasis ((howling stones)).  This task, unless you have the key that unlocks all the doors is a major pain!<br />
<br />
The Task is called &quot;Worked to the Bone&quot; and unless you have the keys to charasis already i would not suggest taking it on.  I've been in Charasis for several hours and we are still trying to find the key to the second wing.  I've explored everywhere i can without the keys and what i need to kill does not spawn there, i can only assume it spawns further in.<br />
<br />
I'll try to do some more tasks in Droga where i can get a better idea of how long it takes, aka no keys to try and find.<br />
<br />
I can also confirm that a longer task for a lvl 62 SK produces 1 gold bubble of regular exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hurakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am working on my first task at the moment and so far I like it.    got it on OT and had me go to Droga and kill 10 of a specific goblin type (cave guardian or somesuch) and loot 4 mt death salts...    takes a while to find all 10 mobs and clear the area to get them (most times have to kill 1-2 others before getting to him).   but since the task has no time limit ive been working on it while waiting for my friends to log in.  Not sure what the exp reward will look like but it beats sitting in POK lfg or waiting for people to log on,  and not having to deal with idiots as someone mentioned.      And I agree,  from what ive seen (lots of people of different classes where in droga doing tasks)  we SK are pretty well set for these things with our self invising,  fd, snare, etc.      Now,   Charasis does sound like fun   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Modalex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just finished the &quot;Worked to the bone&quot; task. At lvl 66 it gave 1% regular exp and 116 plat. I got 4% regular exp while doing the task grouped with my cleric. And like someone said above its a waste of time if you dont have the master key because all of the undertakers are in the south and east areas. You could spend 3-4 hours waiting on the north and west key mobs to pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">had a group of 4 of us...SK, pally, ranger, ranger and since it was not a great balanced group we decided to go to Droga for some general xp and killing. Also, we each grabbed a task that would have us kill mobs in Droga<br />
<br />
We figured we were going to be in Droga, why not get a little extra xp anyway. We never completed the tasks...mine is kill 10 cave guardians...but I can continue the killing at a later point.<br />
<br />
So, if you are going to be in a zone with lots of tasks, you might as well get some extra xp...but I don't think I will be specifically focused on tasks.<br />
<br />
I wish Tasks did a little more...either adventure points, or maybe a special augment that grows with each successful task completed. (Like the LDoN adventure's stone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've done 2 level 51 medium tasks (Elements of Mercury and Elements of Silver), from Delila in RM.  Both took place in the Hole, both took 2+ hours.  The big issues was not so much soloing the mobs (20 mobs required for each task), but getting the right drops (4 vials of mercury in each).  If it was just the killing the task would have takens maybe an hour.  Each completion netted me around 60pp and about 6-7 blue ticks of exp.  I did get about 75% of a level doing the killing for the task though.  <br />
<br />
I love the idea of a group all getting a task for a zone, I also wish there was some sort of progressive award, though the last turn in guy for the quests did say something about me developing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed the same problem in Droga witht he MT. Death Mineral Salts.  The only thing i've come up with is to invis around until you need to kill less of a certain type than you need to loot what you need to find, then you just start killing everything.<br />
<br />
On a note if you start a task you can abandon it and start it later, I was worried when I abandoned my Charasis task to help people in droga, but it was there when i went to get my new task.<br />
<br />
This weekend was a mess so i didnt get a time any tasks, but i'd have to agree with keeval if things go well you can complete some tasks in an hour, maybe longer classes in about 1.5 or 2 hours.  It is nice to be able to group with peopel and get credit for the same kills for tasks, where you run into trouble grouping is if you all need to loot 4 somethings....<br />
<br />
I'm starting to get tells from random people on my server about tasks =/   hmmm wonder who talked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smidgit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've been in Charasis for several hours and we are still trying to find the key to the second wing. The key to the west wing is a drop off the named at the end of the north wing. There are placeholders for the named in that room.<br />
<br />
If you lack rogue, or master key.<br />
Map 1 (http://www.eqdiva.com/images/102102/maps/charasis1.jpg) <br />
Map 2, the basement edition (http://www.eqdiva.com/images/102102/maps/charasis2.jpg) <br />
<br />
Key to north wing front door drops off sperms, its a candle.<br />
Key to the end of the north wing is a ground spawn in the center of the north wing (room 2 on map1 above).<br />
Key to the west wing drops off named at end of north wing. Porter at end of north wing drops you at zone in (room 1).<br />
Key to end of west wing is ground spawn in room at south end of west wing.<br />
Key to south door is dropped from named at end of west wing (room 5). I don't remember seeing a ph for that one. TP there drops you at zone in.<br />
I forget where the key for the end of the south wing spawns (I think room 9). TP there ports you out of the zone. Secret passage to east wing is in room with porter at the end of the south wing. <br />
I've never ever seen a key for the door behind drusel (she spawns in room 14), other than a rogue or a master key.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember sepulcher skeletons only spawning in the south and east wings. I may be a little fuzzy on that. Also, I have spent over 2 hours trying to get the named to pop in the end of the north wing.<br />
<br />
Helpful? or I knew that already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bring a rogue or someone with a master key already, you'll be there 8 hours trying to get all the keys unless you're very lucky and all the nameds that drop keys are up. Took me about an hour to get the master key with a friend that had his.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I'm supposed to turn in the 4 salts to Matandrias(sp?) Slad.  The task says to hurry, as he's not very patient, but makes no mention of where I can find the bastard.  Not even a vague zone hint.  Anyone have any idea where this guy can be found?<br />
<br />
Kind of lame that a &quot;short&quot; task apparently expects you to wander the world checking every NPC at random before you can complete it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pretecf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The mob that will accept your Mt.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't notice the zone in the task description, but it was late, and I was tired.  I'll check again (perhaps its listed at the top somewhere?).<br />
<br />
Anyway, good to know that the compass pointer will appear!  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The zone you need to go to will appear on the left side of the task window, for every part of the task, it says what zone it takes place in. so assuming i can get this to work.<br />
<br />
Zone:        Task:            Progress:<br />
Nurga         kill stuff         0 of 10<br />
droga         eat dinner      0 of 1<br />
Dreadlands  turn stuff in    0 of 1<br />
<br />
Any time your task calls for speaking with someone or turning something when you are in the same zone you will get a line on your compass telling you what direction to go in.<br />
<br />
When i first started tasking my first step was go talk to some guy in OT, and i was like well how the heck do i find him?<br />
<br />
IF it doesnt involve an npc you are on your own, but the task system will help you find npcs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In most zones with task masters, the /Find  command will take you right to them.  I know this is true in Overthere and in the Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
At 67 I like to pick up a long quest (almost exclusively NURGA/DROGA or Chardok) and work on it between groups.  The droga mobs are still half dk blue half light blue (while Nurga and Chardok are almost exclusively lt. bl) and are soloable for SK's far inferior to me.<br />
<br />
The final long task turn ins net me about 2 ticks of (regular) exp (about the same as a couple KT mobs) and about 175pp.  On average a long task will take me between 1.5-3 hours depending on my buff status and whatever else I have going on.  <br />
<br />
Back at 65, the entire quest (turn ins and killings) netted about a blue and a half and took about 75 minutes.<br />
<br />
Only problem I have is when I get more Salts than I need, I can't use them for the next task.   (There is some sort of flagging / parsing that looks for the loot message to update your task.)<br />
<br />
Some adventure points would be neat (especially since some of the tasks specifically say they come from the Wayfarer's Brotherhood) but probably something along the lines of 5 or so AP per task considering the risk involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It took me about a dozen tries to get the /find command to work on ONE of the task masters in OT.  Every other time, the glowing path would lead me west out of the fort, halfway across the zone, then straight down into the ground.  Unfortunately, I didn't have my shovel with me.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It took me about a dozen tries to get the /find command to work on ONE of the task masters in OT.

had the same issue, bur realised that the find path just didn't go over a incline, it went through it so I just kept running straight and Lo and Behold, it came out on the otherside of the rise.<br />
<br />
BTW where are you getting Nurga Tasks?<br />
<br />
Overthere is only offering my Burning woods tasks, and I want to task and faction for Chardok ring at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tilelyanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I finally was able to sit down and exclusively devote myslf to a long task jsut to see how long it takes...<br />

4:25 turned in Death salts in Dreadlands<br />
4:27 Explored entrance to nurga in FM<br />
4:29 hailed finally quest guy<br />
<br />
for a grand total completion time of 1 hr 43 minutes.  The only buffs i used were a virtue ((from the exp group the night before)), Cloak of Luclin, Shroud of Chaos, Pact of Hate, and captain nalots quickening.  Though i did just get suspend pet 1, and it helps a ton with tasking, especially if you skip guys you dont need.<br />
<br />
AS for rewards between killing and the reward i got about 3 gold AA, and made well over 500 plat ((not including 2 diamonds i looted)).<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note Keeval you might not be getting tasks because of a level requirement, all the tasks i have that send me to nurga have always started in Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Figured out what the problem was.... The column that showed the zone had been set so that it only showed the first couple of letters, so I had to resize /bonk.<br />
<br />
The bug with the /find command was different from it just not going over inclines.  It really did lead me straight out to the middle of no where, then straight down.  No incline; just a 90 degree bend in the glowing path straight into the ground.  On several occaisions, they led me in the exact opposite direction of the one task master I eventually found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I encountered similar bugs following the /find trail when I first started.  I think it may have something to do with the amount of distance... but whatever...<br />
<br />
The Taskmaster in the Dreadlands that I use is in the combine outpost (near the druid/wizard port ins).  He was prelabeled on my maps as a merchant, so depending where your maps come from he might still be on there.  I'm told there are 2 others in the DL, but I went to him first and he's been more than cooperative enough.<br />
<br />
The ones in the Overthere-  I found one in the outpost itself (near all the trainers).  Another is in the eastern half of the zone, near the ruins with the sarnaks (a bit north of them).  I never bothered to find the third one because neither of them had anything for me at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The one in OT I found (near the trainers in the fort) told me he didn't have anything for me (65 SK) the first time I hailed him.  The second time (a few seconds later... I'm stubborn like that... or a slow learner, depending on how you look at it!) he offered me a variety of tasks.<br />
<br />
Still, beats the Directx9 bugs.</div></div><hr />
