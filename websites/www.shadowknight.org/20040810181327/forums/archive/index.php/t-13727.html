I've seen guildy DE WAR do this quest with gnome illusion portions she bought from bazaar. with LoY a lot of the illusion portions are out. they're not cheap but hey if it's cheaper than Cloak itself, and if you do not have enchanter friend who can cast illusion on you best to buy them.<br />
<br />
I hear quest giver will not give quest to evil races (and she did not give me quest to me as I am DE). If you do buy the illusion portions, you will need at least 3 of them. First to get the quest in PoK, then once again in Ak'anon, then again in PoK for final turn in.<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />
