<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caktis1981</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A big of a problem I seem to have w/ my comp as o late, anytime I got LD it keeps giving me the &quot;your charector has not yet been syncronized&quot; message, up too 20 minutes later I still get this message anytime I LD. It is a real pain when yer in the middle of something important or in a group deep in a dungeon somewhere. Any info or help would be greatly appreciated on how too fix this pls. thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've had the same thing happen. It appears as though there's some bug with the map system that occasionally a map will cause you to crash, then spend forever LD. Solution is to delete the map files for the zone you were in, then fire it up again (and reinstall the map later).</div></div><hr />
