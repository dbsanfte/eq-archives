<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Comparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azudno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But fear has a considerably faster cast time and lower mana cost, plus it does not break mez like festering does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, Festering Darkness (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3400&amp;source=Live)  has a faster casting time than Fear (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=229&amp;source=Live).  It is considerably less mana, however.<br />
<br />
Festering has the added bonus of damage and snare.  I have a decent mana pool and FT, so I use festering for aggro if mobs are unmezzable or there is no mezzer present.   Otherwise, I use fear.<br />
<br />
Now, if you're talking about aggro generation benefits only, you'll probably want to compare Clinging Darkness (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=344&amp;source=Live) to Fear instead.  It has even faster casting time, and half the mana of fear.  But the added benefits are negligble:  the dot is nothing, the snare is piddly and not very long lasting at all.  <br />
<br />
Aggro generation, in my experience, seems comparable between all three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fear is larger per cast but thanks to cast/recast its less over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haven't tested it but I'd suspect fear has the edge.<br />
<br />
But both spells are required in so many differing situations that I usually wind up choosing one or other for reasons having nothing to do with which has the edge on aggro.<br />
<br />
To such an extent that I've never even considered worrying about which has the edge on aggro from a practical point of view.<br />
<br />
Festering's great for splitting multiples to CC, or buying you extra time to throw more aggro spells on incoming mobs.  And it works on fearable mobs.  But it's too slow for fast pulling and too heavy on mana for staple aggro unless you're of the one-cast-then-hit-and-pray school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">on a side note, you should get the brittle slate of keeness augment from the nro ldon camp, its spell haste I and it reduces the cast time of fear and cd, cd is now a 1.5 sec cast for me and fear is 1.8... i guess spell haste I tribute would also work for that now(haste 2/3/4 dont work cause they have higher minimum casting times)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got me excited for a moment...but that aug is slot3 only..and I dont have any LDON gear on SK atm, might be better with Tribute then, gonna check that when I get time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, Power of Alacrity is the Spell Haste (15%) Tribute to use if you don't have a Slot 3 to put the aug in.<br />
<br />
Twinge of Pain is also available for Tribute, which is Affliction Haste (33%), although I don't think it works with Fear.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip; I think I'll be getting Twinge of Pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OOOH yes Twinge of Pain I OWNS! 1.2 sec CD, compared to 1.8, or 1.5 with spell haste I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While aggro is comparable fear is just spent mana while festering is the best damage to mana spell we got (for a long fight anyway).  Why just spend mana when you can do damage and snare?<br />
<br />
Also as far as breaking mez there is actually a short lag between when the spell hits and snare is broken.  This is because the DOT doesn't do damage immediately damage starts after the first 6 seconds are up.  This is just enough time to get a nuke in for extra aggro.<br />
<br />
BTW if you want max aggro when breaking mez (or max aggro period) make sure you got disarm up.  Disarm adds to aggro and doesn't break mez.  Plus it always adds aggro even though it never works.  Far as I know this is the only real use for this ability (think I disarmed like 2 mobs while I was in low 50's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hate to tell you you're wrong Squigle but:<br />
<br />
Fear's much more mana-efficient than festering.  In many high level groups you need to chain cast fear/CD to hold aggro so the casters can do decent DPS.  Try this with festering and you'll go oom quickly.<br />
<br />
I do use festering for DPS occasionally, but only as a move of desperation in low DPS groups.  Its 8 DPS is neat for me but a joke to my caster and rogue friends who'd think I was mad if I claimed my DPS was useful, or even relevant, to most groups.<br />
<br />
If you want extra aggro on mezzed mobs, it's far safer and more efficient to cast fear before you break mez than try to squeeze in a (comparatively) low-aggro nuke after you've dotted it.<br />
<br />
And disarm gives negligible aggro compared with spells like fear and snares, or even terrors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fear is a bit of a slow cast/recast but it generates much more reliable hate as an initial aggro/pulling spell than Terror, and its especially useful on summoning mobs. I've been very pleased using it during encounters in Time where i am pulling and kiting the mezzable adds away from the Saryrm or TT to be parked by our chanters. Also found it to be a big help pulling xegony, who needs to be steered clear of trees and rocks now on the pull, or she'll get stuck and start warping...its like walking Helen Keller through a minefield...<br />
<br />
Terrors just don't seem to lock up the same kind of initial aggro...or anything close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm wasn't talking about chain casting obviously there is no advantage to chain casting a DOT.  If you were going to chain cast a darkness it should be Clinging Darkness which is almost free.  Also since I am usually the snarer in groups Festering is pretty much a requirement anyway.<br />
<br />
Frankly I rarely need to chain cast to keep mobs off casters but I'm not in Time either.  I have a terror type proc on sword which can be very sweet at times though.<br />
<br />
While Disarm may not be a lot of aggro it IS free aggro that costs you nothing except either a key stroke or the time to map it to the same key you use for taunt or whatever.  Bugs me when people complain they can't generate enough aggro but refuse to use everything they can because it is &quot;beneath them&quot; for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Torahdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use Festering, and only Festering for aggro, unless the mobs are immune to changes in run speed then i will mem Asystole. I have no problem at all chaining Festering Darkness, get a mana pres item and you will see a huge diff. Festering is also a faster cast then CD. Also pulling with Festering is much better in a group, the snare lands very often, and while the mob is running towards the group you can cast it again or a spear for very solid aggro. Where as fear causes the mob to run straight to you high speed, and if you lose aggro for even a second it could be clear across the group on a caster. Snare is your friend.<br />

<br />
We can get CD to 1.2 cast time now very easily.<br />
<br />
Personally I use CD and Fear 90% of the time, or Invoke and Fear. Not sure there is a 'best' answer, it comes down to preferrence and situation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm not so sure about how the group would feel about this either...Festering is great on some pulls, but for a fast killing exp group in PoE, snare pulling just slows the kill rate down...and the group will love you even more when you spear the pull like a douchebag and get summoned...especially if some eager chanter or shaman has already decided to slow/debuff the mob as it lumbers towards the camp...<br />
<br />
Asystole is a pretty bizarre choice also...Where are you usually grouping that you use these? Your magelo would indicate that you know what you're doing, but I don't see why or where you'd be using these techniques...can you expand on what you posted above, Torahdane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Asystole is great agro.  I use it when I kite in Fire to make absolutely sure that the mob will not turn on my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I do the same thing kiting at the tables, but he wasn't  talking about kite strategy is the thing...<br />
<br />
I use Festering, and only Festering for aggro, unless the mobs are immune to changes in run speed then i will mem Asystole. <br />
<br />
As aggro on the pull, certainly Asystole works very nicely, but it's not really reliable for a second cast while you're tanking...you'd want to have another, faster casting aggro spell memmed as well at that point...unless you have that much faith in just using spear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Utmost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I pull with terror in PoE cause then there are no summonz.  If I am the puller I'd rather not be tanking.  Chain pulls am gud.  For tanking, in any zone, I use clinging and Terror of Thule.  If I want to up my dps I load Blood of hate and I use Aura of Hate to increase everyone's dps.  <br />
<br />
I have generally been keeping ToI and TOV up, but with their quick refresh time, I think I'll remove ToV for Aura of Hate.<br />
<br />
Back to chain pulling, I'm gonna have to say that the best class for pulling is an Ench.  If they can have a mob back at camp either mezzed, and inc right as target mob dies, and they can keep everything slowed, then you sacrifice minimum DPS.   Shad's are good for pulling, but then you;ll need 2 tanks in teh group.  Monks/rogs/rangers are all good, but then you are sacrificing their dps as they are out grabbing a mob for you to tank. <br />
<br />
What say you on best class for pulling?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For raids we use SK/Monk team to split and pull  usually, works well for us, and it is alot more interesting than waiting to hit /assist.<br />
<br />
For most exp group situations and chain pulling, Ireally think bards are the way to go...for mostly the same reasons you prefer chanters. Decent crowd control and slowing ability, but with awesome movement speed and fading memories also...some of the GoD stuff is very fast on its feet</div></div><hr />
