<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShareebMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this was intentional with LoY or something that perhaps i've just noticed...but, fearred mobs no longer seem to wander back and forth when you or your pet swings at them. <br />
<br />
This makes it very difficult to fear kite in many zones now as the mob just continues on running in the same direction once fearred. For example forget about it in the grey anymore...<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this or ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lillith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed it tonight in PoD.  Very bad news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The change is very positive, it removes some of the exploits tied to the spell, like the auto-switch direction change you mentioned that stops the NPCs from running away(yes, impossible to avoid, still not supposed to happen).<br />
<br />
Fear kiting was originally a creative workaround for a spell designed for ghetto crowd control, it's about time they fixed some of the unexpected issues of the workaround /shrug.<br />
Just adapt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've decided i hate this...  was soloing the underbulks in echo, and everytime i snare/feared, they would go straight to the guard...  had to burn HT just to get the xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't understand why they even let us keep this spell, they seem determined to nerf it into complete uselessness. Honestly, it seems that every other weak they turn around and say that &quot;using it this way is an exploit&quot; and nerf it. Pathing issues, now mob turning direction when it was hit, pretty soon the whole &quot;mob runs the other way without attacking&quot; will be said to be an exploit.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I understand there were places and instances where this spell was being abused, but I really do think they are determined to nerf it to the point where it is totally useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well i think part of it is they never expected Fear to be used indoors or in tight spaces..couple that with the pathing issues and they have a big problem.<br />
<br />
seems with this change in fear behaviour they are coming up with a more intelligent response to using Fear..that being making the mobs just flat out run away in a straight line rather than running around like headless chickens<br />
<br />
in dungeons this means the mob is much less likely to get stuck since its just going to follow straight lines rather than zig zagging and it also means a mob is going to be able to get a lot farther away from you when you fear it, increasing the chances of adds.<br />
<br />
I dunno, this makes it seem like EQ devs have been paying attention the responses to fear kiting problems<br />
<br />
these new changes make sense really..if im afraid of simething, im going to get away from it, not run in circles around it . It only makes sense mobs will make a beeline away from you know when you fear<br />
<br />
who knows,this could make their behaviour a bit easier to predict.. if you know they are going to bolt in a given direction, then you can set up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I kind of agree with that logic, but I also feel that if you were running like that and got hit you might just as easily turn and run the other way, after all you are scared shitless and don't know what's going on. I actually think somewhere in the middle would make the most sense, sometimes they keep running, sometimes they change direction. That would still make it unpredictable enough to use the way they don't want you too, but would IMO be more realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rezzbagg, one of the focuses of the current dev team is to get rid of all the little things about each class that don't work the way they should.<br />
Fear originally was intended to be a cheap crowd control/escape spell (i kinda pity newer player who never had to do fear CC, it used to own outdoors and to buy time before a wipe out on raids heh), players found a way around it, the dev team could have totally changed that by making fear breaking like mez, they instead decided to fix the bugged way the spell reacted when not used for its original purpose.<br />
<br />
You are fear kiting so you can use mana instead of your HPs, so what difference does it make if the mobs run to different directions now than they used to ?<br />
The mob is still not hitting you, still not doing anything really more dangerous for you... you might lose a few spots because of this, but also gain others, which will balance out.<br />
You don't actually lose anything, yet it eliminates a LOT of issues with fear and makes it behave like it should always have... seriously why is that a loss ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rezzbagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keyan, you may be right, I have been exploring the LoY zones and haven't visited any of my old reliable fear kite spots, so it may not be that big of a loss. Call me nerf bat shy I guess, I just don't like them mucking around with something I have been using for almost 2 years. <br />
<br />
I still don't necessarily agree with them saying they will just run in a straight line, i think the best idea is somewhere in between what they had before and what they want now. I think it should be random, they may keep going straight, or may turn in a diifferent direction, not even necessarily back the way they came either. I just think that would be a little more realistic.<br />
<br />
Edited to add- I did just think of how this is detrimental to the way I have been using fear up until now. That is kiting more than one mob. It used to be you could darkness and fear a few and while you kill one, the others would just wander around. When they started to get far away, you could just hit them with a spell or run over and smack them once, just to keep them all in the same area. This won't work anymore I guess...</div></div><hr />

This makes soloing the Twilight Sea dock guards unusable now if it is true.  I know from 52 -54 when hunting there I counted on the guards to continue moving back and forth otherwise I would have to swim and fight.  I have done Katta guards near twilight sea since the expansion and they do walk around the path normally so I don't know how it was prior to the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well according to a message on casters realm, the Dev team knows that fear pathing is all screwed up so hopefully they will either fix it or atleast find a middle point between what we have now and what we had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So they remove fear from PoJ and somehow screw it all up elsewhere?  Way to go Verant!</div></div><hr />
