<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the reasons that Keevel is an Erudite is for the intelligence.  BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF MY MANA POOL.  <br />
<br />
I'm a causual player and a slow leveler, but I figured with all these new quick exp levels (and old ones like Kurn's) that I didn't want to get to a certain level but have underpowered skills.<br />
<br />
Most of the posts I see here list the reason to want more intelligence is for the mana pool.  <br />
<br />
I wanted higher intelligence for quicker skill ups.  I wanted to be able to spend less money on my trade skills for skill ups (and yes it does add up), I wanted to be able to raise all my weapon skill quicker.  I wanted to learn all my skill quicker.  <br />
<br />
Why have I never seen anyone else mention that?<br />
Why isn't how quickly you learn your skills considered important?<br />
What am I missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denaiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a very good reason that people haven't mentioned anything about intelligence effecting weapons skill ups.  It is because Dexterity is what effects it.  As per Caster's Realm:<br />
<br />
Dexterity: Dexterity affects how quickly you learn weapon skills, and how often weapons will do their special.  Since Shadow Knights get a number of weapons which proc, and some spells which do this also, there is a definite advantage to putting some points into this statistic.  It will also help to increase their channelling skill so they are not interrupted as often when hit while casting.<br />
<br />
Intelligence: Intelligence directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills.  It affects the amount of mana for Bards and all pure casters, as well as Shadow Knights.  A lot of Shadow Knight spells are mana intensive, and they use it up very quickly.  Putting some points into this stat is certainly worthwhile for getting some extra spells off, but items which give large amounts of direct Mana are more efficient at later levels.<br />
<br />
And here is the link, just in case you need it:<br />

<br />
That would be why you don't see it as a reason.  Int is for mana, and skill ups, but not weapon skill ups.  Trade skills, yup, int is good, with perhaps dex, or str for a few (fletching, and smithing) being a factor, if higher than your int.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah.<br />
That explains it<br />
So is the feeling that my MoSS with the +10 int seems to skill up quicker all in my head?<br />
(it may be)<br />
Oops, time for my placebos. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also you can get some +int items for tradeskills for really cheap. Plus not everyone likes trade skills.</div></div><hr />
