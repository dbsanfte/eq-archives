<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the lowest level you can be to do the quest? is there a way to test the turn ins so your stuff doesnt get eaten?  I know with the rogue epic quest turn in you can give the turn in guy a coin and if you have agro on something or if your faction isnt good enough he will return it or say a phrase that lets you know that you are doing something wrong.  I just want to make sure cause I have someone going to multi quest the whole quest with me and i want to do it as soon as possisble. Thanks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Messer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">MQ'ing the entire epic is so ghey on so many levels.  Why even bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I so agree with you Messer. Heck I say kudos to any sks who actually did the epic from start to finish and without MQing cause man oh man they had to endure the epic big time. Heck if there was something I could see sks getting for mq is that hide and possibly soul leech. BOA is not even that rare. Got mine on the pegasus isle (4th isle) and another dropped from a bee on isle 6. <br />
<br />
Soon Messer I will be cursed by Inny. Of course now I am cursed on having to wait for Marl to get the Dark Shroud and then having to wait again to get the will of Inny. At least there is no more drakes Messer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope all your MQs get eaten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hah..i asked a question and all you guys could do was flame me.  Look...the whole quest is gay...i know this.  No one in their right mind would even attempt the quest unless they just wanted it for looks and even then it's too much of a pain in the butt for.  I just want the epic for looks so MQing it is worth it cause it saves me time and my Sk is just a toy.  My main is a Rogue and this will really make you guys cry---&gt;&gt;Im trading the MQ of the rogue epic for the MQ of the SK epic....so flame me all you want.  I really could care less if that crap gets eaten....ill find another person who will MQ the stuff again if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">USED to be, you could do the epic at 30 when you get the hide skill.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I believe the quest guys don't want to talk to you till you are 50 (recent change IIRC).  I could be wrong tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks man! I was going to try to get it at 46 but I can wait until 50 to try.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>quickling1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So...what is the lowest level you ever heard of someone obtaining Innoruuk's Curse? Some guy on my server did it at 52! or so he says</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sinafey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Still cant MQ the final fight *shrug, hope he has a lot of peeps to help with that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dachande, old skool Sk on Drinal, had an SK alt with epic at level 32... might have had it earlier, but that was his level when I saw him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Completed mine at lvl 53.<br />
<br />
I got all the items except soul leech to complete epic a second time. Was thinking maybe selling it or possibly seeing if I can MQ with a lvl 1 or what not for shitz and grins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">NPC's won't talk to you until you are at least 50.  The reason that there were lower levels walking around with the epic is because the quest was changed from its original form.  Used to be that in the final battle, you looted Innoruuk's Curse from Lhranc.  So, a high level player could do the quest, and a low level character could loot the epic.  Now, when you do the final handin to Lhranc, you recieve a coin.  You then give the coin to Marl Kastane, who spawns after Lhranc is dead, and recieve the epic.  So you can't MQ with low levels anymore that I know of.</div></div><hr />
