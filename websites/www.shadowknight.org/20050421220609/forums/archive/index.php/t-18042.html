<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take 5 friends, one being a rogue (might need a couple more if you're mid-low 50s).  Crawl through south wing, crawl through east wing.  Kill her.  Get a map and warn your group where the pit traps are.<br />
<br />
Drusella is labelled '14' on this map<br />

Alot of people will say to lev to east wing directly.  If you're short on time, great, but part of the fun is getting there.  A drusella crawl the old fashoned way remains my favorite thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">camped the spot for 8 hours NOTHING grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you didn't know already, Drusella Sathir is on a 65-79 hour spawn timer. She is still a contested spawn because she sometimes drops the coveted spirit wracked urn for the spirit wracked cords quest in Chardok. Your best bet at getting Drusella is to have a friend come in periodically to check track in hopes of catching her up. Also finding out when Drusella fell really helps cause it is definately so much easier knowing when she might be up. <br />
<br />
Hopefully you will get Drusella soon. I was able to do her with an 8 man team of 55+ that consisted of a warrior, bard, cleric, beastlord, wizard, druid, shaman and sk. Cleric was able to pacify pull drus no problem and we proceeded to tear her apart. She is not even as strong as one might think. Luckily Cazic was kind and Drusella coughed up the urn on my 2nd ever kill of her :) <br />
<br />
Good luck on Greenmist. Hehe I still need the greenish metal shard and unfortunately have to go through the trouble of camping the Alchemist Acolyte in Chardok. Thank god they put the necro epic mob by his spawn point to make things better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ah so shes not a ph mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope she is not. That is what makes her a real pain in the butt to get. Be thankful Sony decided to make the mirror always drop cause if it was like the urn, we'd probably have fewer Greenmists around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I keyed a ranger alt to track her.  Not sure what skill level is needed though.  I do know a mid 50s druid and ranger can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NEW GREENMIST ON TALLON ZEK THANK YOU ALL!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gratz indeed on Greenmist. Hope to wield that sucker soon too like you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valdarie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually you don't even need to go through the south wing. Simply sow and lev over to the East platform from the North or South platform.</div></div><hr />
