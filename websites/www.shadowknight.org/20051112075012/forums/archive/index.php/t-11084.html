<br />
Not justified, IC stuff like has been going on here about how &quot;Grobb will rise again&quot; and killing so many frogs that Innothule swamp water becomes 90% amphibian blood by volume. Which is nifty, and EQ needs more of. ;)<br />
<br />
Not even the vaguely justified &quot;My Neriak faction sucks! What do you mean, actions have consequences?&quot;.<br />
<br />
But 100% pure OOC whinefest stuff like &quot;Wah! My two favourite cash farming spots are gone! SOE did this just to nerf me!&quot; and &quot;I don't like it when SOE changes stuff - why can't everything stay the same always?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE does something interesting and Norrath-shaking for the first time since, well, waking the Sleeper and people bitch about it.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember the massive bitching about waking the sleeper? :P<br />
<br />
Really, though - this is great.  Remember when it was unusual to find a Troll who wasn't roleplaying?  Remember when clawing and biting and kneecapping your way to 50 as a Troll SK despite the double experience penalty meant you were one of the toughest bastards around? (and anyone who objected to troll speak could stfu?)<br />

<br />
Yeah...right...<br />
<br />
Personally I love it.  Can't wait to be my froglok pally ;)<br />
<br />
All it does prove is that no matter what SOE does, people are going to whine.  I say to Hell with them and hope that SOE does MORE stuff like this.  Lets have the dark elves invade Feydwer and conquer Felwithe driving the High Elves to go live in Kelethin.  Lets have North Freeport fall before the Militia and the Paladins relocated to Gukta.  Lets have an event that turns Kithicor into all-evil/undead all the time or cleanses it.  Have the iksar finally strike an alliance with the dark elves so that iksar can walk in dark cities and dark races can walk in Cabilis.  Or, have the iksar finally get fed up with the teir'dal and turn the Outpost in the Overthere into an iksar-controlled location.</div></div><hr />

Those that whorship Inny will start in the DE city and those that worship Cazic will start in the new LoY city.  It could be positive for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chezebreth</div><div class="date">02-08-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to say Im a Troll. I have never played any other race as a main character. I loved Grobb and the swamp. Grobb is the best city in the game because it is small, everything that you normally would want is all at the entrance, everyone in the city was not over priced, and it been there for years gives me a home feeling just knowing I can always go back there. But now the Froggies took it from us the Trolls. <br />
<br />
Now, heres why I hate what happened and why I posted this. My faction was destroyed for Ogres becasue I did many of the SK quest. I still have DE faction but just barely because I got a Dragoon durk from the Dragoon when they where worth while. I also hate large towns that are large just to be large.<br />
<br />
Trolls losing Grobb to froggies is an outrage for many reasons. <br />
<br />
First, most Trolls are KOS to Ogres and/or did things against the dark elfs because it was better for them.<br />
<br />
Second, Neriak is one of the most hated towns in the game because its 3 zones and each one is deeper in than the last unlike Freeport where it is easy to walk around. <br />
<br />
Third, The newbie zone next to Neriak is nothing like the trolls old home. The Trolls have such low charisma that Verant make the newbie zone next to Trolls and Ogres much richer to make up for that. <br />
<br />
Fourth, This is a major nerf to all Trolls because they now have a getto home with the darkelfs in the worst or 2nd worst city in the game. (I think Halos is the worst of all cities but thats just me)<br />
<br />
Fifth, Frogs that you can murder in the 100s with out braking a sweat taking over your hometown is insulting. And saying the battle lasted an hour or two at most is the worst story telling of an epic battle. Verant could have put some stuff in there about how pissed Cazic-Thule and Innothule must be. <br />
<br />
Sixth, and I think most of you out there might just aggre on this one... If this take down of Grobb was done in game instead of in patch it would have never happened because I know Trolls can put up more of a fight than what they put up on the LOY page. <br />
<br />
I hope Verant is getting there act together and making a new Troll city. I know most of you hate the flames about the Troll city and all but think of it like this. What if CB orcs took over Kelathin, or if DF orcs took over freeport, or if gnolls took over Qeynos. Would you be pist too?<br />

The battle was done in game.  I fought for over 30 minutes taking down wave after wave of frog until there were just so many, I couldn't hold them back any longer.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwump</div><div class="date">02-09-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely the &quot;battle&quot; was &quot;fought&quot; very much like the Split Paw infection. Waves of npc mobs sprouting up and whacking other npc mobs with as little or as much pc involvement as happened to be wandering through the zone. My biggest beef.. and this comes from an Ogre whose long since past the point where he ever had any plans to visit Grobb again.. is that they changed a static setting into another static setting with.. a static event. That's not a dynamic change to get all gushy over. <br />
<br />
They wanted frogs, they decided to put them in Grobb, and even had every player from 1-65 had taken up arms against or for them, they were going to GET Grobb. If it wasn't for the addition of Pop, I'd probably have a few words to say about the meta-game impact of robbing one more zone from the dark species of Norrath. But why should that matter? Most newbie up on Luclin anyway.<br />
<br />
Sure, Neriak's lowbie area is virtually worthless in comparison to what was taken, and yes it's kind of sad that Trolls and DE's get to share a wonderfully closed off little home base with what would have been a nightmare of travel inconvience. Yet there's that book, starring you in the face, begging you to come along... you belong... join the fizz and cut yourself a piece of the moon. Good/Bad; that's for Norrathians to decide, we're all happy and nuetral up in looney land. <br />
<br />
The whole thing would have upset me more before, full of annoyed verbatium about the obvious biases of the game's developers. Now, it just makes me a little sad to see this &quot;dynamic&quot; move heralded as some great stepping stone toward a more interactive world. <br />
<br />
You guys maybe right, but until it matters whether or not I kill a Froggy king or die by his hand, then I'll just enjoy all the little game adds and let other people play froggies to their hearts content. I suppose if I was on a PVP server, I'd get a group together and get some payback for Brudda Grobb. But as we all know, those city guards are virtually unkillable.<br />
<br />
Well, unless you happen to be an NPC. <br />
<br />
This isn't a flame at the game or even at the expansion. I play, I pay and I'll be picking up LoY, even if I leave froggies for the pally players. I just personally would have prefered the whole affair had been handled differently. Or at least, if it's going to be moving day for someone, why not burn those Munchee'chee Wood Elves to the ground? At least then you could walk on the ground without 90 pounds of Elf and 210 pounds of twink gear, raining on your head.</div></div><hr />

I'll wait to pass final personal judgement till after I've explored the newer content. It'd be nice if they were to create an outpost or contested area like some of the Luclin zones where clearing the mobs or a specific NPC, shifts the balance of power for a time from one side to the other. <br />
<br />
That would be truely dynamic content. Or at least as close as the current game incarnation can handle.</div></div><hr />

Also the gods might have done something on some servers but not on others. Or if someone raided and killed Mith mar in POP the froggies would lose the battle... But none of that happened. What did happen was everything happened as it was written. So, it was static content to me because I could read what happened and known if I helped or any number of people it would have been the same.<br />
<br />
I have not seen one thing showing this as dynamic content. The most people say about it being dynamic is that the towns changed on every server. Is that truly dynamic? I know this is static content but people want to believe its dynamic because something changed. <br />
<br />
Was the sleepers waking dynamic? No. Because it was the same thing everytime. If it was truly dynamic there would be differences in every server. Not just the people and the amount of highend equipment. There should be a difference from one server to the other. Like highpass winning the war from the gnolls goblins and orcs. And on another server it lost the war and its a goblin town where humans are invading it. Thats dynamic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizzestra</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You seem to expect an awful lot from a game. No, Grobb didn't fall on some servers and stay troll-owned on others. The resources for that simply don't exist yet. What you are seeing is the beginning of dynamic content in it's infancy. It will get better as new games are created and new software/AI/hardware is invented to support the growing need for dynamic game worlds. Give it some time and stop whining about how &quot;/whine It's not &quot;really&quot; dynamic, whaaaa!&quot; It's as dynamic as it is going to get so sit back, relax and enjoy the first real attempts by SOE to do something good and different with EQ to make it a little better rather than shooting them down just because you're can. These changes in EQ may not be truly &quot;dynamic&quot; but they sure beat the hell out of leaving everything exactly the same boring way it was before.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwump</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're fast hurtling toward an argue over the semantics of &quot;Dynamic&quot;. Personally, I'm not whining over anything. I dislike what was done to Grobb and the inability to &quot;save it&quot;. That's mostly an IC issue with just a hint of nostaliga for my favorite city way back when Mino axes were king and I personally petitioned the Tad Skin/Froglock Meat for a cruddy two-hander quest, as exploitable since it could be done ad infinitum. <br />
<br />
I agree that having a real fight for Grobb, a newbie zone.. and having that fight dicate the varying placements of another newbie zone, would have been a nightmare. Starting cities should be more or less safe and secure once established, so that new players can get a handle on things without having to worry that the glut of info they've just digested is going to end up dissagreeing with them later. That's a good enough reason right there to make the true &quot;newbie&quot; guards more or less invulnerable or at least not worth the effort to slay. <br />
<br />
What we have is the creation of a newbie zone, an area that by it's very definition is designed to be static and uniform across all servers. The location is a bit of shock as is the moving around of the Trolls, but for the most part we know it'll settle down into a same ole-same ole with new faces and old skin color. When it comes right down to it, nothing more &quot;new&quot; has occured then a dock suddenly appearing in some zone, leading to new places to explore.<br />
<br />
The point is that this isn't really any more dynamic then any other expansion that has ever been added. In fact, in most of the in-game ways, it's going to have less of an actual impact on the way the game is played then just about any other expansion; well, given what little we actually know now. <br />
<br />
All the truely game-changing, dynamic features are meta-game.<br />
<br />
A new race with an old newbie zone isn't something that thrills me all that much and as far as I'm concerned, they could have left the trolls alone. Personally, I would have rather seen a new troll area (like the Coldains) that was under seige. Give me a place to explore and actively participate in what was going on. <br />
<br />
To me, that's dynamic gaming and it's something that they have worked on in other infancy forms through Velious with the faction wars and later with Luclin in more active mob wars. <br />
<br />
The thing is, that may very well be the case. I may just get my wish. None of us know what all the expansion may entail and in the end it may very well be the most exciting addition to date. I just don't personally find any of the in-game changes to be very dynamic or deserving of much in the way of &quot;Hoo-hah!&quot;.  <br />
<br />
... yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chezebreth</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good reply Gwump...<br />
<br />
Now to Kizzestra...<br />
The thing is thay alwas could make the servers diffrent. If you seen the tech info on the server program theres a diffrent event of that program running for every server and the only thing the server would need to have the zones diffrent is one of there files changed. Im just saying you can do it. Varent has not found a whay or never looked into having a whay to maintane a truely dynamic servers like that because all the info on why one server is diffrent from a nuther would be so much to go through patches could take weeks... <br />
<br />
I along with may others played UO (Ultima Online) befor EQ was out... and thay where able to have many diffrent areas from other servers because thay made it to be a truely dynamic game where the servers where more able to change zone files while the game was running... EQs server is a bit behind but thats more becuase of graphicl issuse I guess; Because thay tryed somthing like that back in the first Halloween event and it crashed the RM zone for about 4 hours...<br />
<br />
So, Yes thay could make all the servers have zones that are diffrent but thay dont have the people, tech, or just luck to get it to work and be usable. <br />
<br />
I hope thay would work more on that than a somthing new like LOY. But I know thay need money to pay for EQ2 EQA and other projects thay are doing.</div></div><hr />

I think that by 'dynamic', people are referring to the fact that Grobb changed hands.  This was essentially static content (a starting city for troll PCs) that was changed.  Not truly dynamic, but a nice change that keeps things a bit fresh.  The uproar from people with troll characters is not unwelcome at SOE, I would bet.  Controversy and scandal is what keeps people paying attention. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spylmann</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now one thing that I think is interesting is the this..<br />
<br />
I get the feeling that most people here are saying that anything different = good. Not that it's wrong, but I think that it at least has to make sense anyway. Whoever said that crushbone invading kelethin would be neat, I say it would be tedious. Seeing as I could use my Kick skill  to kill their king in one hit,  the rest would fall within 2 minutes. 2 minutes of chain casting Word of Pain, assuming there were hundreds of thousands of them.<br />
<br />
The only reason that this is in any way different is because frogs are now a playable race (which I still think is a bad idea, but that's a different rant entirely). So if gnolls invaded Qeynos (assuming we are talking friggin hybrid Gnoll / Schwarzenegger / Steriod-pumped Gnolls which happened to be the Royal Guards of the Diety of the Plane of Gnolls), they better damn well give me gnolls to play as, AND give a good reason behind it. Something that won't make me assume their reasoning is &quot;We didn't want to work too hard, 4 zones for this expansion is actually quite a lot! We need every penny of the $80 for it.&quot; But now that I think about it, adding another playable race is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Everyone always thinks that I don't like change. This is only half true, I don't like bad change. It just happens to be that nearly 95% of change in this game is bad :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chezebreth</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL that gnoll thing was a good one...<br />
<br />
Yes this change is realy not that good and $20 for a 4 zone expantion with a home town moved realy is not worth it... the other stuff should have ben in the game already and we should not have to pay for it. This addishon of a dynamic game play is making me wonder if the game being dynamic would realy help... but realy the only thing that can drive any game like this is new content and longer time to LV. POP was the best expantion EQ could have made because its a place that all players make it there goel to get there. and the only realy people LV 65 are people that worked amazingly hard to get it. Unlike all the people that could get to LV 60 with ez from just haning around in Kunark long enough...<br />

So in the end I bet this will be a good expantion. No having froggloks a playable race will never be worth it ( I would like to have 2 or 3 new zones then having the frogloks) Having to pay $20 for it is a bit over priced for the 4 new zones but its somthing most of us could live with. <br />

One thing tho, I doubt the Trolls will get a new starting city, we are stuck in the Neriak ghetto probably forever.<br />

The new zones are 35-60 so no newb area therefore no new starting city.</div></div><hr />
