You're not the first to wonder this.  Should the day come that a man steps forward to answer, he would enlighten many.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mem it during raids with alot of trash to clear and see how many rangers, wizards, overnuking druids you can get killed without them noticing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luxem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My favorite use is to cast it on my friends enc. or wizzie before I leave a HoH or BoT group... always get a good laugh.</div></div><hr />

I thought it only increase agro created by melee attacks<br />
<br />
If the voice line did all attack that could be very helpful for agro kiting (yes I'm still an sk newb in many areas)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ha, if it really helps increase caster aggro, then I'm going to cast it on my bro after I leave groups.  He starts to nuke at like 80 cuz he can =)</div></div><hr />

It can save you some mana when aggro kiting but you're going to lose a buff slot doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at that point yet that I can do this, but might help the druid I duo with occasionally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Voice spells are aggro modifiers.<br />
<br />
Voice of Terris is 10% aggro modifier to the person you cast it on.<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule is 12%.<br />
<br />
I have a hotkey specially made to keep Voice of Thule on a shaman friend during guild raids, last Fennin raid I counted 5 deaths before he sent me a tell begging me for mercy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not quite 12%, it divides the aggro mod by a decimal when they converted how some stuff works.  what was previously *1.12 is now /.88.  While it's still close to 12% it's actually a bit higher in some cases.  As far as melee goes (spells I havent figured out exactly yet, but it should be similar) SK's are at .7 aggro mod with subtlety, .8 with subtlety+voice, .82 with nothing, .93 with voice and no scs.  If it was still *1.12 it would be .7, .78, .82, and .92 it's not much of a difference but its something, basically 13.63% aggro increase instead of 12%.  Aggro increasers got better from that change aggro decreasers got worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">only one warrior in my entire guild ever asks for this buff.  if he isnt MA it just sits in my book collecting dust.  pretty useless spell.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like I can have some fun with the cleric that likes to Melee.....  mmmmm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've used it on a few raids. No one has ever requested it, but most times the MTs love when I offer. From what I've seen, it actually works. When I keep it on the MT, he rarely loses agro, but anytime it wears off, I immediately start seeing more ping ponging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">this actually might have made a useful clicky on our Ornate BP.  definately better than Shroud...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Voice line was actually in demand BEFORE melee rebalancing patch. Ater that, warriors immediately stopped asking for it.. Voice became from useful to useless overnight for raids.. Go figure.. Now, I see OOW spell line up and I saw upgraded Voice.. No thanks.. ;)</div></div><hr />
