<br />
edit: stun aug (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42199) <br />
also, if your in a LDoN use a SEWS... in a 6 person group the SK's dps isn't so insiginficant. don't need an agro weapon as an SK unless your MT'in somethin that has a low delay that makes channelin cd/fear a pita.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you figure?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that the SEWS proc is defensive in nature I would think its lower in aggro generation then the Cudgel proc. <br />
<br />
I own an Opalescent sword and I can tell you it has nil for aggro generation. In general though you dont even need to turn on attack alot of times to maintain aggro. So your weapon is just an addendum to any aggro you might generate. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem I find nowadays is having to put away a specific weapon in order to avoid aggro on raids and in groups due to WA. But the proc is nice and I love tanking with it.<br />
<br />
I wish they would get Magelo fixed to work with test so I could update.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general if you want to hold the best aggro you load 2 or 3 good taunt spells and chain cast them so you do nearly zero DPS.  Frequently this is on tougher named mobs where you've turned attack off to eliminate riposte damage.<br />
<br />
Therefore the argument about which weapon is &quot;best&quot; for aggro holding is kind of academic.<br />
<br />
But if you want to hold off on spell casting for a bit and let your weapon help, whichever does most DPS is best.<br />
<br />
It doesn't hurt to get a good weapon and aug it with stun like Maicom says though, provided you leave your best DPS one without aggro proc so you can still use it on raids.  I have a Ykesha auged one hander myself for any time I want a little bit of extra free aggro.  Don't use it much but it's there if I want it :)<br />

<br />
still, on mobs that can 1 round me, I turn of attack too</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see you insist on standing in front of non-trivial mobs when you're not the designated tank, and try to talk your way out of an xloc by telling the raid leader: &quot;Riposte damage is so overrated...&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, all I have to go on is my subjective impressions and the word of clerics I group with that it costs less healer mana and causes noticeably less spiky damage.<br />
<br />
Plus the comments of monks and rogues who bandy around figures like 20% of attacks being riposted by the mob.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done any parsing to test this?  Can't find it myself.</div></div><hr />

I just went over my last log vs. Cazic... he riposted me 4.6% of the time, and attack was on the entire fight.  A much shorter parse vs. Innoruuk(thanks to my clerics getting feared somehow) showed a riposte rate of 3.8%.<br />
<br />
Riposte damage is overestimated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was an old study that showed 40 percent of damage taken by a monk on slowed mobs was from Ripostes.  Duh.  He was dual-wielding two fast weapons on a mob that was seventy-five percent slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for info Mathas, I'll do some playing around next few groups I'm not tanking myself too.<br />
<br />
Not that it'll change what I do much; regardless of the frequency of ripostes, if I'm chain casting fear/CD on a tough named mob I'll have aggro lock already, so turning attack on doesn't contribute much apart from the chance to pick up the odd riposte for a couple of K extra spike damage.</div></div><hr />
