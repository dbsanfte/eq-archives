<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niladen</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was curious to know if anyone had noticed any discernable difference in our damage mitigation? I know VI posted that it was &quot;situational&quot; and with our pets apparently /sheilding us I hope that the situation is better than that. I know my pet can't stand up to the average gorgana and am hoping I that can do so now, at least a bit better. If there was a previous thread on this and I missed it, sorry for the repeat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daralron</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">average gorgana <br />
<br />
Funny you should mention gorgana's since I was beating on them this morning to test out the new mitigation, but I did not notice a difference. Max hit the same, lost about the same amounts of health through the fights, etc. I did not parse the damage but I have been fighting there every day for like two days now so I would have noticed a difference.<br />
<br />
Dodge went up a few points though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnost</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going to assume that the new migration is for the big encounters mainly.<br />
<br />
Slightly miffed about the ranger defence thing, I really didn't think they needed it.  But maybe it will lead to us getting an offencive upgrade ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adus</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really dont care to do big dps, it helps but most of my jobs rely on my defensive capabilities. Patch helped that and I kinda doubt rangers are going to be tanking over our job cause they have a bit more defense or whatever. Ranger was telling me how he'd wear a RBG over my belt simply cause it has haste. I have no haste but I wouldnt trade a 100hp + stats/resists belt for a rbg just to up dps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canelek - KOE</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the heck is a ranger doing with an RBG(unless for the extra HP)? Swiftwind(mainhand ranger epic blade) is 40% haste and is about as easy as the rogue epic to complete...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuruk_xev</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatly I havent been able to log on yet (Aust time zone) and there is another 2 hour patch tonite :/<br />
<br />
If they lifted our caps, would that not mean we will need to wait for the skills to rise to the new cap to see the effect.<br />
<br />
I dont think it will make too much difference on gorana's in ME but. I all ready migitate tons of the damage as it is tanking exp group mobs. Im kinda hoping the the the changes translate into raid lvl tanking more than exp grinding.<br />
<br />
SK dont have problems tanking exp grind stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aress</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">parsing did not show me any differences in FG.  May be that mitigation is geared at uber mobs, i.e. hits of 500+?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baroyonx</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What lvl can I try capping the new dodge skill?  I could use the ac but I was letting just clobber me earlier and no change in skill as of yet....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peasley Grunglefunk</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">make sure their atleast dark blue mobs to raise skills... tonight while add tanking at emp (danm depop 5 minutes before we attacked!) and got up to 166 dodge.<br />
<br />
nothing real noticeable yet, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adus</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He doesnt have a rbg, he has gauntlets of dragonslaying, thats not the point, he was saying if he was in my position..  but hes not and hes a ranger so I'm not about to take his advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After getting from 150 to 158 doing Goo solo in CoM (yup, there's still blue mobs in CoM... just gatta know where (how) to find them) I noticed hits usually landing in the 58s drop to 49s.<br />
<br />
Went to chardok to camp Observer with group, maxed while doing and mobs usually hitting for 160s drop to 138s.<br />
<br />
Noticable in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satsujinma</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tanked RumbleCrush some tonight only hit for 226 with a few 688's thrown in there, some monk bitched that he got hit for max damage 7 times and died hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manslayer</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took me about 15-20 minutes of soloing to max dodge heh.  Still hardly ever actually see Dodge messages though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackstone</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't notice much of a difference in damage taken.<br />
<br />
I did notice that I was kicking ass more than usual in VT.  I spent 5 minutes before I registered a hit below 100 with Blindfoe, which was an 89.  This was on Blob1 btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was curious about this too, just what did &quot;certain situations&quot; mean? While add-tanking in Ssra this morning I didn't notice any difference at all, while using a 2H wpn at least. I was getting more than a few max hits from my mob, so I switched to 1H+Shield, and then I noticed a difference. For the next 10min I didn't get a single max hit on me, granted, while using a shield my ac went up about 50 points. <br />
<br />
At first I thought that was what &quot;certain situations&quot; meant...using a shield. Yet, I re-read the patch message and Bards were mentioned along with us, and I can't see them ever using a shield (if they even can).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RandomKayan</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You assume the &quot;situations&quot; are the same for Shadowknights and Bards, nothing says they have to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bards can use sheilds, but they cannot bash.<br />
<br />
Certian situations could also mean that it checks the max damage or atk of a mob to determine if you get additional mitigation.<br />
/shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight, I noticed something odd when I fought Geonids in WL as usual for 3 weeks. All the sudden, their successful hit against me is exactly 32 hp dmg about 30-40% of time. 28 dmg comes in 2nd. Rarely went over 100 hp anymore. I didn't improve my equipment back then. It never happened before that I would see consistent of 32 hp dmg toward me if successful hit. Of course, hits are mostly a miss. It seems that dmg mitigation is working well in this situation against those low dark blue geonids. I do notice that my dmg intake got improved alot against WL geonids. They are wimps now. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Countic</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you turn down a haste item to an hp item then you arent that bright (if you alrdy dont have a haste item that is).  You cant tank if you dont have aggro.  You will have a much harder time getting aggro if you dont have a haste item.</div></div><hr />
