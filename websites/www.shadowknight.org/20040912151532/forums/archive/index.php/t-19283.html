<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just about ready to ding lvl 60 and I was wondering what this spell is stackable with.  Will it override cleric or druid buffs?  Would hate for someone to waste a peridot if this overwrites but doesn't stack.  Thanks for any info you can give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It does not stack with the paladin brell's line, the ranger strength of tunare line, or the beastlord's spiritual vigor line.  Virtue, symbol, druid protection buffs, and focus all stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's just dandy.  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone have any opinions on which of the &quot;non-stacking&quot; buffs from other classes might be better for us than Cloak of Akheva when they are available?<br />
<br />
Recently, have had several BL's try and drop the SV line on me while I had CoA on, wasn't sure if I should drop it before someone casts one of those buffs or if CoA is superior in any way to those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goregan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im pretty sure paladin buffs give you  more HP never looked much further than that really, if theres a pally close i get BSS if not i use CoL</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's the currently accepted AC to HP conversion now?<br />
<br />
It used to be 10hp = 1 AC, so 18 AC = 180hp + 279hp = 459 on CoL vs. 330 on BSS, with Ranger/BL buff being preferable in a non-tanking situation for the attack unless you're at worn attack cap?  Does that seem right?<br />
<br />
We have a lot of Pallies in guild, and I'm always hesitant to click off Brells (or any of the other unstackable buffs, for that matter) in favor of my self buff...  /shrug.  <br />
<br />
Guess it's just a gut call, seeing as how 129hp isn't really a huge difference when fighting mobs who hit for 500's +.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would personally say CoL &gt; BSS if you are tanking. 10 ds + 18 AC &gt; 51 hp.<br />
<br />
If you aren't tanking, and are dps, I would go with SoT for the atk. It was not my impression that the worn atk cap had anything to do with atk buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh, had wondered about that (atk buffs and worn atk cap)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tanking - Cloak<br />
<br />
 Sitting in an AoE - BSS<br />
<br />
 Anything else - SoT</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think theres a general conversion left now, with LDoN and PoP mobs being so entirely different on DB DI. I always go with Cloak of Luclin anyways. F Pink hearties</div></div><hr />

Lasy all around buff : <br />
Cloak of Luclin (279hp/18ac/10damage shield)</div></div><hr />
