<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fizzwik</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just recently started a Gnome SK (Yes, I realize that is flamable on its own merit) and I'm not a power gamer so I do have a few questions.  I've tried searching the forums for information on pet damage based on weapons given and there doesn't seem to be a consensus.<br />
I'm currently only level 13 (which probably doesn't give me much right to even be a member, but I'm trying to get up in levels) and it seems as though my pet's base damage without a weapon in hand is 14 max.  Using a Minotaur Battle Axe his max damage went up to 16 and up to 18 using a Rusty Two Handed Sword ( obviously base damage 8 for the Axe and 9 for the Sword).  Being a Master of the Obvious one would draw the conclusion that given a weapon with say 12 base damage a pet could hit for 24.  I haven't tested this theory yet, but I'm wondering if Boner has a damage cap.<br />
It would seem to me that one could level very quickly to around level 30 or so if you could pick up a cheap weapon in the Bazaar with high base damage.  Obviously you'd need to keep the aggro since Boner's hit points would still be the same, but in theory it sounds feasible.<br />
Also, the second question I have is based on where to hunt solo from level 13 on that yields the best experience and loot (being secondary to xp)?<br />
Any and all help is greatly appreciated...<br />

<br />
As for pets with weapons - I don't think that thier max damage is affected at all by the weapon they wield.  I do know that they are more likely to hit for max with a weapon.</div></div><hr />

these 3 steps preaty much sum up what ya need to do.</div></div><hr />

As for the delete my Gnome thread....NOT A CHANCE!  Uniqueness of a Gnome SK is cool, naturally high INT helps a ton, and being small is also a major bonus IMHO.  If I'm in it for the long haul then regeneration and the like are things I can equip myself for in the future.    ;) <br />
Also, I'm pretty sure the base weapon damage is multiplied by 2 for the max pet damage as a Rusty Halberd has now given Boner a max 20 hit and he's never hit that hard before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvershadow</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know if lower pets work differently but with my current pet he always hits for 65 max, with or without weapons. The only thing that changes that is some of the OoW spells. Maybe lower level pets simply don't hit for max as often and thus benefit even more from wielding weapons (the point being that your pet just doesn't hit for max often enough for you to see)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggborn</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kurns Tower hands down is your best zone.  You can stay there a while too, as the basement and subbasement mobs are pretty hard.<br />
<br />
Time to ramble:<br />
I leveled my Iksar SK on Kunark only until level 30, so here’s a mostly soloer’s guide to Kunark:<br />
<br />
Kurns tower—nuh said<br />
Close by in the Field of Bone is a very nice place to level your swimming, as the path is very long, long enough to trade skill while you do it safely.  I do suggest you don’t take the pass through the cliffs though to the beach as an Iksar named may find and kill you, also there’s a ghost that roams on the beach.  Go up into the woods behind Kurns Tower carefully clearing or avoiding if you are below 19 and get into the water there.  If you swim just off of the shore you should be safe.  I don’t suggest doing too much exploring on the island out there with the wall, big epic monkey out there.<br />
<br />
Back to Leveling:<br />
When you are bored with Kurns Tower try heading to the Overthere (especially if you can get group) or for solo, Warsliks Woods.  In the Overthere the area between the PoK book and the Warsliks Woods zone is appropriate to your level below 20.  Gather your troops just across the water in the Oasis, but don’t take the boat there from the Overthere, as the outpost will probably kill you.  The mudpits are fun with a group, even a vendor is there who will sell to any race.<br />
<br />
I spent most of my time between 18 and 30 in Warsliks Woods when I solo’d.  The Giant Fort will can sustain your loot and xp needs solo from 18 to 25.  Sneak around to the Cabilis side to enter, watch for roamers and try not to get involved killing skellies on the hill outside, giants can roam and the respawns of the skellys are frightening.  Yes the caves can take you to the Lake of Ill Omen, but don’t do that unless you are feeling the adventure and die.  Watch for goblin roamers and just say no.  They are awlful.  Once inside the giant fort, a safe camp is up on the hill. Snare the giants. There will be down time.  Later in levels try the Brutes outside of Dalnir in the cave.  If you have some friends to hang out with, try the goblin fort , nice earring can drop there.<br />
<br />
If you have a healer friend go to the Swamp of no hope in your late twenties and camp the skelly camp near FV. If you are an earlier level try the skelly camps closer to the Field of Bone.  This zone is great!! and too overlooked.  I just duo'd my 28 druid with my hubby's 24 necro there and we had a blast!!  extremely good xp, wish we had gone there sooner.  Solo'd it's kind of hard as you can get adds, but you will learn to hate frogloks.<br />
<br />
Grouping in Kunark, the Frontier Mountain Giant Fort or the LOIO Sarnak fort can be fun.  The Timerous Deep is also worth exploring at any level.  Watch when you get there.  If you have to take a telelporter, get an invis first.  Go via the Oasis.  The sweet solo spot in your Late 20’s is Gorla Island.  No one will be there, and you have plenty of mobs till level 35 to get good xp on and fear kite.<br />
<br />
If you get a group together, hands down the best place is Dalnir at level 30 and above, especially if you have an enchanter.  It blows the best ldon or raid out of the water.<br />
<br />
This is not every zone, but a few that I did mainly. Post is long enough as it is.. good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culdahl1</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PC in luclin is retarded XP in your teens...not sure of any hot spots in the 20's (been awhile and only got my alt to 21 most of which was in PC).<br />
<br />
P.S. - you can pretty much camp luclin from your teens 'till 49 or so and the proximity to nexus/PoK can be very usefull when getting buffs and such (though it was more an issue for me 'cause I did my leveling there pre-PoP).  If luclin ain't your thing then OT is a great place for your 30's 'till you can handle fear-kiting in DS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you gave him a weapon with a base damage of 33 he would start hitting for 66.<br />
<br />
It is just most people dont realise this since weapons you give to pets tend to not have higher base damage then your pets natural base damage except when you are very low level.<br />
<br />
My twinky necro at like level 6 with pets weilding the 2 handers from shadowmen was quite fun  :) <br />
<br />
Of course in this day and age you have a wide variety of infinetly sicker options.<br />
