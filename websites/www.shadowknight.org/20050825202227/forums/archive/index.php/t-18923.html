<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valon</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im a level 50 sk, reasonablly well geared and have access to a 65 enchanter to haste and c5 my groups.  I am looking for suggestions as to where in veskar and nurga a low 50's group should camp, I have no experience in either zone, but they sound like a nice change to the constant LDoN missions.  I know some of you are adverse to powerlevel, but I just use the chanter in addition to my regular groups.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

<br />
wheres the problem with PLing anyways? There's a reason you have access to this enchanter :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valon</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understood it, that with the charm nerfs, the pet steals xp based on the amount of damage hes done,  I had used it to level up twinks before the nerfs, but as I understood it, the pet steals too much xp to make this viable anymore.  I am however, not an expert in this, and only recently started playing again, so I may be uninformed or just plain wrong, anyone care to fill me in?<br />

SK finishes off the MoB and gets full XP for the kill while Chanter and pet head off to pull a new MoB.<br />
Enchanters can PL any class very easily.</div></div><hr />

I would cast invis on myself when both mobs where down to 10% or below. Then finish off both mobs. This stopped the charm mob from taking exp away.</div></div><hr />
