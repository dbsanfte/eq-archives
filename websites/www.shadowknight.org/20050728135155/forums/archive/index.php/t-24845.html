<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slithinknott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The BB one seems pretty good so far i only got shoulders (still need to see if they are tributable) from it and have yet to see the 65 65 65 aug.   Anyone know about the others.  Adding these type of mission were good to me the shoulder i saw where decent pretty respectable.  100 hitpoint area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used a toy monk of mine to try and investigate the Qeynos one.  Not having a group I wasn't able to get the mission, but the guard did give me (each time I tried to accept the mission) a clicky item - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=85014 - that apparently does nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>frappy666</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">first, the powder is used to triger a instanced zone of quenos, you need to be a minimum of 3 in group. Level need to be 25+ (with the respect of a 7 level diference...might be 10 tho). this mission of for 25 to 40 i think but there is no cap so higher level can see the new zone.<br />
<br />
once you have the group, use the powder and haid the sleepy guard and your transported to Quenos One!<br />
<br />
Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done the Hatesfury one a couple times.  <br />
<br />
You need to go to nadox and find a shady merchant near the docks/HF zone in.  He gives you the mission and then a shady smuggler closer to the HF zone in ports you in.<br />
<br />
Mobs are about the same as in unrest one...hitting for 600s max.   You need to kill a bunch of mobs to get random page drops that will eventually trigger named to spawn.  Maybe half the mobs are undead trolls.<br />
<br />
Named dropped a +20 atk, +2 regen/FT aug one time.  Other time it dropped a shoulder thing for priest/caster with +2 regen/FT (i think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the melee version from Hate's Fury of the caster FT 2 you get in unrest.  Almost the same item except most of the other classes.<br />
<br />
Looks like maybe 3 different drops per.  I'll have to farm the Hate's Fury for the FT aug for my cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did 3 tonight, two HF and one Unrest.  The good rewards are only if your group is average level 65+.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rukgut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I understand the xp for the Unrest mission is pretty good (PoFire-ish) with 40k hp mobs hitting around 700 max.  Any truth to that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never been to PoF, so can't compare xp - but the mobs do max hit in the mid 600s, and the xp is only slightly less than RCoD.  40khp sounds a bit low, but our group was DPS light so it may have just been my impression - didnt log it to be able to give concrete facts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With 2 people in the zone (1 outside just for the purpose of having 3 to get the mission), I was getting just under 5 percent per kill.<br />
<br />
Not the best exp I've ever gotten but super easy and virtually no danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did Unrest with a good group. Was taking about an hour to do the entire mission. I used my double XP AA during it and got just over 2 AA for the hour so pretty good XP if you are killing fast.  And at an hour per reward its a quick farm if some people want the drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same experience as Drak in the Unrest mission.<br />
After doing both Unrest and the Hates Fury missions about 3 times each, it  seem the HF mission is a bit better xp.  No numbers to back it up.<br />
<br />
If I know I'll be doing one of these missions I save my VR double xp for them.<br />
<br />
I have read some people to claim they are soloing and duoing the unrest mission in 10 to 15 minutes.  Dunno and dont care...the xp is too easy to pass up and other than the 65hp aug, the loots arent much of an upgrade for our groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AadinyeDuathiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been doing the Unrest one with guildies and friends.  One time we went in and noone hailed the NPC on the island in Dagnors.  We killed all the named and spawned a locked chest.  Because we neglected to hail, we did not get credit for any of the artifacts.  Our cleric gated out and hailed her which only gave us credit for the Hail.  Since we were out of choices, our tank decided to hack away at the chest.  It broke open and we got the loot.  Another time we decided to try and go down to the basement to kill the ghost and see if the chest spawned, bypassing the other two named.  It didn't, so we went back and killed the acolyte and librarian.  Once the librarian died the chest spawned.  <br />
<br />
Good xp and a lot of fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When doing a level 65 mission in Unrest, we were getting about 2-3% AAXP per kill in a group of 3 (65/65/66). Trash mobs were very weak, hitting for up to 293 and were fully slowable, although they had a lot of HP for the level. A 925 nuke would take them down 3-4%.<br />
<br />
Don't make the same mistake that we made and set up camp behind the house. Unless you like having 4-6 in camp, that is :)</div></div><hr />
