<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordraeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After two nights of 4 hours each, I've about had it with this guard.<br />
<br />
I've done everything out of order already. I ran about 10-15 seals to get my faction up. Completed everything else in the Hole. We killed Fright recently and got the SL. And the princess just gave me the BoA.<br />
<br />
So, as my faction is higher than what it would be if I were just turning in the stuff regularly, can I skip the Tome and just turn in my swords and sheath and get this thing over with? I am leary of loosing the swords, but I don't really want to go back down there.<br />
<br />
Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If you've already skipped around you don't need the tome<br />
2. If you're skipping around you don't need to run seals<br />
3. If you're skipping around you better use invisible to reach Indifferent on every turn in you do</div></div><hr />
