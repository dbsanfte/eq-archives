<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Incurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On two seperate seru raids i and some other SK's within our raiding guild have run up Unholied and released our HT upon seru.<br />
Pre-patch unholy lands fine everytime never seen it resisted, hell seru is one of the only mobs i dont think ive ever seen resist a disease or poison spell of mine no matter how long the fight lasts.<br />
However every sk without the unresistable AA has had it resisted, so no more disease check with unholy? or just bad luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rkikzza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It might be possible that they were still using an old hotkey that wasnt trigering UA properly, if his hotkey was /disc unholyaura then it wouldn't have fired and might be the casue for resist, if not /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Incurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope, no hotkey useage from me or the others, was click disc, click HT button. Anyone else tried this recently on MR immune mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lucy doesn't say it changes the resist check to disease, they most likely forgot about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RKik: old Unholy hotkeys wouldn't work as of the day they put the new melee stuff in. Had no time to buy my new Tomes the first night they were in and when I went to click my hotkey on a raid later, nothing happened. (I have Unholy on one hotkey and HT on the other)<br />
<br />
<br />
So yea, was real surprised to have Seru resist my HT last time- will have to /bug it next time we do him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callipygia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is there any way around using two hotkeys for Unholy and HT?  /disc unholy seems to work, but for some reason my macro won't do the HT command that's on the second line.  Do I need to program a /pause in there?  I'm wondering if Unholy is not a insta-click discipline anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't made any changes to my hotkey and it still works as expected:<br />
<br />
/disc unholy aura<br />
/doability 3<br />
<br />
<br />
I seem to recall someone in another thread mentioning that you need to have a space inbetween unholy and aura, as I have above, or simply just using /disc unholy.<br />
<br />
Only other thing I can think is that perhaps your HT button has been moved to another slot in your abilities window that doesn't reflect your /doability line.<br />
<br />
EDIT: misspell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rosefire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Having the same problem as with Callipygia. Only way I found is to 1st press and activate ur unholy disc, then press a 2nd time ( maybe more ) to fire the HT.<br />

My hotkey is<br />
<br />
/dis unholy <br />
/doability 9<br />

/disc does nto work anymore Rose, you have to go buy the tomes and hit Alt-c, click the s or c whatever, and you can hotkey them in that little 8 key thing. You can then transfer the macros from there to you hotkeys, and put it next to HT or whatever you want, it is no longer possible to have ur disc and HT on the same line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess I'm the only person that types /disc unh then hits their iht hotkey every time they use it? :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
the /disc command still works, once you turn in the tomes to the guildmaster there is no reason to even have the comba abilities wind open other than to see if they are greyed out. The only change to the /disc command is that it no longer tells you the refresh timer as there are now 3 seperate timers for disciplins.<br />
<br />
easiest way to set up a hotkey is simply<br />
/disc unholy<br />
/alt activate 86(or doability #)<br />
<br />
no need for a pause in my experiance but I guess lag could cause issues with them fireing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LEG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes have noticed that the unholy / HT keys are not reseting also this however is a small problem compaired to the fact that our Unholy disc is on a different timer than our AA skill,  Touch of the wicked !! ( our reduced  AA timer for Harm touch ) .<br />
<br />
 e.g    <br />
<br />
     HARM TOUCH TIMER ( without touch of the wicked ) = 1h 12min<br />
<br />
     Timer for UNHOLY AURA =   1h 3 minutes<br />
<br />
     Ok HT works fine if u have no aa reducing the time that it takes to use harmtouch your unholy aura will refresh in time to use your next HT . <br />
      But .... what happens when you spend all your hard earned aa points on TOUCH OF THE WICKED ( reduces refresh timer on HT after use ) <br />
      <br />
       TOUCH OF THE WICKED level 1 ( 2aa point) takes 12 min off HT timer so ya harm touch now takes 1 Hour to refresh ...... so all of a sudden your huge harm touch cant be used until 1hour and 3 minutes .....not so bad you say, well it gets worse !!!<br />
<br />
       TOUCH OF THE WICKED level 2 ( 4 aa points ) drops ya HT reuse time down to 48 minutes ..... but wait  you can't use your super harm touch because .... your UNHOLY AURA disc will not refresh till 1h 3 minutes ....   <br />
<br />
           So whats the point in spending hard earned AA points in TOUCH OF THE WICKED  to reduce ya harm touch timer if u cant even use ya super harm touch till 1hour 3 minutes are up .<br />
<br />
           TOUCH OF THE WICKED level 3 (6 aa points) 36 min timer for harm touch  ....... WHY WASTE YA  AA , ITS NOT GOING TO HELP,  soe please fix this.<br />

<br />
I think this is probably dead on. Easy enough to test. Head into CoD hit disc, then use regular HT. Everything is diease immune, so if HT does any damage deals any damage then it not disease based, if it resisted it probably is disease based.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have had a couple of instances now where I hit my HT hotkey and Unholy fails to fire but HT does. Current  HT key is set up thus<br />
<br />
/disc unholy<br />
/pause 5<br />
/doability 3<br />
<br />
I have checked Unholy is ready each time and no other discipline was active. Doing a few more to test a pause of 10.</div></div><hr />
