<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a post on these boards linking to an external web page that includes another walkthrough of 1.5 along with an introduction to 2.0 on the next page of it. It was as follows :<br />
<br />
&quot;After completing Epic 1.5 Gilihna will send you to City of Mist to find Kilidina. He is FD not for from the zone in on the right. Upon hailing him he will go live. Info on him. He hits for 4700 max but like most OOW mobs its not to hard to tank. He casts Plasma Decay AE the nastyone from Grummus. He does the 3 minute mez that Terris Thule's adds in Time do. And there was another AE. With 12 Qvic geared folks we managed to burn him down. He didn't have alot of hps but did bring some pain. It was close with those 12. He drops a head which you return to Gilihna.<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior takes the head from you and holds it by the hair. Gilina casts a small spell and the head springs to life. 'Talk, Kilidna. What has happened to you?' Kilidna's head begins to sob. 'I am sorry, master. I was corrupted by evil magic! Now look at me! I dare say I will not be able to finish my studies any time soon.' Gilina scowls, 'What did you find out while in the city of mist? Tell me now!' 'Well master, it seems that when Innoruuk's Voice was summoned to this plane, it drew the attention of many [powerful beings].'<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior says 'Yes, what powerful beings? Out with it, head!' 'Well, master, one of these powerful beings has resurrected Lhranc from the dead! When I confronted him, he turned me into a mindless zombie! I overheard Lhranc talking about recovering the sword for himself. You are both in great danger! Lhranc cannot be defeated in his current form and he will surely be coming for the sword!' Gilina tosses Kilidna's head aside. 'Thank you, Kilidna. Your services are no longer required. Well it seems we have quite the [dilemma] on our hands, wouldn't you say?'<br />
<br />
Gilina Yilzior says 'Luckily, I have much knowledge of Lhranc, the first of the shadowknights. We must find a way to anchor him to this plane so that he will be vulnerable to our attacks. I believe if we recover some items of his from his former life, we may be able to accomplish this. First, you will need to find his pendant. Look for it in the City of Mist. Next, you will need to recover Lhranc's corroded bracer from Charasis. Lastly, you will need to find Lhranc's ring from the undead in the Kithicor Woods. Once you have all these items, return them to me.'<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Gilina Yilzior takes the items from you and holds them before you in her hands. She mutters an incantation and the items meld into one. 'This item will be used to help anchor Lhranc to this plane of existence. The anchor will not be enough however. In an area in the Realm of Discord known as Anguish, you will need to find a globe of discordant energy. This will be used to infuse the earthly anchor with the power of discord. When you have these two items, hand them to my contact, Filligno the Slayer. He has tracked down Lhranc in Dranik, the Ruined City in the Realm of Discord. He will need your help to get Lhranc's attention however.<br />

CoM - Black reavers drop the Pendanet<br />
Charsis - A random golem in the East wing dropped the Bracer (LONG camp)<br />
Kithichor - Riazen Commander dropped the Ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's my question. Has anyone confirmed these steps ? Has anyone progressed beyond it ? Can anyone share it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nanelane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is correct, and the next step involves Citadel of Anguish, a keyed OoW zone so there has been no progression past these steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">anyone have any info on the kith and HS parts?  the reaver part is real easy, but haven't found much on the other 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iohotep-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The kith part dropped off a rotting knight for me. Risen commander I tried camping, but only one or none would spawn when nighttime came around. Was sitting by RV zone when i got agro on a rotting knight and got lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Avryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Camped east wing for bracer today.  I would say upwards of 6 hours with nothing.  Killed all the golems druislla room, past her room, at zone out etc.  Slaughtered many of the regular ghosts etc but no bracer.<br />
<br />
On the bright side I did get a spirit wracked urn from drusilla which was funny considering when I actually wanted to do the quest a friend who was quitting had to mq it with me after 20 kills with no urn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the ring in kithicor from a Revenging Knight. Pretty much i was running around killing anything that looked like a zombie model. Took me about 2h but that is because of the downtime till night when the undeads spawn.<br />
<br />
Reavers was straightforward but i have some issues in HS. I have killed over 130 golems so far. clearing the first room in east wing, drusella's room the room after and the 2 in zone out and nada. I even got drusella herself to pop on my head and dropped the urn too (go me). But after over 130 golems I start wondering whether i am killing the right mobs or not :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yanikren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">okay from talking to guildies it seems that the locked zones are locked for raids. one zone the raid has to be lvl 69 ( not sure if u have to have a certain number of peeps in raid or not yet ) and another zone the raid has to be lvl 70. info about weither or not everyone has to be that lvl or if it is an average of the raid is still unclear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KilvenSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok after like the millionth Golem I got a drop. Room between Drusilla's and Zone out room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>carna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Camped hs for 10 hours with nothing, is this information valuable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Temet Nosce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got the bracer from one of the golems in the last room before the zone-out. Took 3 spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">okay from talking to guildies it seems that the locked zones are locked for raids. one zone the raid has to be lvl 69 ( not sure if u have to have a certain number of peeps in raid or not yet ) and another zone the raid has to be lvl 70. info about weither or not everyone has to be that lvl or if it is an average of the raid is still unclear.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only way to average 70 for your raid is for everyone to be 70. <br />
<br />
The game truncates its numbers. If even one person is 69 then your average could become 69.9999999 and the raid window will reflect average raid level of 69.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taladaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my bracer off of a mortiferous golem.  Dinged level 68 while there...made over 3500pp and got about 10K worth of tribute from the crap gear that dropped (Hint:  If you get a necklace of superiority, it's worth about 17K tribute).  I also did the Hand of Glory combine so I never have to have NORENT keys again.  Yay me.  Total time was 8 hours over a 2 day period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ziox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah bracer is a loong camped , about 8 hours b4 i got mine  at zone out area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Has anyone made it to COA yet ? I got 2 trials down 4 left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Knevil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Taladaar and I were haunting around HS about the same time, Mort Golem droped the bracer for me but I hadn't gotten to the druz room. This was on my second day after camping Hand of Glory parts and Golem room for about 3 hours. Yes the Necklace is nice tribute, was a plesant surprise. Cash isn't terrible either.<br />
<br />
Ring was in the same location stated in the offsite walkthrough, near the burnt out house. It dropped off a risen commander.<br />
<br />
Pendant was just about 3 clearings of golems. You may get lucky if a golem keeps respawning after killed. Mine actually droped on the third of a 4 spawn set.<br />
<br />
Two signets into anguish key atm, still grinding away.<br />

We havent had much luck or time there so no progression towards 2.0 from there. Been basically spending my free time camping the bracer. <br />
