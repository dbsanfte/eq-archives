<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">looking at the armory board I noticed most people like to suggest rounding out stats on characters, sentient for ogres and trolls, crusty or maybe VC for DEs, erudites, maybe gnomes.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering, if you pick an erudite because you like a high int, then why turn around and buy str/sta gear? now I understand that some items are just really nice, and some stats will cap out in raid evnvironment, but otherwise, why not get int on an erudite? maybeexploit your strengths rather than trying to eliminate your weaknesses, an erudite with 200+ int can probably survive a while tanking just through lifetaps, and can clear a larger room before having to med.<br />
<br />
an ogre can be the big mean meat shield they always wanted, while a DE can be the spell caster who can tap you to death without raising his sword.<br />
<br />
of course this all depends on how you view your character, iksar and humans seem to be a bit of a middle ground in stats, so maybe you'd want the welll rounded middleman, or maybe you just wanted the tail, the scales, or the eyepatch and you really wanted to be more of an int or str/sta based character, since they are towards the middle maybe you could go either way.<br />
<br />
I'm sort of wondering do you agree with the idea of exploiting your advantages based on your race, or would you prefer to round out your character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zeralenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The biggest problem with my race, dark elf (how come everyone seems to forget that DEs can be shadowknights, too?) is the lack of strength. Armor weighs a ton and can become a problem. Yet an SK without armor class is ... well ... almost as bad as a ranger.<br />
<br />
My solution? I took a long term view and learned smithing. At level 40 (real level, not smithing; my smithing is 180) I now wear a full suit of DE cultural enchanted adamantite plate I made myself, which adds strength stats and weighs a lot less than other plate.<br />
<br />
I wore sentient for awhile but DEs already start out with pretty high intelligence. Plus, the stat bonuses for INT for enchanted adamantite plate are better than sentient, and it adds strength, agility, dexterity and hella good AC without the heavy weight.<br />
<br />
There are ways to compensate. You can both play up your strengths and shore up your weaknesses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it is because people rarely choose their SK based on the starting stats.  The race they choose is based on other factors, such as roleplay value or they just like the look.  I chose Iksar because I liked how they look, no other consideration whatsoever.<br />
<br />
From there, you seek ways to smooth out any perceived weakness in starting stats.  If you're Erudite, for instance, you may want to improve your STR and STA to complement your INT.  An Ogre may seek out more INT and mana items to complement their melee capability.<br />
<br />
Also, there are some stats that you want raised to a minimal level, such as AGI to 75 (to avoid paying an AC penalty) and STA to 100 (to avoid paying a fatigue penalty).  Thus classes who are deficient in those stats will look to increase them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>asguth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If an ogre has an int of 108 with items and a de has a int of 199 who has less downtime?? Sure that fat ogre lacks the total mana that the de does but does that mean that it takes him longer to med up? NO it doesnt!!!! Will the ogre learn to be more mana efficient than the de? I think the chances are pretty good that he will. Also looking at the high end game mana regen is gonna be not as bad as it is now if its bad at all now! Can a sk raise his hand if he isnt using kei to maximize his soloing potential?? I dont think many will make that claim. With kei who really cares about mana if your soloing with kei and this is true for alomst all levels which are very mana heavy. To me it seems that many higher sk spells are being tuned to the larger races that dont have the mana of the smaller races with spells like deadly temptation and lich. This combined with Kei which we should have up as much as possible is more than enough reason for me to chose a large race even if they do have the low int. Do you really want to miss out on having slam with a 2 handed wepon for like almost all the levels of your sk career. Im Decided although i do play my human cuz shes such a cutie hehe. The only thing that you have to decide on really is do you want regen or do you want to not be able to be stunned from the front? Unless you are going for RP value in that case Pick whatever class you enjoy. I really hate that statement that any race class combonation for sk is good that is such a cop out from someone who is just dealing with the class they chose. Research and ask high lvl sk how they like their sk and what they dont many are happy to devulge any info about the class. There are definate Differences of almost up to 100 attack rating if i use my human with exact weapons and armour compared to my ogre and with kei there is practically no difference in mana since we are only 1/4 caster our spells dont make too much of a dent in kei. Iksar would be a pain in the arse to get to 60 and the armour restrictions are a pain too but after you get past the bs of gettin all the armour and weps for a iks god you could be very powerful.<br />
Eh but too much hassle for me hehe. Im going with large race too many things i like about em just be sure about the class you pick if you solo maybe tollie would be best but if you group mostly then id go ogre just imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Razaduuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">boy tha's quite a block of text...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I wasn't neccessarily advocating that erudites/DE/gnome are better than ogre/troll. I also agree that you could get all your stats up, but more wondering why it is suggested more often to strengthen your weaknesses rather than your advantages.<br />
<br />
Although  in the end I think I'm gonna have to agree with Lizarde, personally I did consider stats wen making my SK, but mostly i considered the pros and cons that could not be compensated by gear, AC bonus, exra regen, size, vision (though not much), and faction. (okay so faction you can fix, but it takes a lot of time for some places)</div></div><hr />
