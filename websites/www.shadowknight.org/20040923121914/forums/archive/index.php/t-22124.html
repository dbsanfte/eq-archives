<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ommnoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been to dozens upon dozens of clearings in PoFear and have yet to see this weapon drop....ever!  This is the last piece I need for the final CoM fight.  So, several things please:<br />
<br />
1)  The research I've done on Fear indicates the Amy Knights can drop this weapon.  Can anyone 100% confrim this?  I've also heard rumor the Dracolich can drop this.  Can anyone confirm this as well?  If neither mob types drop SLDoB then this will cut out a ton of the clearing of trash and dealing with that damned temple.  God I hate this zone.<br />
<br />
2)  Is two solid groups sufficient to handle the golems?  Say, heavy on the DPS.  Could it be done with one group, given it's wittled down to 5 with the DT?  In all the countless clearings I've done of this place, it has always been with multiple groups. <br />
<br />
3)  After working on this epic for 3+ years now I'm about at my wits end with the Fear drop being the major hang up for completion.  I'm willing to pay hansomly for an MQ on this should anyone on Terris Thule have one.  Just shoot me a tell.<br />
<br />
The rarity of this drop is just plain idiotic and should be ran up the chain to be looked into increasing similar to the one they did for Hate.<br />
<br />
Any help you folks can provide in the above is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.<br />
