<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to duo this entire quest with a 65SK and 65 Cleric with 100AA ? If so how long would it take (estimated) to complete ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the entire thing either with just my SK (who was in her 50's at the time) or using my pocket Druid (65) for ports, buffs, etc. The only thing I didn't solo or dualbox was the Mirror- but I didn't buy an MQ. I think the group was druid, chanter, monk, druid or something, and that was mainly because the monk wanted the Urn. There are threads in here on how to do Drusella with a 65SK, check those out if you really want to do this part on your own. <br />
<br />
The Greenish Metal Shard I was given by a friend- while I was able to duo down to the Herbalist with a chanter/druid combo- the camp alone would have made me cry. So that's a whole different ball of wax and can be the biggest holdup if you can't find one for sale or just can't get the drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for how long the rest of it would take- really depends. The faction farming is a whole separate thing and can be the longest timesink of all.<br />
<br />
As for the drops- I got really lucky on all of mine and the longest camp was a 4 hour one. But then there's ones where I would go back and hang for an hour then go do something else. I know some people who spent days on one drop. <br />
<br />
If you got lucky on drops then you could do it in a very short period of time (again assuming your faction is done)- depending on how often you play.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have your faction done (and all times based on my own experience)<br />
First Khukri - couple of minutes<br />
Second-without a tracker, could take you the rest of your life :p Took me 3 nights on this one.<br />
Third: few minutes in Kurns<br />
Fourth: couple hours in Warsliks<br />
Fifth: hour tops (travelling, waiting for spawn, etc)<br />
Sixth: Took me about 8-10 hours total. Has taken some people an eternity. <br />
Seventh: CoM scrolls took me about 5-6 hours total, MM took about 2 hours, Kaesora Crypt Raider took me 20 minutes- also <br />
one of the camps that can take forever. The keys and Argest took me about 10 hours of camping over the course of a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Greenmist, The Unholy Khukri of Rile-<br />
Just read the walkthrough that is sticked, the levels of the mobs are given right there, as mentioned above you can do them all, it's just a matter of the few time sinks (getting Drus to drop the mirror, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, just read the walkthroughs posted on the top, those were my bible for this and the responses pretty much tell you what the varied lengths of times can be for all the camps and how easy or difficult each was as well.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
