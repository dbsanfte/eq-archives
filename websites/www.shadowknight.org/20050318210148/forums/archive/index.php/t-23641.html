<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grosbras2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As it takes me 5 death to learn to do it properly (ok I am an ogre so try to make anexplanation in less than 2 words with less than 7 letters (CHARGE ?)). So I give you the walkthrough so your pet can teach it to you with 1 group. You need 1 tank (for me a 9k9 68 war, healers and dps. you can add a slower and CCer but the only needed is you the SK. If you can have another way to DA/harmshield (bestow DA from cle , another SK, a pal that will be easier). You need to mem harmshield, FD (aa if you have it), gather shadow, any darkness if you are on snare... whatever you need to increase your group dps (aura,bite...)). Verify that your SOE is up for a good 30mn.... no horse available in ruin (<br />
<br />
From BF zone in go invi, exit castle, take first bridge on left, then  the other bridge. You are at the entrance of the murkglider part. It is normaly safe , I had my 55 bard camped here to be able to check on breeder wo problem. I will call this point point A. <br />
refresh invi follow corridor to a room full of glider, take the other corridor you arrive another room (also full of murkglider) that is where the named murkglider and our breeder spawn. Take the other exit (call this entrance point B), climb stairs, on your left is a Dead end with a single murglider, set your camp here (kill this mob and start the job).)<br />
<br />
a) go to point B (without INVI), cast harmshield, enter room  and run to poiint A to FD ... the long way to do it (aggro everything, specially the breeder, I usually make a run around her to be sure, DO NOT STOP RUNNING you are on a tight schedule), cross the room, enter other corridor (aggro corridor you cannot prevent it), enter other room (aggro it also... looks like a nice train now) your HS shoould stop when you exit the 2nd room as you are faster you should reach thebridge before the murkglider with enough time to stop, make a half turn (as a 65+ sk you should know why)and cast FD (careful you cannot take too many fizzle). You should have make pop 2 murkglider spawn in the begining of the corridor ... wait 2mn (message your ennemies has forgotten you), cast gather shadow , return to camp by the way you came (if your invi drop ... good luvk to you mine did not, you can also COTH if you have a mage).<br />
b) rinse and repeat step a twice (took me 10mn as a cle gave me bestow DA for the 2nd pull, and I refreshed DA for the third).<br />
c) now the easy part you just pull the 2 murkglider nearest to point A (FD pull, pet pull as you prefer), then the breeder (FD pull just to be sure that you bring it single a roamer go sometimes near it and can give you multiple adds else it comes single). Take your time I single pull all of them  and the spawns where still up when I ran back to ruin more than 20mn after my first pull. <br />
The important points to remember:<br />
1) all spawn should be in the corridor where you FD (they are also the only murkglider there), so verify that you have exactly 6, you have 2mn to count them (even my ogre managed to learn to count up to 6). This if much easier with a tracker.... if you have one.<br />
2) your camp is in a DE with 1 murkglkider who can pop there, kill it just before breeder pull ... In my experience you can be sure that spawn and add will target your cleric first.... perhaps bad luck but really you prefer to do it without add.<br />
3) if your group want to do something they can pull from the breeder room while you clear aggro 3 times, just be careful on adds (you need a FD puller IMO).<br />
4) always keep a snare ready murkglider run away (except for the breeder who is unsnarable but do not run).<br />
5) No mobs see invi from the zone in to the camp point... and that include the breeder (not sure with the other named which pop in the breeder room, I have seen it only once... and had not time to check before pull). I have seen murkglider which are undead in other zones but these one are NOT.</div></div><hr />

Are you basically just saying us DA to pull them into a different room where they will corpse camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or, simply cast HS and pull the Breeder to the bloodfields zone, as has been written in this forum a number of times.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">simple way is just train her to zone blood fields and zone. zone back invis and do it again. 2 times of those and she'll have spawned all 6 for sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your gear should not be an issue.  I did this at less than 7k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Clear the room of murks.  Get as far away as you can from the Breeder and hit him with an arrow.  Then run to zone.  With run5 and a CoS, I didn't have to cast harmshield, but since you have neither, you will want to.   You won't get stunned with harmshield up.  That's it.  Pretty simple.  You will probably have to do it twice to pop all 6 adds.  So get the 1-shot DA from the Dain, or bring another sk/bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just had a leet Bard pull the Breeder and kite until all adds were out and then he Highsunned the Breeder back to his spawn point and I proceeded to pull Breeder single to cubby where we killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FINALLY killed the bastard today.<br />
<br />
The Breeder has been the hardest part for me. I Failed 4 times before before geting it right. The train strat works. I do it a bit different than how it was desecribed in the posts i read.<br />
<br />
I pull my pet out, invis get in hall oppisite the breeder. Hit pet attk on breeder then RUN LIKE HELL youll still be invised so the mobs on the way out the tunnel wont attk till the breeder passes through but this gives you a HUGE head start. have HS up just incase they warp. It happened once.<br />
<br />
I trained breeder off 2 times just like that an got 5 Spawns out.  i F/D on bridge  an then waited for the 2 min and got up and invised back in to camp. The Druid used the new harmony on the PH next to the breeder an the mob in center of Room She said PULL Breeder an so i hit it with a ToD an brought his ass to the Group.  NOTE we did not kill Any mobs in the room jsut the one spawn in cubby where the camp was an the static that wanders up stairs an the one mob that is stationary right around the corner from breeder. An liek i said used Harmony to get breeder Solo with no F/D tag or nothing. Yes it can be F/D split but its not snareable soo it takes few trys to get it split right. Harmony worked real smooth.<br />
<br />
Another thing to think about while going after the breeder is you want to pull the breeder just after you kill the three mobs i mentioned above the Cubby Spawn, the Static that goes up steps an teh one jsut around corner from breeder in halway. you want to pull breeder right aftter that mob in halway is dead gives you plenty of time to kill breeder before pops come. The breeder has a SHIT load of H/P an resisted damn near everything i threw at it exept for Life taps was a long fight an its not  hard hitter once its slowed. <br />
<br />
I know there are alot of posts about how to kill the breeder an i have commented in almost all of them ((complaining about not being able to kill the bastard)). Well i got the SoB today an im happy so i figured i would share my story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At this point I'd settle for seeing the damn thing pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Training to Bloodfields would work, but I think its irresponsible to train raid mobs to any zone in/out.   Clear the breeder room, run around in a circle around the outskirts of the room till 5 babies are out (props Del) then train it outside till the last baby spawns.  FD and have someone ready to grab it at spawn if it warps, and someone in hall ready to grab it as well.  You can either train it past the cubby (everyone MUST be invis) or if you have a &quot;rule #1&quot; like I do, pop invis and run towards the BF zone.  FD when you hit the safe hall before you leave murk tunnel.  I didn't aggro any other mobs this way.  Then have someone else pick it up when it gets back to its room (don't let it reset).  You probably won't get to participate in the fight, but it works.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure this is posted in one of several hundred other threads here :p.</div></div><hr />

The breeder is not a raid mob. CAN be taken down by 1 Solid group.<br />
<br />
 I layed F/D at breeder the first time i got it to pop.  But could not find the help to kill it.<br />
<br />
Watched a group of 5  people Take it down. took all of 10 min once engaged but they did the train Single pulled her and beat her down slowly but surely.<br />
<br />
I took breeder down with 9 people IMO thats not a raid.<br />
<br />
2 Sk's<br />
1 Enchanter<br />
2 clerics<br />
1 druid<br />
1 necro<br />
1 warrior<br />
1 bard<br />
Was a easy fight. Get the pull right,get it slowed,BURN the SoB down.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you can split hairs over what is and what isn't a raid mob all day.  The final fight in the SK epic 1.5 isn't considered a raid mob by exceptionally geared people either.  Basically, most people who zone into RCOD would be dead before their screen refreshed if the breeder was sitting at the zone.  Thats my point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your point would make some sense if the idea was to train the mob for shits and giggles and then wait a couple hours for the cavalary to arrive.  The idea is the kill the damn thing, if someone has THAT god damn bad timing (on my server RCoD usually has the same 10 people in it any evening) then you use the cleric you brought with you to kill the thing to rezz them after it's dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea your right its a thin line between raids and a group or 2 trying to kill one mob.<br />
<br />
But if you have ever done the breeder pull you would know that if your halling ass like you should be when training it to ZL you can get to ZL WAY before the murks or any other mobs get close enough to aggro people at ZL. ((IF)) big IF...you do the train like i described in prior post which involves being invis the whole way its really easy to do it.<br />
<br />
Its conceivable that you dont even have to zone or take the train all the way  to ZL  if you do it useing invis and pet. I did the train to the first bridge just outside the caves heading twords ZL i F/D in the middle of that bridge wait the 2 min and  get up do it again till all babies are out.<br />
<br />
Pulling pet out Invising and then Sending pet on attk on breeder will succesfully clear out that WHOLE room you will be invis SO if you RUN LIKE HELL as soon as you sick the pet on Breeder and you are not too clsoe to breeder when you Send in pet and you RUN as soon as you send it you CAN make it too bridge F/D  with Plenty of Room between you and the mobs...<br />
<br />
The wanderer Kyv Eyeclollector paths across bridge and back down the other side ..if he is there just F/D and let him path away  you gotta wait the 2 min anway to drop aggro.<br />
<br />
The hardest part of the whole damn thing is being patient. if you try and rush things that murk cave will kick your ass no matter how well equiped you and your freinds are.  Take your time and have your strategy, make sure EVERYONE with you knows whats going on, and then execute. <br />
<br />
There are 100 different posts about, the Breeder, The pull, the training and all the things you will need to know here on this site. The breeder is VERY tuff. No doubt the hardest part of Epic 1.5 for me. But after many Rushed and failed attempts i went out didnt rush anything had my strategy planed everyone was aware of what was going to happen and when. <br />
<br />
 we executed and i went home with my egg.</div></div><hr />

I've read the various posts here regarding the breeder pull and it seems doable.  But I need clarification on one part: someone mentioned (Nimic?) not to allow the breeder to reset at spawn.  What happens if it does reset?  Does it then have the ability to pop six more babies?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly... and then you gotta clear all the babies it pooped out, or deal with training them around in addition to the breeder + six more babies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ahhh... thanks.  That helps explain why most peeps run all the way to the BF zone instead of a couple rooms away, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">havent done my own yet...but did the pull for another sk on TP...<br />
<br />
when i did it...used a mage for coth....got pet ...invised....pet attack...started running...stood on bridge till i could see the murks coming out of the cave...then cothed<br />
<br />
somewhat variable as to how fast the babies pop....so i would rinse and repeat 3 times total...then had the rest of group pull breeder to camp<br />
<br />
doing it with a mage didnt make it any easier to pull him towards BF (was already easy)....just made it easier to get back and repeat quickly to be absolutely sure you have them all out....<br />
<br />
doing it this way also allows you to count how many babies are out as you run past them invis on the 2nr or 3rd pulls....<br />
<br />
-Ephyr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did the camp today, and Breeder popped in a couple hours.  Following the advice/tactics here, I used pet on first train to BF w/rule#1 for a head start and HS'd the second time.  4 babies popped on first, 2 babies on 2nd.  Cleared cubby, the roamers and one or two mobs out front (ranger harmony pulled) and then pulled the breeder.<br />
<br />
Was a close call, I got down to half a bub health at one point (thought I was a goner), but I got my egg with a group of six (70shd, 70dru, 70clr, 70rng, 69rng, 70enc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kruggan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thought I'd share my experience.  Did the Breeder yesterday...<br />
<br />
SK buddy of mine in the guild who I'm very grateful to, put my butt in gear to camp the PH.  After 2 PHs the breeder popped.  I was doing the happy dance.  We quickly got 12 people to RCoD (2 clerics, 2 SKs, 1 shaman, some DPS), buffed em, and moved to camp spot.  Our tactic was pretty simple.  A 70 paladin served as the main assist and made sure the camp was clear of roamers, etc. while my SK buddy began training the breeder towards the zone line to empty her of babies.  He got 5 out but was pretty darn low on health and the clock was ticking.  I then trained her one final time to get the remaining spawn to pop out, while he cleared agro, ran back to camp and got a heal.  As soon as I feigned off the train, he snagged the Breeder (then solo, due to the fact that it immediately warps back to its room while every other mob paths back normally).  The team made short work of the Breeder.  No deaths, no problems.  By the time my agro cleared 2 min later, I ran back just in time to see the Breeder collapse.<br />
<br />
I'm very thankful this part is OVER! :)  Hope this was helpful.</div></div><hr />
