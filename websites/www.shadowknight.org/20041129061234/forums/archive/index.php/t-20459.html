<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay here it goes. I am a lvl 65 SK, this is my main and have 575 AA at this time. Have played this toon for 1 1/2 years. <br />
<br />
I use DOTS. So far so good...<br />
<br />
My guild does Saryn in Po Torments and the MB comes up. I bid for it. I am told I do not use dots... Well I do use dots,I explain, but then I am told not like Necros, shammans, and druids. So I am told I will not be allowed to bid as this is not my way to do damage. I did some reading on this and realize the shammans, necros and some druids do use dots as a main damage, but rats SK's too. Actually on the search that I did an SK said he got MB and he liked it and made him more powerful. So the question for you veterans out there. What do you think about this?<br />
<br />
My SK is very powerful but I do not see any of my raid leaders using me to the maximum potential. I am basically put as an offtank, pallies get the first shot at loot that is Pally / SK and even pallies are placed to tank big mobs, but not SK. <br />
<br />
I usually do not say much of anything as I am basically outnumbered. I do not like to enter into heated arguments.<br />
<br />
I am the only lvl 65 SK , not to say I do  not think any one in my guild has 575 AA and the others are mostly too low to have any idea of how a high lvl 65- SK works. <br />
<br />
 Actually many times I am the only SK in the raids. So when I hear people say this sort of thing, you do not use dots. I just makes me furious to say the least. What about Festering Darkness, Heat Blood, Death Bond, to name a few? Did someone forget that we are part necro?  Did someone forget that I am constanly using mana?<br />
<br />
Then I see Warriors getting awarded weapons that have mana of 125, and me being passed on such items. Well then, they do not use mana, why should they be allowed to bid on an item that they can not use to their full potential?<br />
<br />
I also have seen Rangers get weapons that would have been better used in my hands as rangers do a shit load of damage from a distance. So why award such a weapon to a Ranger, who is not going to use this weapon as effectively as me, but then I am told I will not enter in the MB as it is not my main way to do damage. Rangers  are not a tank class like an SK, but they got the tank weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems to me that something needs to be discussed here.<br />
Or am I whinning? <br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas are welcomed before I stick my foot in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Kritr lvl 65 Sk and proud of it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SK dot's suck, really don't worry about it too much, you have one dot thats worthwhile for damage and it's only 26 dps, the best focus in the game only adds 20% (5.2 dps) to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well if our dots suck, then two things come to mind. Why did we get them to begin with if they are that bad and should have they been 1/2 of our parent class?<br />
<br />
# 2. Still as we are left behind other classes, like they are now trying to make the warriors basically indestructible, any improvement in my opinion would be welcomed.<br />
So why not award the MB to an SK if it will improve our miserable situation?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kritr <br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MB should go to PRIMARY dotters first. That means, the majority of what you do is dps through dotting. That == necros<br />
<br />
After that it should be open to whoever is willing to shell out for it.<br />
<br />
Shammies get nice dots but no way to deal with the aggro generated<br />
<br />
Druids get nice dots but nicer DD's and pretty much every druid I know prefers to DD - it makes more sense. You get a much higher chance to crit with DD and only recently a low (9%) chance to crit with dots for um..30ish aa<br />
<br />
Like Brael said though, sk dots aren't great at all, if we run into dot slot issues I will be bitching at everyone who uses a slot for a less than 50dps dot :P<br />
<br />
Brael's point was something like, it's not worth making a big fuss over such a moderate upgrade to dps when for other classes it is quite significant. Or I think that's what he was saying :-)<br />
<br />
However if you do pure DKP you'll often see gear going to classes it makes no sense on..like those vengX (i think) and mod taunt 10% boots went to a bard on my server..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay after studying, thinking on the issue I guess being passed on this is okay. Just does not feel good being at the bottom end of the totem pole. Here are 2 opinions on this loot from Sk at AK:<br />
<br />
#1. I just got this and so far it works with all SK DoTs including leech spells, but the Focus Effect is kind of misleading.  It does not increas spell damage by 20% each tic. As far as I can tell it increases the effect UP TO 20%. Don't expect a full 20% increase on DoTs.                          <br />
 <br />
<br />
#2. This is an awesome item for SKs, not saying other classes wouldn't benefit or anything.  As a lvl 65 SK I would bid on this item. The stats are pretty nice and the focus effect makes us SKs just that much more powerful. However if I found out that the focus effect did not work on my leech line of spells then I wouldn't bid on it.             <br />
<br />
<br />
then this other opinion:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Btw, giving these to druids is like giving shamans ID 4 or other DD focuses. Do you REALLY want to see shamans and necros rolling for ID4 and other DD focuses when wizzies, druids, mages would do SO much better with them? The people who really and seriously DOT as a major part of what they do are shaman/necro. Shamans do almost all their damage with DOT's, and necros depend on them a bit less. Druids hardly register at the levels you will be getting this earring. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I play a level 65 Druid on Veeshan.  I myself would love to attain one of these. When you're kiting HoH or anywhere else for that matter, anything that increaces the abilities of your DoT spells is invaluable, regardless of whatever class you are. Who is to say that Druids benefit from this less than other classes? HP and Mana bonuses. Wisdom for more mana. DEX for when you start getting beat on by a goofed up pull (as if it ever happens :) <br />
<br />
BA4, to top off the list, is invaluable to any DoT using class, and druids don't benefit any less than anyone else. <br />
<br />
How much you benefit from an item doesn't depend on what class you are, it depends on how you play and the strategies you use. As a DoT kiting druid, I'd love to have this item.<br />
<br />
Edited, Sat Dec 6 15:01:48 2003<br />
<br />
 <br />
So...lots of thinking makes me then reconsider and really do not want to be a cry baby and really at this point if a shammy or necro needs this give it to them I will pass... but again not having mastered much except leech spells, and HT... when other classes get their share of goods makes me think sometimes I would like anything that will make me better even if just a little bit.<br />
<br />
Kritr<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our dot is a joke like brael said, only real dot class is the necro, shammy usually to busy to dot and 65 droods don't dot anymore, their nuke are far more efficient.<br />
<br />
Only time I'm using dots it's BoH when I want to burn mana when FM and snare when needed of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khangaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know, if you disregard everything that a SK gets, Brael, that is not teh uber, then you disregard your hasted pet, your DoT's, your spears, your attack/AC taps, your Cloak line, and myriad other spells. Where does that leave you? A gimped warrior with a penchant for necrophilia.<br />
<br />
Seriously, people need to learn that a class is a culmination of its abilities, and is not defined by one or two super powerful traits.  We are not playing diablo here. This should be apparent in that druid spells don't suck :) .  <br />
<br />
In brief, DPS adds up.  A narcoleptic with degenerative brain disorder could figure that out.  Throwing out elements of a class without considering their overall benefit is wastful and inneficient.<br />
<br />
Oh, and any SK on a real server will tell you that DoT's are often an essential element in pvp. The resistance debuff of all necro/sk fire resistance dots from Heat Blood --&gt; Pyrocruor have an insane negative resist check, far beyond the -100 of lucy's.  These spells stick regularly to players with 400+ fire resistance. And no, that doesn't apply to funeral pyre. Blood of Hate sticks to gimp resistance, acts fast, and really helps out against casters.  Bond of Death is a godsend, period.<br />
<br />
So yes, BA is a positive and extremely helpful thing for an SK. Transfer to a real server and I guarrantee that 9/10 guilds will let you bid on MB.  People there know what's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A DoT damage focus is nice to be sure, but when you're a member of a guild or raiding force, and trying to work towards higher level encounters, you want to gear up the entire guild in a way that most benefits the guild.  Giving and SK another 5 DPS is well and good, but how much extra DPS does a necromancer get out of that same item?  Certainly a lot more than that, and therefore it is more of a benefit to the guild as a whole.  If you really want Burning Affliction IV, use the tribute points to activate it.  If you do not think it is worth the tribute points, then why would you think it is worth the item?<br />
<br />
And since when are the PvP servers the &quot;real&quot; servers of Everquest?  If that was the case, there would be far more of them.  As long as the vast majority of the EQ population resides on PvE servers, I personally will consider PvE the &quot;real&quot; Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well well... I have been really giving a lot of thinking to this issue and this leads to this ...<br />
<br />
# 1. What are we SK's about?<br />
<br />
Answer: Among others... Aggro... Yes Aggro... <br />
<br />
One of the ways I get aggro is using exactly what we are talking here and is DOT spells. I keep mem 100 % of the time 3 spells : <br />
<br />
one is Festering Darkness = DOT spell<br />
<br />
The other is FD,<br />
<br />
<br />
and Voice of Thule = aggro spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So anything that I will do to make better my aggro = will make me more efficient. Notice I am not talking here on doing damage to the mob,  but getting aggro. <br />
So for me DOT spells more than actual damage will be a way to increase my aggro, which is what I am all about. <br />
<br />
So when you consider the issue of Raid situation and doing damange, I have no problem with the Necro, or shammy using it more effectively. When it comes to creating aggro then to me and SK this is invaluable, as I am an aggro machine. Without my dot spells I would not be able to gain aggro as well then I would be inefficient as aggro generator and holder. <br />
<br />
So this is what I do:<br />
<br />
Always,  I mean always use Festering Darkness to gain aggro, this is the first DOT spell I use to get aggro. <br />
<br />
I use Death Bond and Heated blood again both DOT spells to keep the aggro, but these last two are not mana efficient but nevertheless useful to keep my aggro.<br />
<br />
So guys  bottom line &quot; DOT spells = more aggro to me&quot;....<br />
<br />
I can see when in gps Necros and Shammies use their DOT spells, the mob usually gets pissed at them and runs after them making my job as an aggro holder more difficult. So I have now to keep casting Festering Darkness or Death Bond to regain my aggro.<br />
So in groups I rather Necros and Shammies not cast these as it will make my job more difficult. Then when they get hit by the aggro they created they drop like a sac of potatoes...<br />
<br />
Kritr  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tribute for all, discussion over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...<br />
<br />
Seriously<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
It's not the dot part of festering darkness that generates the majority of the aggro, it's the snare component.  Just ask a ranger how much aggro their snare spells generate sometime, and those don't have a dot component.<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule?  Well, whatever floats your boat.<br />
<br />
The little bit of extra damage done through a DoT focus isn't going to have a noticeable effect on your aggro.  It certainly will not make Festering Darkness do 10% more aggro than it did previously.<br />
<br />
So yeah, uhm, please try a different rationale, that one doesn't fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I am could not argue one way or the other how the Festering Darkness or any other of the dots spells work wether the snare or the dot part. I can tell you for sure as I am the tank 99 pct of the time I form groups that Festering works wonders for <br />
me as well as Death Bond and Heat Blood spells. By golly I use this all of the time. This is the way I play and get aggro. The Voice of Thule... Again I can notice a difference when I use it or not. My aggro is better. Getting aggro depends on the group you have. When I have necros doing their dotting is hard as I have to chase the mobs or cast Festering Darkness more than once. I also use the Terror spells. <br />
<br />
Point being wheter this is official or not my Festering Darkness= DOT spells has made my job real good. When I want to be sure I keep my aggro I cast Death bond or H Blood spell and that mob does not move away. I do a good job and aggro keeping and the mobs do not wander much. People like to play with me as the cleric does not have to heal anyone but me. So yes... DOT spells do work for me.<br />
<br />
Maybe this will not fly with you... But it does for me. Just my playing style.<br />
<br />
Kritr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not saying it wouldn't make an SK moderately higher dps in a few situations where they dot.<br />
<br />
I'm saying that on a necro it is a -much- more useful and damaging focus. You won't see me bidding on an all/all vengeance item, regardless if it has nice stats. Same with improved healing etc<br />
<br />
It makes the most sense on a necro for a raiding guild. A minor upgrade in dps for Sk, a huge DPS bonus for necros, why is this even a discussion? If your guild uses pure DKP a warrior can win the earring. If not, it should go to a necro first, then open to probably any other class who wants it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The reason why this is a discussion was stated in my original post. First my guild does not use DKP system. We use NBG= need before greed. As stated I am the only high level SK in the guild. So there is not much help there when I need advice on issues. That is why I am in this board to see other SK my equals in lvl on their opinions. <br />
<br />
Secondly I was told, as no one has much of an idea how an SK works, that SK do not use dots. This is an error as we use dots. Better reply would have been Necros and shammies use it more effectively on raids.  Actually I was told that after the original statement, that SK do not use dots.<br />
<br />
Third... Yes true on a raiding guild like we are it makes sense that it was awarded to a shammie and if you read my afterthoughts after giving it some consideration I said yes I  would pass to other, that needs it most.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. But the point is that this will help me to improve my SK toon, at least the way I use it. <br />
<br />
Let's face  it we are sort of a forgotten class. At this point I have 586 AA, working on my Gates AA and full raid buff my HP is 7312. <br />
Some Paly's and most warrior with not even this much close to me in AA have at this time 8 k HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now then why would I not bid for an item that would benefit me?<br />
Not to say anyone else needs it but whatever will make me better would be an advantage to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's put it this way in my guild SK, jezz I am the  only one at this level, are given no chance to tank big mobs, or try to use our aggro abilites. <br />
<br />
I know, no question here, that I am an aggro animal. In my groups, mobs do not move much. When I go online  and ask  for peeps to start a  group, I have so many tells that in less than one minute have a full group. That tells you a lot!<br />
<br />
These are the comments I hear form peeps that group with me: <br />
<br />
You are so good at aggro, Sk's rock, you should tank in our raids, nice to have you in this group as I would take you any time before a warrior, your aggro is super, clerics love me as they do not have to waste mana healing every other player, they only have to heal me and therefore me as aggro holder and tank is a blessing for them, and on and on...<br />
<br />
<br />
So this is not self adulation, it means I am doing something right.<br />
<br />
So now tell me this. If aggro makes me different and better why I would not bid for an item that makes me much better?<br />
Why I would not bid on an item that would increase my pathetic stats. I have heard of elemental SK's that are 8-9k or even 10 k, but certainly I am not there. I am just trying to live throught my stinky gear. A necro will not take the hits I get and live. I need to keep getting hit and keep it this way for me to be effective. So anything that makes me better, I will bid for. Maybe if I was elemental and had 10 k HP and other &quot;UBER&quot; gear I would not be so touchy at this time. But the point is I am not there yet. As I understand there is some elemental gear that has precicely this same effect. So someone must think is valuable for us SK's. I can not comment on this as I do not have this effect but will continue to bid or will get it if possible and see how it works.<br />
Maybe the tribute system is a way to try the effect. But again the stats of MB are much better that my ridiculous present earing that gives me HP +35 and AC 5... he he ... have had this earing for over one year... if I am going to look at this from the stat point and forget the effect of MB this item still would have been an improvement to my 7312 fully raid buff situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">[</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One of the points that I was trying to make is that a damage focus for your DoTs won't greatly increase your ability to get and keep aggro, and won't increase your ability to survive getting beat on.  If it was only the damage dealt by our dots that created the aggro, then Ignite Blood would be better aggro than Festering Darkness and Clinging Darkness, and this simply is not the case.  Also, resisted spells would not draw aggro the way they do, because they aren't doing any damage.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, it's easy enough to experiment on this.  Simply get the permission of your group mates to do a little testing of what works best for aggro, and replace Festering Darkness in your spell lineup with any other DoT that you have that doesn't debuff, ie Ignite Blood or Blood of Thule, and see if you can hold aggro just as easily.  If so, then everything is well and good, but if not you might want to experiment with other spells.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the most common spells used to keep and hold aggro are Clinging/Festering Darkness for the snare, and Fear (on level 55 and up mobs) simply because mobs get really mad when you try to fear them.  I'm not saying that your way will not allow you to hold aggro in the places where you fight, because obviously it is.  What I am saying, is that through experimentation you should find that a lower mana cost spell lineup will work as well, if not better, and allow you to do more things with your mana such as nuke, AC buff, attack buff and many other things.  If your groupmates love you now, just imagine how they'll feel if you can do your job even better than before.<br />
<br />
You are, of course, free to ignore any advice contained in this thread, and I'm sure that if you do so, you will still continue to be as successful in the future as you have been in the past.  I would just prefer that somebody in your position, ie the only SK in a guild, was able to show off everything an SK has to offer to our fullest potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Okay I am not sure how it works, but I do not think this dot spells were intended to be used to create aggro. This appears to be a consequence of it. I need to clarify that is not just using the spell that gives me the aggro. I am taunting, and using terror spells too. So I do not want to give the impression that I used any of these DOT spells and I just sat there getting and keeping aggro.<br />
They are a way that I keep the aggro and all I have to do is recast any of these spells and the mobs come back to me.<br />
Again, I do not think this was the intentions of these spells. <br />
Maybe is a bug. HE HE. <br />
<br />
It is interesting to say that this was not my idea to begin with. I will always remember being in Dreadlands and having horrible aggro knowledge. Another SK told me start using DOT spells... and my golly have not stopped using them for aggro purpose. <br />
<br />
Now let me say I had a contest with a druid and we had a competition on who could steal/ keep aggro the aggro. He was dotting and then he beat me a few times. So I start to use my dots, fear, Festering Darkness... He he.... I won then. He is not able to beat me.<br />
<br />
Actually I read using lower level spells like casting disease spells, asystole, create aggro. I did tried using thethat pulling and it worked. <br />
<br />
I have already used the Death bond and heat blood spells to create aggro. I already had experimented. Have to tell you it worked. It gave me aggro.  <br />
<br />
Have used them alone and not used Festerinig Darkness and still worked. The problem is that DB and heat spells are mana drains and I only used them when I really must keep aggro. Like during my contest with the druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
I use FD all the time, this is the first spell I use and keep casting it together with the terror spells and I have no problems with aggro. <br />
<br />
When a necro is in the group and he dots man the mob goes that way. <br />
<br />
But let me add to the discussion I also use the Spear of Decay and other DD to make the mob pay attention to me. Now this is  DD spell, but hey I also use it to create aggro. Now that really will throw a few peeps off track.<br />
<br />
Now let me mention that this are mostly BOT, POV, POV mobs I am talking here. In sol ro there is tons of aggro, just me being there gets me aggro. Sol ro is the aggro capital, so not sure if this dot issue applies there. <br />
I am not talking here either of tanking for a raid type of mob as I have not done this. I am referring here to the regular mobs form tier 2 , 3. Have not been to elementals so have no idea how any of this is going to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally I want to say I do use this DOT spells as a style of playing my sk. As not much is given to us but I see other classes, like the warriors lately among other melee gps like monks lull, I need to use all the little things I can lay my hands on to improve my functionality.<br />
<br />
The Voice spells that has been put down by many as only 10 pct aggro and a piece of trash I have used it to my advantage and it really works.<br />
<br />
So every little thing I have I will use to improve my overall function as seems to me SOE has no major plans for us. <br />
<br />
Would be nice to have a lull spell , like monks got and pally's have or at least an FD that works better.  But does not seem to me this is gonna happen any time soon. We get this ridiculous pet AA. Crap try using a pet in BOT, SOL ro or any big time raid and this pell will last only one hit. So why bother with such an idiotic AA.<br />
<br />
On the other had this DOT spells if I can improve them with MB, I will do if I can. <br />
<br />
And let me say this, yes... will bid again for MB  if allowed, although does not seem likely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">By the way Just did as you suggested. Loaded Death bond, H blood spells. Did not used Festering Darkness.<br />
<br />
Still worked holding aggro. Actually there was a ranger pulling and for some reason threre was this mob in BOT that was not moving at all with anything he was using. He was the puller. He then tells me to come and pull it. I used the Death Bond Spell. Not only did he moved, he came to me and stuck with me throught out the fight. <br />
<br />
Kept doing the same all evening with similar results. <br />
<br />
So just tested my theory one more time. Yes, dot spells increase my aggro, then they make me better in my job to keep that aggro.<br />

cuz it doesnt make you &quot;much better&quot;, just &quot;slightly minutely better&quot; ? very minimal dps increase, the aggro generated by the extra damage isn't really worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
it should go to necros then shammies in a nbg/merit type situation, then probably anyone who dots and wants it.<br />
<br />
you'd be far better off with veng type items or ft for aggro and dps purposes. but whatever...interest..fading...gone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok, guess I'll take this time to extend my congratulations to Kritr for going and doing the experimentation I suggested.  It seems like you have found a way of playing that works well for you.  It is a bit different from the way that some others, myself included, play our class, but I guess that's the beauty of the Shadow Knight, there isn't just one way to play that works.<br />
<br />
As far as your situation goes with your guild, all things being equal, Paladins should not have first crack at all Shadow Knight / Paladin items.  I think that is something that you need to speak with your guild leadership about, because if they don't let you perform a raid role such as offtanking because they feel you don't have the gear to do the job, and then they go and hand that gear to somebody else, and do this frequently and consistently, then they are creating one of those circular loops we all know and love.<br />
<br />
My advice this time around is, that since you can already do the job of holding aggro perfectly well, concentrate on your abilities to do the other jobs of a Shadow Knight, such as pulling and tanking.  Let your guild leadership know that you want to perform some off-tanking or whatever, try and convince them that you need better tanking gear, and make them realize that a Shadow Knight is not a gimp Paladin, but a powerful class in its own right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We were doing the RZ raid last night in POT.<br />
Our Pally was tanking RZ and trying to get aggro. I am spammed with tells form the MT and ST to hate him. I do and he keeps flawless aggro that he could not get without the Voice, only using his Pally skills. This is the same Pally that told me that we SK's do not use dots.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Let me say this:<br />
<br />
# 1. A few months back a pick up raid was being lead by a ranger. He asked me to always, always keep Voice of Thule on the MT and Voice of Terris on the ST. I do. Good results on their aggro gain. This was new to me. First time anyone asked for a Voice type of spell to be used on a raid.<br />
 <br />
# 2. As I learned this experience I offered to our MT the Voice of Thule when he is doing his job. He says, sure. Ever since he has not stopped asking me for me to hate him. He even has a hot button with the message: hate me please. <br />
<br />
So moral of the story: little changes can make big differences depending on your playing style. I think a put down spell like Voice of Thule/ lvl 65 SK spell  that gives minimal advantage and is considered by many SK’s an insult, can be used to our advantage and make or break a playing situation whether on raid or group encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Small things can add up and used wisely. This is the point. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kritr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You had a paladin that needed Voice of Thule to keep aggro?  That is pretty sad, really.  Paladins have excellent aggro generating abilities, if they know what they are doing.  Next time that Paladin asks for Voice, tell him he's fired. ;)<br />
<br />
When I was a PM for my current guild, I offered to Voice the main tank, and he turned me down.  He kept flawless aggro the entire raid.  Maybe the rest of the guild wasn't trying hard enough or something, but he had no problems.  That makes me happy, because I don't have to keep any spell slots reserved for Voice, and can mem other useful spells instead.<br />
<br />
I, for one, do not relish the job of &quot;buff bitch.&quot;  If I had wanted that job, I would have kept playing my shaman that I started when my SK was level 16 and I was getting frustrated with the game.  Thankfully, I got over that and was able to continue playing my SK, and I'm reasonably happy with my situation at the moment.  Often I end up being the add tank, or third tank, occasionally I get to be the one calling assists.<br />
<br />
If you are happy with your role, that's great.  Play the game to have fun, and more power to you.  Just please, get somebody to buy that paladin a clue, he doesn't strike me as the sort of player I would enjoy being guilded with based off of what little I have heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The fact is the bauble will be more use to your guilld on a Necro, Shammy and probably Druid than on you.  Simply because of the focus effect. <br />
Up to 20% increase in Shammy, Necro, Druid DoT &gt; Up to %20 increase in SK dot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Me being the only lvl 65 in my guild makes it hard to really know my role. We are rapidly progressing to become elemental. All we need is RZ and the sol ro minis. Last nite by the way we finally made to RZ and I think we could have done him but the adds came out of the blue and it was a wipe. He he I did not die. <br />
<br />
I FD when I saw  it was a total loss and our clerics were wiped out.<br />
<br />
I just stayed down and then the adds just start to enter the room and stay there. I said to myself. Hell what now. So I invis. then use may gate potion and got the hell outta there.<br />
So I did not die. I think we could have killed RZ when we got to him. but the adds did us. This has been just our second attempt to this mob. I am sure he is going to hit the dust soon, we have the potential, the weapons and the force. Just need to polish on the strategy.<br />
<br />
Well... hard to say what my role is I do not know if anyone has an idea what would my role be. Really casting spells on others does not bother me at all. Any way I can help my guild is okay with me, especially the MT and ST. <br />
<br />
I am not sure I would like to tank a big mob like RZ or TZ or VZ actually with my 7312 HP at this time not sure if I would be able to do it unless we have a really super chain healing group of clerics with spot healers spamming on the heals. Would be interesting to see if I can do it, but not sure the guild leader would allow this, and at this point, just me, not interested in assuming this position.<br />
<br />
I just can tell you I did have a hard time staying alive doing the named in BOT. Now they are a brezze. Kriegers are play things to me, and they used to kill me flat. <br />
I remember doing Deep South/ named in BOT, and a Pally was tanking this named. He had two healers working on him and he barely made it.  This was in December of 2003.<br />
<br />
I have done this named in the last few weeks several times. He is just a punk. He can not kill me and all I have is one healer. So something is working for me as an SK with 7312 Hp. <br />
But again now I have a couple of new toys,,, he he, Have Blindfoe, and my 8 K HT that helps me a lot during this fights with the BOT mobs. <br />
It would be interesting to see when I am done with the bashing AA and bash stun what will happen to my tanking, fighting abilities.<br />
<br />
I really think some of the things that happen in this game are not really planned by SOE/ game developers. Some stuff that happens are applications that we find have other uses.<br />
<br />
Like on the Gate Potion I read that if you buy in the bazaar lets say for 1500 -pp a / 5 dose. When you are down to the last one go and sell it for like 800 to 700 pp. Never done this till a couple of days ago and rats... there it is... got 711 pp for a original 5 dose gate potion. So I went and got another 5 dose for only 1/2 a price since I sold my old one for a good price.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our guild is still developing and the SK being so few and me the only one at my level, makes me hard to have a perspective on what to do.<br />
<br />
By the way I can not fire the pally that was tanking. He is the raid leader and also an officer of the guild. Actually he is the big boss of our guild that has  596 players as of yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. By the way guys I give up. Let me eat the pieces of food that fall off to the ground. I will pass, I think I have no choice on this one, on the MB. <br />
<br />
Agree others Necro, Shammy, druid can use more effectively.<br />
<br />
 This discussion has been informative and a learning experience to me. <br />
<br />
If no one wants the MB maybe I could take whatever is left when all the big guys get their dreams and desires satisfied. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No offense, but your guild sucks if they distribute loot in such an arbitrary way.  Yeah, all you other people are technically right in that our dots dont' do a tremendous amount of damage....certainly not the kind of damage done by druid and necro dots.<br />
<br />
But where does this rationale end?  An SK is not the &quot;best&quot; at anything.  Our dots aren't the best.  Our nukes aren't the best.  Even though death peace is more reliable than monk FD, we are still 2nd-rate FD pullers in most situations.  We get no useful non-self buffs.  Our ability to heal group members is a joke compared to other classes.<br />
<br />
Where does it end?  When you start saying that other classes benefit more from item X, Y, or Z, where does it end?  Technically, warriors should get all the AC/HP gear FIRST.  Rogues should get all uber piercers first.  Rangers should get all bows first.  Casters should get all focus/mana/FT items first.  Pure melee should get all uber melee weapons first.<br />
<br />
Guilds that go down this road can basically rationalize knights completely out of a job.  And this is why I refuse to be in a guild that uses a loot system such as this.  My advice would be to stand up for your class.  It's not an issue of how much more another class will benefit from item X than you.  It's an issue of basic fairness.  You work your ass off just as hard as the next guy.  That should be evident by how many raid points, DKP, or whever method your guild uses to judge contributions.  Tell them to get over their arbitrary class valuations and let people earn their loot.<br />
<br />
One other thing to consider:  a DoT focus item is much better off in the hands of an SK that raids all the time than in the hands of a necro that logs on once in a blue moon.  Let them choke on that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hey Rad, thanks for your reply. Nice to hear someone sort of sees my point of view.<br />
<br />
That would be a different subject DKP or NBG. This caused an uproar in our guild and has been brought up several times. <br />
<br />
I rarely miss any raids. In over a year has missed only two raids.<br />
If there was a DKP system I can tell you I would have tons of points. I never leave till the fat lady sings, never, ever before.<br />
But is hard to take when you are passed over for whatever reason you are given. Whether an item like the MB is better for necros and others or whatever is does not feel nice when you are trying to upgrade your equipment. <br />
<br />
I have done a lot of thinking on this but I like my guild and I abide by the rules. By the way I am not  a loot whore like the previous idiotic post said about me. I usually pass down anything I have if I get an upgrade and all the time pass on items I really do not need or use. Do not take to sell in the bazaar for instance if a ornate silk drops and another can use. Usually drops for other classes I give to the guild to give to whoever needs. Actually when hunting in sol ro our gps usually keeps the ornate drops for the ones are in need or almost done with their ornate gear. <br />
Many time loot that drops in BOT or anyother place I do not even bid just give to the one in need.<br />
But the point is when loot drops and I think it would benefit me  the NBG systmem can be something to be desired. At first I was for this system. Now I am not too sure. <br />
Our guild did MM 3 days ago. Killed him. He drops a very nice range item that would be a great improvement for me. Let me say my bow that I use in the range area has no ac, and no mana and only 25 HP... Forget the name of the range item from MM but it  had like 100 of mana and Hp. I salivated and certainly did my bid. <br />
Well a bard, just a recruit till that very same day when he became a full member gets this item. It did not set well for me, a regular, faithful and dedicated player. Did I liked it, No. Can I put up with it, yes. I have too many friends is this guild and after one year here this is home. Not going to leave due to a loot issue.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Kritr<br />
<br />
I also would have let that Bard go for that item (MM's signet). You have the option of putting an Ele bow in your range slot, the Bard does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Okay then, right that is it was the signet, now it comes to me. But rats everyone can get stuff that will be great for them. Maybe I need to look at some sort of only Sk loot I am allowed to bid as all the other pure classes will be over me. Now this is not a sarcastic comment but now I read Rads reply and here we go... then any weap with mana I should then be considered first as I need tons of mana but that is not the case. Warriors are awarded this items. <br />
<br />
I just want to figure out what is it that is fair for an SK to ask as there seems to be some other class outbidding me for some reason or another. I am talking here on fairness. Maybe Sk will get their day when I get to the elementals. Will see how the loot thing goes there. Some necro outbidding me as they get more whatever. So how long will it take me to be 8 K or more....<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to start doing more ldon and forget improving my gear on raid loots... he he...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">thats why i refuse to be in a non-dkp related guild, merit sucks way too much. i was in a guild that did bidding, sometimes it was kind of nice..like if you Really want an item you can lay down a lot of points whereas with dkp if someone has more and wants to be a jerk they can get it relatively cheap..<br />
<br />
personally i think dkp just needs to be tempered with a few obvious rules; EB items go to war, ft items go to people with mana pools, BA goes to necro priority, vengeance and melee focuses go to melees first..if no one bids the item is open to all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Mak <br />
<br />
That sounds good to me and actually have talked to many of my guildies that are not happy with the loot distribution situation.<br />
The point is when considering all, us going to elementals, the friends I made in over one year in this guild, the tons of hellos and good byes I get when I log in an out, the loot system will not make me change my mind one way or another of whether I stay in my guild or not. Loot situation aside, I love my guild, love the way we do raids, love knowing all this people that had become a family to me. Last nite we did TT in less than 30 min,, he he. Went to BOT to mess around, did 5 named with guild members and we gave loot among ourselves or gave it to guild for someone who needs more. That is the kind of people they are. We are a powerful bunch, a force to be dealt with. <br />
<br />
Again loot issues are just not that important as such, mostly what I refer is to playing styles and fairness, mostly in regard to SK's and what would benefit us.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if some sort of DKP system or mix DKP/ NBG is in place. I think if this argument of assigning certain drops to certain classes and not others is taking the possibility and excitement of knowing what will such an item do in the hands of the so called, class that would not benefit the most from this item, us SK's passed most of the time. <br />
<br />
As someone said before, what good would the MB do in the hands of a necro that plays once in the blue moon vs someone like me that plays every day and does not miss any raids?<br />
<br />
PS... Have been working on may Gates AA and just noticed last night that there is an AA that will increase our DOT capabilities. <br />
At the present I am finished with Weapon affinity and it has really made a difference in my weap proc. Blindfoe is much better now that I can just keep sucking life during fight.<br />
<br />
Then I am working on my bashing abilities and I have my improved bashing up to 150 / bash.. wow......much better from the crit of 20... wow.... this is an improvent indeed and after that will work on my stun bash... then will go into the DOT/ AA  and I think at that time this discussion will become even more interesting he, he. <br />
<br />
This are frontiers to be explored. Not sure if anything is written in stone and I am not sure if even SOE knows what they are doing at this time. <br />

<br />
Critr.  you have some studying to do.  Read the boards here and see how other SK do their job.<br />
<br />
I do use BoH, it's a nice extra 26 dps, and does not hurt.   That's all for dots.<br />
<br />
By the way, I think there still is a limit on the actual number of dots on a mob.  Think about this :)<br />
<br />
And, I advise you to leave your guild.  Your loot system is unfair the the extreme (although the dot focus items should rather go to necros).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kritr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">HA HA HA HA,,,<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I am here in the boards, just for the reason I want to know how others do it. By no means I say I know it all or I would not be here.<br />
Errr.... but I have developed my style, like it and will change what I need to change, not to say anyone has to do as I do. Just works for me in the places I play. The SK being not good at anything great, have to do strech the bit we get and use it very astutely to make a difference. When you do not have like 8-9 k and nukes like others, then the little you get can become very significant.<br />
<br />
The loot system is not the best but I really do not care about loot. The point of this discussion was on fairness regarding who should get what as we are not good at anything we then will not get anything when a pure race bids against us. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice to leave my guild, but no.. will not leave due to a loot issue. My happy times with the people I have met and played makes up for all these loot issues.<br />
