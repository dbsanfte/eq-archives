<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Puller lagged and trained the grp w/ all the pallies, they despawned before we could re-engage.  I cannot initiate anything with Gilina now and Sienna will not take the sheathed sword back... any ideas, or has anyone else experienced a similar problem after failing the part and what has to be done?<br />
Any help is appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The skelly will respawn in like 30 mins no worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">whew, thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No problem and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe i did fail well took me 2 3 hours to finish this part.. mainly because i didnt want to bug others so i duo my sk+clr for them .. kinda fun like most the epic 1.5 are</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Duoed this part also, it took 2 tries because I couldn't get 3 dead before it became daytime again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How easily was this duoable? I can bring a boxed 65 cleric and 65 warrior (both pre-ep gear) in addition to myself. I intend to try it anyway, but if anyone has thoughts, I'd appreciate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pet pulling trivializes this encounter.  YOU should have been the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, I failed it... duoed it with a Shaman who went afk after the first one and ran out of time.  Killed 2 got 2 bloods but then took too long and they started despawning and stopped dropping blood.  So after bitching at the Shaman for 20 min I just spawned them again and got blood #3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I duo'd with a rogue, pet pulling makes this trivial.  With the rogue dps they went down fast.  Didn't need a healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I pet pulled and we got 4. Had a group so it was no big deal, except that I said, &quot;No worries, I'll pet pull singles!&quot; Then got 4 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did that happen with Invoke Death Chania?  Or something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sazzabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I soloed this part no problem. The 2 frog pallys are snareable. Easy enough to split them off with FD or zoning. I was able to kite one around with dots/pet and tap back hps in between summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Invoke Death, dunno why I got 4.Made me look bad after bragging I'd get a single :( As for soloing them... Not for the average SK. Sazz is up there, gearwise and skillwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pulled two and didn't get shit.. pulled a third and got a blood.. pulled a 4th and didn't get anything.. then they despawned since our DPS was ass... waited for the skel to respawn.. killed 3 and didn't get shit.. pulled a 4th and got another blood.. then they despawned.  Gonna get my 3rd blood tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Myth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Use Invoke Death and wait for them to sit in their circle prior to pulling, this makes the encounter more trivial then it already is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">could a mage pet pull these successfully? or does it need to be a sk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I see no reason why a mage or any other pet casting class could not do the pulling.<br />
<br />
That said, other pets do more damage than ours so its a bigger sacrifice for them to use a lower level pet then it is for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">worked... got the drops.. and able to trigger the Final Fight :)... hehe i tested it out already w/ HS :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill trigger him on friday and finish this quest :) Archfiend here i come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Probably just too close to them on the failed pet pull.  It happens sometimes.</div></div><hr />
