<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this isn't a serious one, but a 'what if' or 'dream on' one instead, but going to 'defend it' as if it were! :D <br />
<br />
OK, we got low DPS right? Yeah, we can HT crit for 8k+...at 65 with AAs! That seems a lil broken to me, heeh, so, since we are considered low DPS tanks on the same boat with stinkin' Pally's by most non-SK toons, what would it hurt to give us DECAPITATE!<br />
<br />
What could be more SK than that? Be just like a rogue assasinate, expect we wouldn't have to be behind the mob...it just has to have a decernable head! :D<br />
<br />
AND, rogues alreayd do major DPS, and yet get this, so why not throw in the ultimate SK swing! Just think of the shock or horror on the faces of newbies, cruising their plush starting city, say Kaladim, only to come across a decapitated guard! Ahhhh....now that's being an SK! ;)<br />
<br />
What ya'll think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you deserve to be shot, drowned, poisoned, and thrown off a cliff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keyan has been hit for 32000!<br />
Keyan has been decapitated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That would be a decent ability for the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I guess they could fight for it, that is if they would not have noticed already how the original Assassinate skill is so freaking pointless in the current state of the game.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
1- This ability is worthless. Killing greens in one shot? Big whoopinghoo. To impress newbies? Nice priority there.<br />
2- Would be more in line for the warrior class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its called Finishing Blow, and it sucks.<br />
<br />
And no, it wouldnt make sense to allow you to &quot;decapitate&quot; a mob before its at 10% and fleeing - 10% and fleeing = mortally wounded and trying to run for its life, therefore you finish it with one well placed strike.<br />
<br />
As for killing greens in 1 hit, rangers already have it, its called Head-Shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd rather see trolls/ogres (maybe iksars) get some kinda of munch skill where they forfait the loot on the corpse and &quot;eat&quot; it to regain 10% HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My erudite needs a forehead slam, so he doesn't need a shield to bash. :p <br />
<br />
Though it would be a cool ability for decapitate. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL - love the forehead deal.<br />
Warrior class? Please.../ponder at wtf you're thinking in that statement, versus an SK executing a 1 shot kill.<br />
Rangers get it? Well then now this is a MUST! I HATE rangers! ;)<br />
And no, its not called finishing blow, as that is at 10% HP....this can happen at 100%.<br />
And for the pointless bit, I play with a couple 61 rogues...they can and do assisinate some lbs, and they can farm plat VERY nicely with this skill, as well as 'shove off' bothersome mobs while traveling. Think about hitting Rathe to farm plat...wizzies &amp; rogues would be pissed! LOL And lets face it, as far as priorities for suggestions etc, everyone knows this is NOT the palce to make a serious suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With assasinate and disintegrate, there is no corpse. So there is no rogue that can farm plat using it unless they Pickpocket it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TheDarkness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">uhhh...I was grouped with a rogue 2 days ago, doing gaurds in Kaladim, then Dulak harbor boats...assasinated quite often, both mid fight, and on first hit...made some nice plat. The only things that popped off the bat was the quest / vendor NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Most rangers dont even put points into it... same would go for any class if this ability did exist...<br />
<br />
The only use I've really seen for Head-Shot is to kill the little green con mobs that pop after you kill some mobs in PoEarth / PoAir.  Other than that I doubt people hang around greens enough to care...</div></div><hr />

<br />
at 62, it takes me about 25 seconds to kill a giant., so you can tell from that , how worthless the skill would be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not very likely, as they think we are already overpowered since we can melee and spell cast besides we already have one worthless skill its called HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SK's are low dps only if your a lvl 45 gimp swinging a MoSS.  Otherwise, our dps is is decent.</div></div><hr />

Hey keyan, been watching Ghostbusters?  hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urgokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually a couple rangers I know are going to buy this after they buy all their bow aa's and such so they can farm tradeskill loot faster.  Makes tradeskill farming really easy if you have a chance to kill in one shot and your not using mana or anything to do it.  Just run around some place like EK or Stonebrunt and kill everything in sight.</div></div><hr />
