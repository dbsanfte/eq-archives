<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is to announce that I have finally achieved Reaver status.  :D<br />
<br />
Only took me almost 3 years and some obscene number of hours played.  I know this may seem like an insignificant milestone to many of the other old school shadow knights out there, but I am a true casual player who puts in maybe an hour or so a day and likes to wander and quest far more than is good for levelling quickly....<br />
<br />
(Gonna have to finish my new signature file to go with the new boards....been working on one for a while and haven't gotten it finished)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Byttorr Ebonknight</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations. Although many hardcore players have long since passed that milestone and forgotten it, it is still a valid accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Enjoy being a Reaver, because when you become a Revenant, you'll start getting tells asking if you have any old robes, or if you do spell research...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajak</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Much congrats Nikumu !<br />
<br />

<br />
Beware a 54. 6 months here and countin.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the words of encouragement Rajak....<br />
<br />
My real problem is that I hate the xp grind, I love exploring and such.  About the only thing I hate more than xp grind is faction work.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravager</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little shy of 51st myself after 2 years of play. I have to agree that the xp grind is just not fun. I much enjoy just trying to see it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought I finally found a group of like minded folks!  I've been playing for about 2 1/2 years and I'm just one yellow into 53 (with run3 though).  Just too much damn fun to grab little jobabner and go poking around in places I just shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Ahh well, comin on Jobababaner I think I see a cave over there I haven't seen before ...... <br />
<br />
Why does it smell like dragon poop in here ....</div></div><hr />
