<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Markor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the best place to solo for a 65 sk with 80aa and ok gear? I have about 5k hp, 1290 ac, and 1120 atk. My magelo profile can be seen below. I am ele, sro, and bot flagged. <br />
<br />
 Also, sometimes I will 2 box my 58 chanter but most the time I will be soloing. Does anyone have any good spots to suggest with and without the chanter?<br />
<br />
 Thanks.  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to add, what weapon should I use when soloing? More weapons can be seen by clicking on rallic pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure there are a lot of better zones/mobs for soloing but I know many people keep these a secret</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reever Darksul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are places in Veksar and Acrylia caverns ya can solo for decent aaxp. just have to find them:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soloing for aa when you have elemental flags is really innefficient, but it can be a fact of life if you play odd hours.<br />
<br />
Fire is the best solo aa exp for aggro kiting, and you can also add a duo partner there to speed things up. Mana pool and mana regen are essential, as is mana efficiency-- the tribute system makes focus effects very easy to access, so FT/Mana Pres 4/Burning Affliction 4/Additional Mana Pool/ID4 might be a good bunch to consider. BA 4 tribute buff was broken at first according to guild necros/druids...might have been fixed by now. Also, equip your best weapon set for mana/int-- that is the primary concern for aggro kiting...if you end up meleeing anything, you've probably fucked up...<br />
<br />
Mage summoned haste mask/stat belts/weapons for your pet make a huge difference in his dps, especially over time...so does our pet buff. Make sure his taunt is off too. To state more of the obvious, Kei or better is a good call (manapool/int over Pact), along whatever other buffs you can get -- Pot9 being among the most usefull.<br />
<br />
PoF zoneline area is a good spot to test yourself. If you feel like it's too easy, then you can try the picnic table area by the Fennin script setup spot-- 6 solo kills per aa, but ofter camped and very very very fucking long solo kites. Conversely, there is a decent spot in Tactics up ontop of the pit on the left side, and finally there is also the HoH graveyard area.</div></div><hr />
