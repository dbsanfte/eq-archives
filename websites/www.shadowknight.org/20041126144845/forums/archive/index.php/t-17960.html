         <br />
                I went to CS and well......I died. It was quite liberating actaully.I have made a new enemy now and I will make sure that every last one of them feels my blade.Why do we need claw faction anyway? I feel that my home is POK or nexus now,and I dont step on their toes there(you need a safe house to crash at)<br />
Now I have decided that Im going to victimize every dragon I see in the game.I do not descriminate anymore while in game.I hate every living thing eqaully and the dead even more!I feel that being an SK is about me now,Just ME!!Yea Ill quest it for ya....then Ill come back and kill you for sending me on some retarded run all over norrath.Why does anyone need claw faction is what I was getting to.... After all Ive killed sooo many giants that Im ally with thurgadin and now I found that I gain faction by killing those vile wyverns in CS.Lookout Skyshrine!!! here I come.<br />
Thank you for letting me vent.Im not sick,Im just not well in my mind.Just someone answer my claw question and am I right in killing them&gt;???<br />

Personally, I felt very much the SK when I was hunting wyverns there.  I have max CoV faction and could walk right up to them and hang out - then start whacking them when they least expect it :b</div></div><hr />
