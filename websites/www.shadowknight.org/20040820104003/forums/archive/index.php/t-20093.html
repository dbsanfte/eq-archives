If you think your quest is really good please add a link to the page that describes the quest and let us know which race it is especially good for and which level would benefit most.<br />

For the OT gate hammer, which if you get Weapon Affinity, should help it proc faster...in theory, anyway.  But get your faction up to amiable first by doing the &quot;Protect the shipyard&quot; quest repeatedly<br />

<br />
Alternately, click on my magelo, click on my gear, search for it in allakhazam's, and find out which quest it's from. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't think of any quests that you absolutely should do, to be honest. <br />
<br />
Well none that aren't progression quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greetings Naubi. In terms of progression quests I can only think of 3 off the top of my head. The first would be the coldain ring quest. This is a fun quest and most people do up to the 8th ring cause it gives you a nice clicky. A 8 point DS that stacks with our banshee aura and cloak spell line. If your guild is strong you can even get to the 10th ring. The stats are decent and you get a 10 ds, 10 regen and 10 attack buff. Plus there are a few decent rewards still from the war like the faceguard of bentos the hero and the true prize, crown of narandi.<br />
<br />
Another progression quest is the shawls. If you are a tradeskill freak it's perfect. The 8th shawl has FT3 and a focus effect that makes your buffs last 20 percent longer. Not the best effect for sks but still not bad also. The stats are ok too but I feel that FT3 makes up for the low ac on the shawl.  <br />
<br />
A third is the Greenmist quest. It's progression cause you have to do 7 khukri quests before you can even forge Greenmist. Greenmist is still not a bad weapon either by today's standards. Ranks up there as probably in the top 10 of the one handers.<br />
The epic is a fun quest overall except for the decrepit hide and possibly soul leech. If you can stand testing your luck and possibly spending lots of time in hate or fear then IC is for you.<br />
<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder is a good quest though I will say this, if you can stand the hate part of our epic, then by all means Stormfeather should be cake to camp. Just watch out for Ksers. The patch still has decent stats despite the effect (useless when you got a shaman/chanter/beastlord hasting).<br />
<br />
Finally the Wood Elf Crown is a neat quest to do when you are bored. It's funny to pretend to be a wanna-be ranger or check out your guy in Wood Elf form. The factioning will take what seems like forever but it pays off. Reet crown is not a problem and if you are daring and brave you could try soloing the reets for the crown. I recommend buying the velium mastodon fur cloak cause ice burrowers (61 mobs) in WW are tough mobs and are one of few phs for mastodons. The fur itself is an uncommon drop.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you will enjoy these quests naubi. I have done all of them except for 9th and 10th ring and the shawl quest (not a tradeskill freak). Currently working on the epic and I just need the hide. Then the rest will be cake.<br />
<br />
However, I am semi-retired from EQ so I may not finish the epic. It all depends on when I feel like playing again and also if I come back and my friend has the hide available for MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Best quests? it really depends on your progression in game really.<br />
<br />
Spirit wraked cords  (the 2nd part of the quest also give you a nice ring)<br />
Eye patch of plunder<br />
Crown of deceit<br />
Secret of the Planes (you will have to buy a MQ from an elemental drop which wasnt too bad.  I got my hopestone for 15k. but most of the hard stuff is teir 1 named and actually catching thier spawn)<br />
Coldain ring<br />
Coldain Shawl <br />
Draconic Paldrons<br />
Str of elements<br />
Epic (not a must do, but damn sweet looking weapon)<br />
Bracer of benevolence<br />
PoP gate neck<br />
Worker sledge (OT hammer)<br />
Loyalist shield<br />
Green mist<br />
Emp key (nice ring, you need a group for most parts, and Id recomend a raid for the 3rd floor piece.  Its in SSra temple)<br />
<br />
These are a few off the top of my head, search for them on alla =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I forgot about eyepatch of plunder... that's one I would do for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i did eyepatch of plunder, sf was the worst camp of my life....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Enrikk Xei'Maxximus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Though I did not post the question, the replies have been cool, so thanks.<br />
<br />
I normally hate quests, I think they take away from the fun of basic group slaying. But, I did have some advice about both the eyepatch of plunder and the crown of deceit.<br />
<br />
The eyepatch is an easy quest until it comes to Stormfeather. This part of the quest is silly, imho. Yet, I 2 box a druid and found the easiest way to 'camp' SF is not to. Every day when I log in I port directly there and run past both Lodi and SF. <br />
<br />
I admit the first time I sat, and sat, and sat, and slept and sat some more, but since that first camp I have been able to get 4 other SF drops without camping. Keep your druids happy, and busy.<br />
<br />
The crown of deceit is a cool quest, for the most part. I think Seb is the key. Kill Seb from the moment you can begin it, and then the faction part of the quest isn't a problem. The only hitch is the part that makes you camp WW. Nice zone, lotsa fun, but rare drops made this agonizing. Then, I learned that the velium hounds seem to spawn in greater numbers than the Mastodon. So, I killed the hounds, looted their fur, and traded it for mastodon fur. After 2 failed combines, got lucky, and now I can fool the Woodelf ladies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nayrien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're looking for a Wood Elf Illusion item, and you have GoD, there'sa new quest you can do that starts in the Abysmal Sea, and from what Ive seen of it, its a lot shorter than The Crown of Deceit quest, you just need good faction in Jaggedpine...which isn't that hard, just go kill in Blackburrow for a littel bit. I found the quest on eqmaps.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bolas &quot; You fat chunk of puke &quot; you are from AB arnt ya.<br />
 Pez has your name <br />
<br />
 You arnt even in a Tier 2 guild are yee ? :D <br />
<br />
<br />
 Anyway, my list. <br />
<br />
 OT hammer ( MUST do )<br />
 Greenmist  ( Long, Boring, PoP 1hs are better BUT it does have Shis Bonus. BUT what I hear is Corrupted Emp weapons give a +20 ?! ) I done it just for the commitment and its better than our EPIC.<br />
  Gate Neclace ( Why waste your time. OT hammer is just fine for bad situations, that HS and FD dont cover. You can make potions if REALLY need be that are more that half the time. ) PoP neclaces laugh at these things regarding stats. Why bother ? want to waste a slot.<br />
<br />
 I have the parts for the Eyepatch but I cant be bothered. ( dont want to waste a Face Slot. I have 36% already and when I raids I am hasted to my Max Haste %. only usful for soloing but that isnt effiecient in PoP. Grouping is far better for AA xp.<br />
<br />
As for Keying.   VT and EP are good. Basically :)<br />
<br />
<br />
But everything is up to the Individual AND thier guild lvl !!<br />
<br />
 P.S Look me up AB man. We are short of AB folks here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>juzam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fun quests if done since i like to solo and see just what all i can do on my own..<br />
<br />
Eyepatch for sure if you are a soloer. will end up being a bag item but wth,<br />
<br />
Greenmist is alright, i have heavy bludgener atm and it has far better stats and tends to proc more but GM is still fun to do if you can manage the iksar faction work.<br />
<br />
Epic, been doing this quest for close to 2 years now, am up to the point of Killing the mummy of G in the hole. second to last fight. Just havent decided if i want to solo that yet or not, will prolly take a cleric and rog friends with me in the next few days to finish this.<br />
<br />
If your elemental flagged i say go for the 3rd gate neck far better stats then the OT hammer ( and less faction work to do.)<br />
<br />
eithreal bladed Naginata. Quest starts in SS. and have to have max CoV faction for the boss dragons there to even talk to you.. long some TS involved (smithing) and results in a cool looking weap.. simaler to the war marshels bladed staff.<br />
<br />
Silver Charm of Tranquility is a fun quest, Fits either wrist or neck, 35 ac, 9str 10 sta, 100 hp / mana, and fun as hell to llnk in PoTrang!!!  Quest starts in west wing of ToV. once again must have max CoV faction to do this,<br />
<br />
Shawl quest is fun to do. up to #7 personally, just need a grp to do the walk with me and its done. great starter to get involved in Tradeskills. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel is a fun one, great result too. imo one of the finer earrings in the game, need to be elemental flagged and have all Tradeskills 220+ im currently doing the tailoring part now, the hardest part of the quest,<br />
<br />
If you finish each of these, then ill post more that i have done and am working on. but this is a good starter quest list for ya,!!!<br />
Have fun and enjoy<br />

Spirit Wracked Cord isnt worh it imo but the 2nd ring is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The gate hammer is easy to get, unlimited use, no reagent, no flags. Basically anywhere a proc is possible, either on mobs or duelling, the hammer is better. The neck requires elemental access and snagging a bunch of drops to get the unlimited version, which would be the only one practical for continual use, but still requires a ~100pp reagent. Really, you are best off just getting the OT hammer and carrying a gate potion or Thurg potion as a rarely needed backup. I have done so and have needed to use the Thurg potion maybe 4 times in 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spirit Wracked Cord isnt worh it imo but the 2nd ring is nice.<br />
<br />
I beg to differ.  The Spirit Wracked Cord is a great item.  I wear it in my wrist and my Shaman wears it on his Shoulders.  It has 100 HP which is damn good for a wrist, shoulder, or even arms.  AC is a little lower than what you might prefer but for someone who isn't in a raiding guild or is unable to attend a lot of raids, it's a good time investment.  I've had mine for about a year now.  I miss a lot of raids so it is a great item to have still, and its ALL/ALL.  Something nice you can work on whenever you have the free time to play.  I keep the rings bagged for when I'm soloing, 2-boxing, get into groups with no Druids or Mages, or lack a slower in the group.  But I still wear the Cords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kilkulan Darkwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would say the most usefull quest would be... Loyalist Shield .. which can carry you as your backslot right through VT into time... OR OT hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if you have descent velious / luclin era gear you can prolly farm the halls of testing quests with one group of friends pretty easy.<br />
<br />
the silver charm of tranquility and the silver bracer of speed are two VERY good items, and will last you all the way to the Elemental planes or beyond if you choose.<br />
<br />
<br />
it will require some tedious CoV faction work, but the rewards are oh so worth it.</div></div><hr />
