<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I know the &quot;The Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood is in possession of Dread, Fright, or Terror in the Plane of Fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
&quot;The Blade of Abrogation is at times carried by monsters in the Plane of Sky.&quot;<br />
<br />
My question is how hard are each of these to get?  <br />
<br />
I have always heard that the Blade of Abrogation is easy to get.  The only problem on the Karana server, is that the Plane of Sky is on rotation but easy to get on.  <br />
<br />
Now it drops off the first island and other islands?  Whats the drop rate?  What mobs drop it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the Soul Leech, I know its not as hard as the old days when only Cazic dropped it.  How often do the mini's in Fear drop them?  Whats their respawn rate?  How many drop per raid? etc.<br />
<br />
I feel that I am close, yet not really close to finishing this epic!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It really is any mob in PoA.  Any island.  The trick some folks like to use is to camp a 46+ alt on the first island.  You can see the graphic if the fairy princess chick has one.  But honestly, going on a guild raid to any significant depth of the zone will almost guarantee you at least one drop.<br />
<br />
Golem repop is 3 days, iirc.  If I had to put a number on it, I'd say maybe 10-20% drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i got my soul leech after like 2 or 3 golem kills...but ppl get different drop rates</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saibot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At what lvl can the first isle be solo'd?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Problem is all your buffs are stripped when you port up to the 1st isle in Sky.<br />
<br />
At 62 and a few AA I was able to 2box the princess np with a cleric.<br />
<br />
I just stayed there and camped back in every 4 hrs and finally she had the blade about the 30th kill or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since Sky and Fear are on rotation on Karana, it can be a major PitA to get them unless you are a member of a guild that is on the rotation, and still raids there.  Your only other option is to take Sky out of Rotation if you have a small group of friends.  You will run the risk of giving yourself a bad rep though.<br />
<br />
Easiest way is to talk to your guild officers and convince (bribe) them to schedule a Sky raid to farm epic pieces for varioous classes.  You can farm Spiroc Lord all day and Night.  We killed him about 10 times, and he has the blade twice.<br />
<br />
As far as fear, most guilds still raid fear regularly on Karana, so taking it out of rotation is generally a bad idea.  (Isn't it always?)  Rotations can be a good thing, or a bad thing.  Just need to have patience with it, and it will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or you can ask to go along with them.  At least 5 blades will rot per clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep I am on the Karana too.  The rotations are a pain.  I really dont see why Sky is on a rotation.  It should be FFA like Hate is on the Karana.<br />
<br />
Fear, I dont know about.  The bad thing about rotations is that it can take your guild two months to get Fear on a good date.  Then if the golems are not up, your screwed.   Two more month wait.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, I will keep trying.  LOL.  Its funny that 6 days after i get my hide they up the drop rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">dunno about 5 blades rotting per clearing.  when i got mine it was the only one that dropped the whole time.  Was my first time trying to get the blade and was the last time i was ever there except when i returned to simply turn in the quest pieces for the SK haste belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Where did you get the globe for the quest belt?  What island if you looted it?  I have been looking for the globe, its the last piece i need for my quest belt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">went on a raid in fear a year or so ago, killed all three golems and got one, was a miracle.. stilll have the blade from sky to get and hear it is easy, does anyone know if its random or just off the boss mobs because i have heard both now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We had at least 4 drop on pegasus Island...I think that's island 5. Seems to be more common the higher up you go. All I need is the soul leech now. 3 golums and no leech yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i finally got my hide today and the last piece i need is the blade from air, also went there today and me and my monk friend got to the 4th isle, where the named death touches. ouchies, but no blade dropped therefor me being in the pita :P<br />
 would like to know the repop time on plane of sky mobs if anyone know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the blade is very easy to get, get to the 5th isle with the unicorns with a group we got 2 in 20 minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BucMan55</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did island 1 solo on my 65 monk.  Yes monky is well geared and AAed.(relatively speaking)  Thunder Spirit Princess was not as tough as advertised.....<br />
<br />
Remember though SKs have several things going for them that monks don't.  Several DoTs, more raw HP, better damage shield(mine was only 8), lifetaps, insta 8k HT(with AA).   Oh yeah, better AC and no mitigation penalty.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sluggas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can't remember correctly because i havn't played eq for a month or so, and you might want to look this one up on allakhazam to find out but if you can get a group to the 5th island with the pegas mobs it shouldnot take more then 30 minutes. and all you have to do is kill the regular mobs, dont kill the named cause he death touches,. and the regular mobs up there also once killed pop 2 agro mobs so make sure you have a good 2 melee tank type classes there to pick up agro real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kynan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The quest for our epic..<br />
<br />
Lets see I went through almost 160 drakes before I got a hide.<br />
<br />
Cleared Sky close to 20 times no BoA<br />
<br />
Have gone through maybe 90 Golems and no Soul Leech. DAMN YOU SOE...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone done the Hole part Soloe lately? Or 2 boxing it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Medcor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">65 Cleric, 65 Necro and myself 65 SK did Kyrenna with the FD pull trick, easy as cake, group of 5 of us did the Mummy turn in, nothing special about the group some middle 50's people and myself. He was ok also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zachnafein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got lucking on the BoA.  I zoned up to PoSky and one of the little fairies was wielding it.  So basically only took about 1 min to get it.  PoHate kinda sucks to solo the ashenbone drakes since half the mobs are undead and see thru invis and it's not really time/mana efficent to just kill everything.  I tried clearing just the entrance area to hopefully spawn ashenbone's near the zone in with no luck.  I've soloed about 15 of them and all I got so far are 2 blue diamonds.</div></div><hr />
