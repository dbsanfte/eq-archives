<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaediil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, not much to really add, but you ask about leg armor then post info about gaunts?  Gaunts go on hands not legs.  Greaves go on legs......<br />
<br />
Pardon my ignorance, but FSP = Fine Plate?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the legs for those quests are:<br />

 <br />
Another very easy quest you can work on is in Feerrott and would get you going toward your epic should you choose to do it is the Darkforge Armor.  Legs:<br />
<br />
Darkforge Greaves   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +13 Sta: +9 Magic Resist: +3 <br />
 <br />
Although for an ogre perhaps these are a better item for you since they add int and on my server I think go for only a few hundred plat.  I know they are not quested but....:<br />
<br />
Sentient Greaves   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +12 Int: +9 Magic Resist: +3  <br />
 <br />
I believe I wore the Sentient until late 40's as I recall.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did a few of the Darkened Knight's quests after I finished my Darkforge.  Trust me, they're not worth the trouble.  The mobs that drop what you need are rare, and unless you can find the items in bazaar or on a vendor, you'll have some serious issues with getting everything for a single piece.<br />
<br />
Each Darkened Knight's piece requires at least 3 items, the Greaves and BP require 4 each.  <br />
<br />
I'd say go do the Darkforge Greaves, if you need/want to quest the items.  No faction issues with the turn in mobs (unlike the katta mobs that you'll have to deal with if you try the Darkened Knight's set) and much easier to gather the components.  Otherwise, look into buying some Acrylia plate or Engraved Royal Velium.  Decent stats, and not nearly the PITA that the quested armors are for lesser items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All I can say is you're going to look silly with fingers sticking off your knees when you do the quest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>evilfat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe spot the mistake game lol 'FUN' <br />
<br />
Thanks lots for the info people :)<br />
<br />
i think i will do the forget about the twlight sea quests based on the info given :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bruiser Bigins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if I were you I would just level up to lvl 45-46 and ask some guild if you can join fear raids...umbral armor is pretty nice and usually it rots, even back in the days when it was top notch gear it used to rot a lot since there were never too many shadowknights around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>evilfat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks lots i have just been reading up on this armour found in POF and it sounds fantastic :)<br />
 sure i will find some kind people willing to let me have it instead of it rotting :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoG stuff isn't too bad either.  Look there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sepcieulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wore a mix of Sentient, Crusty, rygor, and umbral (from PoF) at mid 40's to early 50's. Senti, rygor, and Crusty are pretty cheep on my server. Decent ac and stats for those lvls. <br />
<br />
Umbral is great once you can get into PoF at 46. I wore the greeves and Vambs up untill recently when I got my SS vambs and upgraded my greeves. <br />
<br />
The Nocti stuff from PoG looks great for those lvls also(better than umbral in my opinion) ... but alas I was never able to make a guild PoG raid so I missed that boat.<br />
<br />
As far as the Darkforge stuff goes nice stuff for the lvl intended. Takes a while to get the drops you need but you may be able to get some decen't exp there for your lvl (not sure ... been a while).<br />
<br />
My suggestion,<br />
<br />
If you like camping spots and questing: Do Darkforge, might make some plat and exp in the process. <br />

I've seen all of the above sell from 25-100pp(all depends on how quickly someone wants to get rid of somthing). Go to the bazaar everyday and spend a few min's useing the /bazaar command  looking over the leg choices for your race/class/price range. See what the market is bearing on legs your interested in. Don't spend to much and don't fret to much about the decision. You will prolly be upgradeing in a number of lvls anyway then you get to sell back what you bought..<br />
<br />
***edit****<br />
<br />
BTW ... may be a bit off topic but felt it noteworthy.<br />
Went with my guild to the new PoH sunday night (6/8/03). A umbral plate bracer droped off of an ashbone drake. This may be common but I had never seen the umbral stuff drop in PoH before. Was the only umbral piece that droped in about 5 hours of mass killing.</div></div><hr />
