But about a month ago my guild killed Lord Yel and he dropped 3 (yes count them THREE) Soul Defilers. Seeing that no one had any main characters that were Shadowknights at the raid, it was given to alt (that is what I am).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velourea</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">soul defiler is good for regular use vs the greenmist. the ratio is much better against non-shissar and the proc is either great or tolerable (makes you a skelly but takes away infravision). the proc on the greenmist (lifetap dot i believe), while nice, isnt going to make up for the ratio vs the soul defiler as far as raw damage is concerned. however, it might be good for tanking (which is the main benefit of one-handers) so its your call really. <br />
<br />
for soloing id rather use a big damage two-hander since youre not going to be hit much anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasiir</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing the ratio on the SD may more than make up for the proc on greenmist, although it is hard to judge since Greenmist is a Tap(debuff/buff)/LoT (Taps 20str 9ac 120hp over time at 15hp per tick), and I notice the difference in mob attacks on me after I have procced on them (they seem to hit less, do less damage, etc), but the only way to really tell as best as could be told would be to try each of them and log it. Greenmist might be better soloing, while the other might do more total damage, at least that is what I'd guess.<br />
<br />
Greenmist is an amazing weapon and a really fun quest (for the most part), so I'd definitely still get Greenmist, no matter my main weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groobash</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uhhh...your main is a nicely equipped monk in a guild who can kill Yeli, and you dunno which of these two weapons is better when? LMAO <br />
<br />
Whatever...thanks for the wank post to inform us all that your twink has these two swords tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranaz Asmogian</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sorry if I offended you Groobash. All my posts here have been civil and information I have giving has been to the best of my knowledge.<br />
<br />
For a simple matter... my main is a monk. I know monk things... I know what items are best for monks. Some weapons even though they have a higher damage/delay might serve better depending on the monks job.<br />
<br />
I am just learning mana/ac and damage delay, taunting and spells. That is why I am asking. If I geared my SK like my monk, I would have a guy with massive sta, low int, and ac/hp. That is why I am asking the shadowknights here.<br />
<br />
Look at the wording of my posts here. Never have I said &quot;woohoo I am ulber and you are not&quot;.<br />
<br />
And if you even looked at the Greenmist quest, one must do most of it, solo or in a small group. And I do not know how your guild works, but my guild with not waste its time and resources on someone's alt. I got my book and shard for doing Corpse Retrievals (I am ally to Chardok as is most of my guild).<br />
<br />
Again I am sorry if you see this as a &quot;wank&quot; post.</div></div><hr />

You should gear your SK like your monk. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranaz Asmogian</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about mana?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When faced with the same choice I went with greenmist and swapped SD in when I needed mana cause I was proud to have done the greenmist quest and the SD was something I just happened to pick up by being in the right place at the right time thus not much to be proud of *shrug* I've been known to be kinda strange tho :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vecktor</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wouldn't use gm on raid situations, unless your a lvl 60 sk and are the main tank... i watched a iksar with gm in tov, proc, aggro, dead... guild won't be happy either hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neq</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, ya gotta be able to handle your aggro with that puppy on raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranaz Asmogian</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you... these are the answers I am lookign for..<br />
<br />
Normally as a monk, I am the puller in ToV..and I normally use Feign Death to keep my aggro in check when I am in combat there..<br />
<br />
I am looking for a 2hander that will help me on Raid Situations (once I am high enough to participate on more of my guilds high level encounters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sleestok</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Ranaz Asmogian <br />
What about mana? <br />
<br />
Most SKs will agree that INT is insignificant compared with HP/AC, damage output, and resists.<br />
<br />
I only have 110ish INT, and I hardly ever go below 50 mana while soloing unless I chain pull.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Koadic's, I hardly go below FM on raid. :)<br />
<br />
But to answer the initial question--Soul Defiler will definitely outdamage Greenmist in every zone except Ssra, and it may very well outdamage it there too... at high levels, the primary STR bonus is enough where the difference between a 22 and 19 delay weapon is VERY significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelael Sang'Noir</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only reason to use GM over SD is because you did the quest, and you probably want people to be aware of it.  SD is a far superior weapon, theres really no contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranaz Asmogian</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I found my answer.<br />
<br />
I really forgot why I created my Shadowknight. I created him to have fun.<br />
<br />
And as I stated before I brought Ranaz out of Retirement to do the Greenmist quest. It is also the reason why I use more &quot;Stylist&quot; weapons over those that are much better. I only use Naginata's as my 2handers.<br />
<br />
I will use the Soul Defiler for the proc and use the Greenmist in normal weapon.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the postive posts on how to equip my SK. With a few minor low costing itmes, I increaded my Stamina alot, without feeling a signifigant drain on my Mana (hell, I am always OOM when I solo)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cauchy</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an exp situation, the soul defiler is pretty cool anyway if you're not tapping a lot.  the mana regen on it is enough to sustain dooming snares and whatever spell taunt you need.  I don't even care about int anymore, sta/hp all the way.  I think I have something like 127 int ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tropics</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only time I have problems in ToV is when GM decides to chain proc. Usually a well equipped warrior has no problem keeping agro if I decide I dont want it. On one mob though the GM went crazy and procced like 6 times in 6 swings, that got some real quick agro let me tell you. Despite that though a SK in ToV should be able to handle a ToV mob for a round or two if he is buffed and has decent gear. Only things I fear in there are the named and those wyverns and drakes that go flurry crazy.</div></div><hr />
