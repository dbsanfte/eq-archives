estimated at 1.5-2.5 hours.</div></div><hr />

He is blue, hard to slow, and his AE can eat away your hit points.<br />
<br />
Although im only a 7.5k buffed sk, the key seems to be his AE.<br />
<br />
I immagine that a few better resists would make it trivial, or another healer. Got him to about 60%, but had to gate the sham.<br />
<br />
Pulling him is trivial, killing him more fun 8)<br />
<br />
Laters!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ootoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">since wednesday, i've done him 9 times, 8 times with 4 people --- me, the sk--- warrior--- druid ---shammy<br />
<br />
1 time just me and shammy, droped loot each time, epic piece each time. The ae isnt to bad and if the shammy keeps casting rc you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gabuk Biledrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I checked him and he was up so I asked my guild for a couple volunteers and 8 of us went down to kill him. 65SK, 66Bst, 66Bst, 66Rgr, 65Mnk, 65Enc, 65Clr and 65Shm.  We owned him.  Although I can see how this guy's AE is a problem.  We tried the strat of putting healers behind the pillars at the back of the room to avoid the AE. (Much like in Ssra) However, I think cause this is an outdoor zone that did not work.  All were hit by AE effect.<br />
<br />
2 hours later we checked and he was still not up.  We were prepping to leave and POP!  There he is approx 2hrs after he died.  Took him again!  First time he dropped a Neck item with Regen+2 on it and second time dropped an earring with Mana Regen+2 on it.  However, I have heard rumour that if an SK does not loot the epic drop off the Captain the chest with the good loot does not pop.  Bring an SK even if it is an ALT.<br />
<br />
Good Hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First try ( before anyone really knew what to expect ) I tried 2 boxing him with druid to see what he was about. Yeah druid died, I FD'd he was at 85%. Went back with boxed druid, boxed cleric, cleric, shammy and owned him easy. Slowed first cast, and never casted a heal besides CR &amp; EE ( lifetapped to heal myself btw casts ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">66 sk, sham, cleric, wizzy, bard and was trivial.<br />
<br />
Mind you thats two people and 5 toons, not exactly optimum 8)<br />
<br />
Bard meant we resisted all the ae's, then it was trivial.<br />
<br />
SK stayed alive with just q up on him.<br />
<br />
So resists are certainly good here.<br />
<br />
btw he resisted slow three times even after malosed, dunno bout HoS, bard doesnt have that song yet.<br />
<br />
sham and wizzy are the only two ep toons in that mix, sk's a gimp 8)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mirzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When you say keep casting RC do you mean remove curse or radiant cure? I tried with a cleric botted and remove cursex2 didn't remove the snare/slow/slow-cast AE effect. It's a good thing I had a buddy with me, I wasn't counting on being stuck with the AE after reading this post...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He is now a red con and hits for 1800. I am pretty sure this is in response to how easy he was as well as the fact he quickly became a farm mob for classes other then the sk's trying to work their epics.</div></div><hr />

Can we get a SS to confirm this? I Highly doubt it without server downtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont post just to make up crap, I am just posting to let you know of what is coming up. As with all things on Test this may change but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
My server comes down daily for patches and other stuff. On top of that a server does not need to be take down for a mob to be tweaked. I have participated in plenty of testing events and all that needs to be done is the zone is repopped.<br />
<br />
I dont have any way of hosting a screen shot. If you want to host one I will gladly sent it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Killed him 3 times now...<br />
<br />
First time was : SK, ENC, CLR, BL, DRU (boxed- me)<br />
Second time was : SK, Mage ,Sham (boxed-by mage), DRU (boxed- me)<br />
Last time was : SK, Dru.. (boxed- me)<br />
<br />
Was a Long fight but with Management was able to use Druid CH the hole fight almost... it makes it about a 30 sec cast so you almost chain cast it but with KEI/B9/MoF my druid was able to hold her own...  used Leech cure to open up to get the heals going inthe right timeing behond that it was just CH over and over ... I would suggest geting any kinda slow makes it SOOOO much eazer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Went to drop this guy real quick this morning with a 70 wiz and cler.<br />
<br />
Max hit is now 1920 and seems to have more hp. Needless to say we got plowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wtf? Why is a mob that is effectively an equivalent for doing a kunark quest hitting for almost 2k???? I'd much rather they leave him easy, and downgrade or eliminate the loot. Morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just made a quick run down to Dulak to check out if Captain Varns had been changed, and he has indeed. Previously he conned dark blue to 65, now he is an even con at 70. Max hit 1900, seemed harder to slow and lots more hit points, additionally most nukes that previously had landed for about max damage now seem to land for about half damage only. A full group is now required for this mob, most likely more if not decently geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimsouled</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tried him this afternoon with 9 people... we did maybe 5% of his health before we died. Neither the 65 chanter nor the 65 beastlord could get a slow to land and the both tried repeatedly. Maybe with a shaman it would have been different. But I don't see being able to take him down without at least 3 or 4 groups now unless you got Time geared people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PeteBull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Our 66 shaman couldn't land a slow. He popped us all for 1900 hits, rampaged and enraged immediately upon engagement.</div></div><hr />
