<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In all seriousness, what does everyone have against gnomes?  Don't go into their stats, that's not valid because they're better off than dark elves (not by much, but it still invalidates that argument).  And don't go off on some big flame rant, I want to know WHY you think they suck, not simply that you do.<br />
If you play a gnome, speak up and defend yourself.  It's not like you'll change anybody's mind, but you might as well give them a piece of yours.</div></div><hr />

Really, I'm NOT kidding about my h8 for noams..<br />

<br />
In all seriousness though, I have no problems with a noam sk, or noam mage..ench..war..rog..cle...whatever.<br />
<br />
The thing that would piss me off (Being an ogre) is joining a group with an 'uber' 65 noam sk and having him tank over me. -lowers head- I just couldn't deal with it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theesadpoet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I remember turning the stations after watching some DBZ, decided to watch a movie that was on showtime, High Crimes, but later turned back to Cartoon Network to see the cartoon Dexter's Lab was on.<br />
<br />
I decided to watch that while I jumped back on eq to farm the bazaar a bit, watching dexter's lab it goes on about he's sad that his favorite boots/shoes are ruined and his sister D D gives him a book about calling gnomes who specialize [[in fixing shoes]].<br />
<br />
So he did, next thing I see little old midgits wearing green tights, pointy shoes, red santa claus like hats, and red cheeks, running around his lab. I look at them then think of gnomes on EQ.<br />
<br />
And say to myself, &quot;Those things are considered Shadow knights??&quot; :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
:p :p :p :p  lol<br />

Now, if the gnomes all pulled out big ass swords and started lifetapping Dee Dee, I'd have to agree that it's a little off.  Still, that would only make me appreciate being a gnome more.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pharr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In referance to all the short races, here is my views.<br />
Dwarves - You have to respect anything that is 4 ft. tall and 4 ft. wide that drinks and fights.<br />
Halflings - Due to the halflings I have encountered in EQ, they are, to me, the most annoying of the three.  Probally because most I have seen are druids, and I hate druids.<br />
Gnomes - Really don't bother me that bad.  I get along with the few I know(who are all Int casters)<br />
As SKs though, well I believe that it was DQ who said it best. &quot;Anything the hieght of a dark elf's crotch should not be a Shadowknight.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You got that right...<br />
I've always hated halflings for some reason.  Maybe it's their looks, and they have a little faction modifier with me, so to speak - can't stand purely good races.<br />
Then the frogs come along and took the top seat on my hate list.  And they get the front cover coming into the game. And they look like Battletoads... if anyone sees a froglok named Rash, Pimple, or Zit, /smack him for me.  Surely, someone else here remembers Battletoads?<br />
I know someone else mentioned this in some thread, but the Cleaving Tooth goblins from Kunark should have been the new race.</div></div><hr />

RP-ability.  Shitty.  How the fuck do I RP an evil gnome?  I don't even get gnome necs... makes no sense...  They're all inquisitive and hyper and stuff.  This is honestly the hardest thing in the world for me to figure out.  I mean, my dwarven warrior has attitude, she's kick your ass and have a beer while doin it.  My chanter is a porn star and thinks she's a rogue.  My gnomer is...  well I just have no clue, lol.  /shrug that's prolly the only real prob I have with Chai, but I love playing her all the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't see how someone would have trouble roleplaying a gnome.  I did a decent job when I tried.  I got sick of it as much as I got sick of being an ogre.  You're right Chaitea, being the dumbass of the group gets old, especially when people get on your case for acting smart when your INT is 90 natural and theirs is 85 (yeah yeah, I know, don't put all points into INT for an ogre, this was a long time ago).  Conversely, when you hit lvl 20, and you're talking to your friends about suggestions for a last name and all they come up with has the word &quot;gear&quot; in it somewhere, you realize that maybe acting like a gnome isn't for you.  My gnome looked like a mini-me version of G. Gordon Liddy, and I had no trouble convincing people that I was a sick bastard who wanted everything to die.  Then I started getting flashes of that movie Leprechaun in my head... kills it for you.<br />
Some poeple would say it's hard to roleplay a human.  I think this means they have trouble being a human IRL.  I'm just now attempting to play a human SK for the first time, and I think it fits me pretty well... and strangely I look exactly like a large version of my old gnome.  Same mustache, same pissed off mug, same bald head.  I want to look like an evil jerk, not a gay William Wallace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lovehate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Is there still a race discussion? Wow, when do any of you find time to play??<br />
<br />
I am a gnome of bertoxxolous on the rathe, no I dont have a higher level caster toon.  I selected gnome I admit to be different.  Here are some of the things I have noticed about my pocket sized sk.  In the early levels it was tough finding suitable armor as most &quot;tank&quot; gear is large or medium races, as well as some weapons. Recently though &quot;clockwork observer&quot; armor has gotten popular so AC wise we have cultural equal to that of the large races.  Now I admit this.. I am a far cry from a MT.  That is something a gnome ( or a erudite for that matter ) will never IMHO have over Troll or Ogre.  <br />
Bottom line, we have the same spells.. and when we pick up loot or shop in the bazaar we make our stats however we like them.  High-end, we all get buffed to max stats and load down on HP and Mana gear anyways. Play your toon, have fun! Pardon me /flame off.  I need to log back in and solo another AA point tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Magus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I hate all this crap about gnomes.<br />
<br />
Here's the deal: there is nothing wrong about choosing a polygonal animation set for your SK that has not been around as long as other polygonal animation sets, it's the player. Those who chose to play as gnomes seem to have the innate desire to just annoy the hell out of everyone. It's like ALL gnomish players role-play a character that is inheirantly stupid as fuck. I can't stand it. I ignore all gnomish people I see. If the ever talk to me up close, I tell them to shut up and piss off. <br />
Sure, you will once in a long while you will see a player who chose a gnome for the stats, and those people will just play the game and forego the stupid dialect, and I admire those folks. <br />
<br />
By the way, I do not feel just this way about gnomes. My attitude also applies for Halflings, and also anyone else who speaks like this: &quot;lolz u r own3d n00b&quot;<br />
....those people need to be wiped off the face of the earth.</div></div><hr />

About the meanest a Gnome SK can look is as mean as a rabid chihuahua, with a steek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What's more annoying than the duh-speak people use as ogres?  I try not to imagine the biggest, scariest creature ever to sound like the abominable snowman in the old Bugs Bunny cartoon (&quot;duh, I'm gonna love him and squeeze him and call him george&quot;), but many people insist that's what they should sound like.  It instantly changes an evil giant with fangs and veins bulging out of his head into a big, smelly teddybear with a sword.  Ogre SKs aren't even that stupid.  Every new ogre should talk to What's-his-name the Tyrant in Oggok and hear that NPC's speech on why ogres shouldn't act like dumbasses.<br />
Any race is annoying if played that way.  I've never met a gnome who bothered me, but then I've never met a gnome who actually acted in any sort of character.  I bet you're right Magus, I bet people can think of all sorts of annoying ways to be a gnome, and I bet I'll see that firsthand someday.<br />
I still maintain that all of our distaste should be directed at halflings.<br />

Sums it up?  If you actually hate them because you're really insecure about something - like you're short and bald and like to craft lanterns in real life - then you need your own thread.  So everyone can flame you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those of you who said anything as tall as a DE crotch shouldn't be an SK, well can you think of too many things worse than a HT in the crotch?!  If nothing else all this hate for our kind only fuels us as SK's, surely the followers of Inni can relate to this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Oompah Loompah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">And I would agree.  But realize when I say this I approach being a shadowknight and play this game more as a loner and a solo player.  I enjoy going out itno the far regions of Norath and just staying out for weeks at a time.<br />
<br />
For me the gnome tinkered arms (40% spells haste) were a bonus that I could not pass up.  That haste plus a haste item can push me anywhere from 61%- 81% self haste without any reliance on others.<br />
<br />
I find that to be more of a benefit than unstunability or natural regen (/hug fungi).  Keep in mind I play the game differently than a lot.   <br />
<br />
My advice is to pick a race that suits your play style and enjoy it.  Gnome are small but that just means out hate is condensed.<br />
<br />
What is worse I ask you, putting a tablespoon of tobasco on your tongue and eating it or a tablespoon of ground habanerro peppers?  Try that one out at home.<br />
