<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most of my time is spent grouping for xp with a group of friends or 2-boxing with my cleric.  None of them happen to be classes that can cast haste.  It always peeves me how the casters I group with can consistantly kick out high DPS despite their buffs, but for me, my DPS (and therefore overall exp) suffers without a nice 40%+ haste buff.  I'm thinking that it would be a nice balancing move if they introduced a new item or two (possibly tinkered and rechargeable) that could be used by ANY melee.  Currently, gnome melee's can wear those nice tinkered items that give them a 40% haste buff.   An eyepatch of plunder would obviously be a terrific choice to help in my situation, but we're all well aware of the difficulties in obtaining it (plus the haste on it isn't that great).<br />
<br />
But overall, I think introducing a right-click haste item that any melee could use would reduce the dependency on grouping with certain key classes, and freeing most melee to group with a wider variety of weirdos.  Since the last patch, grouping is the way to go.  Plus, by making it rechargeable, we get to dump more of our cash onto vendors -- an idea SOE seems fond of.<br />
<br />
I guess an alternative would be to make haste buffs last as long as C3... so at least we can grab a haste buff in the bazaar or PoK on our way to meet up with the group.  This small change could really smooth out some inconsistencies in DPS in non-raiding scenarios.<br />
<br />
Anybody have some thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're outta your mind. You have a broken driveshaft with 34% haste on it. Add 20% from eyepatch of plunder and you're all set with 54% haste with that 32 delay Goldenrod!! For crying out loud :P I use a War Marshalls staff and I attack pretty fast, you would be faster than even that! Krikey :P <br />
<br />
I do agree that haste buffs like Vallons Quickening should be like an hour long or longer buff. Though I think with focus items it can last up to 50 minutes. <br />
<br />
I think I am wrong in this matter but am not sure. Sometimes when I get KEI, I get hit with a vallons quickening as well. If I click my eyepatch it sticks too. I am not sure if the vallons is overriding the eyepatch haste but when the eyepatch fades and only vallons is left, I do notice a decrease in speed. So I think they stack. Again probably wrong... since they are both spell hastes. But I've had a couple chanters tell me it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Many Hastes will let you stack the Icons, but you are only getting the actual haste from ONE Icon, and only the stats (If any) from other other. The only exception to this is certain special bardsongs such as Warsong of the Vah Shir.</div></div><hr />

no idea what all it stacks with or the haste %.</div></div><hr />

thats the gnome tinkered pants.<br />
<br />
Only gnome usable, and he mentioned wanting something like them usable for all melee's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oompah Loompah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The tinkered item you are thinking of is the tinkered Arms.  Right click effect of &quot;Cog Boost&quot; a 18 Minute 40% haste buff.<br />
<br />
The legs give a SOW buff.<br />
Gaunts - +30 STR<br />
<br />
There is one that gives +30 dex too, cant remember which.<br />
<br />
This was the deciding factor why I chose to be a gnome.  I have limited play time, usually log where I am exping, and when I do play I might only have an hour.<br />
<br />
Clockwork Arms (40%) + Haste Item = Non-reliance on caster haste while I solo.<br />
<br />
To me thats key, but my play time/stlye is a lot different than most.<br />
<br />
I think EQ makes too many comprimises as it is.  Next thing you will know all classes/races will be unstunable, have mend, get FD etc.   Every decision has choices, pluses and negatives.  That's what makes the game fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">isn't the right click eyepatch of plunder a &quot;SONG&quot; haste... meaning it stacks with worn effects AND spells?<br />
<br />
correct me if I'm wrong, but I always thought that was one of the reasons it's so highly coveted.<br />
<br />
I wish I could find a way for SKs to make some decent cash... as a casual player, I don't enjoy utilizing my time to sit staring at the wall in trader mode... and not burdening my family with &quot;No, don't use the computer... I'm in trader mode&quot;<br />
<br />
cause then I could BUY some haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Profett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe that a mob in The Deep drops some pauldrons with a clickable 34% haste that lasts for 72 mins.  It was either Thought Horror Overfiend, or some kinda of mind burrower.  At leasr if I point you in the right direction you can find some more info on them yourself.<br />
<br />
Btw, I do believe that Eyepatch of Plunder does stack with other haste spell buffs.  Anyways, I think the max haste a person can even have is 100%, so don't try too hard to get over that heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you can stack 3 different types of haste,  worn haste, bard haste, and chanter haste,  pretty sure plunder is considered Bard haste.   And remember haste isnt attack speed but the rate of attack :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sacryphice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm unsure of what Time effects really do, but unless hell froze over haste continues to work in the following ways... (will use caps just to consolodate key points).<br />
<br />
Worn or Item haste does NOT stack - most people seem to grasp the idea that your RBB and CoF aren't stacking thier respective hastes together.  This for the most part has never been a problem.<br />
<br />
Thats the first haste.<br />
<br />
Song Haste and Spell Haste are NOT different - they are the same, they are triggered or casted buff hastes.  This includes and is not limited to Shaman Haste, Enchanter Haste, Eyepatch of Plunder, Cog Arms, Dance of the Blade, Nature's Meleody and whatever else you can think of that speeds your attack rate.  This is where people get confused as they hear &quot;song&quot; and thing its stacking - this INCLUDES Jonathans Whistling Warsong for anyone with monk twinks.  Just because its a SONG does not mean it automatically stacks with SPELL.<br />
<br />
Thats the second haste.<br />
<br />
And this is what you will be running with MOST of the time, if you have up 11 icons that are all haste spells you're only using your BEST item/worn haste, and the BEST of those icons regardless of what class gave them to you.<br />
<br />
Now comes the exceptions and the last haste you can obtain.  The third or bonus haste.<br />
<br />
The most obvious one is the epic effect on Celestial Fists (monk epic), Celestial Tranquility as this will indeed stack with the latter 2 hastes.  It will however only be beneficial to the monk if he is NOT at the haste cap (which if I remeber correctly parses to 101% with a margin of error less than 1%).  The monk dicipline...err 100 fists? Will also stack with BOTH types of haste.  So Monks, especially in the kunark era, were attack animals.<br />
<br />
The last exception are SPECIFIC songs that will stack with all hastes applied and in most cases allow you to exceed the haste cap by a margin determined by that bards instument aa's and equipment modifiers.  <br />
<br />
Examples of these SPECIFIC songs include and again arent limited to, Melody of Ervaj and Warcry of the Vah Shir.  Ask your local bard he'll know his songs.<br />
<br />
ONLY those will stack with one another for a MAXIMUM of three types of haste.  You can attain as many effects and boosts to AC/dex ect from these abilities granted they are on different layers of the spell (ie Lucy stackable) but the hastes will not count towards one another save the BEST 2.<br />
<br />
This means that unless your a monk, or in a group with a bard who is playing a specific song, you are most likely getting the benefit of TWO hastes, ITEM and SPELL/SONG.  The 3rd form is purely a bonus, and is at best a situational thing for shadowknights.<br />
<br />
Also, because it's something else that I've seen confuse people, the haste that we associate with items is that items ATTACK RATE INCREASE - not its delay increase.  50% total haste is NOT making your 20/30 2handed sword 20/15.  This is wholely incorrect.  And the fact that the haste cap is at least 100% - you should know that a 20/0 2handed sword is impossible.  The Actual numbers given will tell you how many more swings you will be taking per set interval of time.  <br />
<br />
If in 1 minute you take 100 swings, hasted 50% you will take 150.  50% of 100 swings increase.  50% of 100 is 0.5*100=50.  100 swings + 50 more = 150.  NOT 200.  100% haste will result in you taking 100% more, or 200 swings...NOT infinity...<br />
<br />
If you want the NEW DELAY - you just take the inverse of the new haste as a percentage.  This is easily done by taking you're current delay on a weapon.  Lets say 30.  The dividing 30 by normalizing the haste to a percentage.  Lets say 50% haste for ease of math.<br />
<br />
30 delay / 1(normal speed)+ 0.5(50% more attacks) =  30 / 1.5 = 20.  Thats you're new delay with 50% haste on a 30 delay weapon.  20.  Which is a delay decrease of 33% or 1/3 decrease - the numbers are different and the norm is to use the INCREASE IN ATTACKS number - because thats basically waht we care about - the DPS.<br />
<br />
You can test it to quell the theory of haste on FBSS (this was from over 3 years ago) on whether it was 17% or 21% haste.  Both are correct we use 21.  100 / 1.21 = new delay of 82.65 or approx 83% - that is a 17% reduction in delay, and a 21% increase in attacks.  Both are right, we only care about the increase in attacks.<br />
<br />
To recap:<br />
<br />
- Only 3 stackable possible Hastes<br />
- Worn haste does not stack, takes the best one.<br />
- Spell haste includes generic Song hastes.  They don't stack either.<br />
- The only real viable stacking haste is Celestial Fist, doesnt matter to us, and the specific Compositions and Warcry songs that bards can play to stack and increase haste cap, situational.<br />
- The haste used to report on items is thier increase in attacks, not thier reduction in delay.<br />
- I'm bored at work again</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cirulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yah Eyepatch icon will stack, does not add anything..<br />
<br />
Eyepatch is great, and the quest isn't as bad as I hear people make it out to be.  Getting the Stormy Chicken isn't nearly as hard as a single VT shard, and the other pieces are pretty much a cakewalk.<br />
<br />
Just one opinion of course.</div></div><hr />
