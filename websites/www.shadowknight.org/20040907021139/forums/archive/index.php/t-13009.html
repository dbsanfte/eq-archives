<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anrathal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This might sound like an odd question, so let me explain. <br />
<br />
I tried playing an ogre SK the other day. Ran out to Feerott and wandered around aimlessly for 5 whole minutes, without ever seeing a white con mob! Needless to say, I dont have PoP and just gave up on the character to create a troll SK. <br />
<br />
I´d like to try an Ogre someday, however, but their newbie zone seems to be abysmal :( Any suggestions? Perhaps a place you knw in the zone to exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theesadpoet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's really wierd. When I started rather rerolled my ogre sk I ran across plenty of white, yellow, and red cons through out feerott. Also ogre sks really don't have newbie quest other then the worthless 2hander weap and the 4 tails quest for the black tunic.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is some possible places to try:<br />
<br />
Once I left oggok I followed the road down and made the left in the fork. Kept going along the way killing the lowbie types, spiders bats lizardmen scout along the way. I kept on then made another left in the fork in the road wich leads you pass a hut or two, a spire like construction. The roads ends at a pok book. I stayed there and hunted in that spot till I got up to lvl 4-5.<br />
<br />
Then head towards the lizardmen camps and farmed them till lvl 7-8. After that I went to innothe swamp and killed anything for xps. Most conned white yellow and red from kobolds to burleys. They also have orc raiders and such so to me its a good place to lvl up to 13-14.<br />
<br />
After that its pretty much up to you where you want to go from that point. Me, I went straight towards Nro, and Oasis, for derv camps and orc pass etc.<br />
<br />
So ends the story lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1-4, try the NE corner of the zone, should be bugs and stuff (or the PoK book area).<br />
<br />
5-8 start traveling farther afield, lizzy camps to the middle of the zone, maybe the SE corner of the zone.<br />
<br />
9-12 (?) try the undead over in the NE corner, or go to Rathe Mts and hunt the lizards, orcs, nobles.<br />
<br />
13-30 - Could probably go to 30 or higher in Rathe Mts, lots of stuff to kill, some gaps though that may make you go to Lake Rathe, South Karana, or up into the Ro's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Misty Thicket :)<br />
<br />
Ya, thats what you end up doing when your main for 3 years was a hobbit  *sigh*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/chuckle <br />
<br />
I hunted Misty Thicket and Rivervale for experience!<br />
<br />
Hunting inside of Rivervale was the most enjoyable thing that I've done to date.  (Need to be 30+ to do it so you have invis and FD.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adzagu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How is the cash inflow in Feerot / Rathe? Would I be naked &amp; broke if I spend 20 seasons there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SorishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depends on whether you sell tradeskill items in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If so, you'll do well, if not... hie yourself off to someplace with rats, skunks, or kobolds (Warrens).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bohdy Bagg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">once u hit 20, try to do a couple lvls in lake rathe. easiest way to get swimming up while gettin xp too.<br />
<br />
