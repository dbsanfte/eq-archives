<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Give me your opinion about the average gear needed to CC-tank a slowed, low hp (below 8%) TRC Concellor ?<br />
<br />
1st try yesterday night and i find myself wayyy undergeared to tank that kind of mofo. Even slowed (mitigated) it keeps quading for 890 and the cleric would have to chain CH my sorry ass...<br />
<br />
We are very low on numbers (41 yesterday for our 1st try) and we have to succeed with that low number... please advice about how to maximize our chances =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its been a long time since I have done that but try keeping the mob rooted and back away from it every time it summons.  That will greatly reduce the damage it does and you can still keep agro with spells.  think we had a knight, a cleric, and a druid/sham as offtank groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are indeed brave and I commend a group of people that small who can get that far in TRC encounter!<br />
<br />
I see you don't have elemental gear.  With your smaller numbers you should be able to farm some EPs to get an offtank such as you a few pieces.  It won't take much to increase you signifigantly.  <br />
<br />
You will need it when you get to Time.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!  Keep trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of my guild members got a couple of EP armor pieces. Equipment is not an excuse for failure (which could be one of our motto p). OoW and the lvl 70 permitted all of this, well with some quality players since they aren't geared.<br />
<br />
TRC will be beaten, the quicker the better as there is so much left to be done on this game and so few time to do it.<br />
<br />
I don't feel confident about tanking that kind of mofo for an hour long though. I suppose I'll be to hard on the cleric's mana and maybe equipment will finally matter after all. <br />
<br />
Contradiction huh. We are so full of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What is your gear like ? Back then with only 2200 AC, lvl 65, 11k hps, and only the pop defensive AA's they weren't even a problem below 10% when the last emote went off. Generally the idea is to put your best cleric with your best tank on the first TM since they will be there the longest. You always want to have your best tank tanking them while they get beat down so your TM tank doesnt die and have to get rebuffed and such. Even with 41 you shouldn't be tanking the TM's for over an hour. Have your pullers either snare or use blind orbs to get them pulled on first tries and that should also save time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pullers are great. On this part I know they'll make 100 time better tonight than they did last time.<br />
<br />
Eventually we will put the biggest Tank after the &quot;Reception MT&quot; on the 1st Council but this will drive to me being the forelast or something like that (gear wise). Check the magelo thing and hold your breath p<br />
<br />
Hmmkay, i'll probably mix up a bit with putting the best equipped tank with the cleric having the lowest mana pool (not regen). Considering the best tank will need a hell of a lot less heal than I do even if he'll have to tank a lot longer. As you said, between a 13K warrior with 2K5AC and a 10K 1K9AC SK... There is a world of difference.<br />
<br />
I'll need the best cleric.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're going to have problems tanking it from what I see in your magelo while it is still at higher health %.<br />
<br />
You might be smartest to swap in somehow for another tank on one of the 7-12 TRC and have that tank move over to the #12 TRC...but that won't be easy with aggro maybe? There might actually be enough time to kill #11 first and bring that tank and group over to #12, but that is risky also.<br />
<br />
Good luck, though, maybe your magelo is inaccurate and you'll be fine tanking normally on #12 yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What might help take a little of the DPS off:<br />
<br />
Replace your weapon with a BBB. SHould be able to do Seru, strat I saw used was: Bring the raid to right where his room is. Head in his room, hugging the wall right to the corner. Kill aggro. Position healers behind the pillar there to avoid his AE. Have the tank pull Seru. The rest of the raid runs to the platform where Seru was. Clerics keep tank up, RANGED DPS drops Seru. I've done it with a group of Time/Qvic people, though it took about 65 minutes. ((The cleric is... an unkown. Alt of a Time/Qvic person, but the RP alt, so she wears no plate armor Good AA's though)) I'd imagine with about 30, this shouldn't be an issue. Necro's/rangers are invaluable here.<br />
<br />
The BBB will provide better stats and AC, plus rune proc. Aug the BBB with another Rune/Guard proc. You're already working on WA it seems. It procs often enough for me, and I have crap Dex and no WA. This isn't a solution, but if it fires a good amount, which with two procs and WA is likely, it should reduce the DPS a good amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get you a SEWS if you wanna go the RuneIII route and SEWS maybe easier to get as well....But in all honesty I hate Rune procs and any proc from a weapon that takes up a buffslot...I used to use a SEWS all the time before I got VDD and then 1.5....And RuneIII basically stayed perma up once I got WA5...Procs like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A little late on the reply for me but I'd suggest you crank out the 50 aa's to aquire your OOW tankage aa's.  Those will help.<br />
<br />
Oh and get some elemental gear... you have quite a few slots that could really stand some nice upgrades there.   Use a sword n board combo too so you gain the extra AC from the shield,  not too expensive to aquire a decent combo.<br />
<br />
Just my rangerly 2cp,  g'luck to you guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">since this was bumbed up and i just noticed it ...<br />
<br />
<br />
if its taking an hour between getting the 1st tank [after the m6 mezzable mobs] and getting the last mob beat down then its really too long.<br />
<br />
we did him with 50 on our 2nd try as i recall [stuffed up on the 11th mob on the first try], we used a bard and our 3 Sk's [including me] to pull, we found bard training and the SK's snaring a pre-targeted mob [so we all had the same one] then FDing and letting a monk take it to the raid took about 2-3 mins per mob, so just as they had the last mob locked down the new one was ready to come in.<br />
<br />
we then used 2 healers [mostly a druid + cleric or cleric + cleric] per tank, when we got to the 10th mob the tanks started the beat down while the next 2 were killed, i was 10th tank and used a druid + a cleric i was boxing to heal [boxed cleric was great because i could heal/cure the AE on the pullers without bothering a real cleric in the raid].<br />
we beat them down to 3% though, not 8%.<br />
<br />
it was rough, at the time i was only around 9.3k buffed, 1900 ac.<br />
<br />
<br />
get shield block 3 if u can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the help guys, but our server is dead (Sebilis). Wow just completed our decrepency.<br />
<br />
We were 35 per raid and this number will go down till the end. No way we could kill TRC with that low numbers. We succeded Ikkinz 1 and prolly will we achieve Ikkinz 2 soon but we will hit the wall sooner or later. Sooner... I am a bit disgusted sorry for the bad mood.</div></div><hr />
