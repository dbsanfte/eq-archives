<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOOOOOOTTTT!! What a day in Hate I had today with my guildies. After 10 grueling hours in Hate, Drake 197 dropped the Decrepit Hide. He spawned near the Maestro's steps and near the drake house. We also got a SEOC to drop from Vicar M Kari for one of our rangers. What is funny is I got an ashenbone abassi on a previous trip, the ashenbone axe, shield and the hide on this trip :) By the way it was my 10th trip to Hate and the 32nd ashenbone drake of the day.<br />
<br />
I just want to thank everyone at sk.org for all the support and I hope anyone else who is doing the epic gets a hide to drop. Soon I will have the epic. Hopefully next weekend Lhranc will fall or next week that is :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ffejdoow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got my drop the other day from an ashbone near the steps.  As you are facing forward from the steps, go to the left of the building right in front of the steps. <br />
<br />
This will go back a little bit but there is a dead end where a mob pops to the left.  <br />
<br />
That is where the ashdrake dropped my hide two days ago.<br />
<br />
Where was yours at?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mine was in a building to the west of the maestro's steps. There were some tier 2 mobs near the building. It was right against the wall. Had to pull a cleric of hate first in the room to get to the drake without any adds. Gratz on your hide Ffejdoow and good luck on the rest of the epic.</div></div><hr />
