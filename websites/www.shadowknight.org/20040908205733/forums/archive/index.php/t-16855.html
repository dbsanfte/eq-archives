<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milon-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finished all my Hole portion of epic just got Lhranc to do now, but this was the second time I have done this part (switched servers after I had Hole done before) and when I did Shroud turn in the Mummy never charged me like he did before....so I was just standing there for like 5 minutes so finally I just ran into the tower and aggroed the first floor etc. and the punk ghost of a pally decided he would finally come join the fun....so I dont know why he got scared but he did, so just posting this info if any SK's were bout to do this part, dont think the mob is broke or anything just go get him after a few, he was stuck on the inner door I found out<br />
well hope this helps anyone in the future</div></div><hr />
