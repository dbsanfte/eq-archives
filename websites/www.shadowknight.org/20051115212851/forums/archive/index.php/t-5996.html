<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kona</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a bit new at this SK thing (and EQ in general to be honest)and I keep hearing people talk about using 2hs weapons instead of one-hand weapons? Am I missing something here? It would seem to me that using a 1-hand weapon with a fast delay and decent damage combined with bash would do more over-all damage than 2hs. Is it more a matter of preference or is there something I'm missing about 2hs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahel Everhate</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next to the which race is the best for an sk this has been the longest running controversy... no one post or opinion is actually right about this... but here is my opinion and MY experience having maxed out ever weapon skill on my 52 reaver...<br />
<br />
Which weapon is better depends entirely on what the occasion is..<br />
<br />
RAIDS: when on a raid sk are not the main tank for the most part this is where a 2hander is good because of the dmg bonus on the weapon will out dmg a shield and a sword with few exceptions..personally my weapons are a lil crapped out as i sold most of them for better armor and am left with a vehement sword of rievaj and a lord of pain khurki for my greenmist quest to be paired up with a atramentous shield.<br />
When you are the main tank though i would suggest 1hander and bash as it help retain agro , you still fairly well dmg wise , plus bash if maxed will hit hi... my bash is only 181 and has maxed hit for 78dmg. The stun on bash is excellent at our higher lvls in saving us when we are agroing for a group in cancelling any spells being cast our way , thus dmg for the shield does make up a lil of what is lost dmg wise when using 1handers<br />
<br />
Soloing: here is really where personal liking comes into play...honestly when i solo i am fear kiting (yes its boring as hell at times) ,and my pet does good dmg  ( specially when buffed ) and so i usully will start off with my Rievaj.. the effect is a very nice shield that absorbs dmg , from what i have seen it procs for me a good 3-5 times a fight and the shield stops randomly anywhere from 80-240 dmg (anyone else notice that random shield or just me?).... Once my Shield comes up i switch over to my 1hs and shield, as shield helps keep the mob from running too far when feared ( thus lowering chances of adds).. and if fear breaks and he takes a liking to me he just hits my shield , gives me plenty of time to recast fear and finish the job at my liesure as the mob is usually a good 3/4 dead by then....<br />
<br />
in all honesty there is no right answer to this question as to whether 1hand or 2 hand is better.. we aren't dual wielders so while 1 handers are nice the only do about as much dmg with a good shield as a good 2hander... its about equal.. the only thing that i would say really effects this is what weapon you are using... ie something like a 21 24 shard of night with a shield will out dmg my rievaj but would be on par with something such as an argent protector..<br />
<br />
If anyone thinks anything different i would love to hear more on this topic as well... i've honestly tried my best to see what works for me , and personal preference, i like swords not lil knives or big clubs, lol we're knights not cave men and not rogues<br />
<br />
side note...and completely off subject: who else thinks the shard of night should be a spear and not a stupid lil butter knife.. heheh i mean come on how noble is it to run around with a lil splinter in your hand and a big shield in your other... just my opinion =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thudthud</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My basic rule is, if Im main tank I use my 1hb and shield for the extra ac, if Im not main or fear kiting I use my 2hs for extra dmg !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment, I see no reason to use 1H over 2H anywhere, unless you just don't have a good 2H.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no problem holding aggro with a 2H weapon and it does far more damage than 1H, even with bash.  The extra AC and HP from 1H and shield is negated by the fact that one extra riposte (and you're going to have far more than one extra) will do more damage than you're going to gain in HP.<br />
<br />
I parsed my Black Rock Maul of Crushing (23/23) and Shield of Fury combo up against my Primal Velium War Lance (45/44).  I kept the Avatar proc up with both weapons, only recording fights where I had Avatar up the whole fight.<br />
<br />
1H + shield bash came out to about 40-45dps, with bash accounting for 2.5-5dps of that.  2H came out to around 55-60dps with slam accounting for about 1-1.5dps of that.<br />
<br />
Now, that said, this is at level 60 where you have the maximum 2H bonus.  The results may vary slightly when dealing with 1H vs. 2H below level 50.<br />
<br />
Also, if you compare difficulty of obtaining pre-NToV 1H and 2H weapons, the Lance of Thunder (52/46) or Shovel of the Harvest (50/43) will far outdamage the Eye of Rigtorn (25/25) or Black Rock Maul of Crushing (23/23).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Countic</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye I agree kraz, a 2h always dominates a 1h in the end game.  I am not familiar with mid ranged levels any more since i have been 60 for so long.  Hasted with a facesmasher (48/42 with dmg bonus of 34, 25ac, 25str, 15sta, 100hp I deal about 65-80dps not including procs, lifetaps, or dots being used (and they did account for some of the time used) while my black rock maul of crushing (23/23) only deals about 40-45dps with the same specs.  The reason i give the other stats is to show that even 2h's have ac built into them (some do rather) and they usually give a ton of hp.  Tanking is actually better if you use an awesome 2h compared to an awesome 1h.  The amount of damage dealt by them actually increases your aggro when compared to 1h.  If you are a large race or have the aa ability to bash you can still bash while using a 2h.  Since slam stuns just like bash does its still advantageous to use a 2h over a 1h in fear kiting if you are a large race.  Another important thing to note is that when we cast spells we cant attack.  With a 2h you have a longer delay between swings and can often cast an entire spell before the weapon is ready to swing again-therefore not losing any of your dps.  With a 1h you lose 2-4 swings worth of damage when casting a spell-with a 2h you lose almost none.  Casting spells does not slow down your weapon's delay and if you cast a spell thats 5 secs long then your 42 delay weapon will have popped and be waiting for the spell to go through upon which you will hit the mob right when the spell lands.  Another thing to understand is a 2her's ability to cut through ac.  For instance my 1h will hit for average of about 80 in sebilis, my 2h will hit for average of 200.  When i go raid ssra nameds my average hit with a 1h is about 35-40 (almost half) and my 2h is still about 200.  This puts 2h about twice as powerful from 1hers compared to what they were beforehand.  Almost always a 2h is better than a 1h in the end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kona</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info folks. Looks like I'm gonna have to start working on 2H before it gets too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groglarb</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's never too late to start using a weapon skill. I just started working up 2hb at lvl 45 and at 48 it is at 171, should max out before 50 since I've worked in about 50 points in piercing as well. I just grabbed the cheapest weapon I could with the fastest delay, Poison wind censor 20/28... still doesn't proc yet. You can grab a runed ornate 2hander pretty cheap or even a Nathsar greatsword for almost nothing on my server. I'm looking for a fast piercer now to finish that off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hrendra An'ei</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, there are some rather poor 2handers out there that aren't worth using. :)  I use the ubiquitous Black Acrylia Halberd, and found that while duoing with my cleric partner, in a toe-to-toe fight it's the difference between 1 Complete Heal and 2 of them. <br />
<br />
The damage I'm dealing actually works better as a defensive strategy than 1h+shield, because the 1hander battles take so much longer to finish. <br />
<br />
Not every 2-hander is like that, but it exemplies what I feel should be the general rule of usage--use whichever one kills the mob faster. Using a Centi Warspear at level 52, for example, would be pretty silly, because it doesn't have enough oomph to it to warrant losing the shield. Using a BAH, however, is a tremendous difference.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it looks pretty sad compared to something like an AP, which looks massive in the hands of an Iksar.<br />
<br />
I just imagine that I'm fighting hand-to-hand and actually punching mobs for up to 84 damage. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skresh</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall a good 2HS/2HB is the way to go.  If you have a 2 hander like the edge of cabalis (25 dam  50delay) you are much better off with a one hander and a shield.  However, if you can get your hands on two hander with decent stats stick with it.  <br />
When soloing with no speed buff I tend to cast life syphon inbetween hits.  With a one handed weapon casting spells slows down your hit time.  However with a two hander when timed right you can cast most of our spells (esp lifetap line) while on delay.  If I happen to have C3 on me I cast until I am blue in the face.  <br />
Also, I have had no problems keeping taunt on me with a good two hander.<br />
<br />
All in all I still want a greenmist!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulvyne</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if facing a mob (or another player) with a damage shield, the faster 1hand weapons means you'll take more damage-shield damage, too.<br />
<br />
I used to use 1hb until I found my first decent 2h. I rarely, if ever, use 1h anymore. <br />
<br />
There are just so many REALLY nice 2h weapons out there. And while our 1h selection is ALSO very nice (especially compared to 1h weapons from other classes), our 2h weapon selection is just too good to pass up, IMHO.<br />

<br />
Had it capped in about 10 hours of grouping in velks.<br />
<br />
At 58 I got a petrified rod, 2hb was 0, luckily I had a bronze wood staff, and used that to skill up, did it in a day.<br />
<br />
Pierce was always up as I used a Stalag terror spine spear alot in my youth.<br />
<br />
That was untill I got a MoSS on our first Hole raid (Was the guildleaders old one, he was using a 2hb at the time)  I was 48, had to skill up 1hb from nothing then too.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is find a group somewhere in an xp area for you, and ask if you can beat on their mobs some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scurvy</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are my results (only 1 fight each) against Vindi<br />
<br />
My attack 1165 (nothing but self buffs)<br />
Lvl 60<br />
<br />
Not including any procs or spells<br />
<br />
Black maul (23/23)<br />
DPS: 39<br />
<br />
Narandi lance (45/44)<br />
DPS: 36<br />
<br />
Frostreaver (42/43)<br />
DPS: 36<br />
<br />
Clearly if I included procs and spells things may of been different.  Id expect my SoD procs with the 1 hander, and Judgment procs with the frostreaver, as well as the Dot with the lance (not sure its damage).  Of course the 2 hander lets me cast spells between swings without loosing DPS.  Further tests will have to be conducted as 1 trial on each probaly isnt the best.<br />
<br />
I will say this though in single exp groups I always have better results with aggro using a 2 hander over a 1 hander, and I mean always.  Of course using the 1 hander is a huge boost to my AC, HP, and mana.<br />
