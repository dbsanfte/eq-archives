<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MTCason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, all.<br />
<br />
Admittedly sophomoric question here, but I'm COMPLETELY new to EQ, and want to make an SK, but am a little hesitant.  I'm looking at the DEs, and I think the 'pros' of going with that race seem to outweigh the negatives, but save for one great, big, glaring pimple of a negatory ... they're hated.  <br />
<br />
How is it feasible to play them if they get hacked to death trying to enter any town outside of theirs, the Trolls, or Ogres?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a complete misunderstanding. <br />
<br />
Dark elves are by far NOT the most hated race, they are closer to the middle. <br />
<br />
Most accepted is human, then gnome, then erudite, then dark elf, then ogre/troll, and a far most hated is iksar.<br />
<br />
On Antonica, (with a little time in Black Burrow) you would have access to all of the Antonica cities, there is VERY little in Faydwer anyhow, and with the advent of Luclin/Velious/PoP, there is no advantage or disadvantage to any race (as far as racial hatred goes).<br />
<br />
90% of the newbies hunt their newbie zone, and head to Paludal Caverns and continue through other Luclin and Velious hunting spots. With the teleport system from PoP, it even makes going &quot;home&quot; for spells easy.<br />
<br />
There is so little disadvantage to picking the race you WANT to play lately, that there is no point worrying about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Faction doesn't mean much.  If you spend time in Velious/Luclin and probably PoP your starting faction will be almost completely meaningless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have terrible faction with several cities and doesn't affect my play a bit.  In short it is because they hated me already.  Several cities I can't get any worse faction (Freeport, Ak'anon, Kelethin)  but there are work arounds in most cases. <br />
<br />
First off forget the Faydwer contient all together until you are above 50.  Neriak is your home town and they are places to  hunt closeby  easily.  When you get tired of that you can safely travel to Oggok (ogre town) and Grobb (troll town) by a safe route.  <br />
<br />
As for Kunark we have our own town (outpost)  easily reachable a few zones from Neriak.   And as far as Veilous and Luclin  we are indifferent to all towns until we change our faction very easily.  With the PoP I am sure this will become even less of an issue.  <br />
<br />
Choose how you like I am sure you will still have fun anyway you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nenadar W'Vern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah being an SK will make you more hated than being a dark elf.  Agnostice DE wizards seem to be able to go anywhere...</div></div><hr />
