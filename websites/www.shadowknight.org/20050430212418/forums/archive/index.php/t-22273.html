<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wrowin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am playing my SK again as a main. I havent really played an SK since  disease cloud got broken. He is 45.9 atm he had been 59 but I EEed  down to provide EEs to necros for a raid when I was guilded so his  no  drop gear isnt that bad. I have some friends who have volunteered to help me fill in his blanks.  I have a cpl questions.<br />
<br />
Think it would be easier to  rack up some AAs once I hit 51 again or just level up? <br />
<br />
What's the best  droppable  weapon I can grab w/o level limits for him...2h and 1h<br />
<br />
thanks for your help<br />
<br />
I was thinking of fear kiting in SOLB till 50 any better spots for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't touch AAs until level 65, except for (and this is argued, its up to you) getting RunSpeed3 when you can, if you pull a lot, etc. (Though you could easily get the 3 AAs from planar progression if you're in a guild that is doing any of it, or even with the single group alternate key quests). Most go for a War Marshall's Bladed Staff for 2HS, There is a recommended level on it, though I think its only 56 or so. For 1HS, I honestly couldn't say, I forget what all has level requirements; Adjuctant's Saber (sp?) is rec.56 I think, and is a decent little weapon, there is also a nice 1hander out of Riwwi I think, but I forget if it has a req. or rec. level on it. Anyway, good luck with your Shadowknight.</div></div><hr />
