<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saeldayar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A question was raised at the Fan Faire about upgrading the epic... the answer given was that the IC is the epic weapon of 'KUNARK' it was never intended to be the final weapon of the game... as for the epic 2 question, another epic might be considered at some time in the future...<br />
<br />
There was repeated mention of a major project in process for 'upgrading' the current game, but details were not given, just that the project was related to about 5 questions asked as they were part of the revamp.  I apologize, but do not recall them, just one about the mention of graphics for helms.  It appears that the guy that takes care of 'head' items, HATES helms...<br />
<br />
Not that this helps but thats the SOE response.</div></div><hr />
