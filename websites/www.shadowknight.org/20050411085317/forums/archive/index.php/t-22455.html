<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm in an ep guild that is starting to make some progress again.<br />
<br />
looking at this fight, and expecting it to last for 40ish minutes, and seeing that a warrior will only be in defensive for 30% of that, how viable would I be as a MT for this(or for that matter, other EP encounters)?<br />
<br />
Our warriors have a serious lack of ac:<br />
1 (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=378556)<br />
2 (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=788541) <br />
3 (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=855697) <br />
<br />
those our our top 3 warriors, we don't have enough war's to swap tanks every 3 minutes, so it seems to me like it might not be such a bad tradeoff to have me as the tank.<br />
<br />
On the stuff we've done in EP's warriors seem like far better choices as the mob's generally don't live much longer than defensive's duration. 'Course I have no idea how hard she hits/etc so maybe this is crazy talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Znuglebuug should tank the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting a tank switch in on Xegony shouldn't be looked at as a real option, 1 tank needs to go the duration. Getting and keeping her ATK debuffed by a necro will help.<br />
<br />
SK role is more in pulling her and then kiting and perhaps tanking the waves of spawns. The encounter is about keeping the spawns under control effectively, the tanking on her should be maintainable for hours with a solid CH rotation and BRD/Necro maintaining the cleric mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ravnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure our warriors had less AC when we did Xegony the first time or two.  They did switch out to 2h weapons in order to reduce her damage spikes.  The fight is really more of an endurance test for your clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Onoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First i would tell you to farm the eps for more molds to better equip your warriors before you try.  Then, when it comes to xeg, you should not expect to MA on her or any of the ep gods for that matter until your guild progresses more.  3 warriors are sufficient to do this event. This shouldnt last 40mins from start to finish.  Try to think outside of the box when you do this fight and it should go smooth.  That's all i can tell you without spoiling the fight for you.  Once you figure out how it goes, it pretty cool fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1066820<br />
<br />
That is our MA who has tanked Xegony multiple times.  His HPs and AC are not ever the reason we have wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you really think 200 more AC and the ability to spam lifetaps and aggro intermittently is going to surpass their magical reduction of all hits for all of the fight, with even only 30% of the fight being chopped even more dramatically, I don't think you've been paying attention. OMG milisecond CH rot on me plz!<br />
<br />
Your time saturated-ish level AC, by way of mixed bag VT/GoD/etc. loot,  isn't enough to stop the aforementioned &quot;xeg gets lucky&quot; potential damage spike, only raw HPs combined with natural mitigation, shielding/spellshielding mitigation.<br />
<br />
Xeg is easy in theory - it's the act of getting the classes together to pull it off that's rough. Of course it's easier with GoD augs and loots, as well... but that magical alignment of the sun where the cripples land, chain gets in sync without too big of a DPS spike in the beginning, and proper CC teams on the add waves, not 200 AC.</div></div><hr />
