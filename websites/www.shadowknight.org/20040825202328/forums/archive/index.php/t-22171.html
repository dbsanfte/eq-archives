<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cestodas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">4 minutes down the drain of wasted life, but hey this guy (http://www.mundofryky.com/Noticias/2004/mayo/noti_video_djfryky/djfryky.htm) truly shines as a retard. <br />
Somehow his lunatic laughs toward the end disturbs me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the rubbing his nipples with the vinyl and the breaking his obviously favorite record over his head makes him a slightly amusing fuck stain<br />
<br />
In other awful non-English music stories...<br />
<br />
The first pop some I learned in Sweden was called something like Om Egen<br />
The chorous sounded like Om oh om oh om oh om oh om oh om egen eee och ut ut och eee eee och om egen<br />
<br />
Translates to &quot;Over and over and over and over and over  and over again in and out out and in in and out again&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember it being stuck in my head before I even know what it was.<br />
<br />
They're was also a painfully catch tune with the word Greyhound Bus in it, the song about meating a girl on the boat to Finland and something about feeling like a cloud on the ground<br />
<br />
English language pop isn't the only inane music in the world...people need to die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WTF!<br />
<br />
Da gibt's son komisches Liederl, na das geht ma gah nimma aussm Kopp raus da.<br />
He said there is a strange song.. he can't get it out of his head. :p<br />
Omg and still he can speak german.. well more an austrian accent..<br />
<br />
