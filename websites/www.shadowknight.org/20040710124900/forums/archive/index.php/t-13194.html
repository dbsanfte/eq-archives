You could win more cash off betting I'm gonna crash running outside the forge house to 3rd Gate than you can with all those gay little player-made 'casinos'... So lame.</div></div><hr />

But I guess that is low on the things to do list at sony...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That spot has been like that for years.<br />
<br />
I have had friends complain about it for a long time.  One of them was completely certain it was a problem with his System, and the moron GM on the Sony Tech Support forum told him it was.  So he went and bought a new Vid Card.  <br />
<br />
His problems got worse after that.  <br />
<br />
And he still crashes in that same spot in Neriak.<br />
<br />
It has happened a few times to me, but usually it doesn't.  Guess it all depends on how exactly you hit that spot.</div></div><hr />

Or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had this same problem for years too...  only seems to me, btw, that it happens while I'm actually playing my SK too.  My necro seems to go through the spot just fine.<br />
<br />
I've found that as you're by the bank, running from the bridge, it's just as you cross the forge.  I've noticed I seem to have the problem less if my Jboots aren't up (or similar speed thingie) or if I stop as I go through the door near the forge, headed towards Underground, and just kinda tap forward til I pass the forge I don't crash.  Running backwards seems to help too...  I think it might have something to do with the speed the graphics are processing and that Neriak just isn't designed for you to run through that fast.  But, wtf do I know.  <br />
<br />
I have tried repatching all of Neriak, but that didn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grabatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It has been happening to me since i started palying EQ.<br />
My observations made me think that it happens more often to my  troll (large race problem?) than to my dark elf character. /shrug<br />
<br />
/bug'ed that problem a few times, even provided locs from where to where i was running when i got booted to the desktop.</div></div><hr />
