<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really sure there are any.  From what was on the Test Server here's what you might be looking for:<br />
<br />
1.  Lvl 65 Spear Upgrade ( from a 600 pt spear of decay to a 660 pt spear )  WOOPIE :mad: <br />
<br />
2.  Lvl 65 Shroud of Chaos upgrade :confused: <br />
<br />
3.  Lvl 65 Mental Corruption upgrade :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone else has seen anything else .. please post here .. I am only going off of what I have seen from the test servers and from other posts.</div></div><hr />

You dont think being able to cast 2 600+ dmg spears 1 after the other is a good thing? thats more then twice as much spear dmg if you are a spear caster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well not twice as much.  The alternative would be to load up Spear of Plague for 400 points of damage.  So, what one actually gets is a 260 damage per 45 seconds (as I recall) damage upgrade.  For that, an additional 100 mana is consumed (approximately).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did they change Ancient bite to a HoT? Thought it was a weak upgrade to z-bite. Or was that just what the recourse was whenever the poster plucked th lucy info.<br />
<br />
Has anyone gotten any of the actual spells yet to verify effects?<br />
Yaeh, wishfull thinkin maybe they changed em to something useful last minute.</div></div><hr />
