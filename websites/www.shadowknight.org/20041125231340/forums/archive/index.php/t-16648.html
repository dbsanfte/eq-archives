<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a group for  LDON last night and one of the group was unable to enter the zone. Kinda sucked as he was a Rouge and we kept running into traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They sent a bunch of broadcasts regarding this problem.<br />
<br />
Complete file scan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This usually results from someone not doing all of the preparation steps properly. You need 6 yellow text flags before you can enter a LDoN zone. Many people miss/skip one or more and find themselves unable to enter the zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is also another bug that does not let anyone in your group enter a LDoN dungeon.You get a message like.&quot;The dungeon is currently to dangerous to enter at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have had this happen several times now.I petitioned and /bug reported it.The guide said it was a known bug,but no idea when they would be fixing it.<br />
<br />
If this happens you just have to leave your adventure and get another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few people I know suspect that the &quot;it's too dangerous inside&quot; bug is because all the instances of that zone are filled up... it's a possibility.  Annoying still, and there should be a way around it.</div></div><hr />
