During my run into the good side the quards attack me can we play the field or is it either or.  Lords know most groups are goign to be goodie goodie cause most cleric are on Good faction.   Aye i know i can trade my shard but if this is the case where 80 percent of the groups do Radiant mission it going to put make getting Ebon harder.</div></div><hr />

Cause thats BS and total lack of creativity.  We need opposing factions and different rewards depending on which road you picked.</div></div><hr />

the two new factions are purely new....so no legacy to our past factions....pick one side and progress it by doing missions for that side....<br />

there are ways to switch...but painful...and counterproductive to the end reward...which i assume is kind of like the adventurers stone stuff...<br />

I think I will have to concur. While I would prefer to go evil, something tells me 90% of people will go good. Since these tasks require groups, I will have to go good as well.</div></div><hr />

Frodlin's thread did mention a neutral  camp (wayfarer's brotherhood) where a mixed faction group could get missions as well.  Not sure what shards/rewards there will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Np, trade your &quot;goodie&quot; crystals for evil crystals.  That is, if there are enough evil crystals to go around.  I think there will be a high demand/shortage of evil crystals, due to the greater amount of goodie missions which are done.<br />
<br />
That said, there is no reason your regular groups can't do 50/50 and just trade the crystals.  That way you can work through both sets of missions, though you'll only gain faction with evil while they gain faction with good.  It is my understanding that evil can do good and good can do evil missions without getting the faction hit for completing the mission.  I'm guessing someone has to be hailed in camp after the mission is complete to get the hit (or something).  I'm not sure exactly how that works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The neutral camp is for switching factions.  Anyone can go on a good or an evil mission.  You just have to have someone of the appropriate alignment select it.</div></div><hr />

you can buy from mission mechants while invis/fd so its np for us.<br />
<br />
i also had a paladin along, only the person who gets the mission needs that faction.<br />
<br />
we had to get 15 fangs from lavaspinners instanced zone, took 90 mins with me a bst and a pally [all same guild/same progression] and we made 2 AA doing it [4% per kill].<br />
got 33 ebon shards and the token, also some crap no drop neck which we took to see if we can hand it in for guild trib.<br />

it seems you have to do a bunch of regular missions from the camp before you can do a mission from the &quot;dark&quot; tagged mission giver.</div></div><hr />

Similar to what a couple others posted, I did a goodie mission but can't seem to hand in my token to get a faction hit.<br />
<br />
If I interpret some of the other posts correctly, some other event has to take place (kill a dragon, has to be done once per server?) before I can hand my token in to someone?  Or am I getting several different things in this post mixed up?<br />
<br />
The other group members could all hand in their tokens but I couldn't.  Someone hinted that I could hand it in at the Wayfarer's camp instead to the appropriate factioned person, is that it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did the same thing... Seeing as all the faction hits mention Tirranun's name, I think he's probably unkillable until certain parts of the expansion unfold.  He's probably the boss mob of the game, and the version in LS is probably just there for flavor.</div></div><hr />

Completing a quest in Everquest as you explore new areas is &quot;gay&quot;... eh?...... Bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch. Your server prolly had the same mine had. 30 people standing by the BL door bitching and waiting while 2-3 people actually put effort into it.</div></div><hr />

No being *forced* to complete a quest before you can access *any* content is extremely &quot;gay&quot;. <br />
<br />
I'm all for keyed zones for the end of expansion, but there is zero reason that this event could not have been run last week allowing people to actually experience the new expansion yesterday instead of the day after.<br />
<br />
There's many ways they could have done the same thing (most people don't mind questing a bit) without pissing off so many people (and yes people were annoyed - vocally so last night).<br />
<br />
If you actually liked the quest preventing you from playing what you wanted last night you're not only in the minority you're also a fucking moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This isn't very helpful.  Hopefully I will figure it out on my own.<br />
So far I got a mission from a gnome to kill 20 things from a zone I couldn't get into.  I deleted it.<br />
<br />
I fd at the kos guards with zero life lol.  A friend told me he got into one of those zones and found spiders, but kept getting ported out.<br />
I can wait I guess for a while.</div></div><hr />

Except that it didn't, and I was in a DoN Mission last night for a good amount of time.... sooo... what's the problem?<br />
<br />
/derail off<br />
<br />
So, has anyone located the neutral camp yet?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Ohh and: i've done a mission, you get a token at the end to hand in, you loose FV and keepers faction and gain lanys and dark faction.<br />
<br />
So, faction wise, a good can do an evil mission, and NOT lost good faction unless they do the turn in? Does the token net you the Crystals, or are the Crystal and faction rewards seperate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">[QUOTE=So, has anyone located the neutral camp yet?[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
It is like loc pos 2250 neg 80 something like that if memory serves.<br />
<br />
It is near the other two camps but towards the center of the zone more.  It looks like a gyspy camp at first with wagons.  My only problem was I didn't have access to the zones the NPC's gave me missions for.  I wasn't able to get missions from the evil side, and the guards on the good side nearly killed me.  Someone later told me try ducking into the zone.  I will figure it out eventually I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
all 3 of us got crystals and a token each.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
faction only changed upon turning the token in to the mechant in the evil camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
a good can do an evil mission and vice versa, but only good aligned can start a good mission and vice versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
the dragon is still up on my server, i took 2 groups to have a go at it when it popped but our DPS wasn't great enough so we ended up zoning it off, no one else on the server has tried it yet that i know of.<br />
<br />
<br />
all group members must be in-zone when you complete the mission to get the reward.<br />
<br />
anyone still zoning [IE from an evac] will not get the reward, its a bug.<br />
<br />
to zone into instances you have to click in, not run in as you would with a LDON.<br />
<br />
i can see no reason to turn &quot;good&quot; tokens in unles your changing faction if you are evil already, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
i can also see no reason to change faction.<br />
<br />
i would recomend doing good and evil missions at a 1:1 ratio with your groups and exchange radiant and ebon crystals as needed rather then having a mixture of them.<br />
<br />
i think if your the first person with enough faction to talk to the camp people in your guild your more likely to get groups to start these more difficult tog et missions. [from the NPCs that currently wont talk to you]<br />
<br />
<br />
anything i missed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imho, this actually manages to get around one of the possible annoyances. You can gain crystals without worrying about faction, but need faction for the missions. This way no one side or the other gets favored/ignored.</div></div><hr />

Even if you start out in poor standings with one of the camps, though, you can do deeds to prove your worth to them and get into their good standings.  The Wayfarer mercenaries will help with that goal.  They're a bit less particular about who they associate with.<br />

Apprehensive is the highest you can start out with either camp.  It's the base level at which that side will start working with you.<br />

Well, if your guild decides to go evil or good, you will most likely want to follow. If you mix your missions between good and evil, you will get tokens for faction that cancel each other out, or at a minimum you will handicap yourself in raising faction with one side.<br />
<br />
To me it seems to make sense to focus on one or the other; faster faction, faster crystals (without the hassle of trading), and thereby faster tombs, augs, armor, etc.<br />
<br />
BTW I think I saw a 42/30 1hs pal/sk with a decent DD proc that was fairly cheap. Versions are available on both sides. Some of the augs really look quite good, 175dd + stun, 125 tap, ID5, manapres5, Muram's Anger, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Update: rather than actually try to do Wayfarer's tasks/expeditions, I turned in my goodie token to one of the wayfarers (female half elf wearing plate) and I got the faction hits.  One thing I did NOT notice earlier about the token is that it is LORE.  Had I not attempted some sort of turn in prior to doing another goodie expedition (which we did after my turn in), I'd guess I'd have lost the next token plus the associated faction hits.</div></div><hr />

We did this one last night also.  You have to wander around the zone getting &quot;Unusual footstep&quot; emotes for a while and eventually it will pop on you.  Its a weird one.</div></div><hr />

Finish a mission and <br />
1) Get token, turn in token for crystals and faction or <br />
2) Get token and crystals, turn in token for faction<br />
<br />
Then you can exchange crystals with other players if you like and turn them in for goodies.</div></div><hr />

Helpful hint: Some mission items are droppable and not no rent. We had the flower thing die on us, as did a friend doing the mission separately, but he still had the fertilizer and we still had the pot.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">At the Wayfarer camp, evils can turn in goodie mission tokens to an npc for +goodie faction.  Goodies can turn in evil tokens to another npc for +evil faction.  But also, goodies can turn in goodie tokens and evils can turn in evil tokens at the Wayfarer camp.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell... EVERYONE can turn in their token to one of the two half elf npc's to get faction hits.  Both npc's here will talk to you no matter how kos you are to either good or evil faction.  And both npc's will accept the APPROPRIATE token from you; meaning you can do missions and get faction no matter what side you are on and whether the good or evil merchants are up or not.  All that the merchants not being there does is for you is prevent you from looking at and buying gear.  You can still get missions, you can still do missions, you can still earn tokens, you can still earn shards/crystals, you can still get faction.</div></div><hr />

Well, for me, the majority of my guild are goodies or neutral.  But it really doesn't matter if I didn't need baddie faction and the rest of the group did.  However, doing both sides or alternating, if you will, is a bad plan: no one gets anywhere if we do that (or put another way, faction tokens get wasted),</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Carta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Basicly the only people who have to concern themselves with faction would be the individuals in your guild who will be aquiring the &quot;Raid Missions&quot;  you must be good aligned for raid missions.  Other than that the only difference you are looking at is extra faction work.  If you are an evil class/race you will be Apprehensive to Evil and Threat to Good this works oposite for good class/races obviously.  So that said if the majority of your friends, guildies are doing good missions and you dont mind having to work 2 extra levels of faction go for it.  Just make sure once you decide which faction you want to start on that you stay with that faction to avoid the extra faction work.  Also if I am not mistaken it looks like every 4 token turnins will net you 1 level faction increase so look at doing about 20 missions for one side to get to appropriate faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">What is the purpose of working faction, anyway?  Do you get more shards per win, or better missions or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do get better missions &quot;opened up&quot; that were not visible before (we got more available than the first two after completing the third).  For the first two, in an all-70 full group, we get 33 crystals per mission.  I'd asked someone in an alliance guild who was farther along than us; and confirmed that the reward was higher but also the mission seemed more complex than what I'd seen so far.<br />
<br />
I'm only at the point of being able to do one mission per night due to time constraints, and I'm still Threatening myself as an evil doing goodie missions so personally I won't see much first-hand for a while yet.  I'd guess though that there will be a LDoN Wayfarer's Brotherhood Emblem-like reward at the end for having max faction and/or higher end missions (please note I am only guessing) -- everything the current design team has been doing lately seems to indicate it'd be logical.  And that each camp would have a similar such reward so that for the hard-core DoN'er, who would eventually max out both factions, might get (purely guess, of course) a nice augment that is lore but by doing both camps to the max would be able to get both.<br />
<br />
In any event, I calculate I'll still be KOS or barely out of KOS by the time I have enough points to buy something (assuming the merchants are brought back soon), so it'll be a while yet for me; so it won't be me reporting the goodies at the end.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I've successfully done two goodie missions with a cleric friend, and she turned in the shards. She's helped me do an evil so far, and I turned that in... This is better for the both of us, as it will open more and more and more areas for us both to complete.

That'd work on FV, but since we can't trade tokens everywhere else; it's more feasible for us to choose a side and stick with it even if it's not the easy road (that is, going evil would be easiest faction-wise for me, but it's better for my regular group to do goodie missions).</div></div><hr />

I know what you are referring to  ;)   I think however you misunderstood my first quote.  I didn't mean it was not necessary to work faction per say.  I was referring to which actual faction you chose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it varies depends on what faction you are on.  Apprehensively and indifferent takes just 100 faction point.. Amiable takes 400 points. It would take 4x longer if you are into amiable level compared to indifferent for example. So its not always fixed number of tokens per faction level..</div></div><hr />

<br />
..... But the crystals ARE ((or will be)) tradeable... so I'm not seeing the problem. You can DO a good mission as an evil, you just can't GET one for the group. The only reason the crystals are no drop right now is the dupe exploit. And no, the tokens AREN'T tradeable here they are no drop.</div></div><hr />

Just to put some info out there for people who want to do this (it's kinda a pain)...<br />
<br />
They are tethered to their spawns - pull them too far away, they'll warp back, heal to full, wipe aggro, and strip any dots/debuffs.  You have a very thin space to work with to stay out of aggro range yet close enough to the spawn point, so expect to need some practice breaking the spawn.  <br />
<br />
They summon and enrage, hit about like a PoV mob.  Fairly decent amount of HP, but nothing rediculous.  <br />
<br />
Should be doable by anyone in Tier1/MPG/etc. loot or better.<br />
<br />
Respawn is fairly long.</div></div><hr />

25+ missions, three raids, bunch of solo tasks, and lots of guards..... Dubious still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think all solo tasks give the same amount of faction. You can keep hailing the NPC until you get the fastest one (spider silks). Someone said each solo task is as much faction as a mission. I have not verified it but if it's true, doing the spider silk task is faster faction than missions, but you get no crystals.</div></div><hr />

soling guards = slowest faction<br />
then wayfarer tasks [and token hand ins]<br />
then missions<br />
<br />
<br />
it seems to me that if you turn your token into your factions mechant you get a bigger hit then using the wayfarer NPC.<br />
<br />
i judged this by seeing how many you guys claimed ot have done and how many/type a DE necro in my guild did it.<br />

he went from indiff to amiable today in 4 or 5 missions but he spent all week going from thretening to dubious.<br />
<br />
during the week he was doing mainly wayfarey solo tasks and token hand in's but today it was all to the camp merchants.<br />
and he did a lot of wayfarer missions<br />

its not hard numbers, but its the way it looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Svartrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">There's also a time management factor:<br />
<br />
- Missions have a lockout timer. We would do a certain mission that can be done very fast and then go kill guards for faction while we waited for the lockout timer.<br />
<br />
- If you have half an hour or so to play you can do a single player task. I did one each morning while having my morning coffee.<br />
<br />
- I always took the route through the evil side of the caves when moving around in LS so I could tag any guards being killed for faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each faction level has never been linear in the game thus far; and I guess this confirms that the DoN factions are the same.  It's always taken a long time to get out of being KoS and then goes faster from that point on.  I think what we were lamenting was how long it was taking to come out of threatening/dubious, indicating (as you've confirmed) how much token turn-ins, wayfarer tasks and guard kills were impacting the faction changes.  Also it's usually faster to go down in one faction than go up in another; although it took me till last night to go KoS to Dark Reign.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just recently started the DoN progression part. I completed teir 1 lastnight and got the Gift of the Dark Reign AA. The one where your maxed unbuffed stats goes up 10 and get a free AA etc etc. Teir 2 has the Emoush(sp?) raid etc and the final result of that is 300hp/mana and teir 3 is 5 more buff slots unless im wrong.<br />
<br />
Im doing all of this w/ the Evil side. I was wondering that when you max these AA's from the said camp and then turn around and do them w/ the other camp that you could get these same AA's? So consider 600hp/600mana? Or would it null out the other camps AA's?<br />
<br />
If the latter is the case, then no use in even switching factions imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>nightjackal77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">According to what I hear...if you switch after you started...you can never go back and the AA goes away...they want you to pick one side and stick with it.<br />
