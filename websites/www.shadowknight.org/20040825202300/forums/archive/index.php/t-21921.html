<br />
What could one possibly buy with 4 million plat?  I wonder if there are any Prostitutes that play EQ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Last I checked, E'ci's economy was in the shitter anyway. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
I would say E'ci has a very bad economy. <br />
<br />
I made a toon on that server, not knowing anyone or anything killed in the newbie area awhile (Left the tutorial after getting that charm)<br />
<br />
Anyway, for an hour play time, I went to the bazaar, and made 400 plat before I was even done pricing the crap I had collected.  This struck me as strange, so I started looking up things at what I thought were normal prices... and Damn are they insane on that server!<br />
<br />
Tarew Marr and Brell both have the same Economy. <br />
But Eci was hell-o-whacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I do just fine in the E'ci economy.  Then again, I've never played on any other server so I don't have any basis for comparison.</div></div><hr />
