<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winkles</div><div class="date">11-30-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you can take them out if they get to 74 percent.  But what if they have unbuffed resists next to 300?  I saw a necro who couldn't land a lifetap on a shaman for more than like 300 at a time.  I think it was touch of mujaki or something like that.  The shaman just stood in the middle of the arena like nothing affected him.<br />
Here is how the fight went.<br />
<br />
Pet's engage shaman roots necro pet with some kind of knockback root.  <br />
<br />
Necro lifetaps shaman.  Shaman hp don't drop.<br />
<br />
Shaman pet and about 4 other wolf pet thingys go after necro.<br />
<br />
Guess necro is stunned becuase he isn't casting anything or his defensive shield thingy is up.<br />
<br />
Shaman casts quiscience. I guess in case necro gets off a spell.<br />
<br />
necro gets off a life tap.  Barely any movement in either bar of health.  necro life is dropping from the pets.<br />
<br />
Shaman nukes and nothing happens.  <br />
<br />
Lifetaps for next to nothing<br />
<br />
Shaman hits necro with some spell, i'm guessing a debuff.<br />
<br />
They exchange spells.  Lifetap does nothing shaman nukes necro to death.<br />
<br />
I thought our lifetaps were pretty much unresistable but I guess not.<br />
<br />
When did shaman get to be tough duelers?  This guy owned the arena for quite awhile and even made a 65 mage look like a clown.  The most trouble he had was from a monk who must have had insane resists as well.  Even then it wasn't even close.</div></div><hr />

The only bright side, is once ur resists are above 150 they can't land much on you except maybe a few of their dots which can wear you down but it takes a long time.  <br />
<br />
I like dispelling shamans a few times to get their heal over time in the first slot of their buffs so i can dispell it when they cast it on themselves.  Also put bobbing corpse in your first slot so you can dispell malo when they land it on ya.   Going to need burst dmg to win so when they get low go all out with BoH and just try to intterupt their castin as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Oh and bring up a pet...our pet owns shamans pets in fights just remember to lifetap the pet once u see it enrage to put it out of its missery before it eats up ur pet.</div></div><hr />

/sigh i dont know how to beat myself<br />
but debuff for sure... i know when im dueling i put crap buffs up first...but if u debuff me then my heal over time spell is gonna b in my first slot...  so yeah u could eventally where me down<br />
my shammy is higher then my sk... but the sk class is my true love<br />
and btw i have yet to lose a duel myself... im on a blue server<br />
my shammy of course has all melee skills maxed out... so pretty potent melee as well... not saying i stand a chance in melee only battle .... /grin... well not w/out my slow... and i have 1hb that procs that =)... o how i wish my sk could wield that weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynxal</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The knockback root is one of their AAs....Virulent Paralysis.  It is difficult to resist and lasts two minutes....not to mention he can re-use it every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Shammie is tough,  They have a lot of lasting power.  You can dispell his Q all day, it only costs him 200 mana to cast it again, you are only slightly annoying him until he spends another 4 seconds to cast another one.  I think it's 300HP/tick for 7 ticks with maxed AAs.  He will wear you down and eventually win....you will end up diseplling all day.  His mana pool is insane.  The second he gets you far enough away for a HT he can canna5 and turn the 1900HP into 1200 mana.  Plus his regular canna's when ever he has a few spare seconds.<br />
<br />
It's pricey for him to keep casting malos if he's trying to land slow and Blood of Saryn so if you get into a dispell game with him he can just switch to his disease debuff which is also unresistable and only 1/3 the cost, then start using his disease DoTs to annoy you and his disease based slow.<br />
<br />
His pet will own our pet if he has Q....not to mention the fact that if he has 300 unbuffed resists and the AA's you pointed out there is a good chance he has suspend minion too so he has a second pet buffed up and waiting in the wings, since he obviously has been putting his time in.<br />
<br />
If the shaman is an ogre it's worse since you can't stun him.<br />
<br />
A level 65 shammie with all his AA's will be a tough fight, even when you are only trying to get him down to 74%.</div></div><hr />

They are :)<br />
Necro's have worse lifetaps then we do, theirs is only -200 resist and ours is -500. Sometimes you can just run up to the shaman and smack him up while he is running away and you resist all his spells, but other shamans are pretty nasty. If you manage to miss on the bash at the wrong moment they heal up quickly (make sure to dispel their dot heals in time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have good resists, just melee, cast ToI whenever it pops, and dispell the fuck out of him.  Make use of your pet.  No other spells will be useful save for shadowstep and HS just in case.  <br />
<br />
I should hope he made a mage look like a clown.  Mages are terrible in high-end PvP as they have shit for resist mods on their spells.  It's basically a question of 'can you kill the mage before his pet kills you?' and the answer is usually yes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tr0lls</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I've never dueld a &quot;high end&quot; shaman, I have dueled a shaman several times that was several levels higher than me. Fights vs. shamans are usually either really fast and the sham loses, or they're not so fast, and the sham will end up winning. They can simply outlast almost any class because they can cann and heal themselves so well.<br />
<br />
Here's what I found worked well:<br />
<br />
Bash, a lot, and bash from behind. When he starts to cast a spell, get behind him, and bash him. Save your bashes for when they start to cast a spell. PCs and NPCs can't dodge/parry/block/riposte when attacked from behind, so being behind the sham when you need to bash him will prevent him from dodging.<br />
<br />
Put your pet on him, not his pet vs your pet, and try to get his pet on you, then ignore his pet and focus on beating him down.<br />
<br />
Dispelling him is a good idea, if possible.<br />
<br />
Eyepatch of plunder is nice to have. 20% more haste, and another quick buff he would have to dispell before he gets to your good ones... Not that we really have any.<br />
<br />
Good spells to use would be Touch of Innoruuk (-500), Touch of Volatis(-200), Bond of Death (-200), Blood of Hate (-100) if his resists aren't great, and maybe even try using Drain Soul (-200) because it refreshes quickly and you could cast it while waiting for the big taps to refresh. <br />
<br />
Using a jousting weapon might be a good idea, to maximize dmg in between lifetap casts. <br />
<br />
Just chaining lifetaps on a shaman, and whatever melee you do to him, it seems like you could easily get them down to that critical 74% pretty easily. It's not like they have a whole lot of HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waydol</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, what exactly is the significance of 74% hp?  Amount at which we can HT the shaman to death?  Perhaps I'm missing something obvious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elkar</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, a PvP HT can only do up to 75% of the target's max hp.</div></div><hr />
