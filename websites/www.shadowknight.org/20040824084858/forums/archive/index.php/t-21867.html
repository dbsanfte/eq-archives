No idea how this thread got to 2 pages already, pretty neat how we are capable of talking about nothing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So did anyone else see this whole &quot;Seether Feat. Amy Lee&quot; thing coming a mile and a half away?  <br />
<br />
Hell, I'll even go so far as to say I was looking forward to it.  It should be pretty obvious that the only reason Evanescence was/is popular is that Amy Lee has easily the best voice of any current female singer, possibly aside from some of the random folk singers that nobody's ever heard of and most never will...<br />
<br />
I'd say she definately fits the role of as featued vocalist by other quality bands more than as lead singer of what is at best a mediocre band whose success is based entirely around the quality of her voice...<br />
<br />
I'd just like to see whether it goes any farther than Seether, similarly to Gwen Stefani (from No Doubt) a few years ago... I'd say the role fits Amy Lee better than it fit Gwen Stefani.</div></div><hr />

And we know this is true, just by reading this post:<br />
