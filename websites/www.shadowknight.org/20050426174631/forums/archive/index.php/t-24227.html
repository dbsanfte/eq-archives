<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cronar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the evil things running fv i've noticed that tracker azrael doesn't spawn. How is one supposed to do that part of the quest?<br />
<br />
If he has been moved i have no clue where to.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ikkee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well before he was not allways up and sometimes he would take off and run back to the town. Haven't been to FV for awhile so I am not sure how they changed it, but it could be that he is running around someplace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgonbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">azreal's in the Drovarge isle entrance with other fv survivers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cronar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know that, but he doesn't run his script anymore!<br />
<br />
He is constantly in the same spot. I do notice that he &quot;changes&quot; from time to time. Occasionally when hailed you get an emote about him being odd and smelly. However regardless of his bathing habits, he is perma scowl to iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, apparently he's still broken.  Went to do my part of this quest and tracked him, but he still scowled at me.  Went to the &quot;big rock&quot; by the cliff as well to see if maybe he had spawned there and nothing  :(  I did notice that according to the posts here, his name is &quot;Tracker Azreal&quot;.  The one i found is &quot;Tracker Azeal&quot;.  Not sure if this makes some sort of a difference or if i was actually /con'ing the wrong person, but reguardless, no other &quot;Tracker&quot; anything was coming up.  /Petition sent, we'll see what they have to say in their silly lil patronizing language  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jazzii Thos`Deitius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, as of March 24th, he still appears to be broken. The walkthrough I have says that there could be 2 spawns... one will be scowls, and the other indifferent. The only one I've found is dubious... and in Iksar illusion, he is indifferent. I give him the coin, and he says the text he's supposed to, but Hero Goxnok doesn't spawn, preventing me from continuing to the drachnid spy...<br />
<br />
I've petitioned, but yet to get an answer ... has anyone gotten any info about whether it's fixed, or broken, or whatever?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still broken.....see http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=635</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">more than likely, you'll get 2 types of comebacks, 1 will tell you to ASK yer fellow player or 2 they will acutally respond with an answer, i'm compelled to believe that you'll get my first option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jazzii Thos`Deitius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, when I called SoE - I ended up talking to Tech Support - and they pulled up some information (or whatever they do) and informed me the same as it shows on the SoE boards. The quest is broken, Tracker wasn't spawning at all, which was fixed, but now he despawns on turn-in. They submitted my *petition* and as far as I know, the link from the SoE boards is up-to-date, as far as them trying to find a fix for it.<br />
<br />
Although, it baffles me how they can say it's hard to fix an &quot;older&quot; quest, to make him work properly, when they can - almost spur of the moment - enter fableds and other short-term npc's into the game, and make them work just fine. I guess that's why *they* have the job, and not me ... we'll see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I swear to fucking god if I dont get a response to my petition (waiting now) and get either the two mobs spawned,or the two drops I'm done. SOE can fuck them'selves. You'll see me at PlayerAuctions.com after that. With EQ2 sucking balls their time is almost done.</div></div><hr />
