<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meowbot Killdozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally got my epic tonight and as a result I decided to share with everyone the story of my epic &quot;adventure&quot; if you will. And hey maybe someone finds out something they didn't know about the quest.<br />
<br />
Warning: This story is really long, not interesting, and might bore the shit out of you.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Your luck is probably better then mine.<br />
<br />
Beginning with Ritald, well, this part went pretty well. I made it to the NPC without dying which was a damn good start so I decided to go with it, and see if I could knock out the first pieces of epic as quick as possible. Varn went down without a problem (Shaman SK Cleric Wizard) so moved on. Went to Nightmare, got my hide pretty quick and then went to engage Wailing Sister thinking I was clever. Well, I bet I looked pretty stupid wasting peoples time at 5 AM.<br />
<br />
Few days later the urge hit me again to do some of my epic. I really thought putting it off would be the best way to get it finished, because after reading the quest details here it seemed pretty daunting. My ingenious plan after I woke up was to hit Fear, and then hit Hate and get the solo pieces out of the way. I went to Fear and after about my 10th Amygdalan I believe I had asked someone for help. They told me sure, but they were bringing an enchanter. Something I learned on this day was never ask anyone to help you in Fear unless they can fucking feign death. Wraith of Shissar and whole temple besides CT was spawned, I was pretty antsy to get this part of epic over with so I decided to start pulling, I feigned when I noticed that oh hey, the enchanter was not invisible. Her solution to this was to run straight towards the Wraith of Shissar right as I said &quot;Don't run east&quot;, I believe we had the entire temple chasing her. It was comical even though I was blamed. After about an hour in Fear, I had my eye of the dark god.<br />
<br />
Moving on, I thought seeing as how a cleric friend and wizard had offered me help I decided that the best target now would be the Murkglider Breeder. Oh, my, god. I arrived to Ruined City of Dranik and claimed the Breeder camp since it was up. Another guy from another guild zoned in and asked what was camped, I told him that Breeder was and he told me that in 10 minutes he was going to engage it if I didn't have people. Well, this was mid-day and sadly most of my guild (Probably 95%) work during the day. I was unable to get people but we worked something out and joined forces. We killed the Breeder, wiped to adds, and then rolled on the piece. He won, apparently although we had agreed that &quot;whoever wins, the other group stays until we both get it&quot; this was not the case. They left and I was stuck with 5 pretty pissed off guild members. Our solution to this was to camp the spawns until it respawned. It spawned right after the next PH luckily. I evaluated my options to see who could come to help, and sadly there wasn't all that much. People were bored of just standing around so we did the most stupid thing possible - tried to one group it. No, no, no, no, no. Do not try to one group it without having kited the adds off. We got it to 75% before I realized &quot;We're fucked&quot; and we wiped. <br />
<br />
We came back and had more people this time, the funniest thing about this whole story is that all we needed was ONE more cleric. One more cleric would have been enough to put it into the win category. Thankfully, there wasn't a single cleric available searching throughout every elemental+ guild. We decided to try it with 2 1/2 groups, we pulled a named mob and out of the blue the breeder added while fighting it. We wiped, and the loot from the named rotted. After CR people left, and I kept trying to get more people. It doesn't really seem like we wasted all that time here, but we did, it took about 6 hours from zoning into Dranik until I finally had the winning team in zone. We began clearing from the side with Breeder up above the steps near the static spawn is and pulled all mobs and then brought Breeder to camp, had ranger/druid try to kite it while enc took care of other adds if possible. This went pretty smoothly. Killed it, got my egg, shouted fuck you Murkgliders, fuck you all, and then got a TL. After I clicked yes to TL, I zoned, and took 20k damage. Karma I guess.<br />
<br />
I was pretty happy with that win, the Murkglider seemed to be a pretty hard mob to get people to come to. Few hours later I decided to get people to kill Olidan so I could have 2/3 of my pieces to get past not having my original epic. We went and killed Olidan, and he never dropped the piece. In total, I have killed Olidan 9 times, and 8 of those times were empty corpses. Was a little let down from not getting Phylactery so I looked up more of the quest and decided the best bet would be to goto Plane of Hate. I loaded up my shaman and headed there. I haven't been to hate since it has been changed. I had no map in game, and I was pretty fucking confused as to where to go. There was an SK in zone who was camping Mistress of Malevolence so I went ahead and went to camp Overlord. Little bit of info on me 2-boxing for starters I only have one PC so zone times with 2 EQ clients take about 7 minutes, and sometimes the characters disappear, or screen goes black. It's really not as fun as it sounds.<br />
<br />
Being in Hate I figured I could deal with the problems, so went looking for Overlord. About 5 minutes after my shaman died the SK shouted &quot;Essence of Hate&quot; and I asked if Mistress was soloable. I am far from being anywhere near uber, only about 8100 HP and wasn't aware of how hard these mobs were, so I was a little concerned at first. He said yes, so I was like, ok, i'll go do that instead. I let the shaman rot because seriously who gives a fuck about a froglok anyway? I went to the camp, and started killing. Wow, thank god the respawn is 30 minutes, it's not like anyone would ever camp these mobs. Eleven hours later, and 18 spawns later, she finally spawns and drops my item. Oh my god, had she not dropped my item, I probably would have cried. That camp was so dumb, and so boring. I slept a fuck lot after Murkglider/Hate camp in one sitting.<br />
<br />
The next day I try my hardest to not log in and I finally do. When I log in, I die to a mob in Muramite Proving Grounds. I don't remember exactly camping in the middle of the zone, but apparently I did. I find someone in guild to get me a res, so they res me, and I get ressed right into a named fight, and I die. So, I finally get my res, get buffed up and ask for a TL. Wizard TL's me to bloodfields, and I 20k upon arrival. I run all the way back, find a cleric to res me and she agrees to help me with killing Olidan since he was kind of the last piece I needed before I could progress further. We head there and a raid is killing the mobs, but they won't kill Olidan for me. I get a group to come help me out and right as we set up to pull the raid asks if they can help. I'd like to know WHY THE FUCK they didn't offer to kill it before I spent nearly an hour getting people? We kill Olidan, and I get my piece eventually ...<br />
<br />
Now begins the real adventure, the creme de la creme of bullshit. Oh, I thought the Murkglider was bad. Oh, I thought the Hate camp was bad. Oh, had I known what was about to take place, I would of given up already. Whenever someone uses the words &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;plains&quot; in the same sentence now I go into a catatonic trance, unable to breathe, unable to function, only to piss myself and cry. I loaded up my shaman and headed both characters to growth. About 2 hours later, when they were both finally in the same damn zone (I really should have downloaded EQPlayNice before I decided upon doing this) I began what I believed to have been &quot;something really cool&quot;. It was quite a sight to be tanking 2 Protectors and about 6 other mobs with no danger whatsoever. It was pretty fun at first. I enjoyed this camp quite a bit honestly. I didn't mind killing wolves, I didn't mind killing bears, I didn't mind killing the fucking protectors of growth. But you know what I did mind? I minded the fact that the horses never dropped SHIT.<br />
<br />
I set my alarm clock for 24 hours later.<br />
<br />
I woke up in Time to do my PoG reclearing, apparently something was wrong because there wasn't a single mob up. I went and did something else and came back a few hours later and some mobs were up so I decided to kill them, as I killed them more stuff had spawned in the meantime and things were looking up for me. The best part of this second clearing was the fact that there was almost never a fucking horse, it was always the fucking wolves, and the fucking bears, and the fucking protectors of bullshit. I hate this zone with all my heart by the time I have cleared it again and only saw about 4 horses in the time. I take the shaman hunting around the zone to find a mob, oh what a wonderful idea that was, thankfully I hadn't memmed gate in case I got in trouble!<br />
<br />
I found a horse. A beautiful white horse standing atop a hill, so elegant, so beautiful, so ready to be murdered. My instincts were to slow it, so I slowed it. This is the conversation that took place in my mind, and probably at one point or another left my lips:<br />
<br />
Horse, where do you think you are going?<br />
Horse, don't go.<br />
Horse, why are you running away from me.<br />
Horse, fuck<br />
Horse, shit<br />
<br />
A wolf hit me, so I rooted it. In my infinite wisdom I thought it'd be best to switch windows and run the SK over to the area, I start tanking a few mobs, by a few mobs I mean &quot;about 10&quot; thinking that &quot;Oh maybe it didn't train that far off, and hey look there is THREE horses hitting me.&quot; JACK-FUCKING-POT. No, this was not a jackpot, but a clever rue by some evil god damn genius to get me killed by everything in the zone. What do I do? I feign the shadow knight so all aggro can goto the shaman, brilliant move on my part. I run around the zone with 12% health on Shaman for about 10 minutes, finally when I have reached 17% health I decide &quot;This isn't going to happen, is it&quot;. My train, is huge, epic proportions, I mean, imagine every single mob in Growth from the east, sylvan protectors, thieflings, harvesters, all that crap chasing me. I notice that some of the stuff is lagging behind, and maybe, just maybe I can snare ALL of it. I snare some of it, and it's going quite well. But then the shaman gets summoned and dies ... oh yeah, snare does damage. Woops!<br />
<br />
Best part about the shaman dying? She was 0% into Level 65. Awesome. So now I am stuck at level 64 on a character whos equipment is nearly all Level 65 requirement. Luckily, on same account as my shadow knight I have a necromancer, who I switched mains about 2 months ago in fact. I head to Growth with the same recurring thought in my head &quot;Of the things I could be doing at 5 AM, this is not on top of my list.&quot; I run my necro to Growth and I res the shaman, oh the shaman takes so long to finally zone her window, that the protectors of growth have ran over, killed her, raped her corpse, and ran back to hide in the bushes from any other weary travellers. I'm so mad at this point that I decide I will exact revenge, so I kill the protectors of growth and I go galloping through the zone on my precious white steed. I find THREE horses. Now, this character is not exactly a gimp, she has 631 AA and over 5500 HP unbuffed, I decide, I will kill everything I can here. I will show Growth I AM THE BOSS. THESE CREATURES CAN NOT HURT ME. I die.<br />
<br />
I come back, I res my necro, I kill the protectors, I res my shaman. I hate seeing the shaman half naked, so I decided to go exp her in Tactics with my Necro. I spend about a whole hour there before I realize the shaman still has her AA turned on. After I switch AA off, I kill one mob, she dings 65. I stay for a bit and I log. Oh god, I never wanted to log back into EQ again. But, alas, I still do not have my BLESSED LOCK OF UNICORN HAIR.<br />
<br />
I wait 24 more hours, whee. I come back with just the shadow knight this time to see if I can just solo a few. I kill two protectors, I kill a few horses. I run around a bit looking at the zone, and then, I fall through the world. Now, if you thought my luck was pretty bad, you are right. I am running around under the world when a Protector of Growth runs towards me, I fight him under the world and it was actually pretty cool, but the best thing about the whole fight was I was unable to use my spells because my spell gems hadn't refreshed. After I killed him I camped a good couple times. But my spell gems, oh they would just not refresh. I dig through my bags and begin casting a Gate potion. &quot;You are unable to use this command at this time, please try again later.&quot; Oh, nice, so I can't cast spells, I can't use my gate potions. What the fuck can I do? I'll tell you what I can do. I can run around under the world for three entire hours, taking screenshots from different angles, watching the rain look like stars ... by this time you have probably already realized that yes, I do indeed live a very sad pathetic life. I am running around under Tunare's tree when FINALLY, THANK GOD, FINALLY, something summons me. I love you an entolling harvester! I start running back towards where I would find the horses and I see one, I kill it. My heart stops ... not only does this mob have boots of conjuration but it has a unicorn hair!<br />
<br />
I've never been so relieved, to have beaten a dead horse.<br />
<br />
I arrive in Tranquility when it dawns on me that, ah, I do not have Tailoring at 100. I do not even have Tailoring at 1. I do my research and luckily I had an enchanter bot available and find the quickest way to get my tailoring high. I get it to 140 in about 2 hours, and I succeed my combine. I probably would have killed someone the next day from my seething anger, luckily, this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Alright, so I've made it this far. Things are looking pretty good, and in fact the rest of my story is a success story. The next day I log in, get people to kill Fraga. We kill Fraga and then we kill Wailing Sister. After that I went to go kill an epic mob for a bard and we got Slicekutt killed in that time. Went to raid a bit later and then helped friend with some of their epic stuff. I got a full group available and we went and killed the gnome, the ogre, and the iksar. After that, we went and did the Paladins. Sadly though, the paladins did not drop 3 bloods the first spawn. Tarnamil spawns every 30 minutes, so this isn't a problem, and I really thank the heavens for whomever invented the new Epic system. It's really quite excellent in action being able to NOT lose all your progress, but just needing to be flagged for hail is awesome. Did about 10 more hours of hunting after this and then went to bed. Ugh, I play a lot.<br />
<br />
I got four hours of sleep and when I woke up all I could think about was GETTING this shit over with. I really wanted the quest to end, because so far it has been a stress-inducing nightmare and not really all that fun. All day long as people logged in I sent them tells asking if they could help me in my final battle. Reading the message boards here I truly believed I would need a very large raid force 30+, and someone even told me they had used 45 people to kill it. I was really stressing this fight, thinking I'd need to convince the guild to kill it during raid hours. Things worked out though. We backflagged Uqua and raid got called a few minutes early and at the time I only had 18 people in channel. By the time I arrived in Western Wastes I had 28 people, the break down for Sir Falonious Elmont was this:<br />
<br />
3 Clerics<br />
3 Warriors<br />
5 Rogues<br />
2 Rangers<br />
6 Monks<br />
3 Wizards<br />
1 Enchanter<br />
1 Shaman<br />
1 Shadow Knight<br />
1 Beastlord<br />
1 Necro<br />
1 Bard<br />
<br />
This was like bringing a rocket launcher to a punch fight. We buffed up, we pulled him, and he died. He died so fast people were disappointed it was over so quickly. I had built them up telling them I would need about 30 people and he was like a miniature version of Blazzax. You COULD one group this mob if you really wanted to with the right classes.<br />
<br />
I got my TL, and I went and did turn in and to my surprise I had gained 5 AA. One of the most satisfying things about the new epic is that it is a light source. I am probably one of the only people who care about that though. I am in love with the graphic, and the stats aren't to bad either. I finally feel like a real Shadow Knight now. I could bitch about how Reaper Strike is retarded, and how Embalming Embrace doesn't do shit if you already have Wrath of Druzzil ... but oh well, I am not as disappointed as I am relieved to have finished this quest. After seeing what some of the other classes have to do I kind of cry a little inside, but you know what? I don't think I have ever got more fucked over in a single week of playing EQ then I did doing this quest.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to anyone who completes this epic, I'm sure some of you have horror stories, and I'm sure some of you have the best luck in the world. Thanks to this community for posting good solid information on the encounters and the quest. I couldn't have asked for a cooler looking weapon.<br />
