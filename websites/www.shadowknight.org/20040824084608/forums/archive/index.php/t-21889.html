<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm playing in a pick up group for the 1st time in 15 levels and get a tell from this lvl 50 Shaman, who's in poK, on BS<br />
&quot;Your gear sucks for a level 50 SK&quot;<br />
So I respond<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, you offering to help?&quot;<br />
To which Azoquin responds<br />
&quot;No, you should just keep you're mouth shut you're only 50, quit mouthing off on the boards&quot;<br />
So me being the sweet guy I am say<br />
&quot;Um, I'm 51 but will you tell me what the name of the chip on your shoulder is?&quot;<br />
No response so I tell again...later finding out he's already put me on ignore<br />
&quot;You sir are a coward and a bully&quot;<br />
No response<br />
Finally a guildie cleric sends him a tell (he thought I was telling him), he responds that I pick on a friend of his and I should stop and I should also not be in any zone that he's in because the zones are not big enough for the two of us.  He wont tell us who he is nor who he is defending because he &quot;doesn't like to start shit&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, Azoquin, I assume you read these boards because it's the only one I have a magelo posted on for this toon.<br />
<br />
If you got a beef send me a tell, flame me here or what not, just don't flame and hide.<br />
<br />
To the rest of the board: I know I'm a sheep tackling fuck puppet.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
P.S. Kahntun that's a sig quote for you.<br />
<br />
