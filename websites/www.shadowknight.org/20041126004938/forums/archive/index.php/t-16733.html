<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thread just came up on my guild message board asking heavy tanks to post their AC/hp.  Note my guild is post NToV, Pre-VT.  Basically velious kings and all SoL mobs under EMP. (we've done seru) I'm putting up comparible raiding activity knights and wars all who are level 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
war 1<br />
Hp unbuffed = 5290<br />
No ac noted<br />
Very active raider.<br />
<br />
war 2<br />
5195 HP<br />
1281 AC<br />
Infrequent lately, formerly very active.<br />
<br />
war 3<br />
hp5378<br />
ac1269<br />
Very active raider<br />
<br />
Now for the knights<br />
<br />
Knight 1<br />
Unbuffed:<br />
HP: 4281<br />
AC: 1406<br />
Very active raider<br />
<br />
Knight 2<br />
unbuffed hp = 4361<br />
AC unstated<br />
Active raider <br />
<br />
Knight 3 (me)<br />
HP: 4511<br />
AC: 1271<br />
Very active raider<br />
<br />
Avg War HP: 5288<br />
Avg Knight HP: 4384<br />
<br />
Note: Active = attends at least 2/3 the raids<br />
Very active = misses maybe 1 raid a month<br />
Infequent= 1/2 attendance<br />
<br />
Note2: the wars in my sample are probably the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th best Wars in my guild.  The knights are definately 3 best equiped knights in guild.  <br />
<br />
Basically my point is the HP differential arguement is a non arguement Pre VT levels.  Equally equiped warriors enjoy a 900 hp advantage over knights, which equates to a 20% adavantage in HP.  The major problem is the HP margin stay relatively the same (read on FoH boards that the differential of Wars vs knights hp is about 800) but the advent of all/all 100+ hp items reduces warrior hp advantage to something that was sizible (20%) to something thats marginal (10%).  All in all HPs between knights and warriors seemingly stay very balanced up to VT level.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this analysis was to show while at the ends of the game Warriors may have an arguement about a diminished tanking advantage over knights because of small HP differential, they still enjoy a fairly massive one for almost the rest of the game.  <br />
<br />
So if you see any under VT level war whining about HP differential, tell them to STFU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LickaMahfeetz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you care to take note over what Advanced Abilities they all had pertaining to HP? Or for the differential in unbuffed stamina? Those two factors I think would be key in any comparable analysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my guild our top 3 Pal / SK have between 5800 - 6k unbuffed / 1600 - 1700 ac ish.  Our top 3 Warriors have 6700 - 7100 hp unbuffed, all over 1700 ac.  We are just starting Elementals, were in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think he mentioned somewhere saying &quot;Pre VT&quot;<br />
<br />
That is pretty accurate though, I am pre vt, and only have about 4.4-4.5k hp unbuffed, with almost 1300 sta.</div></div><hr />

Unbelievable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which AA ability do you have to obtain to get 1300 sta? I'm capped at 305, so it's gotta be pretty expensive :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All are in the 210-240 range in stam.  2 of the wars have all hp aa, the other warrior and 1st and 3rd knight have ND3/pd. Knight 2 has ND 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">would like to see raid buffed hps if you could. yah i agree though in my old guild st keyed-starting ssra when i left our good wars had like 8k hp buffed similiar gear where i had like 6.7-7k hp buffed (most active knight in dkp guild) wasn't really a factor when we exped though. Though there are exceptions heh one of my guilds frog pallies (twinked out uber guild's alt who had terrible rep so restarted) was at 8k hp in like all baazar bought gear and a TZ hammer i believe buffed heh. Though i do believe he had all hp aa's and like no mitigation avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's pretty obvious he meant AC instead of STA. Don't beat him silly over it, sheesh. Everyone makes mistakes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, 8k hp buffed with no hp aa and all bazaar gear?  I'd like to see his Magelo hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">DHantes<br />
Knights are getting to low mid 7k range, wars are pushin 8k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stryph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Warrior to knight difference in my guild is like this (Pre-VT, working on keys to emp now).<br />
<br />
Top Warrior (Not counting the elemental warrior we picked up)<br />
5800-6000hp unbuffed<br />
1400-1500ac at most times unbuffed<br />
Full hp aa's<br />
<br />
Second Warrior<br />
5600hp unbuffed<br />
1420ac unbuffed<br />
Full hp aa's<br />
<br />
Third Warrior<br />
5200hp unbuffed<br />
1467ac unbuffed<br />
Full hp aa's<br />
<br />
Top Knight<br />
4880hp unbuffed<br />
1297ac unbuffed<br />
ND3, PD3<br />
<br />
Second Knight (Myself)<br />
4808hp unbuffed<br />
1257ac unbuffed<br />
ND3, PD3, PP2, PE<br />
<br />
Third Knight<br />
4790hp unbuffed<br />
1290ac unbuffed<br />

<br />
So as ya can see it can vary a bit, but the warriors still have a definant edge over us.</div></div><hr />
