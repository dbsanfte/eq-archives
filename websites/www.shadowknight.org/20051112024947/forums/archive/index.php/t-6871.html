<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belyle</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How ghey is it that a level 59 warrior ( i know its less than 59 ) with equivilant equipment is a Superior tank to a sk with 125 aa points.  <br />
The aa scheme should have been set up to make it possible for a knight with over 100 aa points to exceed warriors under level 60 in tanking abilities. (assuming the sk spends points in that regard)<br />
<br />
One of many complaints<br />

&quot;Even if everything was equal defensively between knights and warriors, knights dont go bezerk&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
With regen3, CA3, CS3, ND3, PE, and Double Riposte a similarly-equipped SK can't outtank the warrior with no AA?  That's not possible.  Maybe if your AA points are IM3, MC3, SCF3, steed, 2HB, super-duper HT etc...</div></div><hr />

If I have to read one more post from a retarded druid, trying to pass themselves off as a superior class who actually has an opinion, I'm gonna puke!  In fact, I'm gonna go spew right now just from reading this steaming pile of manure you call a post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synd D`nys</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AA is actually a very moderate difference in most regard, imo.  Level and gear are more important.  I assume you are 60?  Thats only one level difference.  How did your gear compare to his?  If it was equivalent, I see no major problem with the warrior being the better tank.  Warriors should be the best tank.<br />
<br />
The only reason I MT for my guild is that my gear is head and tails better then the next best equipped person.  Well that and warriors suck at holding agro.  Despire how badly our agro spells have been hit of late, we still way outclass them in that regards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buliwyk</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Careful, Synd, your post borders on an intellegent reply to a serious subject.  Shouldn't those get deleted in the Flame forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adus</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because thats the point of a warrior...not like theres a huge gap between 59 and 60 for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnod</div><div class="date">10-18-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would certainly hope a Warrior could always out tank a SK. That is their job. We have spells. They don't. We give up melee skills for those spells. They don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synd D`nys</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There actually is one huge difference between a 59 warrior and a 60 warrior.  That's the ability to taunt mobs higher then their level.  You can't do that til level 60.  We don't have the problem cause we can taunt with spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trysbrina67</div><div class="date">10-19-2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in some cases we do tank better than a warrior.  easier to maintain and acquire aggro and taps like SoD with SA3 and crits can keep us healed pretty well.  Different methods for the same job, warriors use their skills, weapons and bodies, shadowknights use a touch of finesse.  No reason to bash them or us imo.</div></div><hr />
