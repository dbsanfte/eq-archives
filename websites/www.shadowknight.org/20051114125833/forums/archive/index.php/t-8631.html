Whenever someone asked the guy something he responded as an Ogre.  ...   Hence no one could understand what the hell he was saying.  <br />
<br />
I'm like 'ok, a roleplaying Ogre... just so long as he doesn't do something stupid and cant tell anyone about it.'  Sure enough, the dumbass runs off (?) when his hp's get to about 10%, and he knows the two clerics were CH'ing.  So, with this mob chasing and beating on his ass, he runs out of range from the clerics shouting to the whole zone &quot;Meez a gonna dies causea dumbs groop!&quot;<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, we're all telling this guy to come back and not run out of range, but he said he couldn't understand us.  <br />
<br />
The moral of the story, don't roleplay.  You limit yourself from meeting intelligent people, get others killed and come acroos as a right dumbass.  <br />

Anyone who roleplays an Ogre to lvl 60 pretended to be stupid so long it's become natural. Your fault for not thinking<br />
<br />
Second, most encounters at lvl 60 require groups. Or at least, it's nicer to have a group. Roleplaying stupid in a group is bad. Your fault, again, for sticking around. (I personally roleplay the blood thirsty SK/Wizard that simply likes to kill)<br />
<br />
Third, Ogres suck. But I think him running and ending up dead is kinda funny<br />

And the ogre sucks part, please stfu. Ogre's are considered the best tank class, most hp, best toe to toe due to stun factor. Just because you probably play a fucking smurf like the 500 Inkie sk's on server gives you very little right to say any race sucks, fucking moron.</div></div><hr />

BTW, I Roleplay.<br />

Roleplay ends where grouping begins.<br />

If you get your grouped killed cuz you're rping a super noble Paladin who won't kill the glorious specimen of angelic being your group just pulled, yer a feking Idiot. You better be doing your best to keep that group alive and successful.</div></div><hr />

An Ogre of this lvl has likely more INT than a starting Erudite. So he would be smart, if not actually a genius : a character with an intelligence likely much higher than any player (an average human for reference sake).</div></div><hr />

There are few people who really RP in groups.  Usually like Jobrill said RPing ends in groups, would have to say the best RPer on luclin is a pally named Hurrin, guy wont group with SK's and never stops RPing anywhere, in groups raids etc.<br />
personally i find ogah and troll speach annoying, i mean high level trolls and ogres most likely have over 100 int, they arent dumb, and even if someone wants to RP a troll or ogre with a speech impedement, please make it understandable.  This is a team game, hard to do shit when we cant understand your fat ass.<br />
finally Trolls and Ogres suck, why you ask?  hell if i know.<br />

the guy acted dumb, so he is dumb. his text had little to do with it.<br />

fact is, its our job to die first, not run. we're badass SKs, not pansy ass pussys who run around going &quot;stop hitting me!&quot;<br />

<br />
This game is the furthest thing away from a roleplaying game that you can have and it has been that way since day 1.  The game designers did not structure over 90% of the servers to have jack shit to do with roleplaying.  They allowed any race and class to group with any other race or class.  Show me where the fuck you read that Trolls Warriors and Shadowknights and the such would ever find themselves in a group with halflings, dwarves, humans, and the such.  Show me where in literature you would find a Shadowknight that worships a god of Hate grouping or joining a guild that has people that worship gods like the Marr twins.  Or where handing 1000 bonechips to a guard suddenly makes you acceptable in a community. &quot;Don't kill him guys, he's level 60 but he gave me a thousand bonechips, so he's cool.  He can kill skellies for us even though they respawn and even though we could do it ourselves if we wanted to.&quot;  Give me a fucking break.<br />
<br />
When a server came up that put restrictions on who could group with who (Sullon Zek) and let each side openly fight each other, it grew to be the least populated server on EverQuest, except for Legends.  Wow, what a resounding victory for a so-called roleplaying game.<br />
<br />
Show me where in literature you have to sit at a spawn point and kill the same named mob over and over until it &quot;drops&quot; the needed item.  If Elric would have been an EverQuest character he would have gotten the Stormbringer sword and then waited for the Mournblade respawn and gotten that sword too.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
The game mechanics of this game have nothing to do with roleplaying.  Got your epic?  Great, so do a bunch of other Shadowknights on the server.  So much for epic.  Got the coveted Greenmist?  Welcome to the club-- the honorblade of the Iksar and the one wielded by Rile himself can apparently be reproduced over and over.<br />
<br />
So yeah, when some idiot decides he is going to roleplay an Ogre in a game that doesn't have jack shit to do with roleplaying I think he needs to wither get with the program or go dig up some friends and go play fucking Dungeons and Dragons. Don't be fooled by thinking that just because this is labeled an MMORPG that it has something to do with roleplaying games, no matter what the talking heads that developed this game tell you.  I can spraypaint a pile of shit pink and tell you that it is good to eat but it doesn't change the fact that it is nothing but a steaming pile of shit.<br />
<br />
Roleplaying doesn't mean you sit around and talk like a fucking idiot or that you run around speaking in ancient English and say &quot;thee&quot;, &quot;thou&quot;, or &quot;thine&quot;.  Roleplaying also means that the actions of the character are also in line with what he or she would do and the minute that you see trolls and dwarves all running around in the same group or the same guild without any kind of restraint from the game engine is the moment that you realize that this game is not a roleplaying game.<br />
<br />
So fuck off with this shit about &quot;roleplayers made this game&quot;.  You are so fucking full of shit that it's turning your eyes brown.  What made this game are people figuring out how to play their classes correctly and in groups.  Guilds that penetrated and defeated the planes and the such were not concerned with roleplaying.  They were concerned with maximing the abilities of their characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now stop misconstruing what i type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adikt</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Lejina,  I roleplay my  Ogre SK but like she said Ogre SK's have higher Int than some of the other &quot;smart&quot; races have so my roleplaying does not consist of talking like a moron it is in how my character behaves, gungho and ready  to hand out death at the drop of a hat, cocky and brash, ready for a fight anytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimbad</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Toltanus, missed your meds today, huh?<br />
<br />
This is Everquest.  We can make it almost anything we want it to be.<br />
<br />
We can RP, we can be serious, competitive, level 65 with a billion AA guildraiders, we can just kill shit cause we want to, the only thing we can't do is blast things with bazookas or fly around in starships.<br />
<br />
So piss off, if the RPers wanna RP, then let them.  If they get me dead, it's my fault for letting them.  You know the type of person who will bring 4 mobs to your group, then FD and pray the chanter can mez them, cause they come back with 4 mobs in the first place.  If some RP paladin brings back &quot;the armies of Venril Sathir&quot; to your RCY group, you should wait for him to use LoH then run your arse to the zone.  You can't keep everyone alive all the time, and if they are too stupid to run when the fit hits the sham, it's their fault for dying.<br />
<br />
We all payed to play it, we are all allowed to enjoy it in our own way, so long as we don't make things miserable for the other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">STAPUFF</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started this game within weeks after beta closing, with an SK, god hummie chicks in banded looked badass back then, anyways, NOONE rp'ed, all that happened was ppl, screaming &quot;YOU KSing M-F'er!!&quot;  everywhere, across all the zones you went through, in OOC, SHOUT, etc.  That isnt roleplaying.  Believe me, I enjoy RPing, I do a pen and paper game everyother week, have been for 20 years now, this isn't even a shade of RP'ing, when you compare.  This game is about achieving goals, with others help.  Always has been, regardless of who.   Why else would they hinder the dark races so severely, atleast when the game was young, ubless they wanted trollz and ogrez to be friends with sissy halflings, etc.  An ogre gives a couple hundred bandages to a HALFLING who hates him, then the race as a whole loves him?  Or the iskar greenmist, if this was a RP game, noone but an iskar could get it.  THey dont want it a RP game, IMO they never did.<br />

They attempted to make this game a roleplaying game, No everquest isnt a roleplaying game, but alas, is it stupid to roleplay in a game that was a spin off from a role playing game?<br />
<br />
No, I think not. I myself roleplayed for a good 3 years of EQ, no one minded, and i eben tak leek diz, ad nub peepal companed, cuz mez teel do gud jub at puulin. Roleplaying ends when you get sick of trying to be something the game has shunned away.  I for one never got sick of doing it. Usually surprised people, and alot of people enjoyed it.<br />

By all fantasy measures, they're an exceptionally stupid race. Never said playing one was stupid, just the races intelligence is low. If you roleplay a stupid race, out of habit you start to think stupid. I don't much care what your Int is. Stupidity is lack of common sense. Player does NOT equal character, unless you have no life. Learn to seperate the two in my statements<br />
<br />
&quot;Roleplaying stupid in a group is bad&quot;<br />
<br />
It is. Roleplaying is fine. You wanna go hardcore, you'll play dumb. Dumb critters are unstable, therefore dangerous. Simple logic, I never said any player was stupid, just the character<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowblade</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh the ages old roleplaying debate.<br />
<br />
Everquest was an attempt at bringing a roleplaying world to online gaming, and of course with various degree's of success. Any one with 60 int can tell the damn thing is practically based on D@D. <br />
<br />
Ever played a mud? often roleplaying is enforced on these games, and it works well, and hey guess what? the only difference between everquest and these games most of the time is... there is no graphics   /gasp!<br />
<br />
Part of Roleplaying, actually everything of roleplaying is using your imagination! And acting out a role of your avatar, a role you CHOOSE to make out for it. It has nothing to do with silly game mechanics. IF you even bringing game mechanics into it, you have no idea. Stop taking things so literal!<br />
<br />
Roleplaying also has to do with freedom, if the game restricted to you only grouping with your own alignments and faction, how  boring that would be. Traditionally fantasy worlds have thrived on conflict, and the teaming up of unlikely ally's.<br />
<br />
Weis and hickman's Dragonlance saga is a prime example of this, here you have a group of often opposing classes, races and creed's working together often out of need. To even suggest that this kind of thing would never happen is extremely moronic.<br />
<br />
The most enjoyable times I ever have in this game is with other roleplayers who know how to play their classes. <br />
<br />
I often wonder why all the RP bashers ever picked up this game in the first place<br />
<br />
you want an action/hack in slash or similar kind of game maybe your in the wrong place, go back to your counter strikes and lame diablo's clone's , just please leave the Rp'ers alone. <br />
<br />
I personally will be playing everquest 2, and I will attempt begin to roleplay again ( a practise I have for the most part given up on beacause of the silly persecution that goes on in eq1).<br />
<br />
I will join a pvp exclusive server and make any non - rp'ers lives a living hell, refuse to group with them, and hunt them down with religeous fervor. this especially applies to d00d speak practitioners hehe. especially hobbits.<br />
<br />
Personally I would have found that particular incident extremely amusing. Please loosen up a little, it is just a game.<br />
<br />
sorry to be long winded and probably incomprehensible at times, but Im tired and just wanted to put in my 2 plat <br />

I'm really just complaing about this topic from a practical point of view.  If some tard wants to go play as a RPer then fine.  Just don't kill and confuse others in the process.<br />
<br />
I have been playing this game when it first hit the shelves myself, and yeah, In my opinion RPing hasn't been that common.  Cept for one guild that was all DE women, named something Maidens, I can't think of one RPing guild.  <br />

It's limiting yourself, as I stated earlier.  <br />

Nothing wrong with role-playing, I encourage all who play this game to do so with the following rules:<br />
<br />
Role-playing = Shout, Say, Emotes<br />
<br />
(You) = OOC, Group, Chat Channel, Raid<br />

<br />
If I remember right though, Samel L. Jackson's character actually had a deep meaning for using the verse and at the end of the movie he went into detail as to the meaning of it and how he saw himself in it and actually showed that it wasn't just a &quot;bad motherfucker&quot; thing to say but actually saw how he related to it and how he was &quot;trying to be the sheperd&quot;.  <br />
<br />
You, however, just decided to just stick &quot;Shadowknight&quot; instead of &quot;The Lord&quot; and reverse some of the adjectives, like putting &quot;evil&quot; instead of &quot;good&quot; and be done with it.  How motherfucking original.<br />
<br />
(It's Ezekiel 25:17 btw and the only reason I know that is from watching the movie about 30 times).<br />

And considering that the sig is 3x bigger than most of your bullshit posts, it's kinda hard to ignore the biggest part of your idiotic posts anyway.  So if you want people to look at something else other than your sig, then fucking post something meaningful instead of bullshit like &quot;Roleplayers made this game&quot; and try to fucking address the other parts of the post instead of the one that immediately pisses you off.<br />

If Pollie wants to rework that phrase from Pulp Fiction who gives a flying fuck?  Besides you obviously.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) It's the flame board and if I feel like telling Pollie what the fuck I like and don't like about that gay-ass sig, then I will.<br />
<br />
B) Your signature sucks dick too.  Try being a little more original than using some shit font from Quake 2.  Or maybe take the Pollie approach and just rip off some shit that has shit to do with Shadowknights and butcher it and use it in your sig.  The longer the better because it will detract from having to read your short-ass posts which are usually filled with idiotic shit anyway.  At least it will add meat to your posts even though it will still be idiotic meat.<br />
<br />
Here's a good one for you, from Lost in Space:<br />
<br />
Original: &quot;Evil Knows Evil.&quot;<br />
Yours can be: &quot;ShadowKnights Know Shadowknights!*&amp;!^&amp;*!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now go suck on a troll tit or whatever it is you do on Thanksgiving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the feeling you were the kid at school who was picked on and is taking vengance now on the forums behind your computer screen.  It really is attitudes like yours that is the reason the world is such a violent place.  <br />
<br />
Now, I bet your a good guy in RL, but bro, have some fucking respect.  Reading your posts is fucking depressing.  You got something to say?  tell it wth some inteligence, not with all this aggression.  You might get some respect and actaully have your comments taken seriously.  <br />
<br />
Now, I just know your gonna let loose with a string of fucks, but that's your choice.  Try to show some inteligence at least, so I know your not some 14 year old with the itchy trigger finger.</div></div><hr />

So Im guessing its okay for you to rip off (as you would likely put it) something as centeral to your character as your name. But its not acceptable to do that for a sig?<br />
<br />
This is how you spell h y p o c r i t e.<br />

Maybe one day you'll try to stop putting up the &quot;I'm on SZ, I am so hardcore&quot; attitude and be more than just a prick.<br />
<br />
Have a good day sweetheart. <br />
Hugs and kisses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When did I mention Sullon Zek?  Oh wait... in my sig.. I thought we weren't supposed to talk about people's signatures anymore..<br />
<br />
Yanno.. it's funny that people come here to the flame forum and actually expect some kind of civil conversation.  It's called a flame board, but I suppose people are just using it for a &quot;rant and bitch at things in general&quot; board.<br />
<br />
Here's a flame (in my opinion):<br />
<br />
Fenrix, what the fuck did you smoke lately to make you think that I either care about your moronic opinion about my posts or that I actually want your pity?  Pity from an assmunch like you would be like like the local bums telling me that I drive a shitty car.  They might think it's shitty, but it's still a fucking Z4 and they are still fucking bums.<br />
<br />
As for me and my attitude, I don't need to play on Sullon Zek to justify any of it.  I never said a fucking word about my server nor that it was any better or any worse than others.  In fact, the only place I mention it is in my fucking signature, and you have no room to talk about anyone's signature considering the unoriginal piece of shit signature that you have chosen to use to pollute the board with every idiotic post that you make.  Do yourself a favor and get a bit more of an original font because yours is about as overused as your mother's ass in an assfisting contest.<br />
<br />
(end of flame).<br />
<br />
There.  That's not the greatest nor the worst, but it catches the spirit and frankly I get bored enough at work sometimes that I can take 5 mins. and post a decent flame now and then.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the old flame wars in the BBS days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenrix</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought we weren't supposed to talk about people's signatures anymore.. <br />
<br />
Wow not only are you an ass, you're a hypocrite as well!<br />
Did I push some of your buttons and get your peepee in a knot to get such attention? <br />
<br />
/blush I feel so loved &lt;3 <br />
<br />
Lol my font is unoriginal.<br />
Wow, how long did you have to take to come up with that one? Perhaps I can make my own fonts! Golly gee whiz I might make Skurrge happy! Hahaha.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for your idea of a flame, you refer to my mother. Surely you can do better than that....I mean you are at work so you only have limited time to post, I can understand that, sure thing matey. :)<br />
<br />
Yanno.. it's funny that people come here to the flame forum and actually expect some kind of civil conversation <br />
Who's looking for civil conversation? <br />
Oh wait, I'm sorry :) <br />
I forgot it's not a flame if it doesn't contain about 30 different profanities and references to &quot;your mother is a whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, let me try this in a language you might understand mmkay? :)<br />
<br />
You sir are a fuckwit to the highest degree. It's not enough that you spew total bullshit, but you're also a general fucking wanker, that from what I surmise here, noone likes.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that nemesis hit the fucking mark. You are a fucking nerd, that got his ass consistently kicked by even the other nerds at school, and now that you don't have to stand up and take a fist in the face, you're a certifiable badass not to be fucked with.<br />
Guess again sweetheart, you just sound like a fucking screwhead that has a superiority complex.<br />
<br />
How about next time you attempt to make any fucking sense, you write your &quot;flame&quot; in Word, email it home (where you will have time to proof read), revise it to include something that's more of a flame than &quot;your mother takes fist in the ass&quot;, then post it and maybe.....JUST maybe, you might be given more respect than the lump of cunt you are.<br />
<br />
Go change your fucking diapers, you're really starting to make my eyes water.<br />
<br />
Wow, sorry that was so long, was quite alot more than I intended, but wanted to try and make it understandable for Skurrge.<br />
<br />
Luve ya sweetie! :) &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Hmmm.. not to be picky, but it seems that there are about 100 other people who have a sig that lists their name, Race, Class and server... but I could be wrong. I guess that is unoriginal too, hmm?<br />
<br />
And yes, I know my sig has that same unoriginalness...</div></div><hr />
