You can see the fire particles comming from the eyes on the hilt, and the black &quot;cloud&quot; that surrounds the blade. pretty fuckign weak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>pogge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe if there were more particles . u can barly notice them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">too many particles would make it look it something out of a carnival. That looks alright i suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Paly sword is a sword that glows whoopti fucking do. How many swords in the game do you see that look even remotely like ours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>pogge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no, i agree ours is fuckign sick .. but i wish the paticles were better .. like a little thicker cloud ..with like flys or somethign buzzing around in it.. that would be leet, and maybee some green puss or something dripping a little off the blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Layotees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Except it's a sword of Innoruuk, you know, hate, not a sword of Bertoxxulos...<br />

What they need are class/deity specific epics.  Now THAT would cause some rioting in the streets.</div></div><hr />

It could have been a gigantic pulsating cock with ball grip handle that dripped cum from the head.<br />

At least we have a bad ass butter knife.</div></div><hr />

How gay is THAT!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Our particles are definately subtle.  You have all the bells and whistles, vertex shaders and shit, turned on?  And is it possible to get a screenshot in a zone that would create more contrast as the backdrop?  I know jack and shit about emulators.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't they learn from the oh so very small green drip on the rogue 1.0 epic that subtle just doesn't work in a cartoon world?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">when you look at the origional pic they posted on the eqlive site the blade was &quot;supposed&quot; to have small flames on the actual blade. im kinda dissapointed they didnt keep that. this looks kinda lame, the concept art looked very evil.<br />
infact based on what i see it kinda makes no sense why the blade has that cloud over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How about getting the guy who's making the SShot to drop the fucking range particle item so there isn't a glowing blue ball behind it?<br />
<br />
I like how it's subtle, besides, particles off kthx. <br />
<br />
Does it trail when its swung?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lukeren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think it looks cool.<br />
<br />
I don't want a big lightsaber to wave around, let the gay pallies have that :D<br />
I want an evil sword, and what we got there looks like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like it, could use a bit more of the black smog surrounding it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i'd like purple flame on the edge of the blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ezele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like the way they did it, paladin epic seems all to unoriginal to me.  Even though it is a tad subdule with particles and could use a little more, more is not always better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">our first didnt have a really noticable partice effect and look at paladins first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad you can't toggle the graphic to look like 1.0  =p<br />
<br />
The only thing that looks epic at all is the hilt.  I do like the hilt.  But the blade... Man.<br />
<br />
The face in the hilt should be facing forward with a massive blade coming out of it.  Sick of all this puny ass arsenal.  I can see the paladins being lean, sleek and elegant.  But we should get something massive, intimidating and scary.  I don't know about you guys, but I use swords to fight, not cut bagels.<br />
<br />
(And what's with the baleen?  Seriously...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was wondering that myself.<br />
Probably their attempt at making it appear as a serrated edge or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Personally id be very happy with a direct rip-off of the legendary Soul-Edge blade from soul calibur on the dreamcast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zenlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">More floating skulls please.<br />
i 100% agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>nezzka is sexy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">its to small and skinny anyways, but hey, if i want something big to look at, I just look at my HUGE, HUGE penis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">While your at it post all the epic 2.0 pics I'd like to see them all<br />
<br />
I don't like anything about the looks of our epic 1.5 or 2.0.  A crappy jagged curved blade with a croked head on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also jagged edges on the inside of the blade? and the outside the jagged edges seem to go backwards? wtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">you guys worry too much  :cool: <br />
<br />
I actually like our epic, the floating skulls would make it perfect but even so I prefer it over the pally one that looks like a crossbreed btwn fine steel longsword and frodo's poker...<br />
<br />
omgz hlep!!! orcs nearby :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I didn't like the concept art version of the sword, and i didn't like the in-game version either. It all begins with the concept art, the 3D artists just apply the concept design. I am pretty sure SOE rushed with the epics and they just fekked up otherwise all the epics would've been ready months and months ago before the release of the OOW. But they were finished only days ago. It is also pretty obvious that the concept designers have spent more effort on some epics than others (ie. Necro vs Mage) which i believe was one of the side effect of the time shortage. Is it really possible to make a design that 99% of the community like and accept ? I believe it is, but it is a matter of time, effort and money spent on it.<br />

My 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">beside that is just an emulater they mayadd more particle etc .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is hilarious,  I dont think there is anything you could ever do that would get 99% acceptance, EVER.<br />
<br />
<br />
60% i considered very good, 75% a run away hit,  99%? is just unrealistic no matter time, money and effort.</div></div><hr />
