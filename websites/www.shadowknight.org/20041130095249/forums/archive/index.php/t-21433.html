We don't know lots about the class except skill that we have no idea what they do, and a few spells...but new SK looks interesting.</div></div><hr />

When since has being a shadowknight meant running away from a fight like some pussy druid. and why the hell would we want to save anyone other than our selves if we did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Profett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Uhm, probably because EQ is not a game where you roleplay?<br />
You would want to run away from the fight and save your group if you were in risk of wiping and having an hour long corpse run in the bottom of some crappy dungeon.  *sigh* Idiot</div></div><hr />

Well, my personal RP/practical explanation is this. I would consider the main deity of the Shadowknights to be Innoruuk. The Price of Hate, yet I have also heard him called the &quot;Lord of Lies&quot;, due to his rogueish nature at times.<br />
<br />
In other words, Shadowknights are brave, but we're also not stupid. Think about an FD split. Does it make us a &quot;pussy&quot; to have the ability to Feign Death and split mobs so we get only one? No it makes us intelligent. Being a good combatant doesn't simply mean &quot;Step 1: Run in, Step 2: Stab it a lot&quot;. It's about knowing what to do, when to do it, and knowing when you are outmatched, and maybe need to take a step back and rethink your tactics.<br />
<br />
In other words: It fits shadowknights personally, if you actually think about the logistics of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well In the end I have no real problems with it. But if we are getting this ability instead of Fiegn death. Which wouldnt surprize me, Id be totally pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tirsada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now that the NDA has been lifted, I can reply to this thread.<br />
<br />
We have Feign Death.  It is an ability called Graven Embrace, received at Level 21.  It is targettable, can use on anyone in your group.  5 minute reuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">while a nice utility it never got druids and wizards groups<br />

You obviously didnt play in the same LGuk, SolB, Sebilis, Chardok and Howling Stones i've been playing in.</div></div><hr />

Wow, look who the fucking moron is.  If you had half a fucking brain in your head you'd be able to figure that calling something by a name does not make it what ever you call it.  Take this example:<br />
<br />
I ram a cucumber down your throat and tell you it is an apple.  You think &quot;no that's a cucumber&quot; as you choke to death, and guess what?  You're right!  <br />
<br />
Just because some fucktard at SoE decided to make a game with levels and stats that looked vaguely like D&amp;D online does not mean that EQ is an RPG.  No, an RPG is a game where people role play.  Imagine that!  Now, how many people role play in EQ?  That's right: sweet fuck all.  So, no, don't think, don't try reason for yourself you cum guzzling little whore, you just blindly follow what the big corporate tell you is the truth like a good little drone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get over yourself. he got all fired up and called me an idiot without real reason. So you expect me too bow down and take that? umm no ...... <br />
<br />
Actually alot of people roleplay in EQ, just because the majority of people dont, does not mean it isnt a roleplaying game. Cause it is. Its the un-imaginative mentality of the majority of the playerbase which changes that.<br />
<br />
It's the same situation if a bunch of FPS players started gathering around and roleplaying out battles. Not very likely but if they did Does this change the fact that the game is a first person shooter? Nope, and the reverse is true in this situation..<br />

Very amusing. With a mentallity like that sounds like your far more brainwashed than I am. Maybe you should take your own advice...<br />

I still have no idea why these people play these sorts of games. What do they get out of them?<br />

But this is a age old debate, which goes no where so just fuck up and get back too the scheduled thread .......<br />

People do roleplay in FPS games on occasion ... and if they do then they are role playing ... so they are playing a role playing game.  The fundamental problem here is that you are simply too fucking dumb to understand what an RPG is and is not.<br />

Here you are showing just how small minded you are, well done.  Because you can't understand why someone enjoys something it somehow does not count.  For fuck's sake, open your mind and start thinking for yourself.<br />

It's not an age old debate, it's a stupid statement thrown out by rejects like yourself &quot;it's called blah so it must be blah&quot;.  Whatever; yeah, go back to your blinkered view of the world which seems to consist entirely of the inside of your rectum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Group evac is an awesome spell to add to ours. In a role playing aspect its a way of fading into the shadows and cheating death. Why would you want to save your group?? So you can use them to get more xp! Dont think of it as helping them, but helping yourself!! It also opens up new opportunities to make friends. Why do shadowknights need friends? Why to have connections in all the high lvl guilds of course. I admit having spies in clans are a bit rougish but its all clever and evilness all the less...right? *this is where you nod your head obediently* Roleplaying or not, this spell has very usual aspects to integrate into the shadowknight. In non roleplaying term, remember getting STUCK IN THE WALL/FLOOR/CEILING?!?!?!, dont quote me on this but imagine being able to do your own port out of that spot...It isn't a gate to zones miles away but if it avoids that 2+ hour gm response and your saying no to that...to sum it all up. Evac= more xp, getting unstuck from under the world (maybe), more friends to corrupt, and less deaths... I know whats best for you...If you say no to this... I will personally infuse the wrath of innoruuk upon your ass elacerating it to dust...Then i'll piss all over it!  ;)</div></div><hr />

You are seriously taking the position that EQ is not an RPG simply because someone calls it that, in this argument? How rather offbase. Then you further the obnoxious whine that is your point-of-view by stating something like &quot;Just because some fucktard at SoE decided to make a game with levels and stats that looked vaguely like D&amp;D online does not mean that EQ is an RPG.&quot; <br />
<br />
First off, the title MMORPG is more of a notifier that not only should the game encourage roleplaying as one of its main drives than people simply &quot;calling&quot; it an RPG. <br />
<br />
Secondly, Everquest *IS* an RPG, as it is basically the same structurally as every other RPG ever created.  &quot;RPG&quot; itself being a title granted to games is taking the term too literally. If you define it as simply &quot;a game in which you roleplay&quot; you could apply that to Mike Tyson's Punchout or Robotron. <br />
<br />
This labelling only justifies people referring to its proclivity towards fostering &quot;roleplaying&quot; as it was indeed labelled an RPG. It isn't as though I sold a DVD of me shitting on your mom's chest on eBay claiming it to be an RPG. Since it was labelled exactly what it is, it only makes sense that someone points out that they did in fact plan for EQ to be an RPG, it was no accident.<br />
<br />
In short, please stop. Semantic fights are like two retards fighting over the same chicken nugget that fell in the toilet. If it gets to that point, just flush and find something else to eat.<br />
<br />
The original statement...<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, probably because EQ is not a game where you roleplay?<br />
You would want to run away from the fight and save your group if you were in risk of wiping and having an hour long corpse run in the bottom of some crappy dungeon. *sigh* Idiot&quot;<br />
<br />
... is fallacious (not fellatious, no matter how much you want it to be) since you do in fact &quot;play a role&quot; in the game. People confuse the boundaries and limitations of what you can and can't do in a game with it being a true &quot;roleplaying&quot; experience. Just because you are limited by how you can play roles, IE, you can't be a healing shadowknight and meet much success, doesn't disqualify it from the basic offering that you can do what they let you do and roleplay THAT character.<br />
<br />
So, when someone states that &quot;Shadowknights aren't pussies who run away&quot; they are making a value judgement based on the roleplaying experience granted in the ruleset or ability set of a shadowknight. <br />
<br />
Contrary to this is the idea that any ability can be given to any character and spun into a relevant flavoring, but remember that for a truly rich roleplaying experience there would have to be definite class distinction. People don't &quot;fall for it&quot; when classes do the same exact thing with different icons and tailored spell names, or do things that have been gussied up in the decoration relevant to the classes. <br />
<br />
Sure, you could roleplay a shadowknight that complete heals that's called Dark Spirit Impulse Scary Blast Fuckcock but that doesn't mean it's truly relevant to the class or their abilityset.<br />
<br />
I personally think that a shadowknight with a group evacuation is cludgy at best, and less definitive than an ability might be that does something similar. It seems like an ability that would be a better fit for a different class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh...stop arguing both of you (feels like a teacher settling a fight). Settle down and go get a cold one or kill some paladins (halflings are good too!!)  :rolleyes: . A game like this with so many people with different ideals cant always agree no shit. If you want to roleplay then roleplay, if you dont want to then dont!...Dont F'ing argue about something stupid as this. Reminds me of elementary school, I say I like red and a girl says no red is a girl color your gay!!...I'm like what about the red power ranger!!! bitch always arranged the cards so she would win in candy land...everyones like wow your good...i'm like you guys are stupid wonder why she always gets the board game first and ALWAYS gets the same card that makes her win and chooses who goes first? Then everyone thought I was &quot;mean&quot;  :mad: ...but the 3 ugly who were mean to me asked randomly who would be the ex, gf, and wife? I HAD to choose or they would all tackle and kiss me...the prettiest one was the one with a mustache...in 1st grade!...hah...My pointless story is to prove that this argument is pointless... dont try to force your ideals on each other.<br />
<br />
Edit: Whats this about cucumbers, apples and masturbating nerds?...Keep that shit off the boards thats offending... It doesn't define my shadowknight as the one who goes around murdering people and eating them...  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont jump the fucking gun ass monkey. <br />
<br />
Simply because every person Ive ever seen take your side of this argument always comes up with the same tired and cliche'd points, which simply have no merit. Its really getting old I feel like Im listening to a fucking broken record everytime I here this shit. Which doesnt even make sense. Considering the only thing you need to roleplay in any game is IMAGINATION regardless of the tools your given. this viewpoint is moronic at best.<br />
<br />
In the end this has absolutely nothing too do with roleplaying at all. Group evac is just an extremely retarded ability for a TANK CLASS too have IMO if you agree or not doesnt fucking matter. Roleplaying doesnt even enter the equation.<br />
<br />
So bend over and take another round from Uncle Sam. and keep telling yourself you think for yourself and are so superior as you bite down on the pillow. bitch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Validation of your belief is that it's retarded due to roleplaying considerations, IE, what &quot;role&quot; a tank class &quot;plays.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your opinion is that it is retarded for a tank to play the role of the evaccer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ummm yeah pretty much  :p <br />
<br />
also right or wrong doesnt matter its my opinion and thats all these message boards are really about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Opinions are like assholes: and so are you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Harmin Tutch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hate to break it to ya, but as soon as you pick up a computer game of any kind you are basically role playing. Are you really any of the things you play in any game ? Nope. <br />
<br />
Shadowknight is the role and you are playing one. Simple as that. RPG doesn't have to mean you talk like an ogre, or develope an obsesive hate for halflings, it just means you are not being yourself, tho with the amount of crap spewing from your gob I wouldn't be surprised if you are indeed running around weilding a sword.<br />
<br />
As for the spell lines they just dont conform to the original eq , and so what, it was hardly a viable thing that ogres can hide in Eq now was it, or that barbarians can sneek if they are rogues. I would like to see more thought about the race limitations rather than the spells. Figure that with wisdom you should be able to learn skills , so casting a spell is a learned ability. Then theoretically you have the ability to learn any spell and for whatever reason SK's now learn the new spell set.<br />
<br />
However try to convince me that a fooking great ogre can hide just because he is an SK is BS. Same as a gnome is able to take the same pounding as larger classes. Race limitations should play a much larger part IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CursedBlue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Eh...great more masturbating monkeys with cucumbers up their ass...and I think they have guns too?... This argument isn't gonna work nobody is gonna back down now after all the trash has been talked, just play the way you want and lets all shake hands...umm nm bad idea... :confused: <br />
<br />
    Shadowknight evac is GOOD because tanks know best on when to evac or not. A trigger happy wizard evacing making me lose my room and uber rare item i've been camping for hours probably knew shit on what was going on. He just sees hp going down and a few mobs... EVAC EVAC!!! -_-;     ...Its either that or i'm like EVAC NOW!!!...they are like you will be fine...*2 seconds later i'm dead and group wipes in 7*...nice one, lvl 65 newbs  :mad: .<br />
basically tanks know best about the situation and it makes sense for us to make the call...its our asses on the line and we know when were gonna die... I dont trust that trigger happy gnome wiz as far as i'd punt him...I wonder if there will be halfling wizards??...umm nm  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
