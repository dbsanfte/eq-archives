I have not seen any posts from our correpondant yet and I was wondering if we would see some soon?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last time I checked Slein was not the class correspondant unless I missed something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think anytime we post here and Brael reads it, that would be corresponding. Why start another thread on the same issues; just to have a formal correspondance with Brael?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Howlitoezis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dear Brael,<br />
I would like my innate 50% melee mitigation, 45% di mitigation disc, auto double attack riposte disc and 400% HP increase AA's implemented ASAP.<br />
Please be sure to remove WAR usage of all 2handers from the game as well.<br />
Please dont forget to raise our ATK cap to 555, and to implement our new pet &quot;crag beast queen&quot; as well.<br />
I am looking forward to our new nuke &quot;spear of ungodly annhiliation&quot; -900 DR 4000 DD 200 mana cost 0 recast time nuke. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Howlitoezis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My top 10 list<br />
<br />
1) Have self Imbued procs take precendent over Weapon and augment procs<br />
<br />
2) Improve defensive skills to 10 points below warriors (dodge to 165 from 155, parry to 220 from 205, riposte from 200 to 215)<br />
<br />
3) Move 1 weapon skill ( that each individual gets to choose ) to 240. Still 10 points below warriors.<br />
<br />
4) Move Bash skill to 230. Again, 10 points below warriors.<br />
<br />
5) Have our auras also debuff mob while they increase our skills<br />
<br />
6) Increase our channeling focus (since we need to cast while getting beat upon)<br />
<br />
7) AA to increase soul abrasion, casting fury, and theft of life one level<br />
<br />
8)  Defensive ability (My idea…Knights Endurance….20% of all damage taken is absorbed by the endurance bar. So if you are hit by 1000 points, 800 comes off your life bar and 200 comes off your endurance. The discipline lasts 30 seconds or until your endurance is gone, whichever comes first.<br />
<br />
9) Add something to our terror spells. Make them do something besides increase hate…cripple, damage, anything…<br />
<br />
10) Ok, some will shoot me …I want a slow / haste tap. Level 40 = 10 % slow / haste, Level 50 = 20% slow/ haste, Level 60 = 30% slow / haste, duration = 120 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last time I checked Slein was not the class correspondant unless I missed something<br />
<br />
Does that make the information less valid? Did it make that information go away? Just because Breal has the tag, does not mean he has to do it all himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont think the correspondent is about fixing us right away.  Its more so they can say &quot;hey, does this look good?&quot;  And now we have someone who can relpy ... &quot;look good for what? why are you even bothering with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont expect the correspondent to bring about changes fast.  But expect the changes brought around to be more relevant to the needs eventually, once they get on the same page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Everytime they ask if something looks good reply with your answer and tack on, oh and by the way increase our skill caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Increasing our skill caps wont fix us.  Would be nice, but there are more important things that need focused on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flanders</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dear Brael: Tell Sony, I would like to be a tank again thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Neric Ikolis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not a fix just a long overdue up if you ask me.  Doubt there's any coding problems that would result in upping our skills a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Only problem I see with raising skill caps, is I would be afraid it would be viewed as a balancing &quot;fix&quot;.  More like overdue fixes.  Except for probably channeling skillcap.  That would be a move towards balance, other than the fact it is another fix that is way overdue.  But shouldnt count against us on whatever they decide to do as far as balance goes.  Dont need fixes held over our head, when we ask for balance, for them to reply &quot;but we incresed your weapon skill caps, your are almost balanced now&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grumoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My correspondence to Brael...<br />

<br />
please tell Brenlo Fagetcocklover that I think he's a jackoff and I want to fight him...  tell him to meet me in the vacant lot behind the dairy queen this saturday night and we will see how much of a man he really is.  We can fight with knife, stick or bare hand-- I'll even let him choose the weapon.<br />

<br />
Weapon skill Specialization (basically what you are asking for) would limit the SK to one weapon type and I just don't trust the itemization enough<br />
<br />
Terrors need to be fixed, but I don't want damage (would break mezz), I don't want to become a debuff whore, I want to be a tank (in crappy gear ;) )  Scale the agro generated properly and I'm happy.<br />
<br />
Slow/haste idea I just don't understand the appeal of<br />
<br />
Only the knight's endurance fixes tanking issues of what you've suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The top 2 SK's (Brael/SJ)that desired to be a correspondent knew exactly what the SK needs. I really don't think we need to do another top 10 list, what we want list, or anything relating to class balance. All the info is there and Brael has a damn great grasp of what SK's need. <br />
Plus, he's a correspondent, not a dev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">wrong.  not every SK plays the same, and some have differant wants and needs.  Some like pulling... some like being DPS.. some like tanking.<br />
<br />
i feel everyone should have a strong say in what is to become of the shadowknight, not just two Super geared raid SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You don't need a top 10 list.  The reason you haven't seen me make a post asking for stuff is because it's not necessary.  They're working on the top 10 lists and are redoing class definitions, based on those (when they're out) they'll fix whats needed with the classes while adhereing to the vision err... definition.  Now, if you want to post what you would like to see the SK defined as feel free although I wasn't planning on posting that and asking to see what people felt until monday.</div></div><hr />

Harm touch showing its up when i log in, but not firing cuz timer is bugged, really dislike that (anyone else have this problem?)</div></div><hr />

Its not even close to defensive.  If it doesnt scale with content its a bad fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Visvires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Agreed, was impulsive. I liked the idea of endurance being used as a type of &quot;shield&quot;<br />
<br />
Just throwing out different ideas without saying &quot;Give us defensive&quot;<br />
<br />
Your point about it not scaling is quite valid though, and taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Redoing class definitions should be significant in understanding what they think the class is, and should provide a starting point. This will be interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure Brael has a good grasp of what needs fixing.  I'm equally sure that he is passionate enough about this class to not sit around and wait for the devs to come to him.  <br />
<br />
Besides...he just started, give him some time.</div></div><hr />

I can see this is gonna get really retarded for the next while.<br />
<br />
Fuck people, let the guy correspond some before you all chime in with the wish lists.<br />
<br />
Not like this means everything, or even ANYTHING is about to get fixed, it just means they appear to be interested in getting some player input before they change things around.<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone will have a chance to post what their ideal of a shadowknight fix is soon (rolls eyes).  Like we haven't been doing that here for months...<br />

<br />
I couldn't disagree more, Brael.  We need another Top 10 List.  I just watched the E! Channel and VH1.   It appears that all respectable Top 10 Lists have either Tom Cruise or the Olsen Twins in them.  Please add the Olsen Twins, I want SOE to take us seriously. (Plus, I like 18-year old girls!)</div></div><hr />
