<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sure people are aware of the recent statement from SOE about their intentions to address the disparity in power levels between casters and melee. I am not certain they mean purely in terms of DPS, but also in terms of survivability and utility.<br />
As PoP stands at the moment, there are only three melee classes capable of soloing, and only twp can solo effectively. We can solo with an inefficient form of kiting and a lot of patience, Rangers can solo with AM3 and Trueshot etc, and Beastlords's can solo fairly well in the lower tiers I think.<br />
As far as I am aware there are no other melee classes or hybrids capable of doing this. Paladins, Warriors, Monks and Rogues are purely group reliant really, as are we if we want effective exp.<br />
All casters, with the exception of clerics, can solo fairly easily in PoP. Druids, Wizards, Shaman, Necromancer's, Mages and Enchanters can all solo pretty effectively, and they put out greater DPS in most cases than the melee.<br />
Anyone got ideas on how they should go about this? Utility wise I think we are fine, but will we see more DPS or more ability for solo. Do you think they will balance melee classes seperately or just make an across-the-board change?<br />
Personally I have no idea on how they will &quot;balance&quot; us. I would like to see an increase in melee skills, particularly offensive and 2 hand weapon skills, but I worry about a nerf bat :/<br />
What I do hope is that they do not make it an AA change. I do not think classes should be balanced by AA as that only addresses the top percentage of the player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Soloing is only an issue because warriors can't do it and are hard up for groups more frequently nowadays.<br />
<br />
They are useful in post tier3 exp zones and raids, but that's it. [level x] sknight vs [level x] warrior, with a competent cleric, the sknight ought to get chosen over the warrior hands down. Aggro, DDamage, group buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
They honestly just need to leave every other class alone and boost warriors aggro a ton and tweak other aspects of the warrior class so that they're more attractive in pre tier-3 and nonraid situations.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, it's sad/funny to watch a warrior walk up to a mezzed mob, pause &amp; scratch his head trying to figure out how he is going to build aggro from it, then shrug and hit autoattack only to have the mob chew on mezzer. Then, because the shammy had to wait for slowing, the chanter either dies or the warrior takes a huge topping off of health... etc.<br />
<br />
It slows EXPing down, it is dangerous... fix plz so that everyone can be happy again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just read a post on the Steel Warrior page that was linked into the Emarr boards that stated that....<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights have to much DPS.....something needs to be done about this&quot;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know what knights that person has been looking at but I know damn well warriors out damage me hands down.  I also would like to see our offensive skill increase and possibly our weapon cap raised to 235 or 240.  So that when Im maxed out on str and ranger buffed my attk will acctualy break 1150.  <br />
<br />
I honestly dont think it will happen, but it would be nice...for god sake my Monk and BST have more attack at lvl 52.  I know they are pure damage class's, but still there is a 10 level difference here.<br />
<br />
Oh well...dreams</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kumadenie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the difficulties with this is that one would want to increase the effectiveness of melee at certain phases of the game and not at other phases.<br />
<br />
So an across the board increase would unbalance all the non-PoP zones.<br />
<br />
One solution they mentioned was adding better weapons to the game.  IMO, this solution has the same problem of trivializing all non-PoP content.  Not to mention further destroys the value of acquiring weapons in non-PoP areas.<br />
<br />
A non-twink caster can still be happy to acquire a CCS or Crystalline Robe from Crystal Caverns, but no-one gives a damn about the Messenger of the Queen.  (Not to mention our epic)<br />
<br />
So, I agree melee need some help.  But, I really think they have to come in the form of AA.<br />
<br />
Natural Haste Archtype (10% / 20% / 30%) and the raising of haste cap might work out well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...and all class combos that can't solo can Duo with a soloing-able class for better exp.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but Necro abilities to level/solo in this game are so completely jacked up it's not worth the time to complain or wonder about it. If you do a level by level comparison, it's so ridiculously disproportionate. Oh, I'm sorry, they slowed down CoD solo AA from 1 every 15 mins to 1 every 25 mins. Nevermind.</div></div><hr />

Exactly why do melee need help? I fail to see how rangers, rogues, monks, and shadowknights need any boosting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know how to say it without sounding insulting, but you're gimp if a warrior is outdamaging you... especially a 62war vs. a 62sknight. Are you insane?<br />
<br />
You can't just say Melee vs. Melee.<br />
<br />
You have to include pet damage, dot damage, spear damage, proc damage + self casted proc damage...<br />
<br />
and consider that with nearly free upgrades you can increase the amount of damage they all do a huge amount, and consider AAs for both combat + spellcasting... if the &quot;planets are in alignment&quot; and you score a bunch of crits, consider the scales tipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's old ground Frotty - they cannot adjust warrior aggro without triviliasing 95% of old content, as well as making knights completely redundant. As it stands, warriors are the only tank choice for raids, certainly in PoP content.<br />
I was curious to see what kind of thing people felt would be done to balance melees against casters. I cannot see us getting an improvement in utility, because we don't need one. All I can see is an increase in DPS or some form of increase in ability to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55816<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons&quot;<br />
<br />
I interpret this as a response to the numerous threads on The Safehouse and MB complaining that their damage does not keep up with casters who have FT15, focus items, aa's, etc that allows them to do damage without the traditional disadvantage of going oom. For example rogues have asked for Duellist to be made their equivalent of Trueshot and for their Throwing skill to be brought up to par with Rangers (both of which seem fairly reasonable to me). Monks have asked to be able to run faster than a speeding bullet and jump tall buildings with one bound, since they are, after all, kung fu ninja masters. Or something.<br />
<br />
Note the update also talks about the very high end of the game. So some of the bonkers weapons and the mysterious melee focus effects found in Time may be part of this balancing. <br />
<br />
I think enhancing melee soloing might occur as a side-effect of opening up the xp range on pre-PoP zones so that 65's can go beat up old world mobs for a little xp. But they really only tend to make design decisions that reduce the ability to solo, i'd be very surprised if they consciously set about encouraging it as an option.<br />
<br />
Personally i think most classes are pretty well-balanced (everybody has the odd issue of course and always will) with mid-level, non-raiding warriors the only folk who really have a rough time of it. I believe giving warriors more variety in terms of their skills and abilities rather than choking them with more specialization is the best approach. As mentioned above (and every time it comes up) you can't really improve warrior aggro without potentially trivialising the game. Brik's thread has some good discussion going on about specific ideas he's suggested.</div></div><hr />
