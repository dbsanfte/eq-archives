<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Odd question, searched around but couldn't find the answer:<br />
<br />
What order does your pet equip weapons you hand it?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is this. In drunder, I used the dropped weapons, since they are lore and by the end of the day you've destroyed/let rot many, as free pet weapons. However, lets say I hand it the maul. Ok, now he has a maul, but he can dual wield, dammit! So, I hand him the axe, which is the only Diaku weapon that i know of that's both Primary and Secondary. Lo and behold, bones is now wielding two Axes.<br />
<br />
Is this a graphical bug, or is there a specific order to hand him the weapons to ensure he doesn't wind up with two axes? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have also seen that bug a lot.  the only surefire way i know to get Goner to wield the 2 weapons i want him to is to hand him both at one time, with the faster ratio weapon first.  anytime you hand him a weapon better than one he already has, he should automatically replace the offending weapon checking primary first and then secondary.  no way to insure the graphics dont get bugged though once you start replacing his weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the input, though I discovered part of the problem: Bones simply refuses to equip the maul. ::Shrugs:: No idea why...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a Grafix bug is all...   Hand him a Hammer then sepratly hand him a Dagger.. a Dagger will apper in Both hands but when he attacks you will see .. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found suspen minion, and zoning often fix the problem, and makes the weapons look how they are suposed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pinepath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pet weapon priority is just based on delay, nothing else.  Also, pets that natively dual wield won't equip two handers.  If the pet has a weapon in primary, it won't equip a primary only 2nd weapon that is slower, since that would mean swapping out the faster weapon it's already using primary. Similarly, if it's already using a slow primary only weapon, and you give it a faster weapon that is pri/sec, it will swap out the primary and still not be dual weilding, since the old primary won't go into secondary.<br />
<br />
The graphic bug is when you give a pet one weapon, and then give it a 2nd that is faster, making it switch hands.  It won't replace the graphic in primary when it switches, but it's just a graphic bug.</div></div><hr />
