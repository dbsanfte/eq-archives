Just kill lots of sarnak berserkers, collect the braids, and turn them into Captain Grimerott, 4 at a time to improve VS faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From everything that I've found on the hammer quest, it takes approximately 22 turn ins (that's 88 braids turned in in groups of four) to raise faction from apprehensive to amiable.  I just got my hammer this week, and it seems to me that the number is about right, but I didn't bother to count my turn ins, so it may be a few more or a few less (I started at apprehensive).  It should be somewhere between 12-14 turn ins for indiff and then 8-10 turn ins for amiable.  If you are KOS, obviously, it will be a much bigger margin, which accounts for the necessity of a charm type effect on the questgiver.<br />
<br />
If you didn't start at KOS, I would say that doing the braid turn ins is well worth your time if you start early, since at 40, most of them are still dk blue to me, and I still got decent xp (one to two blue ticks) per turn in.  Plus, when I did my first turn in (somewhere around 30) the shield that was given as reward was decent for practicing my 1hs/1hb.<br />
<br />
Now to level to 51 so the hammer will proc.... sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnifty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gnome SK here. Took me about 20-22 turn ins (80 to 88 braids). Number sounds about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to delete this thread. Oh wait! His first non-offensive post! :) Keep it up. Thanks for the cooperation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are only two ways to raise your VS faction:<br />
1. Sarnak War Braid quest<br />
2. Killing Kunark dragons<br />
Either will get you the faction you need to get the hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, yah, only difference is that killing Kunark dragons is a good way to get you dead too...<br />
<br />
88 braids seems like a bargain to me, but then I'm not in a guild at all, so dragon raids are something that I've not even considered up to this point.<br />
