<br />
Besides the fact that there are no fire beetles in steamfont, so your lame insult isn't even valid, I just think it's funny that you seem to be obsessed with me. I mean in virtually every thread I post in , I always notice that you seem to reply with one of your &quot;hilarious and witty&quot; comments that we all expect from you. <br />
<br />
It usually sounds like something like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up bick you stupid fucking loser! you are such a fucker in RL1 you totally suck! omg gnomes are gay! fucking stupid gnome fucker! fuck you! gnome! fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't ever lose the magic bro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Compared to Iksar and Troll, it's not much. But they still get a penalty because they have night vision and high INT. It's all relative to humans. If the race has an advantage over humans (until gnomes we ALL did) there's an experience penalty. <br />
<br />
Like the first response, though, this is NOTHING like it was when we had the hybrid penalty. Being Iksar AND a hybrid sucked back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildize</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, DE SK level at the same rate as 90% of everyone else. There is no DE Race penalty - never has been. The original Class penalty was also 40%, not 50%, at least that is what VI claimed when they removed it. The only penalties that remain are for Troll, Iksar, and Ogre, but all the experience bonuses are all still in game, so Warriors, Rogues, and Halflings all need slightly less experience than everyone else.</div></div><hr />
