<br />
imho (i'm also a 57 SK) your stats are a tad on the low side, but your hit points are much higher than mine which is great. That could be due to the racial difference (I'm a DE) but more than likely most of it is due to gear. So if you feel ok about the amount of damage you deal and take, then you're about right I would say. The curse of the hybrid is always to have &quot;rounded&quot; stats, which can be a bit depressing looking at other more specialised classes.<br />
<br />
Have a look at my magelo profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=72525 for some ideas on non-uber gear if you are wanting to up your stats a bit (the AC is wrong atm it normally sits anywhere between 1000 - 1090 depending on which bits I equip).<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day the more hps you have the longer you can stay on your feet between CHs, the less mana your healer has to use, and the less downtime :)</div></div><hr />

While at 57 you have more Hp than I do (only 2003 selfbuffed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaelenu</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fendor, what unbuffed hit points and AC do you have? That strength is awfully high and I would be inclined to swap out some str gear for hp/ac gear. You can always self buff your strength and in most groups/raids you'll have someone to buff your stats even more. By 51 you should be cracking 1k in AC. Up to about level 50 I didn't focus too much on hp/ac either, and had uber stats, but the 50+ game for melees is (imho) all about hp/ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</div><div class="date">10-03-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most of your stats are low for being 57. I a 55 Iksar Shadow Knight, but I've been playing for 3 years and have better than average gear.<br />
<br />
I think my unbuffed stats are as follows<br />
<br />
STR 179<br />
STA 132<br />
AGI 95 (or close)<br />
DEX 120 (or so)<br />
INT 127<br />
<br />
HP are close to 2800. Max buffed with Aego and Shaman buffs is around 4k I think<br />
AC is close to 1100. Max AC has been 1182 with buffs<br />
<br />
Really, stats don't mean a lot i nthe high end of the game though. What matters is Hit points and haste. Stats can be buffed up so much by your local Cleric, Shaman, Druid (sometimes stackable with Ranger and Beastlord) that all our stats are close to max no matter what we started at. And as SKs, we will only be taking hits if we are a few levels higher or our gear is FAR superior to a warrior (of the same level). So it comes down to how much damage you can dish out, and being able to taunt the mobs off the MT in the rare situation it's needed. Or as the puller. <br />
<br />
Concentrate on getting to 1200 AC (buffed) and do whatever you can to increase hitpoints without sacrificing any stats. Don't sacrifice haste for anything and be a good damage dealer (best damage/delay ratio you can get.)</div></div><hr />
