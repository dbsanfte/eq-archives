<br />
So i need to know what are the common drop camps for AC augs,Zones,Loc-,Mob Names<br />
<br />
Don't bother looking at my Magelo, it's outdated, i have to update when i get my comp back<br />
<br />
I'm looking for camps that will take maybe 3-4 hours to drop something (if that's even a possibility ) looking for 5-10ac augs,didnt see much explanation on camps , so anyone with some experience with camps that are not hard to solo,camp,and isn't too much of a time sink, your advice would be appreciated,i'm looking at a month of upgrading and tuning my gear so i guess a time sink is inevitable :confused:</div></div><hr />

Know there are two doable ones in KT, and recnetly, they changed access ((or just more became aware)) so that all you need is Tipt for access ((Note: You can zone in, but not OUT, so bring something to gate.))<br />
<br />
There's also the Ground Murkglider eyes from BH in MPG. If you can't tank there yet, put up: &quot;MPG ((Snaring, no tank))&quot; And people pressed for a snarer will snag you now and again, since you also provide some utility ((Warriors/Pallies enjoy the Voice line, and Zeefer's is nice as well. Pet DPS is nothing to sneeze at either))</div></div><hr />
