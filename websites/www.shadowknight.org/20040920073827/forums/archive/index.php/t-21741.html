How many quests do you expect to have by release? <br />
When World of Warcraft was nothing more than an idea, the development team had hoped to have 600 quests available for the release of the game. Currently, World of Warcraft has over 1,700 quests with more being added everyday. <br />
<br />
It’s hard to speculate on how many quests will be in the game by release, but we do expect that there will be well over 2,000, with even more quests being added continually after the game ships.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until WoW comes out, proves it is both non-buggy and has great content, and then maintains fan interest over a long duration, it's nothing bug hype.  Just like all of the other EQ-killers that were hyped and then sucked.<br />
<br />
They can have a billion quests implemented by release, that doesn't mean any of them will be any fun or yield decent rewards.  There are tons of quests in EQ that no one does because they suck.<br />
<br />
I'm skeptical towards any new game coming out.  My view is that the more the game is hyped, the less I should expect out of it.  I would be quite happy to see something come out that was better than EQ but so far, the EQ-killers are all like politicians...full of hype and bullshit but really quite worthless in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never was saying WoW &gt; EQ, I just posted the amount of quests WoW has and its name isn't everquest, yet the majority lvling in everquest is /auto attack on /loot /auto attack on /loot etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kassdax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm kinda curious what they consider a quest.<br />
<br />
Are 200 of those &quot;give me 4 bone chips&quot; type quests? Another 250 of them &quot;I want orc shoulder pads&quot; type quests? or are there ~1500 developed, though out quests with some kind of reasonable risk and reward?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At least WoW quests show you the reward before you start the quest.  You can gauge whether it's worth it before you waste any time on it.  I wish EQ had that feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We don't know exactly how quests will work for WoW leveling, so that point is moot.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that both one tutorial &quot;get some burlap&quot; quest counts the same as one Greenmist quest.  What's the depth, role, reward, sttucture?  That much more important to me than a total #.   Give me 100 Greenmist, Freed slaves, Deck of Spontantious Generation, Epic, style quests (yes I realize that I spanned a broad group of quests) rather than 1500 newbie armor quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are a couple of sites that give you the run down on quests.  Think you can browse them by lvl.  The sheer number is mind boggling once you get in there and start looking around.  Most give decent rewards also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine EQ but being relegated to cheesy LDoN style &quot;quests&quot; - that's 90% of the quests in WoW, hardly WoW-worthy....<br />
<br />
Sad thing is the WoW account I used has passed through three sets of people already - my buddy who was ex-LoS who got bored of it and gave to me, and now my buddy that has it now that I was bored of it.<br />
<br />
He's still having fun currently though - he's on week 2...</div></div><hr />

<br />
so questing and exploring new zones for the things you need is not better then standing in a zone for 15 levels clicking the attack button over and over? its not boredom your facing, its seems to be laziness. I'm not in beta or haven't played it yet, but the way battles go seems to be better and more interesting then EQ's battles. I doubt that oyu'll need to quest all the time though, mobs give you exp right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>scpio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">you know your act is cool on the FOH boards but a bit weak here.<br />
<br />
as for WOW quests my understanding is you quest for new armor every couple of levels. which is ok but after a while big deal. when i see good epic level quests ill start to take a look. other games still havent implemented as good an epic quest and rewards as EQs. those kinds of quests are the kinds of things that keep players playing for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the quests I ran across were hardly exploring, etc. at least no more so than quests in EQ.<br />
<br />
The aforementioned 95% was &quot;kill X random trash mobs&quot; or &quot;kill random trash mobs till you get X parts&quot; - there was some VERY VERY cool quests in the 5%, but they're hardly the majority.<br />
<br />
Most of the times a good quest comes down to good writing and a little ingenuity, there are cases where that exists for EQ as well as WoW - currently I'd put them on a similar par personally.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, WoW isn't horrible or anything - it's just not good enough to make me toss away my time invested in EQ at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The major difference is in that,WoW quests can give astronomical experience (I have read,up to 1/2 a level) instead of the meager 1-3% exp that EverQuest might give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That doesn't mean much, really, unless you know at what stage those quests apply. There are plenty of quests in EQ that will, at lower levels, give quite a bit of xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Turning in Crushbone Belts in the very early levels gives insane exp for example. <br />
<br />
But I think he meant that in general most quests dont give almost in exp. <br />
<br />
Only the flagging quests for PoP seem to give good solid exp while working through them. An AA per qualified flag completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>8full</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">People want WoW to be good so badly they can't look at it objectively.<br />
<br />
Grinding xp through quests is probably a bit more fun then the EQ grind of sitting in a zone for 15 levels...but then again sitting in a zone for 15 levels was mostly a player's choice.<br />
<br />
As mentioned by lot of testers, running around finding quest then running around finding the stuff to kill to complete it is not that fun after a while either, it's still grinding, it's still feel like you're forced into that like people they are forced into the camp xp grind of EQ.<br />
<br />
Most people I know who got into WoW beta were disillusioned about EQ and were considering WoW like a savior...ALL of them and I mean ALL of them are back into EQ.<br />
<br />
WoW brings nothing new to the genre like most Blizzard games, it just tweaks the gameplay a little so that the mechanics are more fun...but in the end...it's an exact clone of EQ. So if you're tired of the EQ experience...when you newness feeling of WoW is gone, you'll be at the exact same spot as you were in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There is no way I will be going to WoW. I was considering it strongly but then they hired Furor to design quests for them. Furor and his band of jackasses is gone (guild is mostly dead not totally) from EQ and I say good riddance. Unfortunatly I spent the last several years on the same server as them and I certainly am not going to go anywhere that he has a hand in running it or designing it.<br />
<br />
Furor got himself a spot in WoW by fawning over it on FOH boards and essentially taking his whole guild there. I suppose if you kiss enough asses you can get what you want. Personally while I am VERY pissed off at EQ it is far better now that Furor and his group has left. They will make WoW a mess, my advice would be to RUN from anything he is involved in.<br />
<br />
But then that is my opinion and I have been wrong once or twice in my life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">damn u bitches should try playing the game for fun, stop trying to make it a mathematical equation. i havent read hardly anything about WoW but i plan on playing and exploring with no previous knowledge, much like when i started everquest so it is atleast interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Allakhazam's quests were submitted in by users, so the numbers are probably inacurate. how many of the quests in EQ aren't broken is the number I'd like to see...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sure, a few will be inaccurate, maybe even non-existent. 1100? No.<br />

Not to flame on WoW, but I can't stand how everyone thinks its going to be the most awesome thing since the electric dildo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>hihithere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have been playing WoW for a very, very long time; have several characters 30+.<br />
<br />
EQ is a steaming fucking shitpile compared to WoW.<br />
<br />
Questing eliminates grinding completely. Please never tell me EQ has more quest than WoW.. How many of those quests did people do? I did perhaps 20 or so from 1-65, and I surely didn't do those quests for the experience. In WoW, there are tons of different quests, ranging from exploring new areas, to yes, killing x amount of mobs. But the difference is these quests lead you to every zone and all around every zone, unlike EQ where you perhaps sit in one spot and gasp! grind all day.<br />
<br />
Again, lemme repeat, even though this is an EQ msg board and I did play EQ for 3+ years, EQ is nothing but garbage now.<br />
<br />
The reason EQ is trash isn't because of WoW explicitly; it's because of the 6month shit-out-an-expansion dev cycle, but I digress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
iam scared about any new game because the missing zones , EQ got an size i will miss in any other game.<br />
<br />
well lets wait for the real eq killer who make u think , &quot;WTF where are the ppl, the server is so empty&quot; , well i didnt saw any eqkillers yet maybe wow will get one but it isnt right now.<br />
<br />
and in 5 years , there will be bugs after expansion x and there will be crapy support.<br />
<br />
at the beginning of EQ many support question got answere like ,&quot;well find it out&quot; now ppl will laught at such answers.<br />
and they will in WoW , maybe WoW will be the ultimate EQ killer , you can screw the support , i dondt think they are rdy for the masses of players =)<br />
and this mass will find bugs =).</div></div><hr />

They take notoriously long time to do anything...will they be able to deliver content fast enough? EQ is not perfect, far from it, expansion have been released badly and bugged...but they have delivered them...at such a pace that people were barely starting to finish the content of an expansion before another was out.<br />
<br />
Even if a lot of them might have been sub-par...they kept lots of people interested in the game just by being able to release content fast enough. Will Blizzard be able to do that? Everything so far seems to point out that people will consume WoW pretty fast, it's not that hard by all account...maybe the high level content will be but so far it's not...Will blizzard bring out content fast enough?</div></div><hr />

Maybe true for casuals, but I can tell you that the 'uber' guilds sometimes had to wait for months before new content was released.<br />
And farming the same shit over and over because you can't progress anyway is damn boring, and leads to many people leaving EQ (at least in my guild).</div></div><hr />
