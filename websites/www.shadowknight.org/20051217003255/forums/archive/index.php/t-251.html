a silly question to some and maybe i am a big dumb ogre in r/l, lol, but how does the dmg bonus work on a weapon? does a 23/40 with a dmg bonus of 6 turn into a 29/40 weapon? been wondering forever and finally started posting to ask questions and looking for answers.<br />
<br />
also... how do you put your banner tag into your sig? doesn't mention or give you a place to attach a file on your profile.  do i constantly have to attach my file?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me :D</div></div><hr />

on the top right of the website click the &quot;user cp&quot; button. then click on the &quot;Edit Profile&quot; tab and write in your signature in the signature section. you can add hyperlinks and pictures with regular html or, if youre not familiar with html, you can use vB Code. click on the vB Code hyperlink to get a list of vB Code commands.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can tell the damage bonus you get is only applied after the calculations are done for including your STR and weapon skill.  Also there is a thing called modal damage which is kind of like the usual amount of damage that you do.  So if you actually connect with the mob...<br />
<br />
Minimum damage is  1 + damage bonus.<br />
Modal damage is (2 * weapon damage) + damage bonus.<br />
Max is (weapon damage * ((STR + weapon skill) / 100)) + damage bonus.  <br />
<br />
Note that the max and modal damage could actually be higher than that if you have an item or spell such as Grim Aura that adds to your ATK.  However,  these formulas will get you pretty close.<br />
<br />
The above information was derived using the information I found at <br />
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=66<br />
<br />
I've observed that SK one handed weapons follow very closely to the primary hand calculations.  2HS and 2HP weapons also appear to be the same 2HB formulas in Xaas Swifttails article.<br />
<br />

For our larger brothers, <br />
See that mob over there?   Kill it.</div></div><hr />
