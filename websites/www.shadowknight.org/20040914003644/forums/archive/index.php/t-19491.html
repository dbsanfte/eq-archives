<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nafien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the help of a few friends I completed the quest for Innoruuks Curse last night.<br />
<br />
I decided to finish this quest when I had the hide drop for me while helping someone with the marsinger gems.  I remembered that I had the Soul Leech sitting in the bank,  and within short order I was able to locate a MQ of the blade of abbrogation.  I quested the Ghoulbane.<br />
<br />
I did the whole thing using hide and conning for indifferent.  I followed the 'foolproof epic guide' pretty much verbatim. <br />
<br />
I duo'd the Mimics and Caradon/Kyrenna with a shaman, grapped a cleric and a mage for Glohnor, dropped the shaman for a cleric rounded out the group with a 3rd cleric and a ranger for Lhranc.  All characters were tier 2 pop equipped lvl 65's.<br />
<br />
Lhranc took us two tries - the first try one of the clerics went down after the first cheal.  We were able to get him to 56% despite that, had the ranger use weaponshield while the mage went full burn.<br />
<br />
He popped back to full health about 30 seconds before we were able to re-engage.<br />
<br />
Second try he went down, he runs at about 15% - I thought that was sort of funny from a lore perspective.<br />
<br />
His melee is wacky - I have a decent amount of defensive aa's and looking at the logs, I might have been able to tank him with a single cleric chaincasting cheal if it werent for that 500DD proc - it seemed like it went off every swing - 3-4 times a round.  I wasnt able to resist it with approx 250 MR.<br />
<br />
Nifty little weapon, very cool storyline for the quest and a great graphic.  I dont think i'll use it while im 'on the clock' so to speak, but its nice to have something to wear to EQ weddings....</div></div><hr />
