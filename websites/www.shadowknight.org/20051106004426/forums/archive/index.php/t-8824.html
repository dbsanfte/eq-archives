<br />
Harmshile is insane... I use it for pulling Velks... bring 6-8 mobs.... run to Upper Spiders getting agro on EVERYTHING... get to the top, cast harmshield, and jump off. :) BAM 8 mobs warp ontop of you.... AOE Mez.<br />
<br />
theres one use....<br />
<br />
another is.....<br />
I currently pull for groups in PoD and PoI (and given my level i dont wanna take half myu health in damage when pulling waiting for warrior to get agro... So .. pull... get to camp, cast harmshield and wait..... <br />
I realise the refresh rate is nothing special, so only use that when your pulling multiples and waiting for mez and agro on warriors.<br />
<br />
Other than that... save it for when your group needs to zone out real fast.... hit all the mobs with your agro modifiers, get agro and taunt everything, cast harmshield and watch everyone RUN in safety :) while you stand and take the brunt of the force...  (note: Make sure you are close to zoneline, 8 seconds is not long)<br />
<br />
anyway.. thats my 2cp hope its of help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I very rarely use it, for some unusal situations like:<br />
<br />
_Escape/drag a corpse from a hot place where mobs see inviz or where there are traps to break inviz (example: running from Shei Spot to zone-out, running through a recuso degenerate in HoH when leaving a camp, dragging a corpse in Crypt Of Decay)<br />
_After tagging an extra strong mob running faster than run 3 (example: avatar of war, zlexak)<br />
<br />
I could live without it, but it has its situational use</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) sometimes easier/more reliable than using FD to clear aggro/get a mob off you at an important time<br />
2) small aggro blur component on harmshield (i.e. it gets you off every mob aggro list if anyone else pretty much has a small amount of aggro, and unless you are below frenzy amount of life you generally have no aggro when harmshield wears off)<br />
3) pulling when you know you would get hit (best place I can think of this is ssra temple where the snakes &gt; run3)<br />
4) getting to places<br />
<br />
There are some zones where I always keep harmshield memmed, and these days I'm almost tempted to forget about keeping death peace perma-memmed and just put harmshield in its spot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmshield came in pretty handy for me the other day.  I got into a Kael Arena group, but I had to get myself there.  =/<br />
<br />
Hit the SoW potion, see invis and cast Gather Shadows in WL, then zoned into Kael.  Ran up to the ramp by the see invis Giants, kicked off Harmshield and started running to the left arena.  Got to the ramp leading up to the camp area, HS wore off - then FD.  Told the contact already in the group that I was on the ramp FD and was gonna camp out.  Group cleared the pops at the ramp area by the time I was able to log back in - got over to them, got group invite just as a mob was being pulled in.  No trains, no death, no worries.  =D<br />
<br />
I also use Harmshield at times when I'm working on nasty CR jobs.  Set up multi-corpse macro for all the people I want to drag, kick off HS and run in, hit macros and start trucking back.  If I die, no biggie - at least corpses aren't as far in as they originally were.  Do this a few more times, if needed, and all is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When your not level 60 and you do not have BE legs and your see &quot;insert name here has fallen to the ground&quot;.  Life saver while pulling....but it is very situational.  I only mem it when I am the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokktor</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep it memmed all the time but after reading this thread and thinking about the last time that (a) I needed to use it and (b) it actually went off in time.. I'm starting to think I shouldn't keep it up all the time.  I have BE legs anyway and I'm always strapped for spell slots.<br />
<br />
The few times it has been useful:<br />
<br />
1. Pulling Amy Temple in Fear to eat harm touches.<br />
2. Leaving the top area of Velks.<br />
<br />
Basically if FD fails, I try BE legs.  If I'm getting hit so hard and fast that BE legs don't work, by the time I think to try Harmshield I'm already dead or I'm getting hit so hard I can't even get Harmshield off.  It seems to have it's uses but in most cases it's little more than &quot;Time to play standing around waiting to die.&quot;  I suppose in that regard it could be considered useful for taking some funny screenshots. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amphitryon</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Harmsheild to get past Yelinak when i did my SS armor handins<br />
<br />
<br />
cast , ran past him..he gets all excited and tries to eat me and stuff, i click portal out.and go on my merry way.<br />
<br />
kinda cool to solo aggro a uber dragon LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakton</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmshield is great for getting from disco or guard to the zone out in Seb.<br />
<br />
Other places I have used it are for the Drochliche in Fear, VS in Karnors and Trak in Seb.   Performs the same as Divine Aura so the next time they say they can't do one of those because they are no pally's on raise your hand.<br />
<br />
I also like using it to jump from the top of the big spires in DL. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pensuarr</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing beats putting Harmshiled up and jumping down into the Hole...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caffino</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I thought this spell was the coolest when we got it and kept it mem'ed all the time.  Now I hardly mem it.  I find FD works just fine and  I'd rather mem a spell that I can use more often than harmshield.  On the rare occassions that I do use harmshield, I'm glad we have it (e.g. jumping down into the hole, running passed Sontalak).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozak</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only zone i keep it up in is VT atm.  Comes in handy alot there for me pulling.</div></div><hr />
