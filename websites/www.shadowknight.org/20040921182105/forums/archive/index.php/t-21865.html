<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was waisting some time at work the other day, looking at Alla's and I came accross a zone called Vex Thal.  Whats the scoop on this place, do I need a key to get in, and how do I get into that place.  It claims that is a lvl 55-60 zone, but damn, more then just a few of the mobs there are raid encounters..The loot seems really nice, but I dont know if my 63 shaman would do well there, and my sk is only just 45 and still a ways away..What are your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try searching this board or using google or reading allas or searching another class board or... well, you get the idea - there's a literal fuckton of information on vex thal out there if you're not too lazy to dig it up.  I'm more entitled to being too lazy to tell you about it than you are to being too lazy to look it up.  <br />
<br />
In short, if you'd spent more than 5 minutes researching the zone rather than just gawking in awe at teh phat l3wtz, and you were to see a post such as yours, you'd likely fall out of your chair laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its a raid zone, its absolutely shitty xp grouped, no your 63 sham and 45 sk cant do anything there.<br />
<br />
You need a key to get in, which isn't the easiest quest, and will be a waste to you if your not in a guild that raids Vex Thal. (VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its a raid zone.<br />
<br />
It is to Luclin what Veeshan's Peak was to Kunark, what Sleeper's Tomb was to Velious, and what Plane of Time was to Planes of Power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its key quest is long and involves getting drops from all over Luclin as well as slaying Emperor Ssraeshza.  It is a raid zone.  For loot examples, check my magelo (Yes I am a necro) on back, boots, head, primary, bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did a little research but did not come up with a decent map..But it looks like a gigantic pain in the ass for a soloing shaman botting his sk..Think I will stick to the akheva ruins or Acrylia caverns..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maicom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">good thinkin  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">did a little research but did not come up with a decent map..But it looks like a gigantic pain in the ass for a soloing shaman botting his sk..Think I will stick to the akheva ruins or Acrylia caverns..<br />
<br />
And with that post, you officially killed (and violently so) any credibility you might have, have had, or potentially stood to have had, with regards to all things EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The mobs in Vex dont really hit very hard for their lvl as compared to BoT or PoV kinda mobs, but all Vex mobs have alot alot alot of hitpoints.  The trash mobs on way to the bosses are simply monotonous to chew through.  The exp for the amount of time it takes to kill one mob simply makes it not worth the effort,, it is as if Vex has an experience penalty.<br />
<br />
The named bosses are worth the effort if your guild is not elemental flagged.  They drop 2 to 4 items of loot each, and can be done with a raid force of 20 -25 people geared in ornate armor or better.  <br />
<br />
The biggest issue with Vex is the amount of time it takes to get the key.  10 shards, each one drops in a different Luclin zone and it seems everyone except for a few lucky players will have a run of bad luck on at least 2 of those shard camps and will take 8 hours before to get one.  To get a guild keyed up for VexThal takes a commitment from the members to focus on the key farming and invest alot of time to get enough members keyed.  If your guild can do that,, Vex Thal will reward your efforts.<br />
<br />
My magelo is listed below,  the arms, the legs, one ring, one bracer and one earring are Vex drops.</div></div><hr />

Or that KC is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Newtank told a patch was coming to Open up Vex Thal and that a guild was going to let him loot things from the nameds there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First things first..Im stationed in OKinawa and share a pc with four other co-workers, so my pc time is limited.  The only maps I could find were fair, not great like the ones I was able to find on Mischief, so if that ruins my credibility with you Slein, well I wont loose any sleep over it.  I get maybe an hour a day four days a week to reaserch and putz around on the web, so when I cant find it quickly, I make posts to the forum and ask for help...Isnt that what the forums are for?  I dont have the free time to spend hours surfing unlike those who are fortunate to do so....If asking for help is that big of a deal to you, well you must be one &quot;stuck on yourself&quot; person.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">See the thing is a modicum of research (5 minutes or less) would have found your answer.<br />
<br />
You found Vex Thal on Allakhazams.  There is a &quot;Zone Strategy Area&quot; part of Allas on the main page.  Click on Vex Thal.  Go to the strategy discussion.  The top 20+ articles are about aspects of Vex Thal keying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus..... can't you people just fuck off and die already? Ok, maybe Slein is an asshole.... maybe he's a jerk.... maybe he's a &quot;fuck tard with low self esteem&quot;.... maybe he's even fat in real life..... but you know what? He's contributed more to this board than 99% of everyone else here, and if only for that reason, you have no right to say shit like that. I personally have never seen a decent, informative post from you, you worthless piece of shit. Why can't you, and the rest of the goddam retards of the world, all get together and drink some special Kool-Aid or something? Is it too much to ask that you do the rest of the world a huge favor and just end your meaningless existance already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Basically.. I'll sum it up since you have limited web time.<br />
<br />
The quest is long.. you need to get your Emperor Ssraeshza key first (I think it's for the best)<br />
<br />
Go to SSRA get a taskmaster pouch from the basement, Idol off of Commander Zazuah, Key off of Commander Zerozosh (or however you spell it) and Insignia off of General, Arbitor, or Advisor in the portal room (usually done by a raid)<br />
<br />
Combine idol, key and insignia inside the pouch and receive Ring of the Shissar.. that's your emp key.<br />
<br />
Now go to Akheva Ruins with a Wisp Stone and Essence Emerald and do the turn ins to get a Shadowed Sceptor Frame.. now.. go to The Grey, Scarlet Desert, Fungus Grove, Sanctus Seru, Ssraeshza Temple, The Deep, Akheva Runs, Maiden's Eye, Dawnshroud Peaks, and Acrylia Cavarns and get a Lucid Shard from all 10 zones. Combine all 10 in the and get the Unadorned Sceptor of Shadows<br />
<br />
Now Kill Emperor Ssraeshza and loot a Planes Rift from the mini snakes that spawn from his death. Then kill any boss in Luclin and loot A Glowing Orb of Luclinite.<br />
<br />
Combine Orb and Rift in the unadorned Sceptor and get the Sceptor of Shadows.. your Key to Vex Thal which is located in the Umbral Plains.<br />
<br />
You need a raid to do Vex Thal.. and if you dont have numbers or gear or good people with good AE abilities... then expect a 7-10 hour clearing of the whole zone.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
like since the last time you thought something was broken?? <br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You could duo Zovs probably, maybe Quas with a 63 SHM and a similar leveled tank, but that's about it.  A 65 EP geared SK can solo Zovs, Quas, and if I remember right Zuns.  The only trash mobs, from what I remember, that drop loot are Eoms, who randomly and rarely drop items from Thal Va Xakra's loot table, and they would rip the shit out of you pretty much.  If there was anything you could duo or even one group in the zone, it wouldn't be worth even the time it takes to travel to VT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your best bet for loot is through the bazaar or possibly LDoN points at that point of the game(level 63).  I'd recommend finding some good cash spots and farming them to just buy gear.  With a 63SHM/45SK you could two box Guard in Seb fairly easy, some loot dropping Velks camps, and a whole pluthera of other camps.  You could also farm Tumia Lehio in Natimbi for 20hp augs, which pending the way augment removal works after July 8th, you could still get back after you upgrade the slots you put them in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I will give that a shot..I havent been much for LDONS I may have to give em another shot.  Once we get cable here in our barracks Im probably going to spend a lot of time boxing my Shaman/SK combo..Sebs sounds good..I havent been back to the GoD zones since I got spanked by a trilobyte looking mob on the beach..That damn curse stuck with me forever and prompted me to go to PoM and hunt down yeaths compendium p.72 er..maybe 76 cant remember..I do remember that remove greater curse was like 400 points on ldons...Any particular spot you reccomend for LDONS..Where the aggro augs drop the most?..Ive mostly done the butchblock ones..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aggro augs don't drop anywhere, and SK's can't use them anyway.</div></div><hr />
