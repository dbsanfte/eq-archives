<br />
Just thought I'd let ya know the old standby (Stiletto of the Bloodclaw) is currently very popular among Beastlords - the little weapon that just wouldn't die. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome. Many thanks! And thanks for the kind support for elders like Xilith, Brael, me and some others, too.<br />
<br />
I still feel funny that TKW is no more. :( I feel that a small part of me are just gone. But we are extremely lucky to have volunteer like SoulVoid and Xilith to run this new, wonderful, look-like site and we have something to look forward. I sure hope that this site will have long life cuz it is finally 100% dedicated to SK class rather than splitted resources among classes. In itself, it is good. <br />
<br />
I added location: TKW to my name for remembrance to TKW. We should celebrate our newfound annual SK holiday for the remembrance of the TKW which is March 25th when it dies. Gasp! SK class has a holiday?!? That must be new. :) NO other classes have this. :) I also added remembrance into Journal section of my TKW profile as part of continuing tales over 3 years.<br />
<br />
Hehe, Arkus. You brought up very old memories of my young self that I was fanatically proud of stilileo of the bloodclaw and preached and converted lot of young SKs to use it while it was pretty good back then. Today, Centi and such just slain bloodclaw completely.   Wow, I didn't know that BST can use it. Thanks for new information..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I want to ask a question. What is nickname of this site? I always said TKW TKW for simplicity but I had to say SK site SK site for this one. Maybe we can have ideas of nickname for this site eh? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simu</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah Nocifer ! For the time you spent on the SK Board, the goldmine of Information you were (and still are) for me and some dozen of other young SK (not that young anymore Doh !), you deserved some honorific Title (thanks Soulvoid by the way).<br />
<br />
I for one, would have called you &quot;Papy SK&quot;, but that may sound a lil bit familiar, even in french, or just remind me how my son is calling his grandfather :p <br />
<br />
/salut Nocifer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cactuz</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gratz!! wtg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Simu, Thanks for the kind support. :) You are one of my long-time TKW friends also. <br />
<br />
Anyway, do anyone have link of the picture to Lord Inquisitor Seru? TKW had it a while back with very nice black armor with mean-arse black sword. He had cool plate look with neck guard covering his neck. He seems like a human. Looks very SKish. His sword looks like &quot;Deathblade&quot; which can go well with my last name and he looks like Nightbringer type. :) I always love to look like him and never forget about that picture since SOL's release and its my favorite picture of all the time and best one in 3 years. So I thought maybe I add his picture as my Avatar as my dream SK outfit. :) <br />
<br />
His true agenda is corruption but he pretends to be &quot;good&quot;, etc. He's twisted. I did the same by allied with paladin guilds, all cities except Halas, Grobb and Oggok in entire Norrath (Not Luclin mind ya but I am nearly allied to both Katta and Seru from KOS at start, heh. Well I am still KOS to some faction groups of Seru and Katta though..) itself but in other way allied with evil ones and spy for them, etc just like Seru. Heck, I was born in Freeport where the corruption is well known and gotten use to it.  Gotta have that Avatar added! Finally found one after 3 years. :) Once I get that picture, I'll cut name off and submit to Soulvoid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raise up against this blatant favoritism !!!!!:D<br />
<br />
Now all we need is official approval of Gnome Shadowknights and the world will have come to an end. <br />
<br />
GG, Noci</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought just saying &quot;shadowknight.org&quot; was pretty cool... if you need an acronym maybe you can say &quot;SK org&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never mind..<br />
<br />
I found the inquisitor picture. :) Already sent Soulvoid email with the cropped file and have him attached it to my 2 years old unused Avatar slot. ;) And I gotta change my old title from Death Knight that was more fitting as fledging SK into Death Crusader as current fitting title cuz I'm DAMN old now! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SoulVoid</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check through your user settings you should be able to set all that by yourself along with adding your custom avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pensuarr</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/monsterpics/lord_inquisitor_seru.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gee, I must have gone about 10 different sizes to fit what &quot;look&quot; right as Avatar. At first, I did the whole body but it sure looks sooo small as Avatar so reduced from bottom to chest over several interations til now. Bleh. No sword to show cuz it'll be too small to notice if sword plus head shown. I ain't no expert at portrait. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks Soulvoid for pointing out the Avatar option via user cp. I don't see any option to change my title from Death Knight to Death Crusader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Efugia</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks SoulVoid, Xilith, Nocifer, and all other SKs willing to make the transition here.  Getting that 404 for days in a row really put a lump in my throat, and I'm very grateful for the new home.<br />
<br />
Guess all of us oldtimers can no longer shout at the newbs to do a search.  Alas, so much useful information to be rebuilt.<br />
<br />
I kinda like SKorg as a nice quick alias for this board, myself. ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nocifer, or anyone else who reads this that might get status to put up an avatar/title, once your posts go over 1000 goto the edit options portion of your user options goto the bottom and click on change avatar, you can then import a custom avatar from either somewhere online or from your computer... I think SoulVoid needs to manually set the title though, was a way on knightwatch but I didnt see the option here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chania</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sniff I was halfway to an Avatar... Now looks like I'll get the spell before the title :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus Ebonblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just call it SKO currently :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like SKO acronym, Arkus. :) Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S. still waiting on new title: Death Crusader..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Death Knight &gt; Death Crusader</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh? Paladin crusader title is lvl 60 and knight title is 55. So its Crusader &gt; Knight. That's why I thought crusader is an upgrade to my knight that I had for 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just meant that Death Knight is a cooler sounding name than Death Crusader.  I wasn't referring specifically to the in game titles that Paladins receive.  :)</div></div><hr />
