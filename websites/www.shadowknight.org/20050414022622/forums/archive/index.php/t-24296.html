<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do the rules in Trial of Weaponry (Body Projection) apply to pets as well?  I lead a very non ideal group in there last night just to play around and it occured to me that pets may be damn near useless if they don't get the bonus as well.  Once we came out, I realized I didn't have other hits on to check my log myself.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, my thought is that it may be better to equipt the pet with peircers, since that's the weapon I'm weakest on.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.  Pets get no bonus or penalty on any mob in weaponry.  Fairly decent on the lightning mob, but pretty useless on the others.</div></div><hr />
