( 33 DMG 51 DLY 10 WT, +6 INT, +6 STR, EFF: YKESHA). I currently use a Dark Reaver ( 20 DMG 42 DLY 9.5 WT, EFF: STEAL STRENGTH).<br />
<br />
I know the Thornblade does more damage, but I'm concerned with the delay of 51. I don't have any haste items. Should I still  use the Thornblade, or should I stick with the Dark Reaver?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Imo if you don't have a haste item then you should use the Dark Reaver until you get a Haste item.<br />
<br />
But if you really want to use the Throneblade now already then it should also work if you would learn how to time the spell casting between spells (there is a Topic atm thats not to old where it is very well explained in the Main Section !).<br />
<br />
Another point would be : Are you a big race ? If yes then Throneblade would be even better because you don't need the Strength Tap effect that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure about going to L. Guk to camp the Frenzied Ghoul. I mean, the haste from the FBSS would be great, but I would loose AC and stat bonuses from my current belt item. Yes, I would do more damage with the FBSS, but I see my role as taunter/damage soaker in a group. I'll leave the massive damage to Rouges and Monks.<br />
<br />
Opinions?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste &gt; *.*<br />
<br />
You can have all the AC in the world, and if you can't keep taunt it's useless. Similarly, you can have all the AC in the world, and if you can't damage the mob worth jack, similarly useless. You gotta have a pretty durn uber belt not to swap it out for haste. That haste will allow you to hit the monster more often, making it easier to keep it's attention, and allow you to damage more, which will keep the mob down faster, even if you do have a monk and a rogue in the group. Melee damage does stack between multiple characters and whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fally</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try and go camp Trakanon's Teeth with a guild / friend group and get a Hangman's Noose if you worry about AC loss. Belt has a little AC and Haste.<br />
<br />
Look &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Haste &gt;&gt;&gt; other ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brazzo</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hangman's Noose can also be worn on your head as well, in case you have a head item that is not as good as your belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenrix</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just from a viewpoint of someone that's been using a throneblade as his main weapon for a while I'll add my cp's.<br />
<br />
Throneblade can equate to some big damage. Add Speed of the Shissar? Hell I'm a killing machine. BUT! <br />
<br />
I don't have a haste item to save my life, nor do I have infinite cash supplies like everyone else to get uber haste gear.<br />
<br />
So in fear kiting using the throneblade, the delay sucks, and so do misses, but it overall seems to bring mobs down quicker. Plus the Ykesha effect isn't too shabby :)<br />
<br />
Next on my list though is a Zealot's Incarnadine Sword....I want! :D<br />
<br />
Back to point though, you will like it, especially when you get some Chanter haste or some haste gear, I know I do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainya</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">do yourself a favor... skip the zealot's incarnadine sword.  I too drooled over this sword when i got it.  I kept it for 2 weeks and got rid of it.  Even with dex buffs its proc rate is so pathetic and dmg output is too low :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fengz Deamonscale</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was interisting... so I went to the Dreadlands and started a group. The first group member was another shadow knight. He wanted to be the puller, so just us two, we decided to take a single pull while we waited for more people that were LFG.<br />
<br />
Ok, so here we go, him with some bad arse Velious Lance and me with my Thornblade. Halfway through the fight I hear &quot;Taunt it off me!!&quot; and I reply...&quot;I'm trying!!&quot; I couldn't keep the monster on me when his life started to get low. I had to result to using my Harm Touch to finish the Droolvarg off. So with no buffs other than Grim Aura/Vampic Touch/shadow Vortex/Shroud of Hate I couldn't keep the taunt.<br />
<br />
This all changed though when we got a full group with an enchanter. <br />
<br />
About 15 mins later I assembled a full group. The Enchanter cast a speed buff, I think it was called &quot;Cerelity&quot; and now I became the bad arse. I was hitting for 100 - 130 points, fast... using spells, the mobs had no chance. It was fun and I had a blast!<br />
<br />
My observation.... <br />
<br />
Use 1HS/Shield combo if no enchanter or haste item... use the big bad Thornblade if I get a haste item or spell...<br />
<br />
BTW, what drops a hang man's noose? How hard is it to kill? I'm not a member of a guild so I would have to assemble a group and convince them to help me go after it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hangman's Noose drops from Hangman (go figure), a plant within one of the cycles in Trakanon's Teeth.  It is a rare mob, so going here just for this could try your patience.  Most people find it while camping the Froglok Foragers and Hunters for the Takanon Idol (Sebilis Key) - and I've been on several of these hunts and never seen this plant.  You need a tracker for this, and preferably a group to back you up.  If I remember right, most of the creatures are in the 45-50 range, though there is at least one that is higher (known as Doom).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless your belt is like a Belt of Dwarfslaying it cant be worth not having any haste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about haste, I go to 50 without haste (was too poor to get one, and I like my AC 8 Str 15 belt). Then I got a AC 20 Str 15 belt and no way I would swap that for a FBSS! I finally got SCHW and now with the upgrade to the stats, I'm happy.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic, I use a Zealot's Incarnadine (I have SoG as well) and I find the proc rate pretty good, and the damage output descent. I have 125 Dex unbuffed when using it and with my shaman friend's buffs  (HoS and Dex) I can have about 220 dex. I use the sword when I'm not the MT or when fear kiting and I find it quite good.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking for an upgrade, can anyone suggest something? I have my eye on the warswords that drop in Akheva, anyone know what kind of force is required to get them? Also any other alternatives until I get my epic.</div></div><hr />
