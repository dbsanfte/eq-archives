<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read somewhere that an Iksar Necro who tried to get the Woof-Elf illusion crown had his faction cap at indifferent. Since my char is a Troll SK, and Frogloks hate Trolls, will mine cap lower than that?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if having a chanty hit me with the Froglok illusion will help my faction? I'm hoping with the Ghoul Lord Scalp,  and the enchanter spell that increases faction, on top of a froglok illusion, I'll be able to get warmly in no time at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Using Scalp of the Ghoul Lord and Human Illusion, I was able to do the quest after maxing Froglok faction, but not 1 kill earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you max out faction, and have some cha gear and faction mods you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and have some cha gear <br />
<br />
HUH?!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oombak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cha gear = does nothing<br />
<br />
Ogre Sk CT =<br />
<br />
1) max frog faction<br />
2) scalp of the ghoul lord<br />
3) wood elf illusion (just buy a few essence of wood elf and burn em when you need to, so you dont have to suffer like me and others by finding project illusion)<br />
<br />
plus all the components = sexy illusion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Noones mentioned having a cleric or bard cast that faction spell on you. How much do you think that would help? Maybe I can get to warmly from dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All those spells are self only, so nevermind. Trickers Augmentation isnt even a faction spell (I was told it was)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DE SK.<br />
<br />
Maxed Froggie faction at Kindly.<br />
Maxed faction + Scalp = Kindly.<br />
Maxed faction + woodelf illusion = Kindly.<br />
Maxed faction + Scalp + woodelf Illusion = Warmly.<br />
<br />
You can try it, it should work for you too.  Of course, if you are bored and have a few hours to spend on the faction.  I just finished this 2 days ago.  Did I meantion that I hate frogs more than gnomes now?<br />
<br />
And my stupid shaman was at max ally before I maxed the SK faction.  That really blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How long did it take you guys to max it? If I go every night for 2 or 3 hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Took me around 20 hrs total.  Most of the time was in LGuK, some was spent in seb.  Duo with shaman in LGuk, kept most of it cleared and peaked out at little over 700 faction hits in about 5 hrs.  Had a rough time getting 60 hits per hour in seb with a small group, just couldn't pull the mobs fast enough.   In LGuk you could just aggro them and run away, they would eventually find you.  Seb, you often had to walk them back because the casters would stop to cast and if you got too far away they seemed to forget about you and wander away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did a search but could not find a good answer.  Why is this worth getting?  I realize it gives you a wood elf illusion but is that really that important?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's one of those situational things - not necessary to get, but it can be advantagious in certain instances:<br />
<br />
1) You get a free shrink without having to carry around potions/shrink devices w. charges<br />
2) UVision<br />
3) Illusion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks Derok, I hunted upper guk from 19 to 31,so I have max bad faction.  I think I will have to pass on the crown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Putrid, even if you did not hunt in UGuk in your childhood, you'd be darned close to rock bottom already I think; just by being a Shadow Knight, and serving a likely evil diety.<br />
<br />
I know it's a lot of work; and for me it was more of a toy (I don't need the shrink nor the ultravision) but lately and since the illusion faction changes, I am finding it handy at times to overcome minor faction issues in some places (like Katta).<br />
<br />
Although factioning in LGuk is probably faster, I did so in Seb even though the kills take longer.  The loot was pretty good, and now that they made the post-60 experience range changes, the frogs in Disco 1 range from green to light blue to dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Scalp of the Ghoul Lord  <br />
<br />
And that is what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's a faction modifier for evil deities that increases live froglok faction:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oombak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">a scalp that off the ghoul lord...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Though Lguk is the faction farm of choice for a caster w/ ae spells, I believe the faction hits per kill in seb are bigger, so even though the kills take longer, the faction rate should be equivalent.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?  I forget where I read this...  I will try to find more info.<br />

_____________________________________________<br />
edit:  ok, I cannot find a definitive source for faction quantities in guk vs. seb, but here's how to test it.  Take a non-evil character to guk, kill one live frog at a time, conning after each kill, and stop once you drop a faction lvl.  Then kill dead frogs one at a time, conning a live frog after each kill to determine how many kills it takes to get back to the previous faction level.  According to what I have read, it is 5 or 6 dead frogs to make up the faction hit from one live frog.  Then repeat the process with mobs in Seb.  Someone doing the quest currently and want to test it and post the exchange rate?  <br />
<br />
also, killing the minotaurs in lower guk give approx half the faction hit that live frogs give.  Testing other mobs in Lguk on Dead-side faction might be a good idea as well.<br />
