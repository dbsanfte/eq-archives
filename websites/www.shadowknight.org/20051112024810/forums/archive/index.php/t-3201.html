<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarovich</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok one day I figured I had to much free time on my hands and I started the Greenmist quest. Now the problem to this is that im an ogre. So I had to get my faction up. Im currently high warmly con to almost every mob in cabilis. <br />
<br />
But here is the problem I am still Kos to Librarian Zimor who is the guy you have to start quest with. <br />
I was wondering if anyone else ran into this problem after building up the rest of the factions?<br />
<br />
I was hoping to MQ items with a friend past him but he ends up giving you a tome that you need for one of the combines or something like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advance.</div></div><hr />

If however this faction is already maxed, then you are screwed! Unless someone knows different.</div></div><hr />
