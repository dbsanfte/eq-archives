<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Savard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In reply to the pacify NERF post below, a similar question.  I have been in a few LDoN groups since the patch and I have noticed that when pulling with spells, they seem to gain aggro from the mobs behind or around the mob that I am pulling.  I was pulling right after the person finished pacifying, within like a second or 2.  I do not use a bow since our skill with them sucks, but does a bow create less aggro when pulling, and do I have to buy a bow now?  I have the cash, I just hate to have to use a bow all the time.  I just ran thru a few LDoN missions and noticed this with our spells, and it happened with all of them at my lvl.  Darkness, terror, spears, all of them.  Thanks guys, Sorry if this is in the wrong section.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taelnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were you pulling the mob that was pacified? :p  Assuming I read your post right, you're not using lull spells correctly.<br />
<br />
Pacifiy is one of the lull spells.  When it lands on the mob, it has a reduced radius at which it will both notice you are there, and a reduced radius in which is will bother doing something about you.  Thus, you lull one mob, and you pull the other mobs that are not lulled, and the lulled one does not come(barring some strange mob pathing through the middle of the lulled mob.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Creates less aggro on the mob than some spells (clinging or fear), about the same as a lot of our others (like abd. of str).<br />
<br />
Advantage of bow pulling is longer range, no recast time, instant 'cast', can bow on the run.  Skill with the bow is irrelevant to its usefulness as a pulling tool.  If I'm the groups main puller, I normally use a bow, depending on what I'm pulling and where.</div></div><hr />
