<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've tried using search, but couldn't find threads on items a Troll can use to shrink. I keep getting stuck in Sol-A main entrance, and have been frustrated with my large &quot;footprint&quot;.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what items I could get to make myself smaller when I want to? It's painful being so big all the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another thing, that I recently found out.  Turn on luclin models for trolls.  It'll make you thinner.  I swear it's better then Jenny Craig, I must have lost, 8 pant sizes by doing this.  Prior to luclin models being turned on I was not able to fit into Thurgadin's shops, but now all I have to do is duck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forgot to add, if that doesn't work.  You can buy shrieker potions, shaman made potions, an Anizok's Shrinking Device, mq for a Crown of Deceit, or try your hands at getting a froglock stone.  By the way, I'd leave sol-a at 51.  There's better xp and money spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>trosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm Luclin models.. that's an inexpensive way to lose pixels. I'll give it a shot the next time I'm online. It would suck to have to reroll as a gnome *cough*<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice all.. I'll try Luclin models, and failling that, start saving up for 'em shrink/illusion items. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get yourself Anizok's Minimizing Device (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16420).  You should be able to pick one up for around 400 or 500pp.  It has 20 charges of shrink and only costs like 100pp to recharge once it runs out of juice.  Cost effective.  Cheaper in the long run than shrink potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maeldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What exactly is a &quot;Froglock Stone&quot; ? search didnt turn up any info on this, and am curious about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>trosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Luclin model works! I can waltz into Sol-A main entrance without needing to duck.. strange that an expansion can give you such &quot;advantages&quot; hmm<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion!<br />

I did this quest and it was really simple.  The real hard part is finding a GM Poison Making Rogue.  It is a nice thing to have but the 1 charge of froglok illusion is annoying.  I have to keep running back to Neriak when I want to recharge it.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Froglok Stone Illusion<br />
<br />
This one is the for Froglok Stone a 1 charge Clickable illusion that *Can* be recharged, below is the walkthrough. Original thread was from www.attrition.org/eq/hosted/gsq/ <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
RESULT<br />
<br />
Froglok Stone <br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />
Charges: 1 <br />
Effect: Illusion Guktan (Any Slot, Casting Time: 0.0) <br />
WT: 0.4 Size: SMALL <br />
Class: ALL <br />
Race: ALL except FRG<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Rechargeable see below paragraphs<br />
(The stone will only work once so use it wisely. If you somehow make a mistake in using it return it to me and I will imbue it once again.)<br />
<br />
<br />
First, find the enchanter guild-master Ryoz K`Tarn on the top floor of the caster guild in Neriak 2nd Quarter.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Ryoz K`Tarn'<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'Bah! You have the stench of Troll on you! Then again, who doesn't these days with all those filthy brutes in our city? If only there was a way to [get rid of the Trolls].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will get rid of the Trolls'<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'The only way to get rid of the dirty beasts is to give them their so-called [city back].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Their city back?'<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'You truly are an imbecile aren't you? We have to [get rid of the Frogloks]!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will get rid of the Frogloks'<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'Well there are several ways. We could kill all of the slimy jumpers, but the king and queen won't commit our forces to that. We could infiltrate their ranks and sow dissention, but the most direct way would be to [assassinate] some of their leaders.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will assassinate their leaders'<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'I don't know. Perhaps you should speak to someone who does things like that for a living like one of our local assassins. Come back and see me when you have found a way to kill the slimy beasts. Now quit pestering me before I grow angry!<br />
<br />
Next, find Sazan K'Jartan in the Rogue guild, Neriak third quarter. He is the first NPC on the right when you enter the rogue guild. ** Make sure you have a main inventory<br />
slot open! ** At this point, if you are KOS to the rogue guild you need to hail him and complete the dialog quickly, as he will attack you during it. He doesn't hit very hard, but when done you need an escape plane. Having a wizard or druid there to cast evacuate/exodus is ideal.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Sazan K`Jartan'<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan glances at you from the corner of his eye. 'You'd better speak<br />
more swiftly than my blades or you won't walk out of here Clanin.'<br />
<br />
NOTE:  The ‘Ryoz sent me’ part did not work for me.  I just went to the next paragraph.<br />
You say, 'Ryoz sent me'<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan says 'Ah, come to speak business have you, I figured Ryoz would<br />
be sending someone to me eventually. Well then, let's get down to business. I know of a [potent poison] that will kill even the hardiest Froglok quickly and silently, but with great pain.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what potent poison?'<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan says 'It is a bubbling concoction that can be quite dangerous to make for those with less then skilled hands. I will make this poison for you. However, I will need you to gather the [necessary materials].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what necessary materials?'<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan says 'Well, first off, we will need one dose of Mage's Bane which<br />
I just happen to have here. However, I will also need a dose of Susceptible Essence, a dose of Mind Melt and two [special ingredients]. When you have collected these poisons use this mortar to combine them and then hand me the result. Now you must be careful as this mortar is very fragile. If you happen to break it just tell me you need another and I will give you a new one.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what special ingredients?'<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan says 'There is an associate of mine who can be found in a place known as the cauldron.  Show him this note and he should be able to point you in the right direction. Be wary, retrieving these two ingredients will not be easy. Keep in mind that my friend will not talk to you unless you have some proof from me. If you lose this note come on back, let me know and I will write another for you.'<br />
<br />
At this point, he has handed you a four-slot container to mix the final poison in, as well as a note to deliver to Grimpl Rustedcog, in Dagnor's Cauldron. He can be found on the island in the center of the lake.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Grimpl Rustedcog'<br />
<br />
Grimpl Rustedcog says 'Can I help you, or do you normally walk up to those you don't know and stare at them?'<br />
<br />
Grimpl Rustedcog says 'Ah, you want some Viscous Venom, eh? Well I just used my last little bit to settle a score with an old gambling buddy. If you really want some you'll have to get it from good Ol' [Jagged Fang]!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is jagged fang?'<br />
<br />
Grimpl Rustedcog says 'Jagged Fang is a long time resident of this here lake. Her scales secrete a liquid that is quite potent. The affects of this liquid causes ones mind and body to become weak. While she is a rather non aggressive beast, I would suggest you bring some friends if you plan on getting some of her venom. Oh and one more thing, if you can manage to subdue her bring me back what you get and then I will tell ya who can help out with the other item you need.'<br />
<br />
At this Point North West of from the Island A large Snake &quot;Jagged Fang&quot; will Spawn. The snake cons dark blue to level 65, summons, hits for around 200 (slowable by 65 shm), poisons and you can't stun him. Once dead, he drops &quot;Venom Filled Scales&quot; (no drop) which you take back to Grimpl Rustedcog.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Grimpl Rustedcog says 'Heh, I thought I would never see you again. Guess Ol' Jagged Fang wasn't as tough as I heard. Anyway here are your scales back and a note to my friend Saeko. She should be able to help you. You can normally find her wandering around the Southern Desert.'<br />
<br />
He will hand back the &quot;Venom Filled Scales&quot; and a &quot;Note to Saeko&quot;. Travel to South Ro and find Saeko L`Vinec at the dark elf merchant tents in the desert area.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Saeko L`Vinec'<br />
(hand her note)<br />
<br />
Saeko L`Vinec says 'So you're the one Sazan sent to help. He must need this venom badly. Tell you what, since I have been here for so long and turned up nothing I will tell you the [last known area] that Gargantula was spotted. She is a crafty beast who uses the sands of this desert to move silently.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'last known area?'<br />
<br />
Saeko L`Vinec says 'From the information I have gathered the last time she came above ground was somewhere in the middle of the. . . Suddenly as if staring in the face of death Saeko's blue skin turns deathly grey. She looks at you for a moment and begins to cast a spell. That's when you hear a loud chittering behind you.'<br />
Saeko L`Vinec begins to cast the gate spell.<br />
<br />
This summons a large spider named Gargantula. The spider hits for 275 max (slowable by 65 shm), can't be snared, can't be stunned, and summons. A little over halfway through the fight, she will summon ten small spiders (Frenzied Gargling, Rabid Gargling, Gargling Runt, etc). These small spiders can be mezzed and have few hit points.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
When dead, you can loot a &quot;Venom Soaked Mandible&quot; which you will use for the poison combine.<br />
<br />
Next, you need to hire the services of a rogue with 250 poison making skill, or find two more poisons for sale in the bazaar. The first is 'Susceptible Essence' and is made by combining Ethereal Suspension, Nohope Moss x2, Sealed Poison Vial and Snowcap Amanita. The second poison you need is 'Mind Melt', which is made by combining Ethereal Suspension, Mt. Death Mineral Salts x2, Quicksilver and a Sealed Poison Vial.<br />
<br />
Nohope Moss - is found off frogs in swamp of no hope <br />
Mt. Death Mineral Salts - are found off of goblins in Nurga, Droga or FM<br />
Snowcap Amanita is found off of Poison merchant Nubs Black-Granite, dwarf located in the ‘Windmill’ –2700, -3000 in LOIO<br />
Quicksilver - is a  Manufactured Ingredient made out of cinnabar + gnomish spirits<br />
Ethereal and Vial – are found off of vendor merchant in PoK<br />
<br />
Once you have the poisons, put your &quot;Venom Filled Scales&quot;, &quot;Venom Soaked Mandible&quot;, &quot;Susceptible Essence&quot; and &quot;Mind Melt&quot; in the mortar and pestle given to you by Sazan. Click combine to receive &quot;Bubbling Concoction&quot; which is lore and no drop. Take this concoction back to Sazan in Neriak. At this point, if you are KOS to him you need to take an enchanter that can charm him to do the hand in.<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan takes the materials from you. Sniffing the sickly smell coming from the container, he nods and grabs a small vial from a pouch on his belt. He begins to mix the vial into the jar gently as beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead. Then, he smiles in triumph.<br />
<br />
Sazan K`Jartan says 'I did it! I didn't think I would be able to but here I stand triumphant. I got the recipe from an associate of mine named Tisumie, beautiful lass, deadly with a blade. It took a fortune to get that recipe from her but it will be well worth it if we can accomplish our goal. Well now, all that remains is the delivery. Take this to Ryoz and he will give you further instructions. It will kill any Froglok in Norrath. That I guarantee!'<br />
<br />
He will hand you back a &quot;Vial of Froglok's Bane&quot; which you deliver to Ryoz.<br />
<br />
Ryoz K`Tarn says 'You've done it! I'd thank the gods if I believed in them. Take this stone and it will allow you to travel amongst their ranks as one of them. Once you have infiltrated their city give this poisoned ale to Dar Strategist Guib. When the trolls hear of the strategist's death perhaps we can persuade them to leave our city and reclaim theirs. The stone will only work once so use it wisely. If you somehow make a mistake in using it return it to me and I will imbue it once again.<br />
<br />
Ryoz hands you a mug of poisoned ale and a froglok stone.<br />
 <br />
At this point You can keep the stone and not do the part for the spell if you are non-enchanter.<br />
