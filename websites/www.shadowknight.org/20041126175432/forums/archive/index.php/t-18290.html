<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malheur VonRane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't notice this when it happened but when the ldon merchants were pulled and then replaced after the patch, I lost all record of my adventure successes up to that point. I still had all the correct points but but my credit for completing the missions were gone, as well as my one failure. I thought it was odd that all the vendors only showed me the lowest base items at first, till I went on an advunture then I could see everything I could buy. But now I should have enough successes for my stone to start progressing and this is when I noticed the problem. For instance, I have 510 points in Mistmoore but am only credited with 3 successes. Has this happened to anyone else?</div></div><hr />

The GM would not restore this so they had to do a rollback. I only lost about 4 wins and 5 aa not sure how much you would lose if you did a roll back that far</div></div><hr />
