(1) Can anyone tell me how long it is now taking them to get 1 aaxp point post nerf?  I just want to make sure I am maxing my time soloing.  If you could put your pre nerf time as well, however most people were 45 min to 1 hour per yellow.<br />
(2) Can you now get faster aaxp in groups as opposed to solo?<br />
(3) Favorite or best found solo exp hunt  [yes I know this has been touched on before, but having all of this in one spot will help a ton].<br />
<br />
*Please list somthing about level and gear.<br />
<br />
My info.<br />
<br />
1.  Not sure on new time, prenerf was approx 5 hours per point.<br />
2.  Not sure, thus the question...<br />
3.  The Grey just outside the temple is a hill I set up camp on.  I summon a pet and pull from the hills and rocks, this allows me to see the light blue cons from the dark blue wihtout aggro.  Also it does not take any pulls from the people camping the temple enterance.<br />
<br />
Level 60 TSK NTOV gear, Fungi and Primal knight 1hs, Epic, SD, other NTOV, but no Uber weapon yet ie... Flamberge, Palidus, GSOD etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I duo with a 45 shaman I'm leveling on computer 2.<br />
<br />
I think with him now its about 2 hours per yellow, and he's seeing about the same on his actual xp (most likely due to the fact that I'm getting the majority of the xp each kill).<br />
<br />
Its slowed, but since I'm leveling another character at the same time, and he's leveling in 10hours or so, I'm happy with the progress I'm making atm.  I'm sure it will speed up once he stops getting resisted so much on slows (spend of lot of downtime medding atm)<br />
<br />
I fight in the ratman jail in the Hole myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before solo exp nerf I was often soloing in skyfire during free time, was around 1 yellow per houre wich was better exp than most common exp groups.<br />
After nerf I came back once in SF and was totally disgusted: was taking twice more time to get a blue.<br />
Didnt stay long but now it should be 1 houres for 3 blues I think.<br />
<br />
Solo or group?<br />
Depend on the place you go and the number of people in group, but exp should allways be at least a bit better in group than in solo.<br />
<br />
Favorite places for exp?<br />
Velk dogs &amp; velk spiders in pit, chardok at tunnel (small group) niblek crypt korocust overseer, Sebilis at Discos or shrooms, Akheva, Cazic Temple (best exp)<br />
With help from high dmg output and torrent of hate, I usually grab decent exp during raids in places like HoT (for tears and symbols), Ntov, The Deep and Akheva.<br />
East ToV is great for exp ! :D</div></div><hr />
