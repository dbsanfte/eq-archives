<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SweetMeef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you wipe and the harder lvl 68 lhranc despawns, is all really lost?<br />
<br />
Does it matter that you have lhranc's coin or are you just plain screwed?<br />
<br />
Just wanted to check and make sure I get enough forces for the encounter for when I do it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At the time I finished my epic, loosing Lhranc meant loosing everything. That was years ago so it may have changed but I don't think so. That risk adds a little spice to the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The thing with Lhranc is that once you pop him in human form he stays up for quite a while, so even if you do whipe, just reform, grab some more power if needed, and spank him again. He doesnt despawn for a very long time, if he even does. I've read posts where he has stayed up for an entire day, but I'm not sure about this. Try a search...Its a useful tool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can bind in CoM... it used to be a common tactic to just do battle resses and bind zerg him.  These days, with level 65 as common as it is, it is not as hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that would have been funny to see a bunch of people bind zerging him.  Bunch of naked people popping in the corner to go rush him with a few punches until they're dead again and keep doing it.  When I did mine we did a gang bang with a couple Shadowknights and Mana Burn Wizard.  He was dead in like 2 seconds.  I was wondering though if maybe you could respawn Lhranc in human form with his coin if you failed.  Like how Doggin Codslayer hands back the Froglok Essence in case you wipe to Faydedar.  I wouldn't want to be the one to find out on this particular encounter though.  Too much work to get that far.</div></div><hr />
