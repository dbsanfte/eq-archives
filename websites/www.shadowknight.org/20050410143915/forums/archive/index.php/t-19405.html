<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arkainium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Normally with tanks, I grab some cheap weapons of every type and work on all my weapon skills as I level.  The problems I see with this are that my skills are almost all half of their full potential, making me very ineffective, especially when solo.<br />
<br />
So, my question is, should I keep using this method?  (REALLY want to roll an Iksar SK)<br />
<br />
If not, should I just work on one skill throughout the lower levels, and wait till the end-game, which I've never reached with any toon even though I play all day (*frown*), to work on the rest of the skills?<br />
<br />
Even then, won't groups get angry that I'm not doing any melee DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of people advise you to swap out weapons as you level up to keep all skills maxed.<br />
<br />
I gave up on this very rapidly, for exactly the reason you state:<br />
<br />
It's impossible to keep any skills maxed at low/mid levels if you try to do this because there just isn't time enough in any given level.<br />
<br />
This is just my personal opinion, but I concentrated on one.  2Hs was good for me as a large race SK because I got Slam all the way up while levelling, otherwise I'd probably have used one handers for bash, regardless of the supposedly &quot;uncool&quot; look.<br />
<br />
If you get a decent 2Hp or something at high levels it's not impossible to find a good exp group and ask them if you can hit their mobs to skill up on for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can't keep them maxed early on, but around 30 you start levelling slow enough to raise more of them.  Just switch around without saying anything to raise the skills - groups are for improving your character overall, not just gaining exp, skill gains are also part of it.  If the group complain you aren't doing enough damage, it's up to you whether you want to switch back or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Around the late 30's to 40's leveling slows down enough that you can finally max all the skills.  I kept all my skills up as high as I felt necessary while making sure I had one weapon maxed.  I wound up having a 1 hander and a 2 hander close to max all the time.  The 2 hander was my weapon of choice but I keep switching to 1 hander + shield against casters.  This approach avoid sthe aggravation of not being able to hit at all and lets you reasonable use whatever you happen upon that is an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arkainium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So, I'm getting that it would be best to keep what I'm doing so that all the skills begin to catch up by the 30s/40s?<br />
<br />
However, let's say I just use one weapon type all the way to 50s/60s, implying that the said type is maxed, and rest are all 0.  How difficult is it, at that level, to go from 0  to max?  I mean, it seems as if it would be nearly impossible to even land a hit on a relatively leveled mob.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't really care about havin max points in all skills.  All I care about is usin the best weapoon i have for the situation and kickin some beastie butts.  It'll take you just a few days with haste and focus when ur lvl 60 to get from 0 to max skill if you happen to pick up a nice weapon u have no skill with.  <br />
<br />
Conclusion---just use whatever ur best weapon is, max the 2hb or 2hp or whatever when you actually get a good weapon that you'd wanna use full time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It takes a few hours Arkainium.  Or did when I tried it.<br />
<br />
As I said, you find a group killing blue con mobs then hit them to skill up.  Works fine, and the fact you miss the mobs a lot at the start doesn't stop you skilling up or make it noticeably slower.<br />
<br />
Skillups don't appear to work that way.</div></div><hr />

A long time ago, my first 2hb was Cudgel of Cowardly Death - at the time I got it, I had zero skill in 2hb at level 60.  I used it for the rest of that raid and at the end I had about 80 or more if memory serves.<br />
<br />
In an exp group after the raid I got it up to around 170 or more.<br />
<br />
Next day I maxed it in a group.<br />
<br />
So it's not too hard to get them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arkainium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm glad to hear that...<br />
<br />
This always used to keep me from leveling my characters very high.  Believe it or not, I sometimes even sacrificed exp to bring my skills closer to my level.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm just gonna grab the best weapon I can afford.... probably that Mace of the Shadowed Soul, lol... and level as much as possible.<br />
<br />
This game just overwhelms me sometimes; there's too much to know.  I hope this time I'll get passed my max level of 42.  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiggrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i planned on just using 1H slashing and a shield all the way. is this something i shouldnt do? atm im using SSotY and a SK only shield with 6 int and some mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">atm im using SSotY  <br />
<br />
short sword of the ykesh is really horrible weapon.  Rule of thumb I learned is that if a 1 hand weapon acn be used by dual wielders (war/rog/brd/rng) then knights should avoid it like the plague.  Check out some of our knight only 1handers.  MoSS is great at lower level, or scepter of lightning, etc<br />
<br />
As for weapon skills, i do this:  pick my main weapon, use that till it maxes for the level, then swap in secondary weapon till it maxes, then third, and so forth.  If I ding before a skill maxes, i still switch back to the main weapon.  that way I have one skill fully maxed, and the others going up a bit here and there.  <br />
the three times I have leveled up a melee char, i was able to keep 2 skills maxed and a third close all the way to lvl 39.  At lvl 39 everything catches up, since all skills max at 200 untill level 51, at which point, no matter what upgrades you get, you have decent skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did the same thing as Ogrukk.  Kept 1hb (Mace of Shadowed Souls) and piercing (best lance I could find within my price range) maxed as I went up with levels.  Once I got to around 25-30ish both of them were maxed so I rotated in 2HS as well.  Just make sure to always max your &quot;main&quot; weapon first and then work on the secondaries after that and you'll be fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eludicous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1.  you need to find a place to practice that has mobs around your level.  For example MM entrance if your around 20.  The more white mobs the better.<br />
<br />
2.  you need to group with someone that is way higher than you.  For example a lvl 60 shaman or chanter.<br />
<br />
3.  buff up and get hasted.  Shamans are good here since they can help crank up your str/agi/dex/sta, regen and so on....<br />
<br />
4.  Chanter or shaman can pull or you can pull a train if ya want.  now as long as the critters are slowed your set then you just swing away.  As a sk you can keep agro from the chanter/shaman as need be to raise you defense skill.<br />
<br />
5.  Weapons of choice.  Simple just some low delay/damage weapons.  Lower the delay the better since skills up go off the lvl of the mob and basically how many times you swing at it.<br />
<br />
6.  Once your done you go back to lvling.  This is what I do since it helps out PLing to keep your skills maxxed.  This is why I do the skill up journey to MM after a 2 hour binge in PC with a new char. <br />
<br />
It works I usually have all my accounts filled with 30 some lvl chars.<br />
<br />
As I level I keep all my weapons skills maxxed so I have a bag of weapons on me at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Savik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Prior to level 50, your weapon skills are capped at 200. You can hit that cap at level 39 if I've done the math right.  :)  That means from level 39-50 you will have plenty of time to catch up on all the weapon skills you left alone. This can be done easily in groups with friends or while soloing, especially if fear kiting.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest just starting with the best weapon you can afford, maybe two types if you want to, and just level to 39+ using them. Once they are capped at 200, go back and train the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you are a true glutton for punishment you can do what I did. I wanted to make sure that at every level my weapons skills were capped for that level before getting the next level. At low levels what I would do is wait till just before I was about to ding then I would go find someplace to get bound near a very high red con guard. Then I would attack the guard untill I was down a gold or two of exp then loot the corpses and go back to hunting. Currently at level 57 I have all of my melee skills with the exception of Bash, and Disarm level-capped. I also used almost all of my training points through the levels. I think I have maybe 25 points right now. The other key is to get the fastest delay weapon you possibly can, and try to keep your dex up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would recommend keeping your best 1hdr and best 2hdr weapons skills maxxed and if there is time between dings try and work up some others, but keep your mains maxed and you will want a 2hdr before to long, even if you are level 1.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I found that from the low-teens to the mid-30s, it was pretty easy to max out any three skills (I kept 1HS, 1HB, and 2HS maxed).  From time to time I'd max them out before I dinged my next level, and would switch in my 2HB or piercing weapons.<br />
<br />
By the time I was 39, I had 1HS, 1HB, and 2HS maxed or nearly so, and piercing and 2HB were something like 50 or 70 or thereabouts.  From 39 to 50 I managed to max all but 2HB, which I maxed not long after.  Mind you, I spent most of that time using a 2HS and not really thinking about maxing any skills.<br />
<br />
At 56 I have all five skills at 213 or better (max 218 I think).  I would say, keep as many of them moving as you can, even if none are maxed for each level.  From 39 to 50 you'll have all the time you need to get them all maxed if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Weapon Skills is what I concentrated on the most and as a consequence, keeping my skill maxed was a fast and easy process. Here's how I did it:<br />
<br />
1) Invest in a decent Weight Reduction Bag, many sell for under 400pp.<br />
<br />
2) At the early levels, look for weapons for each Weapon Skill with fast speed, keep them in the aforementioned bag.<br />
<br />
3) Once the skill is maxed, then you can keep them maxed by switching through as you fight in group. Groups usually don't mind you maxing your skill by 5 points. Its when you switch from a maxed weapon to one that has 6 points that pisses them off.<br />
<br />
4) Now that your Weapon Skill is maxed, you can upgrade weapons as you level and can use them instantly...instead of going somewhere to specifically grind up the Skill.<br />
<br />
Since Level 30, I have maintained that practice and had excellent Skill Ups, often switching during a fight as I maxed each weapon. Now I sit at 62 with all my Weapon Skills maxed, including Archery (different method to level)  and Hand-to-Hand (hard to do). :p Just takes a bit of discipline...don't forget your Casting Skills and Offense/Defense Skills.</div></div><hr />
