From what I'm reading above, if he is &quot;on&quot; truespirit faction should killing him not lower your faction instead of raising it?  Apprehensive is better than KoS.<br />

It used to be when you completed the epic it bottomed your truespirit faction so they added that NPC in to reset it.  There was another class this was affected by as well shaman or wizzard, maybe both.</div></div><hr />
