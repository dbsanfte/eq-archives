<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Renafeyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am kinda stuck in a rut, I need to any suggested hunting grounds for a Level 25 Dark Elf Shadow Knight.  Have been killing named Sisters of Elloresi in Ocean of Tears, but its getting boring.  Plus I am seriously low on cash.  Any suggestions would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check the Stickied post at the top it contains wonderful information like<br />
<br />
Levels 24-26: Pauldial Caverns, Upper Guk, Lake of Ill Omen, Netherbian Lair, Highpass, Highkeep, Lake Rathetear, Overthere, Warsilk Woods, Echo Caverns (FG side), Stonebrunt, Permafrost, Marus Seru, *Najena<br />
<br />
Levels 27-29: *Najena, South Karana, Lake Rathetear, Highkeep, Upper Guk, Overthere, Echo Caverns (FG side), Stonebrunt, Permafrost, Sol A, Marus Seru, Timorous Deep, Swamp of No Hope, Lake of Ill Omen<br />
<br />
<br />
then check the Making Plat thread to find snipits like this..<br />
<br />
Vendor loot<br />
Rathe Mountains - Hill Giants - plat and fs<br />
Fungus Grove - shrooms - group<br />
WW - dragons - good loot<br />
Crystal Caverns - geonids/gems<br />
LoIO - bloodgills<br />
SolA - kill everything that moves - FS and plat<br />
<br />
<br />
Pay close attention and you might find a zone in your level that gives good loot and great exp and is close to home (hint: SolA)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Marus Seru and kill rockhoppers.  Save the low quality hides and learn to make padded leathers.  Sell those for $$$ in the bazaar.  Good xp and good plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dawnshroud is a great place to hunt (needs to be added to the sticky) for your level and up though 40.<br />
<br />
At your level hunt near the Neitherbain Lair zone (great exp, rare loot).  The move to the GE zone when you get close to 29ish (much better loot).  Around 34ish move to the ME zone.<br />
<br />
If you get tired of DSP, move to Overthere and get in a ramp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha Ramgar, how long has it been since you were level 25 ? There is no way in hell anyone would take a level 25 sk in OT. Hell, you'd have problems getting a group at level 30. 33 is the norm it seems to be picked up there.<br />
<br />
You're best bet is Feerott. My wife also says the xp in LDoN groups is incredible as long as all the group members are within 2 levels of each other. Shoot for all the same level group and you'll get a level every 2 adventures.</div></div><hr />

The side of the zone near warsilks woods is alot lower level then the other side.  Its quite good for 19-27ish. Occassionally you can find a group near a spot called the &quot;mud pool&quot; which is small pool of water in that area.  He can prob fear kite here as well (if you have fear at that lvl, i forget).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Right, the SF and FM ramp groups would most likely turn you down sub 30.  But you can sometimes get a group at the Warsilk Woods ramp.  If not, you can certainly solo there.<br />
<br />
I was recenty in OT with my 25 ranger.  Plus I have leved 2 other toons there.  I don't just play a Shadow Knight.  :)</div></div><hr />
