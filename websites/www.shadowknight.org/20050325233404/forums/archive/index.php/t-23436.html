<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wife and I have new systems but our old boxes are still good for boxing an alt.  Just bought a new home and dont really want to clutter the computer room with extra monitors, keyboards and mice.<br />
<br />
Looking for some advice from anyone that has used a kvm for dual boxing.<br />
<br />
I've used several different KVMs through work - usb, dual heads, IP based, etc...  but they are all for server switching.  I want something that will switch fast for EQ.  I have noticed with some of the USB kvms, there is a bit of a delay when bringing up the &quot;switched to&quot; system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't box at all but I do use an Iogear 4-port KVM that my EQ machine is on.<br />
I can click over to another machine and back to my EQ-view without any fuss.  Basically there is no appreciable delay when switching but there are rare occasions that either the mouse or keyboard will be unresponsive during a particular view; in this case I just quickly cycle through and back to it and it's corrected.<br />
(Not sure why that happens as there's no software involved to get messed up).<br />
<br />
A 2-port KVM is ideal for 2-boxing since you only have to click once for each view, whereas with the 4-porter I have to make more clicks to get back to any one machine.<br />
<br />
The KVM I use is the standard PS/2-type so it's pretty straightforward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the unresposiveness is a power defieiency to the switch.  <br />

Get a powered KVM switch.<br />
<br />
I used to use a belkin home switch, which even switched my speakers between the two, and it wasnt the fastest, but it worked ok.  I didn't use it for two boxing, I used it to switch over to my server that I used as a software dev machine.  Since then, i got a nice laptop to take it's place...and there is a happy college kid who now owns a dual p3-1ghz 3GB SDRAM, with 5 9GB ultra 160 SCSI hard drives, and a Quadro video card....that machine fucking owned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use a KVM 2-port switch.  Actually, when I 2-box, I use 2 separate boxes -- but when I 3-box, the 2nd and 3rd box share the same monitor/keyboard/mouse.  I have a 4th slow box for buffing and at times I do wish that it was on the KVM also (since the 4th box is physically farther away in that I have to stand up and move to it) BUT, as Khat stated, it'd be a pain to cycle thru a 3+ port switch.<br />
<br />
If I had the desk real estate, I'd avoid using one altogether but then again this was the way to go for me when 3-boxing; I think I'd be swivelling around too much otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get a Cybex Switchview.  That's what I use at work, works great, can control via the keyboard.  You hit &quot;ctrl, ctrl, &lt;option&gt;&quot; to switch around.  Used it with EQ when I brought my machine from home, works great.  No lag on switching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Outpost.com ( aka Fry's Electronics ) has a really cheap 2 port KVM that does monitor, mouse, and keyboard. I think the one I picked up is this one (http://shop4.outpost.com/product/3401593) . To switch, there is a button on the device or you can hit the scroll lock key twice, then either up or down arrow. When I 3 box, this is what I use to share the monitor, etc, amoung my 2 computers hosting the boxed toons, while I play my SK on my main machine. Pretty fast and easy to switch &amp; play, esp since I have most actions hotkeyed ( /assist me, /target me then /follow, etc ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use a KVM to switch between XP and Linux, 2 port Belkin USB, although I don't dual box with it.  Device recognition time varies from 2-4 seconds when switching to the XP machine (0-1 second when switch to the Linux one).  Very rarely, XP will not recognize the Keyboard and Mouse when I'm switching to it [the XP computer] forcing me to hit the reset button, and it doesn't seem to be related to whether EQ is running or not.  Linux has never failed to recognize the keyboard and mouse.  Also, the Belkin model sends its own keyboard codes to the computer (it emulates a keyboard and mouse), which means that the media keys that all recent keyboards have do not work (there is a workaround for this though).<br />
