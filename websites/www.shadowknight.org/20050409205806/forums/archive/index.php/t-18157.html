<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">didnt find anything.<br />
We think we may be ready to go after TT.<br />
I read this strat guide - http://www.scienceofwar.net/strats/terristhule/<br />
<br />
I think we can handle it, but the butterfly spawn sounds like a pita.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if they are zone wide aggro...I was wondering if we could pull or move TT to the zone in or somewhere far away from the butterflies.<br />
<br />
Anyone know or try this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cant move TT out of her hall<br />

butterflies:<br />
try to group them around chanters chain stunning while nukers aoe them</div></div><hr />

And if you are looking for strategy for xx mob i dont think Sk board is a good place for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That strat you posted is right on, actually.  TT's tethered to her room, so you can't move her away.  Other than that, follow that thingie to the letter and you'll win win win!<br />
<br />
btw, the line that says &quot;Terris Thule is unimportant while any single butterfly is alive.&quot;  should be in bold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just breezed over the guide, so this is probably redundant.<br />
<br />
The fight is easy.  Seriously, if you can kill anything in Ssra, this will be cake.  The second the butterflies spawn, everyone gets off TT and congregates at the enchanters.  Everyone except the MA must be near the lockdown.  AE them down.  If any straglers dont make it into the lockdown, have your knights/rangers pull them in (get used to this, this is an important role we have.  positioning mobs). <br />
<br />
Back on TT.  Take note:  DA/HS will protect you from the AE dispell.  If you have this spell up, might as well use it.  Anyways, re-MGB the important stuff (clarity, haste, virt, focus) for the lame classes that dont get invulnerability.  We would assign 4 knights to kite the gargs.  They pop, agro and run around (do a drive by HT on Terris  =P).  Bring them in one at a time after TT dies.  Hail PP.<br />
<br />
Butterflies and dispell are the only two considerations.  Thats how we used to do it, handle them how you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just did TT a couple nights ago for the first time, some things to add.  Butterflies arent that big a problem, just need to ae them, seems like only magic spells landed(no fire/ice). melee push them under terris skirt so they get bunched together while terris takes spalsh damage.  The ae dispell kinda sucks, save your mgbs.  ANd the garg spawned for us at 40-35 life.  Id suggest kiting them, they are unsnaible, but are slow.  You can kite them outside of her room.  You could tank them i guess, but kiting them is pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah assign a kite team to the Gargs (with an extra person in case a kiter goes down).<br />
<br />
Precall your targets of course so that no one grabs someone else's Garg.<br />
<br />
Tell your raid to watch their health. Low HPs brings the gargs wading into the raid. <br />
<br />
Grab em and bring them outside, kiting back and forth, until it's time to bring yours in.<br />
<br />
Have a 5th out there keeping an eye on things in case someone goes down so they can grab their Garg if the raid isn't ready for it yet.<br />
<br />
Make sure your kiters get an SOE after dispell or have them make sure it's buried on slot 15 or 14 or something so they don't lose it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this last week and went very smoth.<br />
<br />
To add whats been said about the gargs, have each kiter assigned to a garg and be watching it after the AOE dispell.  It will begain to move when it becomes targetable so you have a few secs to target and throw an agro spell on it if you are a kiter.  We kited inside the room along the wall in a clockwise motion.  If you got mana you can toss some dots onto your garg as well to help eat it down while you are kiting. (Mine was the next to last one to be pulled in and I had it down to 90% life with only ignight blood, vampiric bond and pet after TT went down)<br />
<br />
One other pt is that the only AOE that TT does is dispell so you can use your pet, mine lived through out the entire event from zone in till TL out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaotix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all the advice.<br />
My guild is a bit short on mgb aa's right now..but we'll start putting together a plan.<br />
Im glad you told me she doesnt leave the hall...or we probly would have tried pulling her out and got wiped trying to get her to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just move your raid out of the lair at around 53% and let the range damage take her over the the edge to around 48% and move your raid in again. Only MT and healers for the MT stay. After the dispell rebuff the MT and the healers asap. That way you dont have to wast your MGBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Braellar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Last time i tryed TT was no spot to avoid dispell even if outside. (maybe i was standing to close)<br />
<br />
Take advice and flip harmshield if you want your buffs up, can take all the garg's outside then transfer to one kiter in a pinch then kite them back inside. (i always found it easyer to kite inside than outside, just used outside for targeting reasons.)<br />
<br />
Brae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just get a sexy troll to take her on a night on the town, get her drunk, boink her and before she sobers up you can be gone with the flag.<br />
<br />
TT isn't that hard, just have fun and dont concentrate on the tactics too much, just use trial and error. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the butterflies are your big chance to use word of spirit for crippling ae damage :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maranthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How many level 65s in HoT/Vindi/PoS Tower gear are needed to do this bad girl.  She has been asking for a spanking I swear :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
very important the kiters here<br />
make sure they know exactly what to do</div></div><hr />

<br />
30 or more, for your first try at least.  TT's dps isn't *that* big, but it can be a problem if(when) the clerics start getting beat on by the butterfly's.  It can also be a problem if healers start getting summoned before all the butterfly's are dead and you lose some of your healing / dps power because of them.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you're just starting TT this will happen, it happened to the guild I'm in, and we are normally pretty good about agro.</div></div><hr />
