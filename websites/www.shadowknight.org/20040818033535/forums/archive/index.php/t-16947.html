<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, long time reader, first time poster.<br />
I am a 53 Iksar SK, found out about the OT hammer recently and read on how I can get it.  Another thread somewhere said to get DE Illusion and turn in TONS of braids, well I accumulated over 160 Braids (put alot of my stuff in the bank on a alt to hold all of it) and got DE Illusion and I'm still Threatening.  In my earlier lvls I hunted in KC before I found out about this quest, so I probally screwed it up.  Not wanting to give up I tried to turn them in with IVU and no go there. <br />
Now my question is, is there ANY way to raise OT faction besides turning in braids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can kill the Kunark dragons, think they give OT faction, but I am not completely sure on that. Otherwise there isn't one that i know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paegan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeap I read somewhere that Kunark dragons give +100 OT (VS) faction. Just have to tag em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a Puppet String and charm the NPC for the quest. Bring a someone along for debuffing the NPC and voila you get your hammer without thinking about any faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Three methods that I know of to raise OT faction.<br />
<br />
1. Braids quest.  I can't do this at the moment because I'm KOS.<br />
<br />
2. Kill the three Kunark dragons.  Gorenaire, Sevelak, Talendar.  This will take a couple weeks, but it works.  Kill ten or so of these guys and you are non-kos again.  Not my preferred method though.<br />
<br />
3. Kill stuff in Veeshan's Peak.  I plan to farm the heck out of Veeshan's Peak, mostly for laughs, but also just to get to be non-KOS to The Overthere without trashing my max ally sarnak faction (even warmly to the sarnaks in The Overthere... guess I turned in a LOT of mt. death mineral salts and green goblin skins).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as an iksar , i just did my hammer using a puppet string (drops in fear from memory).  Pulled him out, cast aura twice with resists, said, screw it, put the jade on cursor, clicked him with the puppet string, charmed, hand him the thing, less than a sec later charm broke, but i had my hammer.  <br />
<br />
Let a guild monk use my strings, he got a hammer but used a few charges.  Then a week later, while he was smithing, he somehow thought it was his smithing hammer and destroyed it.  He finished off the puppet string without getting a charm to stick.  He started having the DT's and ended up buying another puppet string for alot of money.  And got his hammer back.<br />
<br />
In order to charm him, 'YOU' have to be the one to cast the charm, as you need amiable not indifferent faction.  I dont know if there is any other way to boost your faction after a charm by someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dignitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never tries it myself and so i am not sure if it works on this specific quest, but it works at some other places. <br />
<br />
Get someone to cast &quot;Harmony&quot; on the captain so you can get close and offer him the braids. Then come back and tell us if it worked. It wont work if the quest requires a specific faction standing to have the captain accept them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">get a chanter to charm captain grimrot he will now be indiff to you and you will be able to hand those braids in and raise your faction normally. or as others have said use puppet stings on the foreman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You no longer receive faction adjustments from charmed mobs - money, XP, and items work fine on charmed mobs, but no faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After hearing I could get the OT hammer by using puppet strings, I started checking the bazaar almost daily for them. Looked for months on end. Found one guy selling them for 100k, I passed. Then after about 4 months of looking I found some for 10k, so I quickly bought them. Now I got them, woohoo!<br />
<br />
Aura of darkness got resisted on  me too, so I just cast it anyway, charm broke after a second the first time, resisted entirely the second time, and then finally the third time, I had the jade on my curser ready to turn in the moment it landed the third time, so only burned three charges doing it. Still have 7 charges left, but I'll safe those for close friends. I don't plan to re-sell it, though I'm sure I could get my 10k back even with only 7 charges left.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you if you want to do this quest. It's a dang fine item to have!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can vendor recharge puppet string btw.  I think it was 500 pp or so.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying that puppet strings will no longer work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, he is saying that puppet strings work for getting the hammer, but you can't use them to turn in braids and get faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, killed Faydedar a couple times with guild and buddies still bad faction, and killing other dragons in the guild im in is not feasable at this time, so Anyone on the ECI server have the puppet strings?  If so can I 'use' them to get Hammer?  Will pay you 5k just for the use of the strings for this part, will give back after I get the hammer (1-3 charges is what its looking like on this board to get it).  If so look me up online or reply here.  <br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He pretty darn resistant, even after a tash from a 59 chanter took 2 attempts beofre charm landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Recharge them?  How do you recharge the puppet strings?  I'd be interested since I'm about to buy some to do this quest. (it's almost impossible to get faction up as an iksar with max ally Chardok faction kept intact).<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hey Vezax,<br />
<br />
I just tried a vendor recharge.  My puppet strings were eaten.  Luckily I already got hammer, but puppet strings were only half used, so I lost about 5k there attempting.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
I'd suggest others don't try it either unless they are wanting to lose theirs too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ack guildy was able to recharge his like 3 months ago =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The vendor recharge was nerfed in the last patch.  Here is the quote from the patch:<br />
<br />
&quot;Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant's list. Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked. NOTE: This will remove the ability to &quot;recharge&quot; items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back. &quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cft2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">IF all you want to do is turn in the braids, ask a chanter or necro to charm the turn in guy for you.  If someone else charms a mob, it's indifferent to you (unless your attacking them on a PvP server I guess).<br />
<br />
If YOU charm the mob, you get amiable faction with the mob.  So if you can charm the gate hammer turn in guy, you can skip the briads altogether.  Dunno what the prices are for puppet strings, now that recharging has been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As was previously stated, you recieve no faction adjustments for completing a quest with a charmed mob. Thus, a necro charming rottgrime for braid hand-ins would be useless, unless you're just dying for that shield.<br />
<br />
I am VERY curious as to whether lulling/harmonying Rottgrime, and handing in braids while KOS, would work. Anyone care to give it a try? (You'd probably have to pull him away from the outpost first.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sagoth Grimreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wanted to get the hammer for my ikky bl and couldn't find a chanter around and didn't wanna pay 50+k for some strings so I just spent 150p on a troll illusion potion.  The potion brought my faction up to dubious and was able to hand in an inventory full of braids and that brought my un-modified faction up to dubious so now I can hand in braids without any illusion.  <br />
<br />
Lot more work then just doing the charm trick, but works in a pinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gargar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Anyone know if the hide/invis trick that's mentioned in the IC walktrough will work to get the OT hammer?  Cant find any puppet strings and i made the goofy as mistake of trying to get it AFTER i spent a few afternoons in KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>cauchy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">no.  You need amiable, not to mention he's undead anyway, so it wouldn't work anyway.  My guildmate bought some puppet strings, split up the cost 10 ways with other guildmates who wanted a hammer, then organized to have a shaman, ench and bard all debuff the foreman.  I don't think a single charge was wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Undr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just to clear up a bit of confusion on my part, if you don't have non-KOS faction with OT, do you just train the book to PoK after using the hammer to gate?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">This sucks.  No puppet strings in bazaar.  Can't catch any Kunark dragons up to tag and FD in zone until someone kills it.  I'm going to get myself a froglok essence and spawn Fay when the NPC is up and duo the fugger with my druid friend.  It has come down to this, hehehe.  Can't wait to see how it turns out myself.  Druid epic???  DENIED!!! I have your precious sea water right here!  So if you're on Xegony server and want to save your precious dr00d's chances, send me a tell in game if you're slaying a Kunark dragon I could tag please (Being evil is so cool).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wait until 7:00pm game time when the Dragoons leave the Outpost to slaughter mobs and/or players.  Darkness pull Rottgrime (he WILL resist it, but it's the aggro timer you want), marines will add, FD when Rottgrime is close (you'll get hit several times), wait for marines to leave...<br />
<br />
Here's the tricky part, but with practice, it works (did for me):<br />
<br />
With Rottgrime solo, set up a hotkey for sit/stand and one for hide.  Put a braid on your cursor, quickly hit the stand hotkey, then initiate trade with Rottgrime with one braid, then hit the hide hotkey.  If all goes well, you'll be standing in front of him, hidden with a trade window open.  If he attacks you, hide did not work, hit escape and FD again and retry the hotkey combo.  If he did not aggro you, put three more braids in, click give.  You get faction.  FD, try process again.<br />
<br />
It's imperative that you wait until 7:00pm or later game time.  If the Dragoons are still at their spawn points, they WILL aggro you off Rottgrime and will beat the hell out of you.  Since you are going to get beat on a bit by Rottgrime during the method I described, get some HP buffs before attempting.<br />
<br />
This does work, I've been doing it off and on for the last few weeks during free time to raise faction to finially get my hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for this thread.  <br />
<br />
I found some puppet strings in the bazaar for 5 K that showed up on the link as 10 charges.  I bought them and they were empty, haha, don't I feel screwed. Oh well.  Later on I went to Swamp of no Hope and retrieved a Froglok Essence for myself with the help of a Druid friend.  I've killed 3 Faydedar's now.  The fist 2 I did with my Druid friend and soloed the 3rd.  Codslayer is a 12 hour spawn so I can get in 2 a day when I'm not at work or if someone didn't beat me to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">That sig is way freaking huge - shocked Brael hasn't said anything yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah I'm going to shrink it, just that everytime I get home from work I completely forget and start playing EQ instead.  Damn addicts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slea'zie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well a month or so ago a dwarf pally in my guild wanted the hammer and fraction. What we did is with my main(62 chanter at the time) we went in invis, he lulled all the skellies(this is when lull spells lasted like 10 mins) then i rooted and mezed the captian, then the pally did hand in and he said he got fraction hits, when mez would wear off the cap was rooted so i would just reup mez and root, the pally reuped the lull's on the skellies ever so often and we stood their a long time doing hand in's seemed to work. Now I have no idea if this still works or not but at that time it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Perhaps get a higher lvl necro in there to charm Rottgrime then lead him out of the fort, then hand in braids to your hearts content.<br />
<br />
Personally, at higher lvl, OT Outpost is pretty useless, and you can still use your gate hammer w/o a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
Tho I did notice after last patch a new encampment showed up on the north shore of OT with a small ship nearby. No mobs there yet tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lynndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As a DE you'd think I get along fine in the Outpost..wrong. was pl'd by a friend at a young age of 17 to 19 on Ogre Island in TD, went to OT to sell loot from ogres and found I am KOS.<br />
<br />
  So you want a good faction with this town. WHY? it sucks..high prices, low purchace prices, stuck-up npcs. Spells may be purchased elsewhere. You want a hammer to proc you into this town? Bah..invest 20 to 40pp on pottery and get you a Thurgadin potion. much better prices, huge variety of items, better all around town.<br />
<br />
  I helped kill Fayder seven times...did not notice a difference in factions to OT.<br />
<br />
  Epic? Windblade beats epic. also, you can do 2 faction adjusters in Odus to get your epic without doing the armour hand-in in OT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>natus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Lynndar said:<br />

<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because it may just save you a death sometimes.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because sometimes you don't have 10 seconds to wait while you consume a gate potion charge.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because it's a proc and not a spell cast, no risk of interruption.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because you never have to bank Velium vials or prepare them in advance.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because you can be anywhere and then be in Pok within 30 seconds - 1 minute, depending on zone times.  You don't have to zone from Thurg &gt; GD and then run to PoK book.  You hammer a mob, proc, arrive in OT and haul ass to the PoK book, which is shorter than running from Thurg waterfall &gt; book.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because it really motivates you to train 2 HB prior to level 50.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because there will be times when you don't have a Thurg gate potion handy.<br />
<br />
Why you ask?  Because Howling Stones is in OT.  A friend or your guild might need you to be in SF to help kill Ragefire or BW to kill Ixiblat.  Or you want to go to Chardok. Or Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
The majority of the time I use it it procs in the first couple of swings.  And its not like you're going to stay in the outpost to resupply, its just a minor layover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tymor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Why?  For alot of the points mentioned above.  It is well worth the time investment, provided you haven't trashed your VS faction previously.  With a ranger bot it took me about 5 hours of farming braids to get enough faction to do the quest.  That is as a human SK.  Invest five hours for an uninteruptable, combat usable gate item?  Yup.</div></div><hr />
