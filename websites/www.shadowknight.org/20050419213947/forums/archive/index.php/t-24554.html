Paladins too, but just a touch better, mostly faster casting. New slows too for slowing classes. It's the start of the class re-envisioning, let's see where it leads I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The new slows are level 69 and have innate resist modifiers listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i bet we get less than nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lzert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not bad.  Minor changes really.<br />
<br />
The slows are nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd guess the slows are Beastlord slows if they have a new resist check, rather than new shammy ones.<br />
<br />
BL's are the only slow-casting class that can't debuff prior to slowing (shammy = malo + slow / chanter = tash + slow) and the shammies seem to have a small bonus with Balance of the Nihil's resist mod already (not to mention disease slow, ae slow, etc).<br />
<br />
That would be my guess.  Haven't heard one way or another but am familiar with the BL's issues list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shamans should probably receive an upgrade to their patch heals now... the new pally patch heals will be about the same as shamans'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to mention the upgrade on touch of piety's cast time puts it squarely in competition with our lifetaps.  This means our self healing capability falls even further behind pally combat healing.  The healing portion our taps could use adjustment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fixed lower level Terror line, Spears resist adjustment (and hopefully unlinking of the GoD &amp; OoW spears).<br />
Personally, thats my guess about whats going to change for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not to mention the upgrade on touch of piety's cast time puts it squarely in competition with our lifetaps.  This means our self healing capability falls even further behind pally combat healing.  The healing portion our taps could use adjustment.<br />
<br />
Just remember, re-envisioning means they can always change where they view our heals at, like instead of us equalling ranger heals, ranger heals roughly equalling paladin heals and being slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is class tweaking. Since we're currently doing ok, nows a good time to get something tweaked for elegance sake so that we don't get nerfed via everyone BUT us getting an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Base harmtouch should go up by 30/level or more after 60.  It's just silly that it doesn't.<br />
<br />
The level 55 disc should affect all our dd's, not just HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i bet we get less than nothing<br />
<br />
Nah man, they're going to give back Voice Graft!<br />
<br />
It is refreshing that the game has calmed down to the point that it is at now.  Does anyone realize the shitstorm this would have caused 2 to 3 years ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>paustin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you mean like the shitstorm over the server merges...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Like... shrink your sig or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wonder how they will distribute these new spells. Put them on a vendor?<br />
<br />
On that note, I think it's time for GoD spells to be researchable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Most of them are changes, not new spells.  The new slows will probably be OoW runes.</div></div><hr />
