<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some of the character models are pretty bad, but I don't mind the dark elves.  They look a lot better in the preview movies and screenshots from sane angles than they do on the main EQ2 website.  Those shots seem to have been taken from a funky angle that makes them look a little squished.  Ogres and Trolls look pretty bad to me, but the rest of the races look alright.</div></div><hr />

They are a bit cartoony, if they made them a little more natural looking, id be happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The best thing about the gomes is that they can wear glasses.  Oddly enough, the characters just seem to look a lot better in videos of gameplay than they do in a stillshot.  I have no idea why that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaclav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stillshots almost always look worse if you use untouched gameplay stills for most engines these days.... untouched gameplay stills are rare for companies to use however.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shine of the armors and sometimes in screenshots even the light affecting the skin makes me think all these characters are puppets made of plastic.. :(<br />
No pigments and details on the skin...<br />
Whoreage II had hott Darkelves! Yah liked em, :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My sides were hurting from laughing when I first saw the EQ2 models.  The dark elves in those shots look ok but the rest is really goofy, plus I heard there will be sections of town where you have to jump and break a box to get copper pieces.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, I am really un-impressed with how EQ2 races look at all.  Their is something about them that just looks really bad.  Elves in gernerial don't look agile or gracefull but more clumsy.  I am looking at WoW vs. EQ2 and personaly I look the look of WoW more.  Can only hope that they upgrade the races in general for EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All of the races look like their heads are too small for their bodies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still say they nead to hire the guys that did the models and character creation bit for City of Heroes. CoH probably has the sharpest models and greatest diversity I've seen out of any game thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fuck EQ2 and Fuck their gay-assed uninspired character designers/modellers.<br />
<br />
Alot of that crap looks like someones half-assed 1st time submission resume, never understood why they skimped on their character designs and animations so much on a game that is predominantly character based.<br />
<br />
Typical lack lustre sony I've come to know and hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Erudites... where the fuck is my forehead???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I've seen a recent video of EQ2 with a ring of player characters, and I must say I don't really agree with all that is said here. I think they've done a good job. They are not perfect but they look good, are animated correctly and have a great diversity of animations and customizable look.<br />
Well, that's what I thought when I saw the video of actual game sequences.<br />
I'll judge for myself later if I ever purchase the game, which I doubt for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slivers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The models definately look better in full motion than static screenshots ... this has a lot to do with light reflection and is very typical of animations from a few years back.  If you saw a static screen shot of a character from the original Shrek, or better yet A Bug's Life, you would notice the same &quot;plastic&quot; look.<br />
<br />
With that said, I do believe the character models themselves leave a lot to be desired.  Similarily, this is the same crappy presentation that exists in their magazine ads and the in-game load screens.  The current F.V. looks like hell compared to the original artwork; not to mention all the characters in the EQ2 ads ... whomever the art VP/Director is that is giving this direction should be canned ASAP.  <br />
<br />
Ironically, this is almost all due to the original art person leaving SOE a year or so back (I cannot remember the name, but I believe LDoN was the first magazine and box art done by w/o them).  I'm also 90% sure this person landed at .... Sigil.  <br />
<br />
Small world.</div></div><hr />

Always hated dark elves anyway.. but I agree the Trolls look like shit and most of the plate armor looks like oven mitt material</div></div><hr />

This is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to Vanguard, at least I know that I'll like the artwork.  The first few pieces of artwork to come out after that guy left were really bad, especially the stuff on the Gates of Discord box.  The newest artwork doesn't like as bad to me, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The guy you're talking is Keith Parkinson. he made all cover art for eq until PoP I think. But he was not art director for EQ.<br />
He is art director for Vanguard tho, and that means that the game will at least be beautiful !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, Askeer, I couldn't recall his name and it was bothering me.  His style is unique, but not overdone.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to Vanguard as well, however, I'm guessing it is still 2+ years away.  Christmas 2006 anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think i saw the same EQ2 movie as Askeer. It was on a fansite EQ2vault maybe? Can't remember. <br />
<br />
Anyway i'd say the characters look decent enough to play now though i don't think they're terribly inspired or anything. The fightscene in the movie still had the characters doing that weird bow-legged stance that you see in some of the EQ2 screenshots. So i don't know if i think the animations look up to scratch yet, but i expect they'll be altered too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>vex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, it seems a lot of you are unhappy about the models. Do me a favor and post on those boards.... cause the people posting there now about it LOVE them - and that's what the devs see.<br />
<br />
It's not just looks... I wonder if that's what happened with tech stuff too. They got just a few bad ideas from the people that trolled the eq boards rather than the class boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's half half to me.<br />
<br />
At least they got the armor right, as far as adding to the bulk of the player right.<br />
<br />
they also seem to ahve reasonable upper body motion, but the lower body motion I ahve ssn from combat stills kinda sucks..when you swing a sword, you sually shift your weight a bit...not stand there like a tree dropping a branch.<br />
<br />
Now, I hghly doubt SoE will ever get someone that can model proper legs...but oh well...just make up for it by making sure we get single-player content through most of the levels of the game at least.  that way folks who work too damn much can actually get ....(OMFG)....LEVELS!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Considering that they've released that character creation CD, it's probably too late to get them to change the character models.  That said, don't judge them too harshly until you can see them in motion for yourself.  I'm not saying they're perfect, but they're not bad, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Xakkoriz DragoonLord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The Beast races and the trolls and ogres look good :) but the human like races are plastic looking... I'm still gettin the game... it looks cool.</div></div><hr />
