<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have two ideas which I have been kicking around for a little while that I would like to see implemented into the game. Wondering what everyone else would think about them.<br />
<br />
The first one deals with shields and is pretty simplistic. We can make it more complex if needs be for balance issues.<br />
<br />
Give paladins and shadow knights the same five percent mitigation warriors have innately when we use shields. <br />
<br />
If that is too simplistic than maybe we could base it around alternate advancement. Call it Greater Shielding and make it available in increments. Perhaps the first increment will grant you a two percent mititgation, the second would be five, and the third would be seven. Might have to open the option up to warriors if you go this route since the third increment would place us above them in terms of mitigation.<br />
<br />
Just a loose idea though. I will let those more experienced in our class tool around with it some if they think it is a decent suggestion.<br />
<br />
The second idea deals with magic resistances. Have them work like skills. I am thinking like Offense and Defense. You would not be able to raise them with trainers but they would improve in combat when you are subjected to spells which are checked against a certain resist. This would give melee classes an edge when fighting casting classes since we are the ones upfront taking all of the damage. Innate resist skill ups would rock on every server and I am sure that those on player kill servers would definitely love it (except for the casters who rule over there at the moment). <br />
<br />
Above and beyond all else I think this would finally address the power issues between casters and melee classes. <br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

Dude, that is a great idea.<br />

Apparently, that seems to be true. So simple in fact, they never thought of it.</div></div><hr />
