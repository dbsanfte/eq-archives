<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">dropped at 7pm EST on Tarew Marr<br />
<br />
2 groups, MT was 62 pally, cleric was 60 ended fight with 60m<br />
<br />
we had overkill and was a very easy fight....i landed 3 spears 1 Ltap, summoned chanter. i think most of the casters were just resisted....mage couldnt get Malosi(sp) to stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zruky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Errr.... gratz?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dropped Kurron Ni on Stromm Wed  13 Aug. Made some notes. Sorry it took so long to put up.<br />
<br />
Took half Damage from Spear of Pain, Harm Touch and other nukes from group.<br />
<br />
Was resistant to spells but not immune.<br />
<br />
Kurron is positioned so even races who are KOS in the Outpost can help out with hit. Just have them swim around the Eastern sea wall, there are no mobs to aggro. When he runs (more of a limp), he heads for the beach so no problem with adds there either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dachande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This just in, you can save your time and money and not do this part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bradven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yay!  You can spend lots of fun time running seals!  weee!<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather kill the lil bitch.  The epic is a LOOOONG road as it is so a few fights and a few k of plat is just a bump in the road.  For me, and I'm just talking me now, it's worth it to have the quest played out in it's entirety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dachande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Running seals is a waste of time you can avoid as well, weeeeeeeeeee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hudroponik_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Solo this punk at 65 ~ hit me once for 7 and once for 42 .. first time i took him i didnt know what to expect, brought 65;s for overkills .. he dropped in like 5 sec ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Doryshan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks Dachande, the shorted quest info is good. I read the abreviated epic that was posted and chose to do the full quest. It is what I like most about EQ.</div></div><hr />
