Only caveat is gating mobs can be a bitch if you're not careful.  Pick your favorite spot and go own it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oagan</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend making them the same race, if possible (like troll or ogre).  That will allow you to go to the same cities for spells, etc.  But others are right.  With a good shaman, you can go just about anywhere a full group of equal level can go.  It will just take longer to kill things.<br />
<br />
Get to lvl 10 asap.  Head to Paludal until about lvl20.<br />
Head to Mistmore - Is now a &quot;hotspot&quot; with xp modifier the same as paludal.  Stay there till 25-30.<br />
Head to Splitpaw - another hotspot. Stay till 35.<br />
Head to Gunthak - another hotspot till 40<br />
Head to Dulak's - another hotspot till 50<br />
Head to Nadox - go through the luggald temple in Gunthak to avoid the lava.  Another hotspot.  As a two-box, this will give you great xp until 60.  At about 55, head down to the undead, or do the luggalds on the other side of the bridge.<br />

Post 60 - PoP</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelyan</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Between PoK, your home city (really not a big deal if home cities are different, PoK books take you there anyway), and somewhere in Luclin (Echo Caverns for SKs, I think some shammy spells are in Shar Vahl), all your buyable spells are taken care of, so its really not that big a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After a couple years of trying I finally got my wife to play. (Thank you Sony for the new tutorial...lol) She started a froggy (cuz they are cute according to her) shammy and I did an Ogre SK.<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to leveling up with her.<br />
