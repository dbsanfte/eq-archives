<br />
take keen notice of Black Shroud. I wonder if SA will affect any portion of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ummm....<br />
<br />
The absolute only differences between Spear of Decay (lvl 64) and the new Spear of Murram (lvl 65) are the Level, Mana, and Damage.<br />
The difference is so negligible that it's worthless, unless you consider stacking it in your spell lineup.<br />
Even then it's hardly considered a true good spell worth keeping memmed.<br />
<br />
LVL 64 SoD: 225 MANA, 600dmg<br />
LVL 65 SoM: 247 MANA, 660dmg<br />
<br />
Big friggin whoop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>belize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok so black shroud is some sort of shroud of chaos like spell...but acts as a 1 hour long dot on me. i'll have to wait and see info on proc rate, and proc damage before i judge this one.<br />
<br />
mental horror is nice. 1 hour version of mental clarity is nice. even better if it does more damage/taps more mana.<br />
<br />
well, if i'm not wasting a slot on MC, i could add the new spear i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like the the Black Shroud doesn't stack with Mental Corruption though.  If it is better than Mental corruption, it might be worth it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so mental horror = 65 dd +110 mana ? with sa3 195 dd+110 mana?<br />
<br />
black shroud= 0dd+100 mana/hp seems pretty inferiour to both SoC and MC/MH. now if they add 65dd or something  to it i think will be nice too bad sa wont effect recourse =\.<br />
<br />
slight improvement for me on the MH since it will last an hour and i can stop using SoC and load 2 spears i guess heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depending on when you veiwed them last, they have changed - Black Shroud is now a 75pt lifetap proc only. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Khat.. You might think the difference is neglectible between lvl 64 and 65 spears. That is true for single blasters but decent upgrade for double blasting SKs.<br />
<br />
I almost always keep 2 spears up of 600 and 400 hp so I can double blast those every 45 seconds. With that new spear, I would use 660 and 600.  1k blast per 45 seconds (22 dps) upgraded to 1260 per 45 sec (28 dps) (6 nice spell dps increase) is decent upgrade to me. Heck, spears alone are one of popular spell that we use everyday along with zbite, proc spells, COL, BOH and, heh, of course, DP. SOE is trying to upgrade POPULAR SK spells and improve them which is nice than they trying to improve our least popular spells maybe like improved inv to undead, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have to disagree with you there - I never use spears. IMO, they are inefficent, not to mention resisted a lot. The average lifespan of an XP mob ( say LDoN all 65 adventure, Tatics group, whatever ) is 30-45 seconds in my groups. Since I am my groups tank, I always have the following lineup of spells:<br />
(1) CDa - aggro<br />
(2) FDa - snare a runner<br />
(3) ToI<br />
(4) ZB<br />
(5) AoH<br />
(6) FD<br />
(7) PoH<br />
(8) -depends- ( AoP, AugD, HS, etc )<br />
About the only time I use spears is hunting lower levels to kill runners.<br />
<br />
So far, the only spell that has peaked my interest was Black Shroud, and now its just an upgrade to SoC. At best ( crit &amp; ex heal ) we are talking 10*3 ( SA ) * 2 ( crit ) * 2 ( ex heal ) = 120 more hp on rare occasions. At max dex, I want to say I see ~1/6 ( guesstimate of course ) of my procs either crit or ex heal ( not both ) so only looking at 60 more HP every how many minutes? =/ Have to run - finish post tomorrow. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Manr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spear is not popular with me.  I do use it but only occasionally.  And never more than one of them.  It's very mana hungry and I just can't chain it and sustain my mana for duration of clearances at raids or groups.  Only use it for boss fights.<br />
<br />
I always have BoH up.  Very good spell.  Deserves upgrade with new expansion.<br />
<br />
I always have FD up.  Deserves FD AA hotkey so I can put another spell in.  Hey, maybe a spear.<br />
<br />
I always have HS up.  Don't need it upgraded but if it was, would be good too.  How about that HS AA hotkey?<br />
<br />
I have ZBite up when I don't fight disease immune mobs.  Very good spell.  Although groups notice it only when you have 3 SKs in the same group.<br />
<br />
I have Festering up most of the time.<br />
<br />
I have Aura of Hate up most of the time.<br />
<br />
I have Touch of Innoruuk up most of the time.<br />
<br />
I have Shroud of Chaos up most of the time.  Only replace it to cast Cloak if I need it or Mental Corruption when I need extra mana.<br />
<br />
And our current new spells are dissapointing.  Only ZBite upgrade was good at some point.  Don't know what they did with it now.<br />
<br />
New AAs are just terrible.  Self summon corpse, EE res, FD are the type of AA skills I'd like.  Anything that upgrades our DPS or defense is good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd read elsewhere that Recovery might be a self only componentless corpse summon.  I think Recovery is one of the new AA's without a correct description in the strings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soltisce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">neglecting your spears is like disliking DPS. like Brael i always have 2 memmed for double blasts. i never unmem them, with ID4 i do about 800dmg with just 2 of spears, not to mention my normal DPS, if i didnt use spears id lose alot of damage, i like the new spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khaguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only 8 spell gems... it's a constant trade-off between versatility and being effective in only one way, along with driving yourself crazy if you happen to keep switching spells during split-second downtimes.<br />
<br />
Moreso in LDoN than other places, because there's no set time-limit aside from always wanting faster xp elsewhere, you really want DPS.  Look at your spell line-up... this is what it would look like for maximum DPS, factoring in the new DD.  We have to assume you don't need any FDs for pulling and are in a situation where you don't need it to save your own hide.  Being able to keep yourself healed + having a class that can save you if an accident happens, for example.  I'm not saying it'll be 100% safe, but...<br />
<br />
1. ToI.  You want a tap up there, it's mini burst DPS that can also save your skin if you need it.<br />
<br />
2-4. Your 3 highest spears.<br />
<br />
5. BoC.<br />
<br />
6. ZB.<br />
<br />
7. CD / fear.<br />
<br />
These two aren't related to YOUR DPS, but... there's no reason not to keep ZB running.  Effective FTX and regen XX to your groupmates is still DPS.  If you can get by without snap aggro, heck, you can swap out the CD/fear for a spell that keeps dropping.  If you have a chanter mana buff, then that's only really either your pet's buff (avoidable) or your spell proc buff.<br />
<br />
8. BoD if it's necessary to keeping yourself running.  However, assuming the SK is focusing on DPS, we can pretend that self-healing is a complete side-effect and not what we're shooting for.  (Self healing's only really valid in LDoN normals, anywhere else with decent XP it's hard or impossible to pull off)  That said, possibly stick in AoH here (trade-off between increased DPS or getting AoP's AC boost in here).<br />
<br />
Now... there're some spells that die off fast.  MC and pact of hate come to mind, as well as our self pet buff.  You don't have an 'extra' slot up there, per-se, although the last one is the most variable, not as strictly tied to DPS.  Depending on which spells you need to keep casting yourself, you'd need to either decide to keep switching out spell gems, or remove a spell from the above line-up (probably the lowest spear) and swap in the buff.<br />
<br />
The problem with a DPS set-up like that?  Your mana.  You might find yourself slipping too fast.  Losing mana over time is okay, especially in a LDoN, where if you end the adventure with mana remaining, that was (as a SK) DPS lost.  In an exp group elsewhere, assuming a constant stream of mobs, variable shifting of the mana supply's okay, shouldn't keep yourself full so if there *IS* a break, you're not sitting there twiddling your thumbs...<br />
<br />
It depends on the SK.  YMMV, especially considering worn FT, AAs and focus effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/mumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I keep one spear memed.  They are nice for when things get bad and you need to take down a mob faster or to regain aggro after you have cast a Fear/Clinging and it hasn't refreshed yet.<br />
<br />
Using Spears on every mob doesn't make sense in places like LDoN where DPS is important as well as never taking a mama break.  Spears just don't have the damage to mana ratio of DoTs.<br />
<br />
If I am puller and MA in LDoN I to stick to aggro, Zeffers and depending on situation BoD, BoH or AoH.  Any more than that and mana drops faster than I can maintain it.  I want mana at 60-80% at all times so that when something DOES go wrong I can use spear, ToI and everything else I got memed in a spasm of destruction.<br />
<br />
I do not key self buffs or pet buffs memed.  I have a spell set called rebuff.  When buffs run out I say 'Rebuffing self' recast them all and load regular spell set again.  This slight delay has never caused a problem and makes for a very short mana break every 20 mintues that most everyone can use to med or replace expired buffs.<br />
<br />
Personally I always try to keep pet buffed too if I have him up.  Skinny does a LOT more damage with Augment Death.  Fear kite a mob with just him doing damage some time both with and without Augment Death and you will notice the difference.  Biggest problem with it is the short duration.<br />
<br />
Another note I always start with FD up till I get a feel for the group.  If they are good (and I'm not FD splitting) I replace FD with another spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spears just don't have the damage to mana ratio of DoTs.<br />
<br />
They don't have the dps or even the ratio of taps either thanks to resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Spears just don't have the damage to mana ratio of DoTs. <br />
<br />
Yeah, spears are a waste because of recast.  Chaining Spear of Decay and Spear of Plague, with 20% DD focus and SCF3 is almost identical to Blood of Hate with no focus at virtually the same mana cost.  Since Blood of Hate gets resisted far less than spears, it's almost always the better choice on fights over 30 seconds.  I'd be far happier with a new DoT than I would be with a new spear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Spear works good for me to help regain aggro.  Usually spear them if taunt fails and they turn will turn them back.</div></div><hr />

I normally have 1 memmed but  I am thinking of changing my line up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I love to use spears cuz they are hardly resisted in the area where I hunt for xp all the time (not in elemental planes). I used 2 spears+1 BOH each mob for nice dps blast. However, when I just got into elemental planes last month (only xp there once cuz my guild is not yet elem flagged except me and 1 other guildie), I noticed that spears got resisted alot more often than tier 2 or 3 ones. That is huge difference and I stopped using spears in PoEarth and started using lifetap more often to compensate. For LDON runs, I still use spears. Spears rock there.. Improving Spear's resist over -100 would help too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">question: how are these spells obtainable on test? via runes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Using Spears on every mob doesn't make sense in places like LDoN where DPS is important as well as never taking a mama break. Spears just don't have the damage to mana ratio of DoTs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
when i do ldon, things just don't live long enough to have dots make any sense at all. not even BoH finsihes, so i don't see how the mana ratio is better. BoH and IB i think are great on long fights because there are numerous miniboss type mobs that dont' resist these.<br />
<br />
the undead nukes we have are fantastic and rarely resisted in the undead ldon zones - mm and guk. however in almost all the existing ldon's (if that's where you are doing your groups currently) there are mobs that do not resist spears and they are well worth having memmed. yes, you need to know which mobs are likely to resist them and which aren't but there aren't many different mob types in those dungeons at least so it's not so bad.<br />
<br />
in rujarkian for example i don't think there is a mob in there that resists spears, in taks the robe casters tend to resist them but the melee and the summoned stuff do not. spears are next to worthless in guk - go taps and undead nukes in there. mm is a mixed bag, i'd go with one undead nuke and one spear, the live mobs don't resist disease very well but spears are worthless on the undead in there. that's ok because you simply switch to your undead nuke. i haven't done enough EF to have any idea.</div></div><hr />
