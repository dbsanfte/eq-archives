<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda a lame question...<br />
<br />
But if you have a choice of any class in the world to twink ya 57+ ... and aaxp and beyond... which would it be?<br />
<br />
<br />
My top 3 are.. <br />
Shaman<br />
Enchanter<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
My logic.....<br />
Xp grinding comes down to kill rate and down time...it really doesn't matter how MUCH hp you have.. but matters more how fast you regain that hp, or how slow you lose that hp. If you're in a fight that the quantity of hp matters ... then you're probably picking a target too tough for xp grinding.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said..<br />
Shaman can increase your kill rate dramatically with focus + celerity and a pet for extra damage, and epic free dot, jbb might KS ya :P. Damage mitigation can't be beat with slow, along with regrowth.. you really shouldn't have any down-time on the appropriate mobs. Also they're probably the fastest in mana downtime control with can4 + torpor + regrowth + fungi. Also with a soul defiler that extra hp regen = mana regen.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can increase your haste even more.. and with C3 is a lot of free sustained damage from sk spells. Yesterday in velks, I was paired with a UBER 60 isk monk, but I had C3 on, he had aego on... and I out tanked him because I was regaining hp faster due to taps, vamp curse through C3. If you get one with dire charm that's a nasty pet to help out in killing faster too. They also have slow as well, and I think with slow + hp from c3 you'd have no downtime either.<br />
<br />
Druid's damage shield at 60 is about 32 dmg per hit? that's pretty solid damage output, free DoT from epic, regrowth?, and PoG to help with mana regen, no where close to C3 though. Damage mitigation may become a factor here because mobs are going full speed at you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What's your favorite?</div></div><hr />

Frankly I think Shamans are the best overall at powering a high level character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarovich</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id go for a shaman, my brother plays one not 60 yet but hes 59. When in sebilis I can usually pull solos and then with his slow/speed/regen and me using fungi and epic never have to heal, unless get more then one mob. Now doing this you dont kill really fast but its safe easy and still good exp for the duo. Jail has to be my favorite spot to do this since there is that safe spot you dont have to worry about any roamers or anything, but NG or disco area is best exp ive had doing this.<br />

<br />
Then gotta pick the right places with my 60 shaman ...<br />
<br />
Was thinking chardok zone in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
(keep in mind i have not used a shammy soo yes im biased ) <br />
<br />
The Chanter by far.... I have found a great place in Scarlet desert for the lvls 53+ and once that place runs low on bluebies I will be in search of another. Anyhow that is just my 2pp<br />
<br />
bye the way Malaegue said all that and then some for me soo no need to repeat :) <br />

Chardok entrance sucks at 60. About 50% is lightblue. If you want do chardok then that castle entrance just below zonein should be ok. Keep root ready for roamers but nothing really to worry there.<br />
<br />
Fungus and velks is prolly better exp if zones not overcamped at least hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good hunting? good to hear..<br />
<br />
Velks is packed as I imagine on every server.. so is seb I'd think.<br />
<br />
How's perma at 60? bears? or HS zone in.. are there enough to kill ? know of 10 spawns at zone in that can be singled.... think I'd chew through that too quickly though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although the general concensus leans towards Shammy, my 'pet' has been druid.  As stated in the previous posts, DS, SoW, Regrowth, HP/AC buffs, Str really help.  However, outdoors and fear kiting, a druid shines with Snare, DoT's, Nukes and druid pet adding small damage for taking that mob down fast.<br />
<br />
I find that the limiter in how fast we as a duo can take down mobs is limited by my mana (so I see how chanter/bard can speed things up too).<br />
<br />
PS - I didn't post to say what class would be best... more to say what class I did it with or am doing it with.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have a bot druid for traveling too... so that's not really an issue...<br />
<br />
Don't forget PoG for druid... that's like 7 mana/tick i think... very very uber :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
but chanter can do just as good..... all a sk need for soloing is mob slowed, but i do very well in FG with just a monk or Rogue, i would rather have dammge dealer cause faster kills better exp =P<br />

Spurn, mind sharing your SD spot with a brother? I have a perma group of:<br />
<br />
52 sk (me<br />
52 cleric<br />
52 druid<br />
52 chanter<br />
52 warrior or wiz<br />
<br />
were are getting tired of  clops in oot and I was thinking about checking our Scarlett. <br />
<br />
With such a well balanced group you are sure to find some easy XP in SD and the place is off the sun reaver camp on the Plateaue. I easily used to fear kite the the mobs with the same exact group as the one you have. The druid would snare of course and I would keep em feared, and it was always fun to use a pet seeing as its hard to get agro since they are all spawned in one area of course.  The extra dmg never hurt and you all should do swell there. Keep us posted on your progress :) any questions just ask!<br />

<br />
I did my first 23 aa points with an Enchanter (friend who had quit) behind me.  Clarity 3, vog, slow, etc.  He wasn't grouped with me.  I was doing 14 Geonids every 15 minutes.  Your epic would keep you healed.  Worked great. :)<br />
<br />
Then they nerfed solo aa.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
With an echanter you shouldnt have any downtime between the mana for taps and the free rune from bedlam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peasley Grunglefunk</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">shaman no doubt, ench is nice, cleric is ok... all 3 is best!</div></div><hr />

<br />
C3 and VoG are all i need<br />
Shaman doesn't really helps me kill faster<br />
And with C3/SA3 i can keep myself healed np most of the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kuruk_xev</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im alittle different :)<br />
<br />
I use my necro to duo with me.<br />
<br />
I never planed on dueing but as it turned out I got another account so I moved the necro. Normal exp mobs are no problem.<br />
<br />
Necro darks, BoD on mob, Pacts to SK as needed and rogue pet adds a ton of extra damage. Usually non stop pulling as the necro never runs out of mana.<br />
<br />
As long as I dont need more than Pact of shadow (~300 hp over 20sec) and shadowbond (~500hp over 20 sec) durring a fight the necro can keep constant pacts on me and deflux as needed to keep his hp up.<br />
<br />
I would even go as far as to say the SK / Necro duo is faster than a SK / Shaman duo. Necro pet, dot and taps really speed up kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peasley Grunglefunk</div><div class="date">04-07-2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shamen help kill faster by cleritity(or however it's spelled), dots, and meleeing. you don't need c3, you just use deathly temptation, or bum c2/3, because you don't have to cast spells (other than an occational tap/atk tap and darkness) because the mobs been slowed so you hardly have to even heal with the shaman.<br />
<br />
allthough having c3/shiss is great... i guess go with whatever you have available =P.</div></div><hr />
