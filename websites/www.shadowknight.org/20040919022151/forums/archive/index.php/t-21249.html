<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lanick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I was wondering if you guys think a Ranger can do 90% of this quest and just have the SK MQ a few parts of it. <br />
<br />
I figured I would get my SK Ghoulbane, and MQ that to get Corrupted Ghoulbane.<br />
<br />
Then, I would have him MQ the Corrupted Ghoulbane for the final turn-in.  <br />
<br />
Do any of you see a problem with this?  I have a SK alt that I think is really fun, but I already have a time-flagged ranger on the same account that would make doing this a lot easier.  <br />
<br />
Thanks guys.  &lt;3 Sk's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">faction might be an issue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having never gotten past the ghoulbane/kurron ni myself, i'm probably not the best person to take advice from, but I would think that a ranger trying to talk to people who do hand-ins for the SK epic..... might not work. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">talking is not required for the handins<br />
<br />
I have seen a druid multiquest parts of it.<br />
<br />
use the invis tricks and all will be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Faction is fixable so long as you are not KOS I believe.<br />
<br />
In fact I dont think a ranger would even have to use Hide since if I recall correctly they get the sneak skill. Just stand behind the mob and hit sneak and you become indifferent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ragnorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i would say yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually i am thinking you may have a problem when the ranger turns in the single pieces.  the npc might tell u to go take a hike just cause you are a ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lanick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far, I did all the darkforge parts, got the cell key from the hole, got the blade of arbrogation from sky, and got Ghoulbane on my SK.  <br />
<br />
I'll finish up the quest in a week or two and post my results!  :)</div></div><hr />
