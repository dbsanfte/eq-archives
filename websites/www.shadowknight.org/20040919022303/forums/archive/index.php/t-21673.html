<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valicar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lies!  I'll believe it after I kill a few drakes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I got my hide!! Just the Soul Leech left to get now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SuDanger68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't know how the feelig is when you hold the epic in hands but i can tell you looting the sword from fear was the most joyfull i had since a long time in eq. (4th fear raid 7 golems, 2 cts...fright dropped it yesterday :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drop rate was increased before.   Yea right.<br />
<br />
Been a 2 year search now for soul leech and decrepit hide for me so far.   Off an on, trip here and there for a few hours each time.<br />
<br />
But with Epic2.0 coming.  it's given me new drive to wanna finally complete my epic before new one arrives.   I've had 98% of it done for 2 years now heh.<br />
<br />
This last week I've spent about 20 hours about, probably I'm guessin 50'ish drakes and nothing so far.    <br />
<br />
I had just gone and cleared a section of spawns and goin for repops just now but then had to log cause they brought only poHate down for brief update hehe doh.<br />
<br />
Hopefully tonight'll be finally lucky night and be done with hide.  /me crosses finger. <br />
<br />
Then onto damn soulleech.   sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">WOOO<br />
Well, just ran my last addition to my tallying of drake kills over the last 2 years and just under 200.  Coming in at 194 drake kills before today.<br />
<br />
I was beginning to think everyone was lying and decrepit hides did not even exist and were not on the loot table heh.<br />
<br />
Well SoE did something right maybe this time.  Last time they upped the drop rate I've killed about 60 since then and nothing.    Finally tonight after one full day.  Not too much time but killed my 7th drake today and boom the nice fluffy brown decrepit hide finally dropped.<br />
<br />
Quite freakin satisfying.<br />
<br />
Now to figure out how the hell to turn up a soulleech :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valicar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, they increased the rate!  About time!<br />
<br />
My friend got his hide after 22 kills last night and I got my hide after 6 kills.<br />
<br />
Valicar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.   Although I am in no rush, since still needing the last thing - soulleech for me....<br />
<br />
Now I guess it's fun to ever find Teydar actually spawned?   He hasn't been up anytime I've checked so far.  Sucks to run to him and not have him there too. hehe.  Since Qeynos and aqueduct suck to run around.  <br />
<br />
Any good advice on when he's up?  DOes he stay up?   Maybe he wasn't up just cause servers reset recently.  I'll go look elsewhere on this board to see if answer is here allready I'm guessin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmm can't edit my post heh.   Well I did find the info.   3 days after server reset or 7 days after he's been used.  For Teydar spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GorranVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definately increased, I spent 2 weeks straight killing drakes.  My tally was somewhere near 90-100 I'm guessing.  I logged on this morning and a guildie said he just got one in hate, but he gave it away.  I ported up like 5 minutes later, killed 1 drake and it dropped.  So like 2 in less than 30 minutes is a pretty good drop rate. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had the hide drop last night - nice after a 3 year wait...</div></div><hr />
