<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 22 SK and grp with a lvl 22 Shammy all the time.  We are playing on Sullon Zek.  I want to know the best places we can go to xp from 22 to around 50ish or so?  We are are both very well equiped.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sol A until 40.  You'll get pk'd at least once a night here. <br />
<br />
I think I kited in OT for a while in my 40's, did LDoN also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ETHY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might try dalnir also upper 20's to mid 30's. sol a is better exp, but you will see far fewer pk's in dalnir.<br />
<br />
You should be able to do sol a up to 40's but exp will slow alot around there. When it does just move over to solB.<br />
<br />
Another place to duo would be echo caverns TM side. Usually pretty empty and decent exp at 40-45 range.  Head towards the taskmaster and fear kite. watch out for fireclaw though, and and the named fungal fiend. You can just take em to the guard by zone in and ks her for the exp.<br />
<br />
At 45 cant beat COM IMHO. lotta undead to pull. Good exp and the mobs have little HP's. this is where I will be for a bit PLing my 46 shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TelimTor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah yeah, Echo!  Couldn't remember where I was mid-40's.  That'll take you to 50 for sure.  <br />
<br />
CoM is nice too, some decent drops from the stable area.  Mask sells for 3-4k.</div></div><hr />
