<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so how does these work? say a bow with 150 range and a arrow with 50 range would it be 200 range? can some one tell me please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's right yes, bow and arrow range add together.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, the best easily made arrows have about 150 range (eqtraders.com describes how to make them) so with your bow your total range would be 370, about twice your spell casting range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kralthan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a little FYI ... sometimes having extreme range ( 220 bow, 150 arrow ) can be a pain.  I've had lots of times where I'll fire off like half a dozen arrows ... not sure if maybe I missed ... before I finally realize I'm just too far away and the mob is ignoring me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Kralthan.  I'm not sure if it's zone specific too.<br />
<br />
While levelling up I found I had few problems bow pulling in DSP, but mobs would sprint AWAY from me instead of toward me in DL if tagged at extreme range, then when I got to PoP half the time my arrows would miss the mob entirely (I read somewhere this was due to line of sight issues).<br />
<br />
On the rare occasions I pull outdoor roamers these days I usually try an arrow first, then run in to spell casting range if this doesn't work.  If the arrow aggroes the mob it saves time, if not it hasn't cost me anything anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That Extreme Range is good for Bow Training at lower levels. You can work up your Archery Skill and avoid a Bind Wound session. Just take 40 stacks of CLASS 1 Arrows or Summoned: Arrows, a decent Bow (borrow one if necessary) and proceed to make a pin cushion of that Red Con Mob and the surrounding scenery. :D<br />
<br />
Note: If you can't gauge distance, stay close to the Zone. As a Dark Elf, I practised in Nektulos Forest (near East Commonland Zone) on Travis Two Tone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Too bad archery really isn't worth training.  It's only remotely useful for pulling, not damage, and you get the same aggro off of a miss as a hit.  Just let it skill naturally, if it skills at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bow pulling is very under-rated.<br />
<br />
No we can't do jack-shit dmg with our 75 archery skill cap, but if you want to tag a nearby mob and have time to FD almost instantaneously without a spell refresh getting in the way if things go wrong, then bow pulling rocks.<br />
<br />
It is very situational but should useful enough to warrant keeping a reasonable bow and a few stacks of long-range arrows in your &quot;plumbers bag&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use bow pulling quite a bit.... it's nicer than spell tagging b/c it's 'instacast' and the range...of course if you want to build aggro on inc, it's next to no aggro as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also useful if you need to get on the rampage list on inc, but don't have a low aggro spell memorized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malheur VonRane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My bow/arrow range is 400 when I use good arrows, 300 when I use Hunters Barbs, theres a difference in the distance I get when pulling.  Archery range is not capped.  Arrows take some time to travel, when its a real long pull it takes the arrow some time to reach the target (about 1 sec every 200 range I think, never timed it), when I pull Quarm for example I pull at 400 range, I fire the arrow and hit Harmshield, harmshield will finish casting between .5-1 sec before the arrow travels far enough to hit, at which point he aggros and I pull him.<br />
<br />
Bows are essential for pulling, I hate using spells for pulling whenever it can be avoided.</div></div><hr />
