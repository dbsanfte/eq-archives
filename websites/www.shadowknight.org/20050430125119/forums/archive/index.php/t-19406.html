<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrematorBlacksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anywhere that I can go with my wife she is a 64 cleric to duo we have odd playtimes for our server so during the week it is hard for us to find a slower and get a group going. Is there any place we can hunt together without a slower/group we are both level 64.  Any help here is greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sebilis, Velketor's, geonids in Wakening Land, Chardok entrance/exit...  Maybe Siren's Grotto but I never exp'd in there much.  Deeper LoY zones might be a possibility but I've never been back there myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Deeper LoY would probably work.  It would be a little rough on mana without a slower, but you should be ok at level 64.  :)<br />
<br />
Try Torgiran Mines, and Nadox.  Also, there might be a few places around the windscorn in Dulak that would accommodate you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are going to do Nadox, I would suggest perhaps the Hatesfury zoneline.  I spent a lot of time 2 boxing in Nadox with a high 50s SK and cleric.  The cleric had KEI but could do singles without it.  The Hatesfury side has higher level mobs, thus hopefully more xp.<br />
<br />
I would think you could 2 box in Veksar on some of the undead as well.<br />
<br />
Without a slower load up on the DSes.  Banshee Aura, Cloak of the Akehva and Mark of Retribution is 32/hit.  Add in a Coldain Ring and you are at 40.  Get Cloak of Luclin and its 45.<br />
<br />
If you can take them the mobs deep in the Hole would be good xp.  You can now HS/DA jump and land in a non-aggro spot.  If you had a gate potion, both could get out no problem.  Haven't really thought about this as an xp spot but maybe it would work.  It surely would be uncamped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrematorBlacksoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the spots.  Sounds like we may be able to do some of them we will give it a try and hope for the best.  Never thought of HS/DA jump in the hole for exp.  Thats how guild gets down to the Seal to kill him we will have to try this can make Thurg gate potions to get myself out.</div></div><hr />
