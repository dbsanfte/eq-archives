<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As the thread subject says - is there a connection between dexterity and crit rate? A wizard was saying there was, but I don't know enough about it so thought I would ask here. Any help appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes; more dex, more crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Say what?  Dex affects procs, since when does it affect criticals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would assume that DEX would effect most every aspect of melee offense.  I believe it affects whether or not we get the hit, how often we double attack, how often the procs fire, and hence, whether or not the hit is a critical blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't assume, it's bad practice.  Dex definitely affects proc rate, Str definitely affects attack rating (and therefore average damage per hit), Agi affects AC.  Double attack is determined by a skill check that is independent of Dex.  Critical hits are determined by innate abilities (warriors for melee, wizards for nukes) and AA abilities, all of which give stated percentages.  No dex involved.<br />
<br />
If anybody has any proof, or heck, even evidence, to the contrary, please inform me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">critical spells are only determined by the AA you have.<br />
<br />
you will crit 2% of the time with SCF1, 4% with SCF2, and 7% with SCF3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">critical spells are only determined by the AA you have.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's what I thought... it was only AA's and class abilities that determine crits. But try telling a wizard anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It'll have to be parsed a bit at different DEX levels to see if DEX affects the calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I have no parse to back it up, but without a doubt wizards and other critters crit more with Dex.  Often I have my whole group buffed with NDT for the extra crits.  As far as that goes crit heals work the same.  With NDT on my wife, our groups normal cleric, crit heals so many times.  Between that and Yaulp VI and her hammer, she has more crit spam than any caster you have ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would like proof that dexterity increases crit rate, I really would.  If you're going to assert that an ability works contrary to the published description, the burden of proof lies with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With NDT on my wife, our groups normal cleric, crit heals so many times. Between that and Yaulp VI and her hammer<br />
<br />
Most likely she is critting her hammer more because she is actually procing more with higher dex. More Procs = More Crits proportionately. She is most likely not critting a higher percentage of times because of the higher dex.<br />
<br />
But you are welcome to parse and prove us wrong. Until then, I will continue to assume that Dex does not affect Spell or Heal Crit Percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rashakra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Parses show that DEX does not affect spell crits.  Do some searches over at Graffe's to see the infoz.  http://www.graffe.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did a few searches there and I found it is about half and half people saying yes and no.  The biggest post I saw was one from SOE that said &quot;A&quot; stat does help you crit spells more, but they left it cryptic and did not posts which stat it was.  *shrugs*  I will  keep with my DEx theory.  Works great for me, when spear is not resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">link the supposed &quot;SoE employee post&quot;,<br />
or parse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If there were one stat that affected proc rates like the alleged SOE person said, it seems that only a few would make sense more than the rest:<br />
<br />
AGI<br />
WIS/INT<br />
DEX<br />
CHA<br />
<br />
<br />
DEX may not be right but makes the most sense to me, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">DEX effects melee crits... there are parses on PoN by romidar and there was some on the beastlord board by their best parser their but not 100% sure its still there the beastlord den thing kinda went dead when there servers crashed after they were sold to IGN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">DEX effects melee crits... there are parses on PoN by romidar and there was some on the beastlord board<br />
Is there any mention of any stat affecting crits otherwise or just posts stating that 'DEX affects melee crits only'?<br />
I'd look myself if ezboard didn't have a craptastic function of searching through forums one at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It was actually a pretty good parse thing showed the ratio of crits and how dex effected them at each lvl of CF was compiled over took the time for the guy to get CF1-3 i think (guy pullled his logs from when he had CF1 to CF3 didn't do FOTA though) I searched the Bstlord aa section and couldn't find it though but as i mentioned before they nuked there board awhile ago and i honestly dont even go there anymore since its so dead... As for the paladin boards i thinke there version was in relation to slays going off i couldn't find it though either so... /shrug  im 100% sure that dex had a relationship to melee crits (not spell crits)<br />
<br />
Edit* here's the paladin link the beastlord one was better but shrug...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ravenar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well it is not supposed, but as we are too familar in this forum in saying.. Go to the site and do a search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rashakra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">link the supposed &quot;SoE employee post&quot;,<br />
or parse it.<br />
<br />
The &quot;SOE Employee&quot; was not a developer, so I'd say your suggestion of parsing it would be best.</div></div><hr />
