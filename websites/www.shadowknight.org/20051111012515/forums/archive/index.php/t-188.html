you won't have to kill that many gobos though because you will have tons of salts and skins to hand in. <br />
<br />
So 1 skin or 2 salts = how much faction?</div></div><hr />

Give Herald Telcha in Chardok a green goblin skin or two Mt. Death mineral salts <br />
1)  If you are below 50th can you turn in the Salts or Skins for faction?<br />
2)  Is the salt literally named Mountain Death Mineral Salt?<br />
3)  Can any goblin drop it?<br />
4)  Is it only Droga or can you get it in the Mines of Nurga too?<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to get faction up just so I could walk around in Chardok. :)<br />

<br />
2) Is the salt literally named Mountain Death Mineral Salt? - Yes, it looks like a blue powder<br />
<br />
3) Can any goblin drop it? - Any goblin in Nurga or Droga, I've never seen it drop elsewhere<br />
<br />
4) Is it only Droga or can you get it in the Mines of Nurga too? - Droga, Nurga and all the goblins in Frontier Mountains (I've heard FM may have changed). If you're working on faction by yourself go to Nurga since the goblins are lower level. If you're going with an AE group go to Droga to take advantage of the higher population.</div></div><hr />

We'll see how long it takes for me to get 45th in here. ;)  <br />
<br />
Just knowing I can turn in the skin and salts at any level is a great thing to know.<br />

I have about 65 skins and 270salts to turn in but i dont have the faction to turn them in yet. Its taking a LONG time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I turned in over 3 stacks of stuff at scowling without any trickery so you should be able to as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorak</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question - I am Curious......<br />
<br />
If you do all this and get the good faction in Chardok - what mobs are still KoS?<br />
<br />
Or....does it effect all mobs there (sarnaks, chokidais, skeletons, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkmelusine</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you going to attempt this...<br />
<br />
I *highly* recommend AE groups for it.  I spent 15 hours by myself (or with partner) and probably didn't get 1000 faction hits.   AE group, was doing 80-100 faction hits every 15 minutes.  <br />
<br />
I can walk anywhere in Chardok (fort entrance in BW is kos though, they're sarnak faction not di'zok) without agro now.  This includes undead, the chokidai pets, the slaves, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekhmeth</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I do not have the fortune of joining/making an AE group in Droga *sigh* I have really begun to loose my mind down there.<br />
<br />
I have been living there practically for 5 days now(Dubi to Chardok now, from max Kos)<br />
<br />
The long twisting tunnels, the atmosphere, the fact that green mobs can still tear me down with numbers(as they should be!) with their vile magics and Harmtouch abilities have gotten to me and I am now proud to say I LOVE THAT PLACE! :p<br />
<br />
I start by standing on the stone near zonein, jumping on the ledge to exit ramp and killing everything from the opposite way( Shadowknights do it in reverse ;) ) Single pulling everything, this can usually get me about 250 factionhits per session.<br />
<br />
I am often lucky to find a monk or rogue to duo with and I can increase the number of factionhits vs downtime.<br />
<br />
Oh and to my knowledge 95% of all mobs in Chardok are on Dizok faction(skels, dogs, constructs etc). I think the Queen is on Sarnak Collective.(not sure)<br />
As she conned differently from the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dourden Tyler</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything inside Chardok is on Brood of DiZok faction. The Queen is the one who gives out the final quest. The only problem is you HAVE to have a rogue to disarm a trap on the way, and unlock the door to the Queen's room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilith</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get in AE groups when I can, but sometimes I'm the only one there.<br />
<br />
Here's what I do to make it more interesting and a bit quicker as well.<br />
<br />
Put on Fungi<br />
Keep Soul Defiler proc'd<br />
Fight with Epic<br />
Click Coldain Ring and keep Banshee Aura on.<br />
Mem Word of Spirit<br />
<br />
I pull 3-6 at a time and back into a corner so they can't push me.  Let them hit on the damage shield and cast Word of Spirit as it refreshes.  After taking down the mobs on me, you generally have lost some hp/mana, but I find that if I just fight singles for a bit in between them, my hp and mana will be going up faster than the singles can wear me down (and fighting singles is what you'd be doing anyway right?).  <br />
<br />
Just don't try it with a bunch of Stalagknights or Mosstroopers as the tiny HT's start adding up.</div></div><hr />
