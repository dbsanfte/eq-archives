<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oriseus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya All,<br />
<br />
I'm a newbie here, this is my first post in these forums as I've decided to make a SK alt. My main is a lvl55 Wood Elf Male Druid on Xegony, and as might be expected, I'm quite used to seeing myself everywhere I go, and this will contribute to my decision somewhat. I will be twinking so race is mostly RP and aesthetic, or diety/armor.<br />
<br />
I love the look of Erudites in plate, I love how they are kinda big but still smart as hell. I also love how unique they are. Running a search on my server right now, there are too many DE SKs to list, and there are 3 ERUs. <br />
<br />
However, on my server there is a RP evil guild known as Inner Church. It is heavy on seeing the Tier'Dal as the superior race in Norrath, and all roleplay as the most loyal servants of Innoruuk. I am interested in possibly joining this guild because I am a writer and love to roleplay, but I know that if I am an Erudite, I wont be able to participate in some of the ceremonies that are Tier'Dal only (1st rank is for all Cleric, SK, and Necro DEs, but other races are restricted to 5th rank). DEs also translate to other story settings like the Forgotten Realms where they are known as drow, but an Erudite SK.. is so unique that.. it doesn't exist in any form in any other storyline. I guess that is good and bad at the same time.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the look of DEs but I do hate the way they look in dark blue plate, which means I wont wanna wear Dark Prince or Royal Engraved Velium.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the Dark elf plate armor has a awesome look.  It all depends on how desperate you are to participate in the Tier'Dal ceremonies of that guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG, WE HAVE 3 ERUDITES ? <br />
<br />
Well most RP guilds on xegony are kinda all pure evil, well the ones i know, moondark and inner church.<br />
<br />
Dark elfs got some silver colored armour too. Nothing too uber tho, but i believe guardians and sentry (drops in SS) is silver with flames on it ? Or it used to be.<br />
<br />
You also got the red color armours like sentiant and bloodember.<br />
<br />
But you should play what you want to play, with some nice background story you can be the first erudite that switched to woreshipping inny. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Enough Said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oriseus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Erudites = <br />
Pros<br />
Innate magic resistance, great plate look, big but not too big, very unique, less faction problems then most other SKs<br />
Cons<br />
Have to keep casting deadeye once past 22 because no night vision, low 70 in agi<br />
<br />
Dark Elves =<br />
Pros<br />
Easy to RP, ultravision, 90 agi<br />
Cons<br />
Small, lithe forms, less believable tanks RP wise, don't look as good IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look at it this way...You can be a poor clone of the most idiotic dumbass fanboy-worshipped race in fantasy fiction outside of Kender, on a one track mind with hate, Or you can be a Lord of the Dark Truth, researching Necromancy and Knowledge in a fortress on the side of a vast abyss, wielding a sword in the name of fear and shadow, methodically plotting to take over the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, Erudite converting to Inny == weak in most cases. If you really want to roleplay in EQ, I think it's best to stick to worshipping the God you picked at char creation, while having a pantheistic view of the world still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your not that desperate to be a dark elf and like the erudite armor look, then you should be one.  Since your druid is 55, you should have no problem getting his stats up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oriseus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I decided to go with Erudite.. and I love the results. I got sentient arms, bracers, boots, and gaunts, a darkforge bp, and black chitin legs until I can find darkforge to match the bp, and I look so striking.. I havn't yet seen someone who I thought looked as good as I do right now =) Thanks for all the advice guys, you were a big help, time to get to leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graveseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would have picked erudite to *of course iam a Erudite Sk* just because there rare  and they have pretty good stats ex. (Int.) 117 isnt bad already got a bigger mana pool then everyone else and dont have to waste points in Int at the start up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if not an Iksar, I would have gone Erudite. the race as a whole has done more for norath (in a RP sense) than most races. they have an interesting background story, if you can find it among all the quests. <br />
<br />
and they just look damn cool.</div></div><hr />
