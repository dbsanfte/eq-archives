<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aunvrae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im assuming the spell quests, the Epic.<br />
<br />
But besides that...<br />
<br />
What quests should an SK not miss out on for fun or for great kit, or for whatever?<br />
<br />
What are SK must do quests (with links if possible)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thurgadin gate potion<br />
<br />
Coldain rings at least up to #8<br />
<br />
Depends on whether you enjoy questing or not...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>armengarkai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">YEA Gate potioin is a must (i think)<br />
<br />
OT hammer is nice if youre non kos<br />
<br />
spell quest for life leach.......lol i used it 2 lvls till i got my 150 pt chain castable one, skip it i think<br />
<br />
i like questing, even better the ones i can solo most of<br />
working on greenmist now and epic, what i can solo that is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The gate potions are nice to have.<br />
It's not often that I use them but when I do, I make another so I always have one on me.<br />
Keeping one on you guarantees that you always have a way out, no matter where you are.<br />
<br />
OT hammer is great, too but can get hairy if you're relying on it as an escape from the mob you're trying to get away from.<br />
Much nicer if you can use it against someone else's mob so you're not getting splattered while awaiting the proc.<br />
<br />
Though I wouldn't rank them high up on the necessary quests, 2 that I have done outside of the OT hammer and gate potion from Shawls quest have afforded me these:<br />
<br />
Ice Forged Shackles (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4424)<br />

I don't know what race/level you are or if these would even be upgrades for you but I found the quests to be relatively easy and had some fun doing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aunvrae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what is this Thurgadin gate potion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aunvrae,<br />
The end product is actually Vial of Velium Vapors (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5329) that is part of the 4th Coldain Prayer Shawl.<br />
<br />
One is needed to obtain the 4th Shawl but you can make another after the fact.  (Too bad they are LORE, though).<br />
<br />
It is a 1-charge Gate to Thurgadin with a 30 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
The recipe is on the Alla link from above.</div></div><hr />
