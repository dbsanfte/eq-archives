<br />
Always Using LDON to get xp and spawning LDONS with just a group of 3<br />
<br />
Tank: is an SK, have not made the character yet but he will be an unusual race, such as Human or Eruidite.<br />
<br />
Healer: a shaman<br />
<br />
Third toon will be either a monk or a Beast lord.<br />
<br />
Is this stupid or would that work at higher levels?<br />
<br />
Only problem I foresee is crowd control</div></div><hr />

<br />
BL is back up to shaman plus dps while Monk is back up to Feign pulling?<br />
I guess I'd go with BL in that role.<br />
<br />
Will have some hard patches as Shaman fall behind in the healing curve for a while (not until 58 do they get the 1950 heal), but have great UTILITY. <br />
<br />
2-3 Pets for extra dps depending on who is pulling for the lower levels.  <br />
Decent DPS, slow, haste, heals, regen (mana and hp) and BL and shammy buffs can stack.  <br />
You could do much worse<br />
<br />
Can work at least  until 60 (though we generally go with a combo of BL/Shaman/Chanter/SK/Bard)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main issue you're going to have with a three man LDoN team is that you're lacking in DPS.  I've seen some rumors that mobs have fewer hit points when the dungeon spawns with a smaller group, but as yet they're sitting in my &quot;unconfirmed&quot; pile.  <br />
<br />
You could probably xp in those dungeons, but winning a slaughter or high collect might be a bit rough, as you're going to move much more slowly.  On average, with a competent full group, I'm averaging around 45 minutes per adventure doing normal difficulty level 65 collects and slaughters.  We almost always avoid assasinations and rescues, and typically try to avoid slaughters unless there is no other choice (slaughters take longer).<br />
<br />
On an average night, I can finish two to three adventures before I log, after group formation time is added in.  Scale the group back to three, bump up the time to completion to closer to 70 minutes (probably longer) and personally I'm looking at being able to finish one, maybe two if I stay on over my usual limit.  If you don't play 5 nights a week, that's a snail's pace.  Hell, if you do play 5 nights a week, that's a snail's pace.<br />
<br />
Of course, forming the core of a group with those three is a great idea.  I have a friend that I play with pretty constantly (65 Shaman), and we form the core of any group we put together around us.  This tends to work fairly well, as we know each other well, know our play styles and our capabilities.  I'm sitting at 101 successes and 13 failures right now, and the majority of the failures were times when he wasn't in the group.  If you play up from the lower levels together (presuming you're all playing around the same amount of time), you'll find that you know what the other two are going to do without communicating, which is essential in tight/hairy situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i do sk bst cleric. shaman and bst wouldn't work to well since then the bst buffs+slow is of no use. if your positive you want shaman i would suggest possible a mage to replace the bst. But i do prefer my combo since it allows me to play the sk/bst heavily and just do the ocasssional cheal+bulwark of vie with the cleric.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you raid boxing a cleric aint to bad on a raid ch chain, so that could add value to you in your guild.<br />
<br />
Oh and you wont need cc unless your doing hards in which case i suggest not to. On normals you can pet pull pretty easily the whole dungeon to guarantee singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ourok</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you could have sk/cleric/enc, the dps would be sad.... but it could get you through it with minimum probs.. well besides dps heh<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromglon</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive done a LDON in the 50's with sk,enc and shaman. It ran right down to the friggin wire but we won. We were on the lower end of the difficulty. Once one of us got a level it bumped us up the next tier and we got rocked. DPS is king in those things and those 3 classes dont have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nimic</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 man teams are possible, but DPS is definitely going to be a concern.  I duo LDONs all the time with a fellow two boxer, and that works out well... normally we can finish adventures in about an hour.  If at all possible, I'd try to get a fourth toon involved, preferably DPS.<br />
<br />
I normally use SK, Shaman, Cleric, and Ranger all level 65.<br />
<br />
SK tanks, shaman is utility and ghetto CC, Cleric is healer and DPSs with Yalp loaded, and ranger is dps.<br />
<br />
Shaman is not good DPS at all during an LDON, but useful for buffs / debuffs.  I could see it being worthwhile to swap out the shaman with an enchanter... if you can handle charmed mobs correctly, an enchanter can be good DPS.<br />
<br />
The ranger could really be interchanged for any DPS with decent offtanking ability... A well equipped rogue can handle offtanking in LDON.  The beastlord idea is a good one as well, as their pets make good offtanks/dps, and they can slow.<br />
<br />
Cleric could technically be swapped out with a druid...  If your equipped well enough the druid could DPS and heal.  This MIGHT allow you to drop the 4th spot down to three.<br />
<br />
Enough thinking outloud...  Maybe a good three person group would be SK, BL, and Druid?  I definitely reccomend adding a fourth toon if possible.  I didn't catch if you would be three boxing or not.<br />
<br />
As a side note, if you are doing this for experience, I'd have to warn against it... There are many better places to get experience other then LDON.  The only good experience I ever received in LDON was when I was the lowest level member of the group.  In these situations I'd get almost half a level whilst mid level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carter</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3 man team that my friend and I do is a sk/bst/cleric.  We started doing a 4man one beacuse he upgraded his 2nd computer and whatnot; that added a druid.<br />
<br />
But for our 3man one, we never had a problem killing nor running out of time, generally we'd do one ine 40'ish minutes.  That's with just 3, with 4 we havn't done enough to conclude if it's a lot faster/slower or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Biggest problem we've ran into with cleric/bst/sk is sometimes we get issues with mobs casting spells through the sk's bash, bst's kick, and bst pet's proc and the one stun I keep up on the cleric isn't always enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorddaeth</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use SK, Shaman, Mage for 3boxing.<br />
<br />
SK tanks. Shaman slows and heals, with Root for CC if needed. Mage pet is very nice DPS, and mage DD+bolts+rains = nice burst DPS. Mage summons toys for all 3 pets (usually just 2), also has DS buff, and can summon gate talismans. The shaman alchemy makes the juice for them.<br />
<br />
only thing it's missing is the ability to succor/port.<br />
<br />
I havent' done this trio in LDoN, but i do BoT with it easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowfox98</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pally, Bst, SK  and sometimes a bard (he doesn't play much)...we generally do well and win most adv.  We are all the same lvl and group all the time.  Pally heals, bst slows, I pull....lost a few, but win most of the time in under 70min.  Never get adds, because either pally pac pulls or I pet pull.  We do get all buffed up before we go. Virtue Fo7 Kie.  but that's typical of all groups.</div></div><hr />
