<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if, by research, your implying that players should run around the 40-50 (?) various zones &quot;Hail'ing&quot; various NPCs, then I respectfully disagree.<br />
<br />
To often you either find quests in the middle (not knowing where to start) or the results of the quest is restricted outside your race/class/religion combo or the quest is takes you to some zone which is to high for you.<br />
<br />
For the casual gamer (works for a living; has other interests [read: family/life]), its just is not feasible to pursue NPC leads w/out some sort of idea where it will bring you.<br />
<br />
Yeah - it could be interpreted as 'cheating' (peeking at the results of the quest before begining it); but I don't think it would be very satisfying (for me atleast) with the 'hunt and peck' method of hailing random NPCs until they say something with brackets (&quot;[sometext]&quot;) and then hoping that the quest is doable and you receive something useable for your efforts...<br />
<br />
Apologies in advance if I misunderstood your post,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think he meant to try and search some spoiler sites, if you can't find what you need on alla try somewhere else. Don't expect people to just serve stuff to you on a silver platter coz you are too cheap to shell out 20 bucks a year or whatever the fuck it is alla charges for premium.<br />
<br />
 If you don't want to use the cash, use time on it, now either put up or shut up.<br />
<br />
 Thanks</div></div><hr />

Look around dude, we all didnt just find this stuff out by posting..search here for quests, there is a lot of them.<br />

<br />
AllaK's doesn't charge for most quest searching.  You can search for quests by items used in them or the quest reward itself, search by zone or search by factions.  All the details and NPC info is in the quest write-ups there.  The only thing you can't do with the free service is search by class.  So if you want to go cheap and not pay for premium service, you still get all the quest information - you just can't sort it by class.  Do a little legwork and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Willat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No I was not looking for a spoiler site. I am looking for a site that I don't have to sit at for 3 hours with two IE windows open jumping back and forth to find out if I can do a certain quest as a level 9 Ogre SK and is the reward worth the possible +2 hours it will take to complete the quest.<br />

Solan...&quot;if you can't find what you need on alla try somewhere else&quot;<br />

GranchTonka...&quot;WTF..I meant checkout sights, other boards&quot;<br />
<br />
Excuse me but I thought that was what I was asking for...Info on other sites.<br />
<br />
Well this is where I would say thank you for your help but other then UnHolyWarrior all I seem to have gotten is flamed for what I apparently misconstrued as a simple question for information.<br />

<br />
GranochTonka - I took every effort to make my post as non-inflamatory as possible; seems somehow you still took offense.?..?<br />
<br />
I use these boards to ask questions of other players.  Im sorry that you feel that these questions are beneath you or that, since you know the answer and others don't, the posters are whiners.<br />
<br />
I sincerly hope you can come to terms with what ever your problem is instead of taking it out on these boards.  If you are that upset by questions by new players, then its time to move on.  If you were really intersted in helping you could have provided some of these links or a bit of direction (more then &quot;reSEARCH&quot;), however instead you used the opportunity to berate and demean...  I could go on, but I'm already sounding too preachy...<br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Satist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ok, look...  there are bunches of sites out there...  so far, i think i have over 20 sites in my favorites, all related to EQ, including alla, caster's realm, everlore, etc.  at first, all i had was everlore.  then, i found caster's realm, and alla.  if you look at the links on those sites, you will find buttloads (i.e. metric fucktons) of links for more sites, lots of them having areas that cover quests.  it doesn't take much, except a bit patience.  back when i worked nightshift, i reserved the 2 hours before work for research, and forums.  after work, i'd have 2-5 hours to play.  now that i'm back on days, my research has dropped down to when the wife and kids aren't on the computer, and my play time is 1.5 to 2 hours before work.  maybe once a week, i'll take 1 day off of EQ, and do research, and read the forums.  every so often, i might even post.  my personal suggestion is this:  grow a bit thicker skin, when it comes to getting flamed.  do a bit of internet surfing to sites, for research.  most of the sites have semi decent spoilers for quests, and alla even tells you what level is &quot;average&quot; to do the quest, meaning not  twinked heavily, and grouping for it.  all i can say is, read, and learn...  you don't want a second IE window up?  i guess you'll be using the back button a helluva lot, huh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Down boy.  No reason to wet yourself over this.<br />
<br />
Question was around a list of quests by level... not just a list of quests (of which I have found pleny myself).<br />
<br />
Have not seen such a list; nor has anyone on this thread been able to provide such a list.  Allak is the closest I have seen (very comprehensive), but does not organize by level; which, if you actually read the post, was what the question was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time to get over yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually you can get allakhazam's quest info by level if you are a member and actually pay for the work that they do to maintain the site.  If you want the content, pay the $$$. :)<br />
<br />
Advanced search on allakhazams lets you put in not just class, but the level range as well.<br />
<br />
And I didn't flame anyone, and gave people a list of quests to check out.  *grin*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>UnholyWarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks Bolas.  Thats the first intelligent reply any one has been able to give...<br />
<br />
Was hoping that there existed such as list away from a subscription based site; but I guess not...<br />
<br />
thanks again,</div></div><hr />
