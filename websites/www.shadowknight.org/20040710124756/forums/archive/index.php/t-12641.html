<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently returned from an extended break from EQ (about 5 months) to play my 65 SK. Before i took this break i had improved harm touch, scf1 and unholy touch 1 AAs, and HTd for 3k and it was always a critical blast(from memory). When i returned last week i noticed my harm touch was only doing 1700hp dmg w/ unholy aura disc and never ever critical. Yesterday i got unholy touch 2 AA and my HTs are STILL only doing 1700dmg, did something change in a patch while i was gone or is my character bugged in some sort of way? Any help is appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you need SCF3 to crit 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCF1 = 33% chance on UT crit<br />
SCF2 = 66% chance<br />
SCF3 = 100% chance <br />
<br />
That is if i read the board correctly, no AA to try it out myself yet :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah ok thanks. Still doesnt explain why my HT does same damage as with UT1 =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keuven Nightstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you useing improve HT instead of reg HT? I always get crits on /disc IHT . Sounds like your useing reg HT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the AA skill UT has a different button. Be sure to click on the AA skill and use the make button key or search somewhere in the forum what number skill the UT is if you want to use it in a macro with /disc unholy aura.<br />
<br />
*edit : Link where the activation numbers are on the board link (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9607)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&lt;font color=&quot;#ccccff&quot;&gt;As Keuven said, it sounds like you're using the regular Harm Touch button, rather than the Improved HT button (&lt;i&gt;click on improved HT in your AA window and click the 'Make hotkey' button&lt;/i&gt;). As soon as you train UT1 and CF1, you will have a 100% crit rate on Improved HT (&lt;i&gt;not sure where Jupke got those numbers&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/font&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moonana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lol yeah im a complete retard, thanks. This EQ is a fresh install so i had to make all my hotkeys again, and clearly i forgot that improved HT has its own button =p. Thanks alot guys ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ouzestinkeefeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not to go off on a tangent, but someone asked where Jupke got those numbers from. What I think Jupke was trying to explain was more how SCF in general works then specific to the UT/SCF abilities.<br />
<br />
Without UT you can crit HT for:<br />
<br />
SCF1 - 2% chance to crit - 33% more damage<br />
SCF2 - 4% chance to crit - 66% more damage<br />
SCF3 - 7% chance to crit - 100% more damage<br />
<br />
With one level of UT  trained you will ALWAYS crit HT if you have SCF trained. The damage dealt will of course scale depending on what you SCF is.</div></div><hr />
