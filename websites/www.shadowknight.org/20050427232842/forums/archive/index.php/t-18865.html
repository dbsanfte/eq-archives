Just think of yourself as a weapon smith.<br />
<br />
There aren't too many of either, both look bad ass.  But if Regen is your only reason for Troll, it doesn't make a huge inpact for long, and you will level slower for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hostile_polygon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I chose troll myself.  Even though regen has diminishing returns as you level up, for me it cut down on my down time in the lower levels.  If you can twink up your toon I supoose it really doesn't matter and in the high  end game there is no real benefit I think for choosing one over the other.  I have played both and I prefer the troll but in the end its a personal preference.  For me the troll seems to cut downtime at lower levels.</div></div><hr />

Not for stats or size or racial abilities, but because I get annoyed that my left arm doesn't work.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">People say regen doesnt matter in the long run, this is normally said by people who don't understand it. Regeneration is fantastic when soloing in places like Katta Costellum and HHK for instance, thats when I noticed it most. In fact, in my younger days in Netherbain with a Vah Shir friend of mine we got totally wiped out and both of us had about 10% of health. I was at something like 80% or so (Don't remember exact but I think that's int he ball park) before he hit 50%. And you WILL notice if you switch from a regen toon to a non-regen. However, the experiance penalty DOES play a semi-large factor. Since I am on maybe 3-4 hours a day (On a really good day like this christmas break) it sometimes gets rather aggrivating when all your friends are hopping levels like no one's business and your still level 55 (Heh just dinged 56 and got a ton of new gear myself need to update Magelo, Kug).<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, in the long run it's a preferance thing. All I really have to say is if you go troll worship cazic, why? Culteral armor (I never see SK Inny worshiper user armor...and my friend got a hold of a stock pile of the stuff made me wanna cry). Faction is based on religion firstly and that will probably make it easier to get in good with places like Paineel and Cabilis. If you go Ogre unstunnability is useful, I get stunned a lot but when you fear-kite it doesnt really matter, eh). But really, it is ALL preferance with a couple little choices here and there that matter. Good luck on your SK and be sure to Roleplay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have never played a troll, I have tried an iskar but gave up due to lack of affordable armor.<br />
<br />
I have found ogres to be my pick for pl toons because you can throw them at red mobs and they dont spend 99% of thier time stunned and not putting out DPS.<br />
<br />
However the regen of trolls makes them recover faster when soloing.<br />
<br />
Ogre Cultural armor is freely available and damn good (RZ worshipers) Inny worshiping cultural (large race) is much harder to get.<br />
<br />
It really boils down to this....<br />
<br />
You want a PL toon, go Ogre.<br />
<br />
You want a solo toon, go troll.<br />
<br />
The other thing to considder is the firece heraldic armor is very nice for humans, given that humans can use that and the massive udderbulk shell, decent twink equipment comparisons would have them about the same.<br />
<br />
Part from that, everything else is purely preference.<br />
<br />
I like being an ogre cause ogres are evil and defiant, whereas trolls are evil and nasty.<br />

If I had to choose between those two races I'd say Ogres. Regen doesn't beat the no stun from the front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kahrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would have to say Ogre, I could care less for the regen due to the fact I always group. I even have a 65 cleric bot. More than half your game with this character will be end game. You will always get heals in groups faster than your regen as a troll will make a difference. I wish I didn't get stunned all the time while exping, especially on AE pulls with lots of mobs hitting me.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  <br />
<br />
I started a troll got to level 20 and found I was losing more hp from being stunned than I was saving from regen.<br />
<br />
I also found my main regen of hp was from taps not regen.<br />
<br />
I rerolled a ogre.</div></div><hr />

If I had made it quicker to end game area when the old troll models were still the default, then I would never have looked back.

There is nothing better than a giant with a huge-ass 2hander (or i guess 1hander because no duel weild) killing your organs and crushing your mind while smashing your arm ded.</div></div><hr />

&lt;3 Groobash.  <br />
<br />
The single best quote I've ever read concerning this game and race selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Definately agree. (sorry for not adding anything in this post, I just agree alot, that's all.)<br />
<br />
Being a troll is not so bad as long as you are not the MT of a raid. It is clear that the no stun thing from the front is more useful than the regen and that ogre models look cooler than troll and the whole one arm thing is stupid.<br />
<br />
I started a troll got to level 20 and found I was losing more hp from being stunned than I was saving from regen.<br />
<br />
Granted this is only level 20, but this is just a projection of end game. Anyone can amen that more hp flies and less of it is regened by troll regen end game and that no stun means no stun for anything from the front.<br />
<br />
But because one can solo all the way up to the end game the regen is better.<br />
<br />
So my answer to this question would be Ogre if you had to ask.<br />
<br />
You want a solo toon, go troll. <br />
<br />
Go ogre. Troll is a state of mind. <br />
<br />
Just take the one hand thingy out of the game and I'll be content with my troll.</div></div><hr />

 Yesterday my rogue buddy was getting a little out of control and I found that since I've been using just my right hand for what are nomrally two handed weapons I have a phenominal grip!  I gave him a titty twister right through his leather armor that stunned him for a full minute at least!<br />
<br />
  Also it's great to be able to get a beer out of my backpack and take a drink if I get thirsty in the middle of a fight since my left hand is free anyway, heh.</div></div><hr />

Regen rocks even at 65.  Pact of Hate?  Instead of losing 34 hps/tick I lose 6 which is really almost nothing.  This means always having a C3 equivelant available without putting any strain on your Cleric.<br />
<br />
Soloing?  I tank to 60% then kite while I heal.  Does't take that long to heal back up either.  Fast enough that I very rarely use a lifetap when soloing and can use Mental Corruption as a self buff instead of a life tap buff.<br />
<br />
Look at AA everyone says adding 1 regen is one of the best choices for your first 3 AA points.  Trolls get like 24 added to their regen.  I think of it as a buff that doesn't take up a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Yes it takes longer to get to 65 but from there on out you have the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a raiding toon, you'll get gear that make stats not matter much.  For the most part, the SKs in my guild are maxed on stats at raids.  (no advantage to any race)<br />
<br />
Regen will not save you against anything PoP or beyond.  Even tier one mobs generally hit for a couple hundred (when they hit that is).  24hp/tic matters very little.  Many PoP and LDoN items add to regen anyway. (advantage of regen for trolls and iksar is trivial)<br />
<br />
The AC bonus of iksar is not honestly a big deal for mitigation purposes. (advantage of iksar is trivial)<br />
<br />
The only racial advantage that matters in the end is not to be stunned from the front.  (advantage ogres)<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
In the end-game, all races are about the same for a Shadowknight.  Ogres have the only advantage that matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are they as bad as everyone says?  <br />
<br />
Low str - easily overcome as many items have STR<br />
High int - most low mid end items with good int have low AC, so if you start high don't worry about sacrificing AC for mana pool<br />
<br />
No Regen<br />
Melee stunnable from the front<br />
No night vision<br />
<br />
But that aside, if you were meant to play Erudite you just know.  Too many people play the high int SK's (DE/gnome/Erud) for the mana pool then get sloppy with spell casting and line up and totally waste thier mana and are constantly oom anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Layotees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Someone mentioned earlier in this topic that the Troll lore in comparison to the Ogre lore made the choice seem almost silly, and that Ogre was the way to go.<br />
<br />
Well, when the Trolls arived on Antonica from Kunark, they settled in Grobb, I have not found any lore stating that they were ever in Guk, but of course I could be wrong.  The trolls defended their lands against the ogres until the ogres recognized them as a formidable ally and agreed to make peace with them.<br />
<br />
Almost everyone I run into always argues the point that the Frogloks threw the Trolls out of Grobb, thus they are weak and stupid.  But the fail to recognize one fact, that the mass of the Troll's forces were out combing Norrath for the Grozmok Stone, and the Frogloks attacked after they had been empowered by Mithaniel Marr.  Lets see... Blessing from Mith Marr + depleted Troll forces, how could they have lost?  <br />
<br />
Not to mention, alot of Dark Elves complain about how the Trolls are stinking up there city, but the fact that they didn't turn them away when they came to Neriak can mean one of two things...  1: that the leaders of the Dark Elves realised the Trolls are an ally that they would rather not lose, or 2: that they couldn't turn the trolls away for fear of a bloody battle between the two.<br />
<br />
So please, if you're going to consider lore in your choice, don't overlook the Troll SK.</div></div><hr />
