<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taedir Bladeforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm 39 and stuck. Everywhere is boring. DSP is what everyone says I should do but its no damn fun! I read the sticky hunting ground post but that doesn't help either. I loved the lizard man camp doing my darkforge armor. What other places are soloable and fun for a 39? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to Hotspot zones for optimal xp returns and soloable as well. Gunthak and Dulak are 2 good places for you to solo/group for good xp result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taedir Bladeforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, should have mentioned that I dont have Ykesha or GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well then get LoY, its the best expansion going for those getting to the 50s.  Lots of nice items, quests and places to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nikl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never really found soloing to be fun personally. I am just curious here, have you tried any LDoN adventures? You may find those to be something of a change of pace. You didn't say in your post wether you were soloing because you don't have enough time for grouping, or if you just prefer it. So even though I would advise you to find groups when ever possible, let me think of a few solo spots that might be fun.<br />
<br />
The mobs will be starting to green out a bit you could go to The Overthere. If nothing else you could start snagging some Braids for your OT hammer. <br />
<br />
Lower guk would be cool and you would be earning faction if you ever want to do the crown of deceit quest. <br />
<br />
Great Divide at the cave Kodiak caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did 37 to 44 killing cave basilisks in Jaggedpine Forest.  From there to 51 or so, I killed underbulks in the Deep side of Echo Caverns.   I was also able to single pull the gnome guards there and they're decent exp until 52 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wrowin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the walrus's in EW are decent exp and fear kite  easily....can get boring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have always like ToFS.  Mobs for many different leve.  It's a dungeon, you'll learn some serious skills there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ToFS rocks.  You can get a couple more levels out of Kaesora.  CoM would be good.  LGuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I assume you are not an iksar, but if you are, you can solo in the Overthere by the scorpian pits.  If you get problems you can train the half-iksar, half-scorpian guards and they will take out your problems for you.<br />
<br />
The Combine city in the Dreadlands is nice.  Work on your key to Howling Stones in Kaesoria (follow the red line on the map)--yes get Loy!!<br />
<br />
Mostly though, LoY is a great option once you get it.<br />
<br />
Velious zones are fun.  You could fear kite the wolves, or get a group for a challenge and hunt the fort outside of Crystal Caverns.   Start helping friends with their shawl quests.<br />
<br />
You can also fear kite a little in the Dreadlands, and definately in the Frontier Mountains.  Try the Sarnaks and Burynai near the Lake of Ill Omen zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There really isn't much for the low 40's.<br />
<br />
I strongly agree - get LoY.  Best solo XP I have found for my sk (40~42) was at Nadox zoneline in Gunthak, the one with the fire elementals inside Nadox.  Easy, easy kiting area, zone line reeeal close, can get named (and subsequent drops) trolls and is generally pretty easy.<br />
<br />
LDoN rocks.  Get LDoN groups and all will be right.  Unless your cleric's retarded or something.<br />
<br />
ToFS is nice but not many people like going there.<br />
<br />
Try the grimlings in Tenebrous.  That should be good cash and xp.  Just watch out for the wizards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Timourous Deep Gorla's then Spircocs.  Can solo, faster grouped, mobs hit lightly, low HP a so you make up for a lack of ZEM (Zone experience modifier) by quick kills.   Also I have a few pull and assist calls from there that people who've hunted there get.  (&quot;Polly wanna die &lt;Squawk&gt;&quot; and a call using the weird yell the Gorla's make).  Probably can start fear kiting Spirocs at your level.<br />
<br />
Other notes:<br />
Many new players see &quot;hot zones&quot; and shit and just run towards those thinking it's great.  Yes mobs in TD will give you 50% less exp per kill, but with the HP calculations of mobs in LoY you can kill ~3+ Spirocs in the time it takes to kill one Ogre in LoY.  Yes, LoY is great for groups and quests, but Spirocs and other Old World camps are greatly overlooked.  Pre-Revamp Howling Stones was a great exp spot not for the Exp per kill, but because all the mobs were low HP undead mobs that you could burn through quickly which gave awesome exp over time.  Places like LoY (and I'd say a # of Luclin zones like Aheva) need high ZEM's just to bring up the experience over time levels up to something worth while.</div></div><hr />
