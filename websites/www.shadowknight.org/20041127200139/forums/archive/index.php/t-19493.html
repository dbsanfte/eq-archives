1: 65 SK/RNG/BST/Cler. Those will be the 4 constant players. The other 3 come from others being on, a SHM and ENC. The 7th will be a second cleric(only L55 atm) on a hydra set up(situational at best) <br />
<br />
LDoN/Ornate/Randomshit for gear for the most part. The RNG popped 120 AA last night, BST around 70, SK/Cler under 10.<br />
<br />
What encounters could we try, with the 4 as base, adding the others as they are on/needed?<br />
<br />
So far all we've managed to come up with Trak/Zlandicar/Ven Sath. We're considering trying to move into WToV. While getting gear drops that we could use would be nice, simply doing tough encounters will be satisfying enough for us. Please give your ideas on possible encounters.<br />
<br />
If it'll help, I could get a magelo for everyone and post it here later, but nothing impressive as far as gear goes =( We will be filling in more spots with LDoN as time goes on, and we 4 man LDoN often, done a few hard ones when the SHM was on.<br />
<br />
Ideas, please post some =)</div></div><hr />
