There has been no further update at this time regarding any of the old issues on your class list.  I have altered the list to reflect the new items added and submitted.<br />
 <br />
1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated) <br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
5. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
7. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
8. A method to reduce damage allowing us to compete with Paladin stuns (NEW)<br />
<br />
9. An upgrade to Leech Touch, it provides less of a HP swing, cannot be focused, cannot be disced, costs more AA, and prevents us from using our other HT to use. (NEW)<br />
<br />
10. Removal/Refund of SCS or a toggle added to it. (NEW)<br />

<br />
Since when has this AA been a class issue anyways? It's a &quot;people who bought SCS and don't like it anymore&quot; issue. It doesn't affect the majority of the high-end SKs -- in fact, out of the *20* top-ranked (sorting by HP) SKs on EQRankings (which is a fair, although not nearly perfect method, of getting a sampling of the high-end SK community), only 2 of them had SCS trained (and one of them was you, Brael). So, let's pander to your personal desires and those of your &quot;poor old-school SK friends who trained SCS&quot; later, and get the MAJORITY of us taken care of.<br />

<br />
- You better watch what you say. Calling Brael a liar when you don't even have proof is the best way to make him quit his position as class correspondant and then we would have some poor excuse of an SK in his stead.<br />
When I see agressive posts like this I'm glad I didn't bother to apply for the job. I knew they were coming.<br />
If I was Brael I'd have told you to go fuck yourself already btw.<br />
<br />
- Necro rez is getting more popular now it seems even tho I don't see us getting it, so brael will add it to the list when there is room.<br />
Just be patient and wait for the class definition documents and the next round of class balancing changes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SCS needs fixed, true story.  People like Brael and the 5 or 6 other guys who maxed out their AA and spent it on SCS instead of abstaining, or who were really trying to help out their warrior buddies by doing their part to not out-aggro them on raids pre warrior fix were really hosed by that change.  SCS should have been refunded or reworked then, not now.  Having an AA that a class's community says unanimously, &quot;Don't get this AA, whatever you do, it will hurt your character,&quot; is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
However, it does affect very very few shadowknights across the board.  And I'm not privy to Brael's tells or IMs, but the thread about the 3 choices really didn't seem to be leaning toward SCS.  However, I didn't post because none of the three 'new options' appealed greatly to me.  Chose or lose I guess?<br />
<br />
Assuming that that we, as shadowknights, don't have a limited number of fixes before the devs stop paying attention to us, I'd say that fixing SCS hurts nobody (whereas you might argue that giving us necro rez hurts necros).  May as well get it fixed.  But I respectfully request that the players in a position to influence developers (Brael, other class representatives, developer's girlfriends and drug dealers, etc) please try to be a representative of the shadowknight community, not someone who may succumb to the urge to dismiss ideas that you decide are stupid, but that many other shadowknights find appealing.  We all probably think we know how shadowknights 'should' be, but that job does not belong to anyone posting on these boards.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it is rather obvious in the trials, has been from the day GoD went live.  <br />

I do like the look of the list.  I'm just not too optimistic about them agreeing with us and fixing issues on the list in ways that we'll want them to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

that's interesting. because the thread you posted here to get people's ideas was overwhelmed with responses that necro rez would be a priority over scs.

As for the SCS issue, it's not important, but better than none. IMO i'd rather get an AA, that for &quot;swarm pet&quot; or &quot;pet horse&quot;, pet that can run fast = new tool to pull (still, their HP is crapo~ but for those that uses pet to pull GoD content might, i mean MIGHT agree with me~  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually when i read &quot;Bard DPS is higher than SK&quot; line, i kinda feel fucked up.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If 20 people email you, and 17 of them had bought SCS, and now want it removed.. then sure, the majority of people you talked to want an SCS toggle. But you're missing one very important thing: it doesn't affect 90% or more of SKs. It shouldn't be addressed on a top ten list for class balance if it doesn't affect nearlyeveryone in the class. <br />
<br />
If you need proof that SCS isn't a main concern for class balance, then look at all the posts in this thread, and other threads. I'm not saying it's not important for those who got it, but it seems to everyone but Brael that the majority of the class doesn't want this &quot;fix&quot;. Don't punish the whole class into getting one of our concerns/desires taken away because a few elite SKs who can't read bought an AA that hurts them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dont have scs, but would rather see the toggle than necro res. Would come in very handy. Res's are really easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So my previous reply was perhaps more vitriolic than necessary. The accusations, even though in my opinion fair, may have been out of line as well, as I had only a notion to base them upon.<br />
<br />
My essential problem with that item going on the list is this: this top ten list is supposed to represent the top 10 issues for our class, and as I understood it was supposed to bring to light things that would help define our class and strengthen whatever role it plays. I have a tough time understanding how adding a toggle to SCS would play into that, and offering a refund of points of removal of the ability only serves to benefit that miniscule minority that bought the ability in the first place.<br />
<br />
In all the things I've read and experienced, &quot;reducing the amount of aggro I generate&quot; has been low on the list of characteristics of SKs, and it's had very little to do with the role of SKs. I will admit: I didn't even get into the raiding scene until probably mid-Luclin, and even then I didn't start raiding heavily until Planes of Power. The state of things and the need for reduced aggro at times then may have been different from the way things work now. But, of course, that was then, and this is now.<br />
<br />
So, here's my offer: if someone can show me that there's a legitimate need for either the ability to have SCS on a toggle (meaning that this ability would be worthwhile to have and use), and would either be MORE useful than a necro rez, or would be more likely to be implemented, then I'll gladly change my tone on the entire issue. You can PM me, email (eitsekur@hotmail.com) or send a tell ingame (seventh.Eitsekur).<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have no problems with being told to fuck off. And sure, some people didn't like the tone or approach I took, or the very fact that I questioned Brael's motives in the first place. And sure, there's a very real chance that if Brael takes enough shit, he'll step down and someone else will take his place. It's our duty as the people he represents to question him though, and make sure that when he acts he does so in our best interests. If he's not acting in our best interests, &quot;ours&quot; being those interests of the shadowknight community at large, then he's not fulfilling the purpose he was elected for in the first place.<br />

Rez would be nice. On my limited pp budget, EE's are just too expensive so I would only use it if I was the last man standing on a raid and would rez a cleric. I don't see SK's being more popular in a raid roll with rez, probably would only show in pick up exp groups.<br />

<br />
How easy is it to get a rez when you're 3 mobs away from Heartstriker Jhiru and the Cleric bit it on a repop? How easy is it to get a rez when your entire raid except you and a monk wipes on the Cursecallers in Inktu'ta? If people think we want this to rez some corpse we see at the PoK pedestal in Overthere, or rez a fallen comrade while XPing in BoT, then I don't know what to say to you. If you listen to Warriors, we have utility coming out of the ass. Well boys and girls, even Inferna's version of a once a day AA rez is Utility unmatched. But of course, some of you wouldn't know Utility if it came up and bit you on your Windblade.</div></div><hr />

Concerning this one item on a list of 10, let's not lose sight of the most important goal: getting the devs to change ANY of it at all. If SKs get even half this stuff changed in a positive and useful manner we all win. <br />
<br />
Utility rez: Very useful and a great trick to have in our bag, yes.<br />
<br />
Toggle scs: Useful and also nice to have.<br />
<br />
Being better tanks like we're supposed to be: #1 priority. <br />
<br />
Let's not get all bogged down on which lesser problems or desires need to be fixed first until the main issue is attacked and, hopefully, resolved. I guarantee you I am not gonna give a rat fuck whether I have toggle scs or some kind of rez as long as I can tank better and be wanted/useful on my raids or in groups.<br />
<br />
Brael, I don't know you. You don't know me.  Neither of us probably gives a damn. Either way, thanks for heading up the contact with the devs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SK have far too great survivability potential to make them having a rez be anything but open to be unblanced and open to exploits.<br />
<br />
I could bypass content and summon corpse and rez too easily, something a necro can do, but they wouldn't survive the beating we can take making us something equivalent to &quot;CoH&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">While necro rez would certainly be a very nice ability to have, it's questionable in terms of balance. The justification for giving us necro rez would be to parallel paladins' rez spell, which is potentially an important asset to a group. The problem is that giving us a rez spell would then swing the pendulum too far the other direction - we would be superior to paladins, as we have the tools to survive a wipe and they do not. For it to be balanced, they'd then need something like Escape or the like, and then you start a chain-reaction balance nightmare.<br />
<br />
It's really a sticky situation, and something should be done, as paladins' rez ability gives them an advantage over us (aside from that granted by stuns and such). The problem is that balancing it is far from cut and dry. Giving us necro rez would be equivilant to the warrior upgrades from the melee balancing - taking something from too weak to too powerful. I havn't really decided what my opinion on the necro rez situation is yet, but it's definately not as cut-and-dry as alot of you are trying to make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm a cheap lazyass posting the same thing for the 3rd time... sue me.  <br />

People asking for necro rez aren't taking balance into perspective.  It's a lot more complex than a lot of you are making it out to be.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but maybe actually putting the idea up there for SoE review or actually having a talk about it and getting a community view on it would be a good thing.

I understand that you're upset that SCS is up there, but this type of unwarranted inflammatory speech does not help.  Brael said that he received more requests for SCS, and I believe him.  Now, if he managed to keep any evidence of this (i.e. logs, PMs, saved IMs) I would like to see it because it is clear that at least on shadowknight.org SKs overwhelmingly would like to see rez on there instead of SCS.</div></div><hr />

Its one thing to argue a point, its quite another to take personal shots at a guy that put together a top 10 list that has 9 points that most people agree with, and one point that is definitly broken but not used by most.  Gotta keep in mind that SCS is horribly broken, while you may not agree with it making the list, it is indeed horribly broken.  If you where unfortuante enough to get this when sks had a ton more aggro then was needed, I suspect you would gladly get rid of it without even having the points refunded.<br />
<br />
Think of the top 10 list as being graded like in secondary school.  90%=A, 80%=B, 70%=C.  Some of you are taking personal shots at a guy that has an A average so far according to the uncontested majority.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think that for the people who bought SCS, a toggle would be important to them. I just don't think that the only way for them to get it changed is take a spot on our Top 10 list. I also must add that I'm not saying we should get a necro rez.</div></div><hr />

But you do compete with pallies for groups, and guess what.  Rez is a factor.  Ingoring that isn't gonna make it go away.

stop worrying about balance with paladins.  An ability to recover from a wipe given to any class is a benefit to all classes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Back on the subject, why is it so hard for people to realize that getting rez would be detrimental to our efforts to regain the offtanking role?  If we have rez, it'll go from &quot;FD in the corner and wait for loot to drop&quot; to &quot;FD in the corner and wait for loot to drop or the raid to wipe.&quot;  That's not an improvement.  Necros having FD and rez is a very different situation from SKs having FD and rez.  A necro, who is doing his role properly, has a far better chance of being able to FD during a wipe, while an SK who is offtanking is probably going to be one of the first to die, because our job as any sort of tank is to take the hits, and the deaths, so that other people don't have to.  Screw getting rez, I don't want it.  I want an active role, namely offtanking.<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't fire their offtank if he FD'ed when things started going bad, so that he could help recover from a possible wipe, instead of actually tanking things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Realize first that rez would help us get spots in 6 man content like GoD trials, where if the cleric bites the dust, it is sometimes impossible to recover, but would not be if we had rez. Additionally, we ask for tanking improvements as #1 on the list, this is #10 to add a bit of versatility since most of our spells can now be duplicated by commonly available clickies. Last,presuming one has a brain, on a raid, they will only FD for recovery when either the situation is lost or the raid leader tells them to.</div></div><hr />

With regard to your first point, I must heartily disagree. If we indicated that we listed them in order of importance, they can't reasonably ignore that. It would be the same as ignoring the list entirely, which would make the lists pointless in the first place. Additionally, if what you say is true, we should just have a 1 item list: &quot;1.

<br />
As to your other two replies, I would like to point you to Slein Jinn's posts regarding why having a rez would be unbalancing.  I don't agree completely with everything he has stated, but I do think that getting such an important ability added to our class presents a lot of balancing problems.  As much fun as it is to be one of the amazingly overpowered classes, I know that's not good for the game, so I'd rather not see that happen.  We're already one of the most survivable classes in the game because of our high AC, high HP and feign death abilities, and perhaps we are the top of the heap when it comes to survivability.  While it would be nice to be able to put this survivability to use, we have to strive to do it in a way that is fair to everybody involved, including paladins and warriors.  I'm perfectly content to agree to disagree with you on this point, but my stance is that giving us necro rez would be too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I've been trying to come up with a way to give us rez without putting us ahead of paladins, but havn't had any luck... <br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind that I've seen come up - &quot;Pallys have so many advantages (stuns, heals, rez, etc.) it's fine for us to be better.&quot; Poor line of thought, as rez is really the only issue to which this is relavant.  Their other advantages are other issues - saying we should be more powerful in this area, and using defeciencies in other areas as justification will lead to us not getting fixed in those other areas.  <br />

I'm leaning toward giving us some large utility item, such as the Autofeign buff AA I mentioned in another thread (or was it earlier in this one...) - not necessarily that ability, I havn't worked on the details enough to know that it's reasonable, but something along those lines, or anything else that fills the same role - a large, desirable piece of utility.  We don't need to parallel pally rez directly, we just need to equal it's desirability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I still like Gash's suggestion of a the 'pally-like sacrifice AA', where if we cast it on a corpse, it rez's it and we die in the process.  With a long reuse timer on it (say, 18 hrs), it can still save a raid/expedition and doesn't have the abuse potential that having standard necro rez would.  Can't use it on ourselves that way, and can't stick around to protect the cleric we just rez'd/revived/summoned, etc.<br />
<br />
I did read the argument question &quot;Is rez up?&quot; in a potential pickup group selection situation but I think it'd be a good limiter to keep us from passing the pally's in that utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for gash's ability, the limiting factors would prevent it from being used when it's NOT a balance issue (random rezzes as needed - there's not a problem with us gaining this ability really... it's not so much a balance concern).  It wouldn't have ANY notable impact on it's use as an emergency wipe-recovery tool, however, and that is where the balance issues come into play - honestly, no &quot;penalty&quot; you can put on it will, short of making it useless.</div></div><hr />

Ha, that's why I repeatly asked for real NECRO rezz. NOTHING less. I don't care what other classes would say (except clerics who will love this and it will make other classes to love this cuz we save group times to continue trials) but a real necro rezz will not make &quot;is rez up?&quot; to happen at all. ;) Then problem is solved. Screw other classes if they complained and give us necro rezz. I never asked for less. Pfft. Also, don't need to explain to me why we shouldn't get necro rezz and settle for less. I had read enough to hear your side. :) I only wanted to make point why necro rezz is more useful than long refresh one for group settings and avoid hearing dread question, &quot;is your rezz up?&quot;<br />
<br />
And SOE giving us necro rezz WILL not even take their time at all to code unique feature for us or whatever. They simply tweak spell to slap SK to necro rezz then its done. :D No complication involved at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Mallce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Back on the subject, why is it so hard for people to realize that getting rez would be detrimental to our efforts to regain the offtanking role?  If we have rez, it'll go from &quot;FD in the corner and wait for loot to drop&quot; to &quot;FD in the corner and wait for loot to drop or the raid to wipe.&quot;  That's not an improvement.  Necros having FD and rez is a very different situation from SKs having FD and rez.  A necro, who is doing his role properly, has a far better chance of being able to FD during a wipe, while an SK who is offtanking is probably going to be one of the first to die, because our job as any sort of tank is to take the hits, and the deaths, so that other people don't have to.  Screw getting rez, I don't want it.  I want an active role, namely offtanking.<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't fire their offtank if he FD'ed when things started going bad, so that he could help recover from a possible wipe, instead of actually tanking things?<br />
<br />
I agree completely. Us getting rez in no way shape or form helps us do our job better. It would be a detriment to the class.<br />
<br />
Just imagine if our new role was rezzing the cleric in case of a wipe. There is no way we’d be allowed to off-tank anymore. Just say if you do die off tanking, then who will recover the raid? If you die, you didn’t do your job, right? If I was a raid leader, and SK got rez, I’d make the SK do nothing but FD in the corner incase a wipe happens. That would be fun wouldn’t it.

Hehe, Top 1-9 already addressed the class in a whole so we are set for it. Rezz is only hotly debated against SCS. That's all. To me, rezz or SCS is equiv to &quot;toy&quot; for 10th item. So it looks like 10th slot is a toy category cuz we seems to address class problems in first 9 items and had nothing else to say other than sneaking in SCS toggle or rezz as a package or any other toys that we throw in.</div></div><hr />

So, stop telling me it's #10 if all are treated the same. It has no business on the list IMHO. It's a stupid request that doesn't help us in our off tanking role we all claim to want.

But we do need some sort of ability that will increase our utility and desirability for groups (besides the tanking upgrade we should get).<br />
I also feel the same way Nocifer does about not caring about what other classes say, but in reality what other classes (warriors) say  has historically affected how the devs treat us.  Warriors seem to have the skill and readiness to cockblock other tank classes any chance they get.  Unfortunately they have the numbers to where their opinion is usually heard and taken into consideration.  The last thing the devs want is another warrior tantrum.</div></div><hr />

However, I don't see what is wrong with it if we get Convergence at level 69 or +/- one level.

I don't raid on a large scale, but I do see the truth in that.  But once in a while though (more often than I care to admit), let's say on single group encounters like lower end GoD trials, an unexpected add from behind eats the clerics before the cc'er can get things under control.  I might still be standing and fighting the original mob at that point -- yet have no chance to survive because no healers are left alive.  This is when I'd flop, and find that some sort of rez would be handy when the coast is clear.<br />

The point is that necros already have it, so that role, if a raid leader instisted on filling it, is already taken.  Therefore, the SK can still do his job just like before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that so many SKs in these threads on this topic keep saying &quot;I am often the last one alive&quot; tells me that what you state is unnecessary. Additionally, probably more SKs would remain alive except we usually try to keep mobs busy while the cleric camps. Now, instead of doing that, we can flop. So what you say is imo unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Remember, a wipe isn't KABOOM everyone dead, generally it's either folks getting whittled down, or a group of folks dying, etc. As long as you spread out your folks, chances are, if an SK has reason to FD, he'll have the chance 9 times out of 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Our primary job is that of a tank.

<br />
These mobs hit from 1600 a hit to 3000 a hit and with no heals I would not last long whats the sense of dying when some survivors could be of use alive?<br />
<br />
The other day this occured and a cleric was able to run back but couldn't reach the corpses without dying.  No rogues were alive and the mobs saw invis.  In this situation at least your able to DA and drag a rouge to be rezzed.<br />
<br />
Once the rogue is rezzed he can use sos to drag the rest.<br />

The other day things looked bad during Ikkinz 2 trial.  We had the boss split and a tank died and it ran over and started killing all the clerics.

Nobody's saying it's a problem vs. necros, so that nobody can provide an example of when it'd be too much relative to necros is irrelivant - it'd be a problem vs. paladins.  Nothing in your list addresses the fact that it'd basically put paladins in the same position we are in now.  Putting the tanking differences aside, as that's a separate issue, it would go from &quot;lets get the pally, he has rez&quot; to &quot;lets get the SK, he has FD&quot; and pallys would be lacking desirable utility relative to SK's just as we are relative to pallys now.  <br />

<br />
<br />
We do need something - that's for sure - it's just that rez isn't it.  <br />
<br />
Expanding on what I had proposed about a FD DI spell...<br />
AA Based, 10-20ish minute reuse.<br />
Single target buff.<br />
Reasonably long duration - 30mins or so.<br />
Moderately priced regent - star ruby or a couple of emeralds or something.<br />
Causes player to feign death/escape/whatever when attacked<br />
Fires at 80-90% or so, unless it can be coded to fire when the player gains aggro (preferable).<br />
Buff drops after it fires.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily complete, but enough that you get the idea.  It would certainly suffice in terms of creating desirable utility to parallel paladins' rez, but it would require more work/analysis to determine if it is/can be a well balanced solution.  It also wouldn't have the concerns of hindering our tanking role that rez would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A trick some pallies use when wipes are 'likelier' than normal in GoD is that they keep rez up as a spell gem.  In the situation quoted, the pally might stun/root if/when able, and cast rez on the cleric (instructing the cleric not to hit yes) and continue fighting until the face hits the dirt.  There hopefully would be a escape rogue who can advise when the coast is clear.  True, that doesn't work 100% of the time (or even close) but is a trick used.</div></div><hr />

     What changes in the game were ever made that caused SCS to go from being benificial to detrimental? .. it was allways overwhelmingly detrimenta in almost all situationsl.  Those who bought it thinking they were aggroing too much must not ever have been very good at controlling their own aggro.  Those who claimed it let them use more of their dots/nukes etc. without aggroing as much at raids, fail to see that there are supposed to be situational costs and benefits to certain playstyles.  <br />

There has been no further update at this time regarding any of the old issues on your class list.  I have altered the list to reflect the new items added and submitted.<br />
 <br />
1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated) <br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
5. Deathpeace is no longer sufficent as an FD tool. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
7. Knight DPS while not meant to be the highest should be higher than Bards. Far more progressed SK's can be KS'ed by Bards with ease from sheer lack of DPS on our part. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
8. A method to reduce damage allowing us to compete with Paladin stuns (NEW)<br />
<br />
9. An upgrade to Leech Touch, it provides less of a HP swing, cannot be focused, cannot be disced, costs more AA, and prevents us from using our other HT to use. (NEW)<br />
<br />
10. Removal/Refund of SCS or a toggle added to it. (NEW)<br />
<br />
Ky<br />

I guess Necro Rez did not make the list?<br />
<br />
I retired ages ago, but I am back now and back on Tropics. I dont agree with #4 at all, I think we channel pretty well through melee, it is only bashes that really interupt my casting ever. <br />
<br />
As for #5, the main problem with Deathpeace is the fact we &quot;fall to the ground&quot; far too much, and this seems to be a new change as it rarely failed before afew patches ago. Since we have a 1 second cast time and have to channel a FD I believe Deathpeace should be changed to a no fail spell, if we get it off we should succeed in the feign every time. Monks dont have a cast time, cannot fizzle, and dont require mana for FD. We in return for putting up with such issues should have a successful feign every time it works. Or if this fails what ever happend to our FD AA idea?<br />
<br />
#3 is so right, warn them about the bloody spells we are getting in Omens, I read those spells on Alla and almost puked. 5 levels more and we get about a 20% increase in total spell power on some spells and others are sick. We need a new lich spell to do better mana regen then VoC, the new chanter mana buff that does 20 per a tick. Necroes get 60 mana per a tick lich, we should get at least a 30 mana per a tick lich spell at 69 or 70 spell. Also our new darkness spell does 15 more dmg per a tick and snares no better at all, I want more slow power, not 15 more dmg per a tick, we should be able to fear and snare a creature to a crawl and this new darkness spell does nothing for us. New blood spell line, sucks, 48 more damage per a tick, wooptidoo, that is going to be noticable.  :rolleyes: Best spell line we have may be the bite line, we need these spells reduced in cast time so we can mem the 2 best and cast 1 ever 15 seconds, 30 second cast times, combine that with a good lich spell and we would be hugely helpful when we are not TM'ing, kiting, ect...<br />
<br />
#6, spell agro? Hell I still use Clinging darkness, give me back my Disease Cloud I still say. I came back a born again noob and tried to use our taunt spells, the terror line is a waste of play and a waste of space in my book. It is a waste of spells that we could get in the expansion that would actually be useful. I used those things for a whole day, I went oom, I had a hell of a time getting agro and keeping it, I got infuriated with recast times, it was a pain in the ass. I then remembered Clinging Darkness was taunt for me and tried it, again I could hold agro over anyone using a level 9 spell. Nothing as good as DC was (if you are old school enough to remember what snap agro truely looked like) but CD is the king for SK's still and the terror line is useless. SOE has no clue about our agro spells, they suck, they dont have anyone in SOE who has a clue as to those spells or what we would need to be agro machines, give me a 0 damage spell that does nothing but makes the mob *think* I snared it and has twice the hate counters as Clinging darkness and casts in 1 second with a recast of 2 seconds for 20 mana. Something in the darkness lines and especially CD taunts like crazy, take that something and increase it and make it a new spell. Those terror line spells missed the boat.<br />
<br />
#9, Leech touch, simple, make them stack. Or make a omens AA that makes them stack. Any modifications that alter HT should be made such that they do not need to be activated and all stack. a SK once an hour or so should be able to nail a mob for 8500 hps of damage and heal for that amount, that is not overpowered. This is such a obvious fix for HT aa's and discs.<br />
<br />
Plus, I will add one thing, old idea I had ages ago. Want some damage reduction/mitigation to match pallies? We need a Omens of War AA that costs 6/12/18 that causes SK's to have inate tap on all melee attacks of 2/5/10%. With our DPS this would amount to not a whole lot of healing, but it would be substantial enough combined with lifetp procs and such that we would get closer to tanking ability through healing 10% of the dmg we deal back to ourselves. Call it a permanent mini Leech Curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">If we are going to ask for a toggle of SCS...how about make it<br />
<br />
Toggle up...+20% aggro generation<br />
Toggle down...-20% aggro generation.<br />
<br />
That way it becomes a tool for all SKs...not just the ones who purchased it in ages past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Tropics - What we are looking for here is a mitigation ability that scales with mob DPS, not one that scales with our DPS.  That is what will help to bring us in line with the power that Paladins have, and to a lesser extent the power that Warriors have.<br />
<br />
Croaakk - I like that idea.  Does SOE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Is it pally stuns that are scaling with DPS of the mobs? This would largely be trash mobs if so, unless pally stuns are way more landable then I was thinking they would be. The higher the mob the more resists and the less they can mitigate the dps. Similar to the problem we would face of higher AC, more DPS from the mob, and less healing from our DPS return. It could be balanced pretty well. If we have a problem with wanting it to scale then make me giddy by making the AA cost 9/18/and 30AA per a level and make it not only increase the healing return but also boost attack by 2/5/10% of base such that we would be a more offensive tank class then pallies that are more based on attacks then pure defense.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it I am from the school that SK's should be a more offenive tank then a pally. Not a weaker class when it comes to tanking but one that derives its survivability more on the ability to cripple and steal life from mobs then on purely defensive skills. Unresistable/tap resist 10% haste tap that stacks with everything in both the slow and haste department would also suit the SK image. Make it a 2 minute duration 200 mana spell with a 3 second cast time and a 1 minute recast time, that scales with the mob as well and is more suited to the SK then a warrior or a pally. Give it huge ongoing agro due to some dmg dot with such that it helps us tank and taunt and makes it very tricky to use when others are tanking so that it is not a useful spell for others to tank with the added haste debuff. It can replace the terror line and become our bread and butter taunt spell that creates massive agro and cannot be used in raids when we are not the tank.<br />
<br />
Whatever you ask for make it a offensive/attack orientated thing that creates our added tanking ability. The lifetap melee does this, increased attack and reduction of mob attack does this combined with the tap melee very well, a stackable (on shaman/chanter haste, only 1 SK per a mob though) haste tap does this as well. Dont make us another defensive orientated class any more then we already are. Just think of ways to make us offensive orientated in ways that also create survivability such as these ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Paladin stuns prevent attacks from happening, and therefore scale in power (on mobs they land on, true) with mob power.  An ability that bases its power off of our melee output scales with our DPS, which is on a completely different scale.  What we need, desperately, is something that increases with power as the mobs increase in power.  Any solution that hinges our tanking ability to our DPS is bad, because in order to maximize our HP/AC we need to use a shield, and there goes our DPS.<br />
<br />
I do not have any exact numbers on DPS, but at the high end let's say our melee DPS with a good two hander is 300 DPS.  10% of that is 30, so our heals would, in a manner of speaking, reduce the damage we're taking by 30 DPS, at best.  With mobs throwing around DPS closer to 2000 than to 0, even with 100% tap from our melee we would be in bad shape.  Exactly how much does the leech curse discipline help you tank against these hard hitting mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">So how does the tap resistent haste tap do ya? That scales with mob power, it also rechecks agro every tick so that it cannot be used as a slow for other classes. In effect it kills 2 birds with one stone, massive agro, and it gives us damage mitigation in the form of a self only slow. Combine that with the 33 DPS of heals (because we are now hasted 10% over the former cap so we do 10% more DPS, woops another bird) and we are mitigating 233 DPS on a mob that does 2000 DPS, or 333 DPS on a mob that dishes 3000 DPS (if our own DPS remains equal on the mob). As you can see the tap AA is a small part of the fix, maybe that due to levels. If the numbers on the permanent leech curse truely need to be higher to matter then make a case to SOE. 100% hasted leechcurse for me (the 100% of melee disc) makes me alot better tank. If I had a 1 minute version of that that could be used with the same consistency as defensive I would be quite happy and I think 300 DPS mitigated using your numbers for high end SK's is pretty substantial on any mob as a form of damage mitigation. As I said, if we need more Leech heal make a case to SOE, I think they would be tough to get 10% out of but if you can make the AA get 2/5/10/20/30 for a huge cost of AA in a long chain uf 5 upgrades then groovy. 90 DPS mitigated and add a 10% haste tap that adds to our DPS in both our melee being faster and more heals and the mob attacking us slower by 10% and thus being mitigated on its own DPS as well as ours. Take 10% of the mobs DPS and lose it, then add 30% of your DPS in heals. I dont think we need more then that, if you think we would get more, or even get that much you are dreaming. If we could get what I just stated I would be in heaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">The Innate Leechcurse ability could help, but would need some additions.<br />
1 - partial autoriposte <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Counterattack on every hit the mob lands on you.                                   You and the mob would get hit. <br />
You would hit the mob for 5/10/15% of the damage he inflicted on you + 10/20/30% of the damage you would do with your own weapon on a normal attack.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
2 - 100% Life gained back from these Partial Ripostes<br />
<br />
3 - if a normal riposte does happen no life is gained back since the mob didnt hit you<br />
<br />
4- if 15% of mob damage is lower then 30% of your weapon damage , the damage of your weapon wont be added resulting in an partial riposte of 15% of the mobs damage only<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
A mob hits you for 2000 damage a hit and you are doing 330 damage per hit to the mob. <br />
Your partial riposte would be 300 (15% from 2000) + 99 (30% from 330) = 399 damage done to the mob and 399 life gained back -&gt; close to 20% mitigated damage additionally to erverything else we already mitigate.<br />
<br />
Fighting a blue con that hits for 660. <br />
Your riposte would be 99 (15% from 660) + 99 (30% from 330) = 198 damage to the mob and life gained back -&gt; 30% mitigated damage - the maximum possible with this ability<br />
<br />
Fighting a green con that only hits for 60 damage a hit you would riposte with 9 (15% of 60) since the 99 (30% from 330) damage of your weapon are way larger then 9. You will be healed for 9 damage total. Resulting in 15% mitigated damage.<br />
<br />
From these examples you can see, that this ability if implemeted as shown, would result in best mitigation against trash mobs that are nearly equal in power to the shadowknight -&gt; add tanking<br />
Worst mitigation against green cons that are no danger to the shadowknight.<br />
And medium mitigation against named mobs, where the warrior should be the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Tropics - So you want a slow that stacks with everything and has a recourse that overhastes us?  With the amount that slows are mitigated already, it strikes me as unlikely that SOE will consent to handing out even more abilities to slow mobs, especially to classes that have never had them before.  Leech curse is potentially useful against enemies that cannot one or two round kill you, but against such enemies do we really need a serious power boost?  My biggest problem with this idea is that it doesn't increase in power on the same scale as mob DPS, unless you throw in the slow + haste tap idea, in which case the % healed from our melee becomes a small part of the equation.  The slow + haste tap idea seems flawed to me, because in order to be useful it would have to be unresistable (making it extraordinarily powerful), and even if it was unresistable it would be meaningless once a &quot;real&quot; slow lands.<br />
<br />
Blackmerlin - My problem with this ability is the absurd levels to which it would pump our DPS, and the fact that healing is not really mitigation/avoidance.  If a mob that quads for 2000 every 2.2 seconds is meleeing us, we would have a potential extra 1596 damage every 2.2 seconds, or approximately 725 DPS.  Factoring in misses and hits for less than maximum would drop that to probably the 200 DPS range.  In addition to adding a ton of complexity to the code, it would vastly overpower our DPS while tanking.  Taking 20% of mob DPS and adding it to our own would, frankly, be too much.</div></div><hr />

SK rezz.  The main argument against it is its unfair to the other rezzing classes.  Whatever.  Our father class (necros) and brother class (paladins) both get some form of rezz (with pretty decent exp return I might add).  This makes them much more viable not only in raid content, but desirable in single group content (ie, gates trials, and future single group nonsense).<br />
<br />
My suggestions.<br />
<br />
#1) give us necro rezz, but no way to make essence emeralds.  It gives us a way to rezz, but a dependance on another class.<br />
<br />
#2) Give us a unique essence emerald rezz.  Make it lower exp gained, or 90% exp gained (equal to pals), and cost 2 essence ems or some shit<br />
<br />
#3) Give us a reverse summon corpse.  Give us an ability to summon a player to his corpse.  While it would work similar to rezz, it would restore no exp, but would still allow a corpse to be rezzed later.  <br />
<br />
It surprises me when people say &quot;We're knights of darkness, why would we 'restore people to life'&quot;.  Necros do.  We have a skeleton rezz (ie we RAISE THE DEAD).  <br />
<br />
/rambling off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">The slow + haste tap idea seems flawed to me, because in order to be useful it would have to be unresistable (making it extraordinarily powerful), and even if it was unresistable it would be meaningless once a &quot;real&quot; slow lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well yeah, I said it would be unresistable. Tap resistant, if a tap lands (and they are VERY rarely resisted as we all know) then the slow will land, it has the same resist check.<br />
<br />
Furthermore the haste stacks and puts us over the cap, so yeah we can be 10% higher haste then most other classes which seems fair as we use slower weapons on the whole then most other classes.<br />
<br />
The slow ALSO stacks. So if a Shaman slows a mob for 60% (or whatever they slow for) and we hit our slow than the mob is now slowed at 70% as they stack.<br />
<br />
In order for this haste/slow tap not to affect other classes tanking ability and allow them to tank the 70% slowed mob the haste/slow tap must be extremely huge taunt and each tick of the spell having affect rehits the agro. If the spell creates 1500 points of agro on the cast then each tick from then on it adds another 1500 hate. This makes us huge agro machines yes, but what it does more then that is only use this spell on mobs that we will be tanking because no way could people keep the agro off us. It becomes a self only slow spell.<br />
<br />
It is not overpowered in todays day and age with what many other classes can manage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Haste/ slow Idea sucks<br />
Slow was over powered there are now many slow immune mobs and many many named who mitigate to 25% slow.<br />
<br />
It's not an sk ability, it's over powered, it's making us a debuff whore, unresistable would make us better slowers in many situations than current slowers.  Make me a fucking tank again please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Make me a fucking tank again please.<br />

Yeah, cause a spell that locks agro onto you and you alone and slows the mob that you now will tank till it is dead due to the massive agro it causes continuously is just making you a debuff bitch. Whatever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">The biggest point against this is the hard coded cap that has been implemented on slows in order to decrease the reliance upon slow to kill anything.  If it still lands on mobs that are unslowable, or if it goes beyond the 25% that many new mobs mitigate slow to, then it's far too powerful an ability.  If it doesn't do those two things, or even one of them, then what's the point?<br />
<br />
In regards to use getting to have an extra 10% haste because &quot;we use slower weapons on the whole then most other classes&quot;, that is just a flawed argument.  Why does the speed of our weapons even come into play here?  It's not like a 25 delay weapon gets any more benefit out of haste than a 50 delay weapon, so mentioning our slower weapons as a reason to get more haste just doesn't fly.  Saying we should get an extra 10% haste because our DPS is lacking I could maybe see a reason behind, but it still wouldn't make me support SKs getting extra haste.<br />
<br />
As far as shedding the extra hate generated by the spell, hello AE taunt and FD.  Or simply just letting the SK die because it's more efficient to let the warrior tank.  In short, no thank you.</div></div><hr />

1) Your agro lock idea won't fly.<br />
<br />
2) And that helps me take hits better how?<br />
<br />
3) And when they design content with the 10-20% overslow in mind and it has a negligible effect how does it make me take those hits better?<br />

The core roles could be interchanged largely.<br />
Tank? sk pally or warr, doesnt matter eally.<br />
<br />
Slower? sham or chanter, either or, one brings mana regen, the other has better dps.<br />
<br />
Healer? cleric or druid/sham or druid/druid.<br />
<br />
dps? number of classes.<br />
<br />
With GoD they broke that.<br />

Mobs now require a warr to tank.<br />
the insane dps from charm kiting meand chanter/druid reins supreme.<br />
<br />
Cleric is a must have cause you die often to dmg spikes.<br />
<br />
What we need is to once again be on par with warrs for tanking, or at least close enough to make up the difference with patch healing from a shaman.<br />
<br />
If its via a innate leech curse ability that turns some of the incoming dmg into a heal *shrug*<br />
If its via an aa that slows a mob or reduces its dmg *shrug*<br />
If its by boosting the healing of shamans and druids so they can keep us alive *shrug*<br />
<br />
The problem? its fucken hard enough to find a good cleric to go hunting with in high end zones without having to find two of em cause your a gimped tank.<br />

Fix it so we need the same support as a warr to go hunting for fun.<br />

Dont care how its done, increase the AC tap to 1000ac decaying...<br />

Give us mini defensive that lasts long enough to slow a mob.<br />

Yeah, good point. It would have to be a spell that could not last if the caster was FD. Simply if you feign FD overwrites the haste/slow so that the mob instantly is back to normal speed as is the SK.</div></div><hr />
