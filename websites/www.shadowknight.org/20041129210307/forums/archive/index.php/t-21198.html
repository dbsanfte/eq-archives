<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, that tendency to play the Easy difficulty class/race combinations has more or less assured that the only 2 classes to survive after SoE alienates the rest of us, will be Warriors and Clerics.<br />

Until they alienate INT casters and druids, I'll continue to struggle it out in-game.  We're a small enough guild that I won't get to any of the high-end content that makes it impossible for us to progress to the Elemental Planes, let alone get into GoD content beyond tradeskilling in Abysmal.  But I'm seeing the end of the EQ experience looming in the distance.  I don't know how much I'll get to see or do if they raise the level cap to 70, I might get to see the Elemental Planes or even get to Time.  I still doubt, though, that we'll ever do much beyond single group stuff in GoD, since our MT on raids tends to be a Paladin who really knows what he's doing.  But then, we'll have to see if they go and revamp content to accomodate the increased lvl cap.  If they do, then we'll never get into the Elementals and we'll drop out like flies as EQ dies for casual players who want to see some of the higher content.</div></div><hr />
