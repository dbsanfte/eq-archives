<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else noticed this with Z Bite spell?  When u do an excpetional heal for 400 I have noticed often that in reality I have not healed anyone for 400 at all but only 200.  Even though the persons health has indicated that they have more then 400 hp of damage on them. <br />
<br />
This has been going on for a long time but I was wondering if anyone else noticed it?<br />
<br />
I would like my 400 heal to actually heal someone for 400.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can't see who your exceptional heal lands on... performing one dosen't necessarily mean it landed on one of the people who had less than 100% hp... and if it hits someone on full hp, you don't get any heal message at all...<br />
<br />
If you get an exp. heal when everyone in the group has over 400 damage taken, and you only heal 200... then I'm not sure, but it's never happened to me.</div></div><hr />

Where did the other 200 go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have 6 people in the group and you cast zbite, the 200hp heal part of the recourse lands on each of the 6 ppl.  The heal part of the recurse can crit on any of the 6 targets it hit, regardless if those targets have full hp or not, so for example:<br />
<br />
Hps of your group:<br />
<br />
100%<br />
80%<br />
100%<br />
65%<br />
100%<br />
100%<br />
<br />
Hp of your group after zb cast ZB cast..<br />
<br />
100%<br />
81%<br />
100%<br />
70%         &lt;----crit heal <br />
100%      <br />
100%       &lt;----crit heal<br />
<br />
In this istuation you would get 2 crit heal mesages, but only get 1 heal for 400 message.  The reason for this is one of the people you crit healed was already full on health, so there was no hp to heal on that target.  Its just like when u cast a lifetap, whiel you are at full health the damage part of the tap is still done and you can even crit the heal part, but yous till get no health since you are full.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Where did the other 200 go? <br />
<br />
i only have 266 health, so at 25 percent i'm at 66hp, and the exceptional can only heal 200. =0<br />
<br />
its really as darko and drakonn explained.<br />
<br />
with ToL 3 however, one in a million casts every group member will be exceptionally healed. if someone needs the HP then, you'll see it =)</div></div><hr />
