<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Babaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know a bout invising/hiding while handing items to the NPC but id just like to get my faction up to indifferently to be sure i won't fail any turn-in, that's why i need to know which part of epic quest gives the most faction and do it again and again... I'm going to try to hand some cough elixir from smaka to duriek but if anyone has suggestions id take them. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most SK NPC's will spawn 2-3 days after a patch.  There are a few good posts on the board about seal running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Babaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">erf, there's another patch today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nomorri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wondering if anyone here knows how high a shadow knight can get their Truespirit faction?   I've only completed about 60% of the Sk epic so far and it seems we only need to get to indifferent for our epic ,thus the hide trick. Does that mean that's as high as we can get our faction?  I happened to be in fear the other day and since no one needed the child's tear for the shaman epic I looted it for a possible MQ, being that both our epics are on Truespirit...from what I hear I would need to get to ally to be able to multiquest-just wondering if it's a lost cause, hate to spend all that time seal running if I can only get to indifferent as our max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you do the epic the way the quest is written (bizarre, I know), you *never* get higher than apprehensive...</div></div><hr />
