<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zinterax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading through all the walkthroughs etc and found differences in some , minor differences but they were there.  I was wondeirng if anyone had a recent walkthrough for IC.  Or can just post what they know. <br />
Ex)<br />
After you kill Lhranc he drops a coin that has to be handed in Marl Kestane.  Where does Marl spawn? in CoM or back on Kerra Isle ( i think thats where he is).  <br />
<br />
Ex 2) What drops soul leech? is it CT or does Terror and his other guards drop?<br />
<br />
Differences like that I have noticed.  Help a brother out!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dread, Fright and Terror can drop the sword.  I thought CT could too.  Killed demi's at least 10 times each, and CT twice ... still no sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Milon-MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lhranc doesnt drop the coin, u get it when u turn in the 4 items to respawn his human form and Marl spawns on the steps of Lhranc's house after Lhranc's spawned form is dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zinterax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey thanks a bunch guys for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oopsies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, After you kill Lhranc i was spazzing out looking for Marl, but i realized he spawns to the RIGHT of the Stairs, when looking at Lhranc's Door, on a little ledge, i then went behind him, snuck, handed in Coin, and got Epic, nice little Touch the Sneak button is :D</div></div><hr />
