<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was chatting with another SK and he mentioned the hide ability being trainable at lvl 35. I am 37 now so I ran off to a trainer to find that Hide was not even on the list. Was this fellow wrong in saying that shadowknights get hide at lvl 35 or is there a bug where iksar/sks arent able to train this?<br />
<br />
-=edit=-<br />
He was an ogre btw - not a dark elf with innate hide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try another trainer.<br />
<br />
Hide is one of the rares abilities from the trainers. Typically only the guild leader of your native city should be able to teach this to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarhier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought I saw Hide as a trainable skill in PoK as well, but havent had a chance to confirm that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The troll SK leader in Neriak has it. I trained in it but it doesnt seem good for an SK )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thats quite odd =) thanks for the replies</div></div><hr />

No hide, no hide trick. I dont want to miss that ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ophidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what is the hide trick? still new to the class, not quite sure what kind of neat things you can pull off with hide<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually .. yes it is useful (apart from the aforementioned)<br />
you can hide, while FD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took a couple years off the game, and I've been playing about 3 months and until I read this post last week, I had completely and totally forgotten that I even had hide.  Hehehe.<br />
<br />
Here are the places that hide is completely awesome.<br />
<br />
1) Out of mana/health and need to sit down to med and recover a bit.  Tummy starts grumbling a bit and you want to go make a sandwich.  Well, you could feign, but then you have super slow regen for health and mana.  you could invis, but then when it wears off you get attacked, probably while you are pouring your milk and you spill it all over dashing to the computer to save your already damaged SK.  Hide doesn't wear off, so you can sit in dungeons like Droga forever and not be attacked.<br />
<br />
2) As mentioned earlier, you can hide while feigned, which allows you to stand up and then if needed use it for #1 above.  If you feel really daring you can do it under a mobs nose even.<br />
<br />
3)  You want to pretend that you have the old unnerfed circlet of shadows, so you just hit the button and are invis.  :)  Ok, so it only works if you aren't going anywhere.  Glad I got mine before the nerf.  Even with me having the awesome old one, I am using hide a lot when I need to be AFK and don't want to use feign for some reason or another</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZacrooIsgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes, You get Hide at lvl 35. I got mine at the Guild master in cab. It also works very well when getting Bone Chips in FoB becouse when you sit down the lil mobs come hit you so put on hide and med all day, and all undead mobs under lvl 35 can't see hide from what I'v seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hide Trick = teh win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ebiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The is great but how exactly are you supposed to determine if you're hidden successfully before getting up when FD'ing right under a mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zenobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remove any see invis items or buffs. Type /target yourname. If it fails, you're hidden. If it target you, hide failed.</div></div><hr />
