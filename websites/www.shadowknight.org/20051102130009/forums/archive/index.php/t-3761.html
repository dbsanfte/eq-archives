<br />
1. Getup well ahead of posted raid time 2-1 hours before.  Take a shower. Drink<br />
some coffee, eat some breakfast... in other words give yourself time to wake up.<br />
<br />
2. Show up at meeting point 1 hour to 30 mins before raid time.  If theres a chat<br />
channle join it and let raid leader know your there.<br />
<br />
3. Sit down and listen.  Nothing is more annoying than having scrolls of spam<br />
run by when the raid leader is assigning groups.  Know who is in your group.<br />
Group leaders need to appoint somone in group to be secondary leader if they<br />
go link dead... it's just a precation so no one freaks out during a fight.<br />
<br />
4. Listen to pre-raid prep instructions.<br />
<br />
5. Listen to your group leader.  If your group leader says stfu then stfu, if your<br />
group leader says sit your arse down then sit your arse down.<br />
<br />
6. Sit your arse down.  Do NOT run around, don't even move, hell don't even <br />
BREATH. It distracts people that are keeping an eye out for wandering mobs<br />
and those that are planing the next move.  'But we're in a safe spot.'  FYI there<br />
is NO SAFE SPOT. I don't care if a mob never even paths throu that zone... <br />
SIT THE FREAK DOWN.  This also goes for that duck-crackhead-n00b walk<br />
people do. Cut it out, sit your arse down. People notice when you do it and<br />
they remember and they think 'Gawd if he/she ever did that in such and such<br />
zone we'd be dead.'  So it distracts people and they begin a spiral of untrust<br />
just because YOU couldn't sit your friggin arse down.<br />
<br />
7. Spam.  Keep it in groups. Only spam that should be flying across the chat<br />
is MA's message, SA's message, Pullers message (including tagger), Debuffs,<br />
Snare. No one cares if your assist message is cool or not and no one wants to<br />
see it.  Your assist keys should be this and only this: /assist MAname  and<br />
/assist SAname  thats it, NO message, NO 'i'm helping MAname beat on a %t'<br />
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE IT.  Casters only call out messages IF it lands. Same<br />
as debuffers and what not.  Reason?  Clerics and Casters can't see messages<br />
when they have to scroll up to see what has been cast and clerics missed the<br />
CH cycle message and most important you can't see that Mob_A has been<br />
mezed message. Result DEAD people.  So do yourselfs a favor and get rid<br />
of the messages that go along with your assist key.<br />
<br />
8. PAY ATTENTION.  Can not stress this enough.  If your afk don't tell just<br />
the group tell the whole dam raid.  If your in tell hell go afk and message can't<br />
talk now.  If your gettin to much spam from gu then say to gu /gu going off gu<br />
for a bit.  You should be on only ONE chat channel (unless you have one set<br />
up for group leaders, puller team.. ect).  Chat channel is NOT auct channel.<br />
<br />
9. Down time, rest time.  During long raids there will be down time and time<br />
that half or all of the raid goes afk.  Group Leaders if Move is called and<br />
there is still someone afk then make sure it is known that person is afk.<br />
Now for those that are afk and raid moves.  DO NOT MOVE.  Stand still.<br />
Let them know you are back and someone will come get you or tell you if<br />
the way is clear.  If you move you might train raid killing them or get yourself<br />
killed, so to be safe just STAND STILL.<br />
<br />
10. LD's.  Group leader ONLY call LD's, if it's the group leader that goes ld then<br />
the person chosen to lead group call's ld. If you go link dead and come back<br />
and everyone is gone DO NOT MOVE.  Stand still. Let them know you are <br />
back and someone will come get you or tell you if the way is clear.  If you <br />
move you might train raid killing them or get yourself killed, so to be safe <br />
just STAND STILL.<br />
<br />
11. Stick to the plan.  On raids there are certain objectives.  Once those objectives<br />
are meet then you can change your plans according to mobs available and zone<br />
loot.  Changing plans mid-raid is a sure way to get you and everyone killed.<br />
If plan is to go in and kill some green mob don't treat it as anything but a lvl 60<br />
warrior/wizzard with mana burn.  Even a lvl 60 can be zerg killed by green mobs.<br />
<br />
12. Experience. Forget it. Don't even think of it, don't even mention it. On a raid<br />
experience DOES NOT EXSIST.  Whining about experience detracts from the<br />
focus of the raid.  It leads to rushed pulls and bad mistakes and eventually to<br />
death and even raid wipe outs.  If you have a problem keep it to your self and<br />
take it up with the raid leader later.<br />
<br />
13. Loot. Know what is in the zone for you.  It's real simple. Find a web page and<br />
print out the list of items that you can use for race/class.  There is absolutely no<br />
reason why someone should spend 3 mins spamming stats on a item that you<br />
should already know about.  Other part of this is KNOW what you want out of<br />
the drop list. Lotto's should take NO MORE than half the mobs decay rate.  Do<br />
NOT whine and complain about how there are no drops for your race/class in<br />
zone whatever.  We do not care.  Doing so makes you look bad to everyone and<br />
the only thing we'll remember is that your a punk whining about loot, not if you<br />
single handedly saved the entire raid.<br />
<br />
14. Most important. HAVE FUN.</div></div><hr />

1. Someone will get loot, it most likely won't be you.<br />
2. Someone will get exp, it most likely won't be you.<br />
3. Someone will die many times, it most likey will be you.</div></div><hr />
