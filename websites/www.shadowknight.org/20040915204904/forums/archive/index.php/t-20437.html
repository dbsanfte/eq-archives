To answer your questions from a personal perspective:<br />
<br />
1) the drop rate has gone WAY up. Took me a couple of sessions to get my drops for this, and Comatose was a real pain for drops. Have since gone back to do the quest for both my necro and a fellow SK and both quests took 20 mins tops.<br />
<br />
2) At 44 you might want to bring a buddy or two along. I did both quests at 50 or so and the exp was great but the mobs were tough for me, and adds were a problem for myself and the boxed druid. Again, the drop rate has been increased to where you won't be there long. However keep this spot filed away for future use as the Comatose one at least is a nice exp spot and good <br />
drops (BDs, etc)<br />
<br />
3) Is it worth it? Yes, BoP was one of my staple dots until much later on and I still toss it out there when I'm in dot mode either agrokiting or on certain raid fights. The low mana cost makes it a nice one to have in your lineup.</div></div><hr />
