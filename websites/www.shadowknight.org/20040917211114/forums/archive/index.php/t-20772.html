<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelnathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hoping someone here could give me a hand...I've been looking for Marl Kastane in Kerra Isle for the past few days now and can't find him.  Can't even get him on track with my bard. <br />
<br />
Is there something I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Do I have to hail Llranc in CoMist before he spawns, is he broken after the patch, or am I just an idiot and in the wrong zone?<br />
<br />
Any information would help. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He spawns in the little round hut directly south of 1 and east of 2 on the eqatlas map (http://www.eqatlas.com/kerraislemap.html) <br />
<br />
if despawned by a hand in or killed he can take about 3 days to repop. given all the patchs lately i'd be surprised if he's even had a chance to appear in weeks. <br />
<br />
keep checking though. he will show.<br />
<br />
and no, you dont have to talk to Llranc first</div></div><hr />
