<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried a couple different searches but after reading through 30 threads I gave up looking and will just ask.<br />
<br />
Do our torrents and Zevs work on our pet if we get pet affinity?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beastlord in my group said that AoH and bard songs were hitting his pet.  I honestly didnt check if the ZB heal was landing on his pet, or for that matter if his pet was even damaged such that a heal message would show.  I'd assume all group related spells will land, including torrents and ZB recourse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AE range to get the recourse is a bit of a pain in the ass on AoH if you are kiting and want this to land on the pet-- or even if your group is split up durng a raid due to offtanking or kites...200' spell range with 60' AE range on the recourse. Zbite recourse is more reasonable, at 100'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">None of our [small] guild's pet classes have gotten Pet Affinity yet.  When I finish my current AA set, I may get that next, if anything to get it out of the way hehehe.<br />
<br />
Since we usually buff up before we bring up pets (mostly LDoN adv's atm), it probably has limited value.  Mid-adventure, we generally only regen and haste using group versions; most hp/ac and mind buffs are done outside the dungeon.<br />
<br />
I too have read very little on Pet Affinity, mostly because I don't read BL/Nec/Mag boards, and not many of us have gotten it yet (too costly and too little benefit).  We did have a bit of a blurb here from peeps on the GoD beta though, I think.<br />
<br />
My guesses (please keep that in mind) would be:<br />
<br />
- Most standard group buffs/heals - yes<br />
<br />
- Celestial Regeneration (cleric aa group regen) - yes<br />
<br />
- Divine Arbritration (cleric aa group hp equalizing thing) - no<br />
<br />
- Zevfeer's Bite - no<br />
<br />
- SK Aura of * - no<br />
<br />
- most bard songs - yes<br />
<br />
- Paragon - yes<br />
<br />
- Necro group taps - no<br />
<br />
- Spirit of the Wood (druid aa regen/ds) - yes<br />
<br />
- druid/cleric healing wards - yes<br />
<br />
- group heals (pally, cleric) - yes.  no.  maybe<br />
<br />
- radiant cures - yes.  no.  maybe<br />
<br />
- teleports (hey, gotta mention it ;) ) - no<br />
<br />
Again, I am purely guessing -- will gladly accept the appropriate beatings where I guessed wrong.  I'm basing those guesses that the ones that will hold are ones that go in the buff window or the temporary buff window (song) EXCEPT those with recourses (such as sk group taps, necro group taps), and recourses/heals with no icon at all in the buff window (like ZB recourse).  Some stuff may be recourses but don't say the word recourse in the buff description, so I could be thrown off there.  The heals and cures throw me off tho'.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one of the peeps that get dozens of aa/day can enlighten us!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaurusL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ZB hits group pets with Pet Affinity.  Was doing an LDON with a mage with this and noticed the pet in the message of who I healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually Klotar, I think that the only one in your list that wouldn't work on pets is the teleport (duh!) and the divine arbitration.  Earlier in the post Catharsis actually said that Aura of Hate works, which also says that logically all the other auras would work.  *ANY* spell that has an icon pop up in your window is pretty much guarenteed to work, as well as any instant type spell.  Necro group taps leave an icon, so I would bet that they work on pet (other than the fact that pets don't use mana, so those one's wouldn't matter.  Still work, but wouldn't matter)<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure why you decided that recourses wouldn't work or that the spells would require a buff icon to work, but I don't believe that this is the case.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Woops, he sure did say that, missed it.<br />
<br />
That's great that ZB/Aura hits the pets!  :)  That's the clincher for me, I'm gonna get Pet Affinity next (yes, I could spend the points instead on something better but what the heck).<br />
<br />
Not sure how I got into my line of thinking regarding recourses -- possibly a mix of how recourses worked for a short period of time when they were first put in, and I thought I recalled a post where they weren't considered to be real buffs (mebbie it was a dream).<br />
<br />
20 pts for PA -- pricey, but if ZB/Aura's hit, that makes the cost hurt a bit less.<br />
<br />
PS - ready for the scantilly-clad DE babe with the whip now.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dont feel too bad klotar alot of the pre-GoD release info said that are aura's and zbite wouldn't hit the pets. This is the first time i've heard different and is a pleasant suprize...still think im along way off from getting it myself =\.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vuurl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all your answers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torahdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, this is the first time i have read that Zbite and Aura's hit pets also. I was in beta and they never did there. I did /feedback like 10 times a day and this was in atleast 1 of them :p but im very surprised they actually made it work, and happy.<br />
