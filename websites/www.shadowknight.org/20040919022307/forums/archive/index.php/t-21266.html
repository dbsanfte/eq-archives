<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ylaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, Im sure most of you have absolutely no idea who I am..Basically what I'm looking for is help with compiling a list of AAs that are misworded, very vague or otherwise have less than useful descriptions so that the descriptions could be changed in the future<br />
<br />
However I need your help to do it since I don't know what every single AA does or is supposed to do<br />
<br />
So what I would appreciate is if knowledgable shadowknights could help by posting AA's which have incorrect descriptions and then tell me also what they *do* or are supposed to do..<br />
<br />
This is not about balance, so please don't post what shadowknights need or should get at this point I'm only really interested in getting the facts, any help is most appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The big one that comes to mind is the AA ability for the lifetap harmtouch improvements.  They say that they increase &quot;leechcurse&quot; or &quot;leech curse&quot; by 200 a level, when in fact they increase &quot;leech touch&quot;.  I'm not currently near an EQ capable machine, so I can't verify the exact spellings, but what I typed above is reasonably close.</div></div><hr />

    * Requirements: Level 61, Leech Touch at Level 1<br />

Requirements: Level 61, No previous ability requirements<br />
Each rank of this ability adds an additional 1.5% to your maximum hit points. (note this is currently only giving 1.25% to SK's despite the in-game description)<br />
Can be trained once at 61, 63, and 65</div></div><hr />
