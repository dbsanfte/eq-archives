<br />
I have decided to consoliate threads into this sticked thread to make it easier for Dev. to read. PM me for any changes or suggestions to improve this thread. Current set-up is too confusing and I want our voice to be heard better and need to fix some AA/spells before GoD (Expected to be released on Feb. 10th) comes. I will not post anything that is related to NDA unless source is from open source. I am no beta tester btw. This thread will be strictly moderated and will stay sticked til few weeks later after GoD's release and move it to suggestion forum. I shalt post another post-GoD sticked temporary thread for any comments how we feel about post GoD AA and spells. Any irrevelant posts will be deleted to reduce signal-to-noise ratio for readers. <br />
<br />
I suggest you to post your wishlist and any new AA/spells that aren't listed here. I notice that each class has certain set of AA skills to acquire. maybe 13-15 skills per class. Let's list your top priority of 15 skills so dev. can guage overall top 15 preferred list. I dunno why we are limited to several AA skills this time. SOL and POP, we got ALOT more AA list AND level increases (POP). <br />
<br />
I'll update this post of any latest GoD AA/spells. I'll list GENERIC AA list known for any classes and current spells. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, here's my suggestion. ;)<br />
<br />
I understand that from what I saw lately from various sources that we didn't get most what we wanted. I'll just wanted to make suggestions from original post and narrow it down for SKs and hope that beta testers can read this and try to add or change to make it attractive. For this, I'm only talking about hybrids and Sks. This is not related to NDA cuz this is wide open full AA list for all so its ok and I am not commenting what I saw from published current class AAs etc. I just voice out opinion on each open AA lines that I think we should get and delete any AA that is not SK related and hope that beta testers could use some tips to change or whatever. <br />
<br />
Top 15 AA skills I want to see off list I narrowed down below (remember, I'm baised toward 1h/shield knight that I love the most so my priorities are different from most SKs. :D)..<br />
1. Improved Innate Run speed (we all get that so its required)<br />
2. Improved Innate Reg (we all get that so its required)<br />
3 Sturdiness (We MUST have that to keep in-line with warriors!)<br />
4. Weapon Affinity (assuming that its proc-rate increase)<br />
5. Shield Specialization<br />
6. Increased Bash Damage <br />
7. Blinding Reverence <br />
8. Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
9. Stonewall<br />
10. Shallow Grave<br />
11. Strikethrough<br />
12. Rapid Strikes <br />
13. Theft of Life (assuming its advanced version)<br />
14. Persistent Casting <br />
15. Critical Affliction<br />
<br />
Gee, its hard to limit to 15. ;) Anything less than 15 is tougher.. I like FD hotkey as well as new suggestion. Added DS is very very low priority. Pet crits are very minor for us cuz our pets are already weak.. I rather to get NEW upgraded pet spell. It would be fun to add new AA related to horses upgrades. ;) But I WANT 1h/shield improvements to come first... I rather to see improved lung capacity to be gone so we can exchange for USEFUL skill. I never seen someone trained in original lung capacity SOL AA anyway.<br />
<br />
9151 Improved Innate Run Speed<br />
9152 This ability will slightly modify your base run speed. This modification does NOT stack with movement rate spell effects.<br />
<br />
Of course, It applies to all classes. A must for all.<br />
<br />
9153 Improved Innate Regen<br />
9154 This ability raises your regeneration ability by 1 point per ability level.<br />
<br />
It should apply to all classes cuz all of us already have that in General AA..<br />
<br />
9155 Improved Lung Capacity<br />
9156 This ability increases the amount of air you have by 25 and 50 percent.<br />
<br />
Same reason as above<br />
<br />
9157 Strikethrough<br />
9158 This ability gives a chance to bypass your opponents special defenses such as dodge, block, parry, and riposte.<br />
<br />
Sounds like pure melee ability. We might not get it. Would be nice to get it though. <br />
<br />
9159 Weapon Affinity<br />
9160 Through years of practice, you develop a close bond with your weapons. This affinity allows you to gain enhanced performance from your weapons in the form of an increased rate at which it triggers effects.<br />
<br />
Come on, It was for pure melees and priests and pure casters and left hybrids out in the cold. What logic is that? It's a must for knights cuz they spent YEARS on weapons. Casters DO NOT..<br />
<br />
9163 Mastery of the Past<br />
9164 Must spend 6 points in the General Abilities. o Description: This ability makes it impossible for you to fizzle a spell or miss a note. The first level affects all spells or songs up to level 54. The second level affects all spells or songs up to level 56. The third level affects all spells or songs up to level 58. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64. <br />
<br />
We, hybrids,  should get that by default due to our archtype even though its useless for us due to max lvl 58 and all of our spells we, SKs, use are post 60...<br />
<br />
9171 Heightened Endurance <br />
9172 This ability raises your natural endurance regeneration by 1 point per ability level.<br />
<br />
We are part melee so we should get that. However, in current setting with our current disclipines, it means NOTHING. We never have any issues with endurance right now. If we happen to get new frequent-use discs then this one could be useful. <br />
<br />
9187 Persistent Casting <br />
9188 Through strict concentration, you gain the ability to channel your spells through stuns. Increased levels of this ability increase the chance to cast through a stun.<br />
<br />
We, hybrids,  HAVE to get this one. We fight in combat ALL the time. We, knights, should learn how to cast thru stuns especially from bashing in close combat than any other classes.<br />
<br />
9191 Critical Affliction<br />
9192 This ability grants your damage over time spells the chance to have a critical effect each tick they are active.<br />
<br />
We, hybrids, should get that by default. It's what we had been asking for to augment DD crits skills we already got..<br />
<br />
9199 Ancient Fury <br />
9200 This ability imbues your pets with the ability to land critical hits.<br />
<br />
ALL pet classes should get that. It can be weak results for SK, Dru, and Shm pets though. <br />
<br />
9207 Shared Health<br />
9208 When activated, this ability causes half of the damage you take to be transferred to your summoned pet. Additional ranks increase the maximum amount of damage that can be transferred per hit.<br />
<br />
Same, All pet classes should get that. My gosh, BST will get really powerful with that skill.<br />
<br />
9209 Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
9210 This ability further increases your chance to score a critical hit with your direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
All hybrids should get that. It's what we had been asking for LONG time..<br />
<br />
9221 Blinding Reverence <br />
9222 This ability increases the chance that your bashes will stun the <br />
<br />
We, knights, should get that! We are master of 1h/shield than any other classes PERIOD cuz we can't even dual wield. By nature, we learned to hone our skills as 1h/shield or 2h only. Any shield users with bash skills should get that including warriors. <br />
<br />
9242 Stonewall<br />
9243 Each rank in this ability gives you an increasing chance for spells to not break your feign death.<br />
<br />
Oh man! It's a MUST for any FD'ers especially necros and SK! It sucks big time that casters LOVE to break our FD cuz of our stupid cast time. Monks have little difficulty in this. Casters are generally SK's bane for FDing. Stonewall will help us more.<br />
<br />
9255 Theft of Life<br />
9256 This ability grants a chance that the healing effect on your lifetaps will provide an exceptional amount of healing.<br />
<br />
We, SKs, should get that by default cuz we are 2nd master of lifetaps. Necros are masters of those. <br />
<br />
9259 Consumption of the Soul<br />
9260 The most advanced Shadow Knights can further enhance their Leech Curse ability. This ability adds 200 additional damage and healing to Leech Curse, per rank. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
Hehe, it is for us due to Shadowknight it mentioned..<br />
<br />
9261 Intense Hatred<br />
9262 This ability intensifies the overall effect of damage shields that are cast on you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness further. <br />
<br />
We should get that by default cuz we tend to keep DS up all the time. Nice for any tanks too. Combined with Dain ring makes it little more attractive.<br />
<br />
9265 Advanced Fury of Magic Mastery <br />
9266 This ability further increases your chance to score a critical hit with your direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
Would be NICE for this to be for us, hybrids but we didn't get Fury of Magic Mastery version. We should get Fury in this expansion cuz we asked for it long time. Advanced might be only for pure casters..<br />
<br />
9271 Heightened Awareness <br />
9272 This ability gives you the chance to block attacks that originate behind you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Gotta get that! Would be great for SK as a puller. It might be restricted to pure melees though.. <br />
<br />
9273 Increased Bash Damage <br />
9274 This ability increases the damage you do with your bashes.<br />
<br />
Knights must get that. Heck, any classes with bash skills should have access to this. Knights bash all the time.. It's no reason for them to be excluded from this. <br />
<br />
9277 Sturdiness<br />
9278 Each rank of this ability increases your maximum hit points by 100.<br />
<br />
Nice one! Tanks should have that. That means Warriors and Knights to keep knights in line for tanks. Warriors already have 5% mitigation bonus. If it is only for warriors, SOE will tune future expansions mobs to hit harder and harder cuz of warriors. Knights will become much weaker tanks and we would be left out as a tank and the tanking role would be restricted only to warriors. WRONG move period. Knights HAVE to have this one to keep in balance. <br />
<br />
9285 Pet Affinity <br />
9286 This ability allows your group spells to also affect the pets of group members.<br />
<br />
Any pet classes should have this. It might be restricted to TRUE pet classes like BST, Necro and Mage though that still makes sense..<br />
<br />
9295 Shallow Grave<br />
9296 This ability provides you with a fast casting feign death ability. This ability cannot be used immediately after using any other feign death effects.<br />
<br />
We, SKs, should get that. We use FD ALLLLLLLL the time after all.. <br />
<br />
9299 Suspend Minion<br />
9300 This ability grants the summoner the ability to suspend and recall their existing pet at will, provided they remain in their current zone. The first rank suspends the pet with all of its current health only, while the second rank suspends the pet with all of its beneficial effects as well as its weapons and armor. You may cast a second pet while your first pet is Suspended. You may train the first rank upon reaching level 62 and the second rank upon reaching level 64.<br />
<br />
Any pet classes should have access to this. Most pet classes already have that. Looks like it is open to rest of pet classes including us.<br />
<br />
9307 Rapid Strikes <br />
9308 This ability gives you the chance to perform up to two additional attacks with your primary hand upon a successful double attack. Additional ranks increase the chance of this happening.<br />
<br />
We, hybrids, should have that. Rangers and BST already have access to ferocity and we have access to increased 2x/3x of 2h only. This one would improve us further.<br />
<br />
9309 Shield Specialization <br />
9310 Ranks in this ability increase your chance to block with your shield.<br />
<br />
Knights GOT to have that period. Again, we are masters of 1h/shield cuz we can't even dual wield.. Knights with shields are best at blocking in close combat AND against missile attacks as well. Dual wield or 2h CANNOT block arrows while tower shield CAN easily. Warriors and Knights should get that. Other shield bearing classes, probably but would make sense for them to have, though.<br />
<br />
9313 Swarm of Decay <br />
9314 This ability summons forth a swarm of skeleton archers to harry your foes.<br />
<br />
SKs should have that cuz our pets are skeletons, after all. It might be restricted to necros though..<br />
<br />
9325 Packrat <br />
9326 Packrat <br />
9327 This ability intensifies the overall effect of damage shields that are cast on you. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness further.<br />
<br />
We use DS almost all the time even tanking. We should have access to that.<br />
<br />
Also, I didn't include Recovery and Death's Fury cuz it states ELEMENTALs as pets.. I, myself, would go into fits if I see no improvement to 1h/shield for knights.. I had been waiting for ANY improvements for long time. If not, I would have to wait for next expansion hopefully. I don't understand why knights especially paladins had been screaming for 1h/shield improvement and SOE finally introduce AA for it and gave to warriors who never EVER complain or asked for it. Irony.. Bottom line.. Shields ARE... BROKEN...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mental Horror. <br />
Seems ok. Not too exciting but it'll be used. Longer duration than MC is much greater convenience certainly.<br />
<br />
Black Shroud.<br />
Also seems ok. Other than the distinct feeling that we're actually punished for having Soul Abrasion by making the spells relatively low power to start and then insisting on aa being spent to boost them. Still naturally i'll use this.<br />
<br />
Spear of Murram.<br />
Not keen at all. I don't personally use Spears. Too many resists or partials. Some folk use them so i suppose they'll get use out of it. If it had a resist adjust so it landed for full more reliably i'd probably imagine meming it more than once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
Other spell possibilities.<br />
I think development over time has clearly shown we do best with spells designed specifically for sk's, not cut-and-paste from the necro spellbook. With that in mind i'd like to see an sk-focused upgrade to Bond of Death (faster cast time, a bit faster acting). Or an sk pet upgrade. I'd get more use of either of those than Spear of Murram but that's all a matter of playstyle.<br />
<br />
Ancient ZB looks like it's off-the-table. Too bad.<br />
<br />
AA Skills.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction.<br />
I like this. I usually have Blood of Hate memed. I quite often use Festering darkness. I use Ignite Blood from time to time. Better than a kick in the teeth. Cut-and-paste from other class aa's though.<br />
<br />
Death's Fury.<br />
I'd like a better pet, because i use pet as often as i can. So  i suppose something that makes the current pet do more damage is ok. In theory. I have deep scepticism that this aa will in practise be worth any more than a bucket of spit.<br />
<br />
Suspended Minion.<br />
Nice added convenience. No marks for originality of course since it's a cut-and-paste from other class aa lines. Still this is ok.<br />
<br />
Mastery of The Past.<br />
If it goes up to 60 or more it may be ok. If it goes up to 59 it is bloody useless.<br />
<br />
Intense Hatred.<br />
So if we're gettting an improved damage shield aa that seems to suggest we're getting hit. But we aren't getting any tanking aa's. In fact our relative ability to tank seems to be going backwards. Plus in an expansion where everything is tuned for warrior's new tanking abilities i expect when (if?) i tank it'll be on mobs that are slowed. Slowed mobs rather reducing the usefulness of the aa. Will be great for blowing out normal LDoN adventures with the in-house bard mind you. So not that great. At all.<br />
<br />
Consumption of the Soul.<br />
So if a mob that i'm tanking is about to kill me- and since i don't have any new tanking aa and all the mobs are going to be tuned for warriors lets treat that as a plausible scenario- i'm meant to hit my Leech Touch button for woo! 1900 resistable lifetap? How hard are these mobs hitting by the way? You know because to balance them against the new warrior upgrades they'll have to be hitting damn hard. Seriously who the hell is coming up with this shit?<br />
<br />
Summary.<br />
So three cut-and-paste jobs, two ok, one almost certainly bollocks. Upgrades to two aa lines that started way back in Luclin and weren't terribly useful then. A new class aa that is insultingly marginal in usefulness. <br />
<br />
Would it kill to actually have one aa that either upgraded something useful or enhanced a core role that sk's perform? That actually wasn't an unimaginative cut-and-paste in the best case scenario?<br />
<br />
I'm not going to waste space making suggestions since they're all obvious and have all been made repeatedly. And i don't actually think they give a toss anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For one, I don't think we are going to be getting 15aa. GoD is posted as having &quot; 100 new Alternate Advancement Abilities!&quot; 100 AA / 15 classes = 6.66 AA per class. Obviously some classes get more than others but I think 15 is being a bit too optimistic.<br />
<br />
My wishlist, in some sort of order (AA):<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Improved mitigation, avoidance, or hp AA. If we are going to be viable as tanks at ALL in the future expansions - we need to compete with Paladins and Warriors.<br />
2) Hotkeyable FeignDeath. We really do need this.<br />
3) Weapon Specilization. We rely on procs so much! The description says through years of practice with your weapons you have developed an affinity etc etc... and casters get it. How exactly are casters more adept with their weapons than Knights?<br />
4) Shield Specilization AA. We use shields more than all other melee, and I think this would be a welcome benefit to our tanking abilities.<br />
5) Fury of Magic.  Crits for our lifetaps are a large aid during tanking, and this helps our dps out too.<br />
6) Swarm of Decay. Just because =) Give us something to show off.<br />
7) Critical Affliction. We do use dots, and these would be helpful in kiting and exp groups alike. Would be nice if you included some new dot spells to go along with this though.<br />
8) Some type of AA to increase the number of buff slots that can be used at any given time. 5/10/15 in cost maybe for a total of 3 more buffslots?<br />
--<br />
<br />
My wishlist, in some sort of order (Spells):<br />
<br />
1) Black Shroud. I would LOVE having Mental Corruption and Shroud of Chaos merged into one buff. Give it a 60 minute duration and a 500, or even 1000 mana cost. 100dd lifetap affected by SA and 100 mana tap would be excellent.<br />
2) Ancient: Bite of Chaos (Zbite). This would greatly improve our raid and group desirability and I don't think it would be over-powering to any extreme extent.<br />
4) Improved Pact of Hate. Having a self-buff with penalties inferior to a outside cast buff that lasts 3 hours degrades its usefulness. Would be great to have this upped to C5 level or higher.<br />
5) Spear of Murram. I like our spear line, but I just wish it was resisted less. Put a nice resist modifier on this, or our entire spear line perhaps, and it would be a very welcome addition.<br />
6) Improved DoTs. Going with our (possible) new Critical Affliction AA, I think It would work nicely to give us a level 65 dot with some good relative mana-damage efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azerinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My wishlist for AA (in rough order from most wanted to least wanted)<br />
<br />
1) Hotkeyed FD<br />
2) Stun resistance<br />
3) Some kind of tanking AA... either just HPs or increased avoidance/mitigation<br />
4) Fury of Magic<br />
5) Shield Blocking (the one warriors are currently getting)<br />
6) *IF* ancient Z-Bite doesn't get put in then an AA to increase the hp and mana components of Z-Bite... something like three levels 10/25/50% increase so max it would be 300dmg done 300hp healed +150mana for the whole group... obiviously could be reduced some if that is too much<br />
7) Critical Affliction<br />
8) Weapons Affinity (casters are getting this? wtf)<br />
9) Decreased reuse timer for leechcurse disc and/or increased duration of leechcurse<br />
10)  An AA to unlink the timers of normal/improved HT and the tap HT<br />
11) Increased bash damage and/or chance for bash to stun MOBs up to level 65<br />
12) Advance channeling focus<br />
13) Chance that spells landign on you won't break FD (like the monks are getting)<br />
14) A hotkeyed version of our Voice of Thule aggro modifier spell (same reuse timer etc)<br />
15) If and only if the two versions of HT have their timers unlinked then increased dmg for the tap HT would be good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well now that all of our spells new Gates spells will be level 65.<br />
<br />
The following needs to be changed:<br />
<br />
Mental Horror: Get rid of this spell completely. It should be absorbed into Black Shroud. Two self proc buffs is a waste. <br />
<br />
Black Shroud: Change the Resist Adjust to -500MR on Black Shroud Strke, and add Autocast Black Shroud Recourse. Black Shroud Recourse: Slot 1: Increase Mana 100.<br />
Now we have 1 buff that is worth using ALL THE TIME.<br />
<br />
Spear of Murram: Change Resist Adjust to -100DR. I like my spears and a low resist spear will get used in the end game.(Yes disease resist mobs are still immue to this spear as well but we have Scythe now for those undead.)<br />
<br />
Now that Mental Horror is scraped we could add one of the following:<br />
1. Upgrade to Bond of Death (Suggest: Vexing Mordinia from the necro line)<br />
2. Ancient Touch of Innoruuk <br />
3. Ancient Zevfeer's Bite<br />
<br />
On to Gates AA:<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights are one of 3 &quot;TANK&quot; classes. Do NOT forget this while creating our Gates AAs. Currently there does not seem to be any AAs that assist us in our JOB. I do not get groups because im great dps or my group buff/utility spells are required or I have some kick ass pet. NO I GET GROUPS BECAUSE I AM A TANK. <br />
<br />
That being said I suggest some of the following:<br />
<br />
1. Strikethrough<br />
2. Sturdyness<br />
3. Fury of Magic<br />
4. Increased Bash Damage<br />
5. Blinding Reverance<br />
6. Rapid Strikes<br />
7. Theft of Life (Gates Version)<br />
8. Death Peace Hotkey<br />
9. Stalwart Endurance (Stun Resist)<br />
10. AA that lowers the re-use timer on Unholy Aura Discipline to match up (timer-wise) with Touch of the Wicked 3.<br />
<br />
Remove some of the current USELESS Gates AAs for Shadow Knights regarding Pets, and Consumption of Soul and add from the above list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In the spirit of tanking skills...<br />
<br />
Let me suggest a substitute for the SK-only AA Intense Hatred (the one that makes DS on us do more damage.)<br />
<br />
Vampire's Spite<br />
3 ranks<br />
Cost 3 6 9<br />
Requires Soul Abrasion 3<br />
<br />
When activated, VS creates a lifetap damage shield, mitigating part of the damage done by converting it to life.  This is cast much like Harmtouch in that you cannot use it while stunned or silenced, but that it &quot;casts&quot; instantly.<br />
<br />
Level 1 20pts lasts 30 seconds (5 ticks, recast 60 minutes)<br />
Level 2 40pts lasts 60 seconds (10 ticks, recast 50 minutes)<br />
Level 3 60pts lasts 90 seconds (15 ticks, recast 40 minutes)<br />
<br />
Too weak?  mob hits you for 600, you take 60 life from him and only take 540 damage effective.  Thats a 10% mitigation.  If the mob hits harder its less, if the mob hits softer, you get a larger percentage.<br />
<br />
Too powerful?  Warriors mitigate 5% innately... this doesn't count defensive...  which both lasts longer than VS, and mititgates more damage.  All of this doesn't count the new HP increases warriors are getting and we aren't.  Considering it will cost an very large amount of AA to get, it SHOULD be powerful and useful.  Its also in OUR theme of doing things...  the way of draining our enemies dry... while dealing damage.  For fast hitting mobs that hit lighter, we would be quite useful...  for mobs like Vallon in Time, (3K hits) we would not.<br />
<br />
Stacking will be important...  it should stack with all other DS, but NOT lifetap from them. (hehe bards would make this a bit too powerful -- 150pt lifetap DS would be just plain wrong.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, lets say mental horror and black shroud are combined.<br />
<br />
I recommend an upgrade to Harmshield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield of the Void<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1: All mob hits reduced to 1<br />
2: Damage shield by 10<br />
3: Silence (no spellcasting)<br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 200 Skill: Abjuration <br />
Casting Time: 1 Recast Time: 600 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Range: 0 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
Fizzle Adj 25 Deletable: No<br />
Interruptable: Yes Short Buff Box: Yes<br />
Target Type: Self Spell Type: Beneficial <br />
  <br />
Classes: SHD/65<br />
<br />
Why is this an upgrade?<br />
Because you can still melee...  because you can still hold aggro.<br />
<br />
A similar spell could be implemented for Paladins.<br />

<br />
Also, if you need ideas for our spells, combine a few together (aura of pain + aura of hate, shroud of chaos + mental clarity, etc).<br />
<br />
Other easy spell ideas :<br />
<br />
- a damageless snare<br />
- an upgrade to BoH or a similar DoT on another resist<br />
- a &quot;speed-tap&quot; (slow the mob for 20%, speed the group for 20%)<br />
- AE fear<br />
- low resist spear (neg100 resist adjust at least. as it is, spears are too resisted and even with a 30% improve disease damage focus, I don't memorize them).<br />
- upgrade to aura of darkness (resist adjust, debuffs the mob for more, maybe debuff some AC, hp and attack as well as resists, add resists / ac / atk / hp to the group, lasts a bit longer. I know that everyone would like a temp buff that adds 40 to all resists, 100 hps, 15 AC and 15 atk for example. Not overpowering but nice)<br />
<br />
<br />
I could come up with a lot more good ideas but I'm not sure anyone at SOE's listening (or reading) so I'll stop here for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bugrup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;STUN FROM FRONT IMMUNITY.<br />
<br />
And if your worried about the ogre population throwing up thier arms and screaming blue murder (im not). then perhaps a lesser version that doesnt grant immunity but reduces chance to be stunned instead...&quot;<br />
<br />
Easiest way to get Ogres to love this idea is to make it give us immunity (or a chance thereof) from the rear, thus still maintaining a slight racial advantage. Or possibly make it include immunity from stun spells for Ogres, that might be too much though.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't throw up my arms and scream blue murder about SKs getting something that would be so useful to many 8-), but I would be a tad miffed seeing an AA on the list that was only useful to non-Ogres, and would no doubt grumble to myself about it over a Gnome curry or two 8-)<br />
<br />
The main thing not mentioned that I personally would love to see would be an AA (that everyone would get) that let you pick which of your class titles you'd like to have. Sounds silly I know, but people get really attached to their characters and to many appearance is important, which includes titles. I *love* being Lady Bugrup, I think it suits me perfectly, and really don't want to become Duchess Bugrup which I just hate the sound of... I would like to get a few more of the Class AAs 8-)<br />
<br />
So basically an AA that gave me immunity from Duchesshood 8-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think ogres had it good enough already to have been the only race imune from stuns for so long.<br />
If I had known how big this particular ability was, I'd have made an ogre back in '99, that's for sure.<br />
And frankly this talk about race XP penalty is BS, it never was hard to level, not even a TSK during Kunark. And if the NO STUN AA costs 60 AA ( 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25) for example, then other races will have to pay more XP total than the ogres paid for being unstunnable from the start. Sounds more than fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">for AA I would be happy with half of what the warriors got for hp increase.  Instead of 100 hp x 5 I would be happy with 50 x5.<br />
<br />
I would like the FD hotkey.<br />
<br />
More channeling focus.<br />
<br />
For spells the better Zbit makes sense.  And a better proc would be good too.<br />
<br />
A pet thats maybe the next one up from the one we have would be good too.  One with a bit more hp as mine gets eaten up on LDON adventures where there is any kind of DS or dots.<br />

10) Imp. Consumption of the Soul<br />
11) Intense Hatred<br />
12) Suspend Minion<br />
<br />
That list is pretty sad, imo. It will not increase our ability to do anything better than we do now. We only get 1 melee AA, and it basically just a gimmick. We get 3 pet specific AA's for a pet while we're still not considered a pet class. <br />
<br />
We get 2 spell-casting related AA's which do nothing to really help us; an AA that allows us a chance to cast thru a stun, when we are hardly ever interrupted by a stun while casting; an AA which allows us a chance for a crit tick on our DoT's, but our DoT's are so weak as to make a crit pretty useless, but oh well, I'll take it. ;)<br />
<br />
We get 2 &quot;gimmick&quot; AA's which are so useless I would be ashamed of being the class associated with them; an &quot;improvement&quot; upon the already practically useless Consumption of the Soul (which is based on a broken version of our HT) that fails to truly scale up; an AA which seems to have been misplaced, this AA designed to give us an innate 30pt DS when maxed. I just don't get what the Dev's are thinking.<br />
<br />
The AA list I would like to see would look like this:<br />
1-4: Same default AA's<br />
<br />
5) Channelling Mastery<br />
6) Critical Affliction<br />
7) Weapon Affinity<br />
8) Stalwart Endurance (stun resist?)<br />
9) Pet Focus (increases our pets lvl)<br />
10) Suspend Minion<br />
11) Imp. CotS (makes LT do Except. Heal each time)<br />
12) Shallow Grave (fd hotkey)<br />
<br />
A decent mix I think. Would give us a better chance of casting while tanking, less stuns, slighty increase in spell dps, better pet, vastly improved Leech Touch, and two decent utility (suspend minion and fd hotkey).<br />
<br />
As of today on Lucy our spells were adjusted again:<br />
<br />
1) Black Shroud - It appears they might be trying to find a way to make this spell do a 75pt Lifetap DD (stackable with SA I assume) but still have a recourse which adds health + mana.<br />
<br />
2) Mental Horror - No real change; 65dd / 110mana recourse<br />
<br />
3) Miasmic Spear - Name change for a fucked up spell. Why anyone uses these pieces of crap is beyond me. =) Note the lastest change has -no- resist adjustment. All our DD's should have a -200 adjustment simply because the damage on them is so low compared to a pure caster nuke which can afford to get partially resisted.<br />
<br />
4) Ancient Bite of Chaos - Looks like they are still working on these spells, so we can still hope we'll get this, though it will be exceedingly rare.<br />
<br />
For $30 we sure are not getting much at all, I think PoP cost around $34 and we got a -ton- more from that than we are getting from this expansion. I was even told by a friend that the first 5 zones you see in GoD could all fit inside Dreadlands. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Everyone pretty much covered what I want from new aa's.<br />
<br />
Except.<br />
<br />
STUN FROM FRONT IMMUNITY.<br />
<br />
And if your worried about the ogre population throwing up thier arms and screaming blue murder (im not). then perhaps a lesser version that doesnt grant immunity but reduces chance to be stunned instead...  <br />
<br />
<br />
They already have this AA out (Stalwart Endurance).  Problem is, it's for WAR only.  Ogres shouldn't throw there arms up at all.  A Gnome WAR can get that AA.<br />
<br />
I would throw out a great many new AA in order to get SE for SHD/PAL, which should have been done a *LONG* time ago...<br />

Shoot and toast your darn bird next time, please.<br />
<br />
Way to much &quot;pets aa&quot;. It'll not help me at all when pulling, nor will it do when I tank. Sorry but I won't buy suspend minion, pet affinity or death fury before years ! <br />
<br />
Intense hatred is a joke if it doesn't affect spells up to 60. <br />
<br />
Critical affliction is pure candy, plus I was mainly burning my mana on lifetaps (quasi never resisted) and still an aa that won't mean much for me.<br />
<br />
Packrat, <br />
Not for pulling right ? I am tanking slowed mobs thanks...<br />

ok I stop ranting and will pray for some reflection on SOE's side =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree what has been said.<br />
<br />
If anyone at SOE reads this, think about giving us a shadowknight-specific (not necro had-down) blue conning pet, that somehow is able to survive raid AE's for a reasonable time to justify it's use.  This would help balance us, without stepping on other classes' toes.<br />
<br />
And, yes, then the pet AA's will be bought, only then they make any sense.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like the spears myself. They are very good for raids and LDON encounters where creatures die so fast its not worth casting Blood of hate.<br />
<br />
Keep the spear, just give it a nice disease resist adjustment and maybe up the damage to 800<br />
<br />
We should get a new pet as well, to make the new pet aa worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">well i for one would like to see some AA's like make sk's a more desired raid class and it particular make having say 2 or 3 sk's beneficial.<br />
<br />
i think AA to make many of our recourses AoE would be great - Aura of Hate , Pain and Zevfeers would be wanted in any large encounter, Aura of Darkness could certainly be helpful in AoE fights. these effects when AoE would go to the bard buff window to avoid buff slot issues and in order to keep things from getting out of hand you could only keep a certain number up simultaneously depending on the AA spent. so lvl 1 would allow one recourse , level 2 - 2 and level 3 - 3 - something of this nature.<br />
<br />
the durations and such might have to be tweakend in order to allow this but it would certainly be consistent with abilities we already have just giving them to us on a larger scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">AA.<br />

1) FD hotkey please.<br />

Of the old AAs, we only need<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity<br />
<br />
Immobilizing Bash<br />
<br />
and possibly, depending:<br />
<br />
Intense Hatred (depends on how it's coded, if it's a general 50% increase, keep it)<br />
<br />
pet stuff (only if you give us a pet that is worth it.  With our current pet those will increase overall dps by 1.5 dps for 45 AA points)<br />

<br />
What we DO NOT need:<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting - our interupts are 95% from melee, not stuns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction - only 1.87 overall dps increase for 30 AA points?  Come on! <br />
<br />
<br />
Vicious Smash - I do not use a shield, not worth it.  2H bash is worthless at the current level as it is.<br />

Improved Consumption of the Soul - no SK ever uses it, not even with this improved and still weak version.  Unless you uncouple HT and CS timers.<br />

If it's gimp dmg, i'll be heavily disappointed because it's one of the 3 aa's in god i plan to get unless we get some improvements:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">please replace these 3 AAs:<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity 0/1 20<br />
Death's Fury 0/5 3<br />
Critical Affliction 0/3 5<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
with:<br />
<br />
shallow grave<br />
suspend minion<br />
fury of magic<br />
<br />
<br />
why pet affinity, death's fury, and critical affliction are especially bad:<br />
<br />
pet affinity is completely useless to SKs. its main use is for pet classes on raids. however, most SKs don't use their pet on a raid so gain nothing with this AA.<br />
<br />
death's fury is at most 2/5ths as useful to an SK as it is to a magician or necromancer or beast lord. even if it upgrades pet DPS by 20%, its still hardly going to be worth spending the AAs on as an SK.<br />
<br />
critical affliction is similarly of little use to a shadow knight.  SKs only have one DPS DoT, blood of hate. it does limited damage and a good portion only use that one situationally. necromancers/shamans/druids who get critical affliction have the opportunity to gain about three times as much from it as SKs can.<br />
<br />
<br />
what we'd like to replace them:<br />
<br />
shallow grave: we just want our spell death peace hotkeyed, to free up the spell slot that every SK uses for it.<br />
<br />
fury of magic:  shadow knights primarily have and use direct damage spells, so please give us an upgrade to spell casting fury.<br />
<br />
suspend minion: this one is situationally useful for us, and would see a lot more use than getting our pets MGB buffs</div></div><hr />
