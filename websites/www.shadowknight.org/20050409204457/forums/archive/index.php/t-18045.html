<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arsamita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all:<br />
<br />
    Im a SK lvl 43 atm and have one problem with certain mobs in LDoN.<br />
<br />
    In LDoN i am usually MT and puller. When we fight mobs with DS i put my 2hs or 2hp on. When we fight mobs that can heal itself, i change to 1hb or 1hs with shield. But if we fight mobs that have DS and can heal itself i dont know what weapon to use, because if i have 2h weapon on, the mob heal itself 2 or 3 times before we can kill it, and if i have 1h weapon on, i usually lose 1/4 or 1/3 of my hps.<br />
<br />
     What do u recomend to me??<br />
<br />
      And, i pull only with spells, should i begin to use one bow??<br />
<br />
      Thx and sorry for my poor english.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can try to dispell their damage shields</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kyrkii Sa'Kyttn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try pulling with Cancel Magic, costs 30 mana, 3.5s cast time.  If 1st cast doesn't get rid of DS, cast it one more time during fight and it'll probably be gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As the others said, try pulling with cancel magic.  Also, several caster classes have higher level versions of cancel magic that strip more buffs than cancel magic will (I think some strip 3-4 buffs at once), so you might ask your group members to strip off the damage shield.  In my group, we always strip the damage shield off first thing.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of the dmg shield will benefit your whole group as the dmg shield isn't just hurting you, it's hurting every melee character in your group.  I dual box a SK and a rogue and those dmg shields can just eat my rogue alive given her fast dual wield and low hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Greyshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SK's are one of those other classes...  We get Nullify Magic at level 58 which strips four slots.   That's a few more levels higher than Arsamtia is at the moment but its worth mentioning as some SK's I know at level 65 did not know we get that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm... Nullify strips 2 slots, only enchanters get 4 slot dispells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a slow one hander with a decent ratio (I'm guessing completely at your gear and circumstances here, apologies if I'm on the wrong track), so you don't have to switch between weapons so much.<br />
<br />
If you're both MT and puller in LDoN, it's tough to pull with cancel magic because it's really low aggro, and ideally you want that first cast to be clinging darkness or spear.<br />
<br />
Noctix's suggestion is best though; if you can get a caster to hit the mob with nullify magic as soon as possible (has to be very early or it dispells slow) you've saved a lot of healing for the group as a whole.<br />
<br />
If the DS is taking 1/3 of an SK's hitpoints away, then a dual wielding rogue with decent haste is in danger of killing himself on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slow cant be removed with dispell, its removed with cure disease which is beneficial so you can only cast it on other players, pets, and charmed mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your casters should be burning them down when they get low, or casting stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greyshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lucy's tricked me in that it said Nullify is Cancel Magic (4).   The 4 does not have anything to do with the number of slots debuffed appearently.    Unless the chanters Recant Magic debuffs 9 slots (Cancel Magic (9)) which I doubt it does.    The number must just mean the 4th in the series or maybe just the fourth cancel magic effect they put in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhoades Tonowhere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At lvl 55 this is what I do when pulling and MA'ing in Ldon<br />
mind you, normally I either have a Kei, or some form of mind crack (even if its only a bard) <br />
Pulling,, I use either a spear or darkness<br />
if i use darkness first i run it back to camp and launch 2 spears before anyone else gets a chance to hit/cast on it<br />
hit taunt and attack. when pulling I dont bother with a pet, one lucky hit and your pet is off trying to agro the whole zone. so if you dont have pet hold and are MA and puller LEAVE PET DEAD! I use 2hp (narandi's lance) in MM and a 1hs w/ shield (SOP, shield rainbow hues) at the orcs. I also try and have VoD up but even if I dont, I normally dont lose agro. only time I will is when a slow from chanter/shammy whatever lands on mob, but 1 fast casting spear brings it back before mob even gets close. it all comes down to mana managment and how you decide to keep agro.<br />
if your Kei'd and such, you should NEVER lose agro if your party does it's job correctly. if you have NO Kei or mind crack then you use your abilities a little diffrently<br />
with no mind crack i do the following<br />
pull with CD<br />
throw 1 spear<br />
run back to camp taunt and engage<br />
make sure you have MC up if your of lvl to use it<br />
spam taunt<br />
if you lose agro throw another spear<br />
you shouldnt have to throw more than 2 spears and 1 Cd during a fight if so tell your party members that there making your job harder and one day you might not be able to keep the mob off the woosies your grouped with 8)</div></div><hr />
