<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerus</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got FD a few levels ago, and had some questions about casters.<br />
<br />
It seems that casters are always casting, so I am not finding a window to actually FD without being hit with a spell right after I FD.  Is there a trick to time your FD, or to get a caster to do something besides cast for 1.5 secs?  Also, how do you FD pull when casters are involved?<br />
<br />
Also, is it futile to try and FD with 2 or more casters on you?  Should I just try fear instead? (kinda dangerous in a dungeon, though).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zemi</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indoors, casters need line of sight to start casting their spells, so if you can, run around a corner while they're casting, wait to get hit by the spell, and FD.<br />
<br />
Multiple casters are an even bigger nightmare.  Fear is not a bad option, but you'll need a picker or you'll wipe your group out. Darkness on one of them, and a variant of the above ducking around the corner will let you get them a bit seperated, but again, you'll need a picker to get things off of you. Also, try bashing one of the casters to stun it, and try FDing then, but it's pretty ugly, and you're relying on the other caster to not be casting.<br />
<br />
My only real advice though is practice practice practice.  You need to know the pathing where you are really well to perform at your best, plus you'll learn some things about what you can do in order to keep stuff where you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Big thing about casters - they can only start casting if you are line-of-sight.  So, if you get a number of them on you - run, try to get around a corner or 2, wait for the spell they started casting while you were still LOS to hit, then FD.  As long as they can see you, you are going to have trouble and FD will be hit-or-miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronoh</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The key to FDing off casters is don't wait for their cast to finish before you start yours.  You need to time it so that after they start their cast, you start yours, their spell will land (hopefully doesn't interrupt your cast),  yours will go off and cross your fingers for a sucessful FD.<br />
<br />
I have most of messages turned off, so I don't see &quot;so-n-so begings to cast spell&quot;, but I do have particle effects turned on and that is what I look for to time my FDs.  (note: you will always see &quot;so-n-so begins to cast gate&quot;)<br />
<br />
If you have two or more casters, and you're getting low on health, sure.... fear them away, then FD.  Just don't stand up right away.  Stay down, what for the messages that your fear has worn off (how ever many mobs you casted it on).  If you had a pet up at the time, wait for it to die as well.  Stand, FD again to clear agro, and again... stay down.   Watch for the wonderers till it's safe to stand and invis (assuming you have one of the circlets of shadow(s)).<br />
<br />
I can only guess that you're talking about being solo.  If not, the trick to pulling casters is..... *drum roll*  Stay out of their line of sight.   If they can't see you to cast, they come running, hide behind a solid structor and ambush them.  You need to be able to recognize parts of the zone that looks like a good pull spot.  Find a spot that has corners, walls, pillars, rocks, etc..., if you're pulling casters.  If you're out doors, do not rely on trees as something to hide behind, in most zones, it won't work.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

We are not monks, so don’t try to pull like one :)<br />
This is the way I FD pull, you can try it for your self if you like.<br />
1st  is the park and pull, for this you just need to load any of your darken line spells (I personally use low level spells, do to mana management) I cast on the mob that I want to pull, all of the mobs will run after me. I try to get as much distance as I can. Then, FD, rest of the mobs will run back home, the one that I casted on will stay in place, till you are ready to pull him, make sure the rest of the mobs are back in there spawn place.<br />
<br />
2nd type of pull is the pet pull need a lot of bone chips for this  <br />
<br />
3rd type is the bufforama pull as I like to call it ;) most caster mobs are programmed to buff each other if and when they are in close range, what will happen is this. You pull. All mobs will come at you; you FD the Next thing they will do is stay in place and start buffing each other, and walk away one by one.<br />
 <br />
One other thing I do is  /Npc spells on, That way you know when to time the FD, also try NOT to attack the mob and FD at the same time. (attack off).<br />
Also try and get as much distance as you can. I normally look for bad pathing.<br />
SKs have many tools to work with, so play with your spells even the low-level spells. Trust me you will find a use for them :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">04-05-2002, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing to think of when soloing FD is (works way better for necros btw)  use Shadow step then let the pet tank for the few seconds it takes to cast FD.  As a necro I always had Shadow Step and FD memmed....and never had Gate.  Its a very powerfull combo imo.  <br />
<br />
Also Shadow step works better outdoors on top of hills (not ledges) or near water....</div></div><hr />
