<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  I am nervous posting this so close to the other VT thread, but am curious about the current status of VT.  As is shown in my profile below, I am a moderately equipped pre-elemental SK in a guild that is currently working toward Elemental Flags throguh a partnership with another guild that is already largely VT keyed.  There is a growing group of people within my guild now working on Emperor and VT key quests with visions of the VT loot as an option while waiting to get into the Elemental Planes. (Struggling with Bert, MM and RZ raids in POP.)<br />
<br />
When looking at Alla's, there is obviously some VERY nice gear in VT, but I have been told by quite a few people that VT is just not worth it any more because there are guild rotations, and the amount of time you can actually spend in VT raiding is fairly limited.  <br />
<br />
This question is mainly aimed at those in guilds with access to VT already.  Do you find that VT is still overly crowded with guilds fighting for access to the named mobs?  I know this will probably vary widely from, but wanted to see if I could get a feel fromt eh community on how many of the high-end guilds even bother with VT anymore.  And if the high-end raiding guilds have moved on, is the zone normally sitting empty with named mobs up, or have the mid-tier guilds moved in to prep for Elemental Planes.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry for what is very nearly a duplicate post, but I hated to post too much of a serious nature in a thread that so many were clearly getting a tremendous amount of pleasure out of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On Terris only 1 guild is currently doing VT and are planning on leaving it soon and working on EP flagging.<br />
<br />
A few family/casual guilds are shard farming and killing emp, but don't have the force yet to enter VT and do anything useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VT is good till every member of your guild has a TVK =x  most servers dont have a VT rotation, its first come first serve.  that being said, on Cazic-Thule, only about 3 guilds even mess with VT anymore.  My guild does it when nothing is up in the EPs and its not our spot in Time.<br />
<br />
Honestly, VT will never go out of style.  Then again, i love fighting mobs that only hit for 800 but have a zillion Hp =)<br />
<br />
The hassle of getting your guild VT keyed is very very worth it.  Between the casting focuses and the haste items..it just cant be beaten on RvR.  once your guild gets good, you will be able to do a full clearing in about 6 hrs too.  hehe, AEing VT  = teh win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id say spend your time mastering the pop mobs you need for elemental access.  The mobs that drop elemental armor for the most part are easier then RZ.  If theres alot of people crowding the EP's killing the loot mobs, then VT might be worth the effort.  LDON raids drop VT quality loot too, when nothing else is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dont think anyone is in VT on our server, but we competed for it..there was no rotation when we were there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vinnay, my guild is currently stomping AHR (and the other residents of VT) on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love Vex Thall. My guild no longer goes there nor does anyone else on my server but I have always enjoyed romping through. I only have a few items  from that zone (my helm for example) but would have loved to pick up more. AHR items are very very nice and hard to replace.<br />
<br />
As was stated earlier it can be a loot heaven in a single clearing netting some very nice items that you will be holding onto for a very long time.<br />
<br />
The Emp (whom you kill on the way to being fully VT keyed) has some decent stuff as well (like my back item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh ya i forgot la fam is in vt, are you guys the only ones there now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I assume someone is farming VT on Innoruuk, I just dont care enough to bother trying to find out who.  I know that there are occasional pickup raids tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tribunal has a rotation. For the most part it works. A couple of the upper guilds still go as it is a fast way to get new recuits something like reasonable equipment. 6 hours in VT results in something like 40 loots. I cant think of any other raiding zone that can result in that many upgrades in that short a time. Sure for those upper guilds the equipment will be soon swapped out for something better but it does get recruits and new members off to a flying start with equipment<br />
<br />
The quest though to get a key is a pain in the ass. All the shards can be solo'd / duo'd. The emp key parts are real easy although boring single group stuff. Emp himself is still a raid though and can be tricky to catch being up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We're not the only ones there, but we're taking the mobs the vast majority of the time. The other guilds are just starting, and we've been at it for a while.<br />
<br />
Heh, one of them tried to train us last raid - we derailed the train AND beat them to the target mob.<br />
<br />
/dickwave</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VT is the ultimate greifer zone on fennin, it rocks!!! ;p <br />
<br />
im glad time is on a fairly reasonable, and friendly rotation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Toothfairy_TP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yah Vex Thall is definately worth it. I just caught it on the tail end of my guilds VT farming..But alot of great stuff drops there..good armor class to be had. If you look at my magelo I have some sleeves from vex thal still that have 50 ac..I almost cant bear to replace them  :D  But will sooner or later.<br />
<br />
 Yes do the key quest...it will pay off. Try not to skip this part of progression, I really wish I had gotten in sooner and built the RP to get more great Vex shit (aten bp) but anyways ...good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for all the information guys.  I know everyone is sick of VT threads, but half the people I know are incredibly gungho about getting keyed and getting in there, and the rest think it will just be a waste of time and that it is already being over-farmed.  All this input definitely pushes me toward getting my keys done.  <br />
<br />
I greatly appreciate the feedback!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radahsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">6 hours in VT doesn't result in 40 loots.  That's a bit of an overstatement.  It is a pretty good return on your time investment, but I don't remember anywhere near 40 loot drops (of consequence at least).<br />
<br />
My beef with VT is that it is mind numbingly boring.  Clear 1 million trash mobs, fight a named.  Clear another million, fight a named.  Yes, I'm exaggerating....somewhat.  PoTime is vastly superior in the mechanics of how you farm it.  The &quot;trash&quot; waves are semi-enjoyable (though Phases 1 and 3 can become boring pretty quickly).  But after that, its' party time with the loot.  It's more fun than even NToV was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">your right, 4 hours got us 35 lotos a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Vazaelle, we had a 8 week free run at VT and now share it 1 week at a time with another guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Elem stuff doesn't always replace VT stuff... so VT is very worthwhile until Time. While Grimror's kicks a lot of ass, there are a lot of slots in elem that are pretty poor for tanks... VT answers some of these slots, sometimes surpassing elem far and away.<br />
<br />
Definitely something to go for during a big part of progression as a whole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Rule #1 of VT &amp; the EP's.<br />
<br />
Get most of your non-visibles in VT, get most of your visible pieces in the EP's, don't underestimate the unique foci available in VT, and get rings/earrings wherever you can because they can be hard to come by in both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seductre Digimortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To add to slein's rule: GET A AHR NECK, even if you have to spend your whole DKP pool on it or have to save 3 dozen months or bribe the loot council, I so regret not getting one  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">AHR neck is worth saving insanely for only if you can reasonably decide that its stats/effects alone will outweigh the cumulative benefits of other gear that you are passing on in order to hoard dkp to win one. Bidding guilds often see people spending outrageous amounts just to acquire this item, and players who are forced to do so may in fact be hurting their upgrade path in the long run if the guild is progressing well.<br />
<br />
It's still a great item, it is just not the long term uber piece that it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was thinking about the loot bits.....<br />
<br />
We average 35 or so, but we have CoH bots at Blob 1 and DXXT.  If you actually cleared the thing there are 3 named that we skip with our method.  A full cleaning might get 40 loots.</div></div><hr />

just get to kod taz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">bah fuck GoD.  and fuck PoP.  full suit of VT gear is teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggliey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Waste of time unless your in a guild that's looking to progress that way.  Otherwise don't waste your time and focus on PoP flags.</div></div><hr />

CoH Mages, fuck all that clearing everytime.</div></div><hr />

Emperor is harder than any mob in VT.  Coming from a guild who beat Emperor with 49 SSRA-geared people and beat Aten Ha Ra (boss of VT) with 22 (one 2boxed) VT geared people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">agreed but that also why EMP is the bottleneck for VT it makes sure that the people who get in can clear the place =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Depends on your server with the guild thing and farming the place.  Get your key, it's not as hard as people say it is to get.<br />
<br />
The encounters are not as difficult per the loot really.  I have some nice stuff from 19 person raids.  The mobs also drop more loot than those mobs that you see on your way to the Elementals that need 50!</div></div><hr />
