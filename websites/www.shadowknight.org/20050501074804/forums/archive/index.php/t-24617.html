<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retizmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm level 31 atm, and is pretty twinked.. I've been thinking about possible places to solo at and have tried them. I been through Dawnshroud Peaks and Mars Seru, the exp is alright, but I'm not sure if there are other places I could try, taking mobs head on or fear kiting.<br />
<br />
I read the main post.. for hunting.. but that talks about not being tweaked and doesnt mention fear kiting one bit. So if anyone else here can tell me some zones, or information in general, it would be appreciated.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd go to Sol B.  It's a current hot zone.  I had a twink 31 beast there, and with Temperance I was really suprised at how little damgage the mobs did.<br />
<br />
XP was about 4-5% per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nimic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only advice I'll give is stay out of Luclin.  The amount of hp the mobs have is inordinate to the amount of experience they give.  Old world is the way to go.  Sol B, Lower Guk...  From 50 to 60 Sebilis might be acceptable depending on your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Retizmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cool thanks for the advice.. ill try Sol B.. as for L. Guk, my friend is taking me there this weekend to show me how to kill mobs down there for an sk.. cause there is a certain way of doing so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zarzac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried UP as it is also a hotzone and xp per kill was ok but damn they got a  crapload of hp so it takes forever for each kill yeilding very poor xp per hour.  Sol B is the way to go at least until they change the hot zones next patch.  After that I think I'm going to head to the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eastern Wastes<br />
Sol B<br />
<br />
I think those places are best, make sure in EW you keep the Ulthorks feared because they can hit 70-100's easy I think, maybe 80-90s tops, haven't been there in a while *grin*.<br />
<br />
Exp is mad though, get temped and buffed full out in whatever you can get, keep sow on too, is a must.<br />
<br />
For EW stay in the Utree area, for Sol B I just ran everywhere slaughtering everything  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">- New Hot Spots!*<br />
The Warrens<br />
Netherbian Lair<br />
Echo Caverns<br />
The Scarlet Desert<br />
The Tower of Frozen Shadow<br />
The Hole<br />
The Grey<br />
Howling Stones<br />
The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)<br />
<br />
So stay out of SolB (probably need to be high 30's for there anyway) - not a hot spot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, was just about to post this.<br />
<br />
You can find this when you download the newest Patch on EQ, these are new hot spots for 30 now - For ToFS I'd still get a Shammy, likewise to Hole, Grey, etc. <br />
<br />
Good Luck leveling, 59 is the worst before going to 60+ then, I'd say from past experience I played a friend's 67 Warrior and that was a b*tch lol,,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go to Scarlet Desert and kill the sun worshiper doods on the top of the mountain. Plenty of room and a good spot to practice pulling singles. Get your VT shard while your there to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have been working on levelling my pathetic ranger who, until recently, was in his low 30s.  One place i found that seemed to give very good xp in relationship to how easy the mobs were was crystal caverns.  Not the geonid things, which is what most people go there for, but the spider tunnel.  The spiders were easily solo tanked by my ranger and die fast.  By the time i would get to the queen room (which i didn't do) the entrance would be popping again.  Managed to do several levels in a short period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retizmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have gotten level 40 last night.. and i was thinking all the places i could solo, Crystal Caverns, L. Guk, Sol B.. besides these are the any other zones with decent xp and low hp mobs? you know like the mobs that die fast as heck in crystal caverns. im tired of seeing the same stuff, i wanna see other places :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uuuarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had a ton of fun in Gunthak with my 41 necro.<br />
I don't remember the xp being unusually good or bad, but I had lots of fun there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Necrophobe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can verify that Echo Caverns is now a good spot to exp grind for lvl 30-38 toons.  I am boxing a 30 Ranger/32 Shaman there with no problems.  Everything there cons white to red, and am getting an average 2-3% a kill.  A well geared SK would do better there then an Ranger (840 AC buffed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hakkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I liked  Sol B windows camp and pool area above; can get singles windows, pairs above which can be split with a lil practice. No waiting for mobs and can practice dif SK pulling tactics. You could crank through to mid 40's there fast, at 44 you get blood of pain which will help a bit too. They went light blue after 46 for me.<br />
<br />
 In case ya don't know; for back entrance through Sol A, when you come out on the ledge above a door with tunnels to the left and right, just outside  that first room there,  take the right tunnel down and around it zones into sol B above windows ..  zoning back into sol A there  puts you in that safe spot too med-rest-afk what have ya. <br />
<br />
  P,S, <br />
  You'll be asking this soon soo.  Upper 40's I went to DL at BW zone can park pet there pull from entrance to that lil valley. There are 3 dif paths cross right there. Pull em in towards BW then fear em back towards DL, no adds in that lil valley. Safe to med-rest-afk along a wall there by BW zone. At 49 can move to FM zone area. Facing out of tunnel.. off to the left are Ragers and Drolvargs will all be Dark blue to 51. If ya pull em back to FM tunnel area you can fear em along the wall there towards  spires with no adds. There are likely better area's but I use  spots where i can  afk a bit  time to time lol )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Retizmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i tried out what a couple of you posted.. Sol B is 2% per kill, scarlet desert isnt worth going to yet, its more of a ranger or animal kiting zone, echo caverns, though stuff ther is darkblue, the mobs have such hp it isnt even worth it, same with gunthak.. moderate hp, moderate ac. it seems my best bet right now is Sol B =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vaylene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd say go to SolB once all the Fabled Mobs are gone.  Got a group to go there and exp was amazing 2-3% per kill.  Then near the entrance we got agroed by the Fabled Kobald Noble, he was hitting for around 500. Group got whipped, I FDed(God I love it).<br />
<br />
Group got back and some dumb Ranger trained the Noble on us, he was low on life and Groupy said we should try and kill.... He Enraged and killed all of us in 10 sec....  <br />
<br />
Other than that bloody fabled I'd say SolB is great place :)</div></div><hr />
