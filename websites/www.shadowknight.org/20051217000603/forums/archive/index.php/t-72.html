<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xedd Zerous</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we all know its out. <br />
<br />
For the good or the bad its still going to contribute a good deal to EQ as we see it. <br />
<br />
I was just curious if anyone knew anything other then the front page BS about what is going to be with PoP. <br />
<br />
Mainly the &quot;Further advancement of player characters.&quot; strikes home with me, kind of worries me. Some people think its level 70 (haha) my assumption would be that its going to be more AA skills etc. Anyways, back to the rambling. I am also hoping that this PoP expansion will pretty much solve any problems that might be developing on the servers. I know on the rathe you basically can run out of things to kill and have to scrap around for mobs. <br />
<br />
Just my random 2cp. <br />
<br />
Feel free to add.</div></div><hr />

Like say if it was raised from 60 to 70 then once you are 60+  you are no longer to recieve exp back from a death and make it take weeks to get like a bubble of exp, just my personal opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha, the ultimate time sink... and sadly it would still be tuned for level 70...<br />
<br />
xedd i understand that being a human causes you to be blind and have much less intelligence than a dark elf but why even ask? it should be obvious that PoP is going to be level 85 cap (wtg green con nagafen!) with multiple aa skills, and of course... no exp mobs left in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trun</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvl 85. How many crappy unused spells would that translate to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love the level cap upped so it will allow smaller guilds like mine to finally raid those dungeons/zones that uber guilds had been farming for so long and monopolize everything. Upping level cap will move them away from those areas that just turned green to them and they would focus on tougher areas to farm and we move in. I remembered how LGUK was heavily farmed by high levels and so called uber guilds til ROK got released then they finally moved to ROK to farm Sebilis, HS, etc and LGUK was open to us once again cuz its too green for them heh. Sebilis would finally get less crowded just like LGUK once lvl cap of 60 get upped. <br />
<br />
I also always drooling over rogue necro pet to have, better lifetaps, much better lifetap DOTs than crappy 200hp DOT we have, mana skin with 1 mana regeneration at the cost of same component that diamond skin gives, get DMF so we will finally cast on others, better summon corpse with stackable coffins, new SK only spells like combined atk/ac taps etc. List goes on. Perhaps, we will continue to reduce our cast time 3% per level to maybe cap of 50% at most. That would be deadly for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilubo</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if did goes up to 70 with insanely impossible lvls and weeks for a blue bubble, then im going to kill myself:mad: <br />
get to 60 is bad enough, but 70 with that crap, forget about it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksithe</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thikn a level cap increase would be far more difficult to do now.  There would need to be alot of tuning to uber mobs.  Would they put a level limit on VS and Trak like Vox and Nag?<br />
<br />
AA Skills would all be adjusted.<br />
<br />
Woulud be interesting to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaeluur</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember the guy that found the code for the deathpeace aa skill?<br />
<br />
think we get it in PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xedd Zerous</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know my true purpose was to make it known that i'm still around. but no! no special name for me! Junior member my ass. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I doubt they'd up the level cap unless they went through and basically redid everything (making the unused zones now into 60+ zones) hmm CT anyone? and adding a couple more 50+ zones but hey, chardok royals with 2 people anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xedd Zerous</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5th post, no more junior member =p sorry had to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure they would up the levels as another poster said. Changing the cap from 50 to 60 had a HUGE impact on the old world that was tuned for 50th level. Changing from 60 to 70 would no doubt have the same sort of impact only this time affect the old world and 3 expansions.<br />
<br />
Tuning these worlds to meet the new levels and power of guilds is one time consuming and tedious and two not really fair to those people and/or guilds that haven't or are only just beginning to exp these areas in the first place. Just when they get a taste of NToV or ST they get tuned to the point where they can no longer go back.<br />
<br />
I agree with (maybe) a few more levels (level 65 anyone?) and some increased AA skills to make up for the lack in areas where balancing was supposed to fix. Of course i am sure they will be even more expensive to purchase (12pts per skill level?? 15?) and take lots of time to get to. <br />
<br />
You have to hand it to them though. They know their customers base and they know we will complain and cuss alot about the greater time sink all the while depriving ourselves of sleep in an irrational attempt to get to the top yet again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurrge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine sinking more time and money into another EQ expansion, to be honest.  Shadows of Luclin was frankly disappointing.  Where is the new interface?  Where is the working Bazaar?  Where is the class balance?  The new models looked fine in many places, but the long-familiar Velious textures are gone, so everyone looks pretty much the same when it comes to armor.<br />
<br />
So I should buy an expansion that is comprised of 18 planes?  I can just imagine that the &quot;Plane of Knowledge is not working when shipped but we plan on patching it in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
More planes is not going to make anyone buy this expansion, so I bet they will resort to time-honored eyecandy and player expansion.  They will give us stuff like flying steeds, more AA XP, and perhaps even the ability to go to level 61 or 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakang</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they do up the lvls I hope they make it extremely hard to get there.  But as some said I think it would mess up the rest of the world to much.  Unless once you passed 60th trivial loot code kicked in for you.  I think even then it would unbalance alot of the old game.  Better if they just keep adding to the AAXP system.</div></div><hr />

This doesnt effect people who are unemployed and VI always designs high end content around the assumption that everyone is already the highest level with the best gear.  So in other words your suggestion would pretty much forbid working people and people with RL committments from EVER enjoying the PoP expansion.  Can you say ..Hell No.</div></div><hr />

Since when is that a problem for the Vision (tm) ? Ask Nocifer (or me) about it...</div></div><hr />
