<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stronteum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, been workin it since day 1.  I swear PoHate and PoFear turned off hide and soulleech drops whenever I would zone in.  Crazy. <br />

So 3 years later, I can now finally say I got it done.  Wish I coulda done it back when Lhranc took a large 30+ atleast force to do and be scared.  As it was, it took 9 time/god equipped guys.   4 sk's, 1 cler, 1 dru, 1 pally, couple other nukers.   And think the fight was about 10, maybe 20 seconds max.  Took a good bit of damage.  every swing was a proc it seemed from him.   10 hits of his 470 proc.  and about a dozen hits in the 100's from him.<br />
<br />
Wish I coulda been doin him back when I woulda been scared of him.  hehe.<br />
<br />
Glad hate finally dropped a hide after the patch recently, and then got real lucky on a 3rd and last golem yesterday having the soulleech for me FINALLY.  Slapped the crew together and went off and pulled off the IC finally.<br />
<br />
Now I can justifiably to myself start the epic 2.0 when it gets here.  I didn't want to do epic 2.0 without having finished up the first.   Think I spent about 3 months on most of the quest.  then almost 2 3/4 years waiting on a decrepit hide and soulleech... One unlucky bastard I am hehe.  Glad the bad luck ended finally.<br />
<br />
WOO quite satisfying to finish it up.  <br />
