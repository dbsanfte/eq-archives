<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this quest today and decided that I really wanted to do it so I could replace my Dark-Edged Two Hander.<br />
<br />
So I spent three hours out in the Great Divide with my brother (level fourty eight druid who I brought along to track) and not one sign of Blizzent.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to get this guy to spawn? Any idea where he spawns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm what level are you guys?<br />
<br />
I believe Reivaj (named giant in the Manor area of Kael iirc) can drop the sword as his rare, and he's probably easier to camp if you're high enough than a rare pop quest mob.<br />
<br />
Other than that, no idea where the mob spawns =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am level fourty eight (almost fourty nine) and the druid is fourty nine. <br />
<br />
I am currently on Kael Faction (and want to stay there for the Malevolent armor quests) which is why I never thought about taking Reivaj down instead.<br />
<br />
What I did not think about until I read your post is that my brother is on Coldain faction and would have no qualms about popping the giant. So I double checked the sword and found that it is not no-drop.<br />
<br />
What are the odds against him soloing Reivaj?<br />
<br />
He has soloed in Kael before but he hangs out by the zoneline. Having wandered around the entire zone I know the mobs get much more difficult as you go further in and I believe it will be near impossible for a solo druid to single pull from the Iceshard Manor.<br />
<br />
I will take a look in game tonight. We plan on trying for Blizzent again but this time I am going to speak to the three giants who mention Blizzent before we begin (hoping that maybe I can trigger the bastard). I will scout around a bit while I am in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sassafra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">blizzent hangs around the extreme south east corner of the zone <br />
when it's up.<br />
n7000 n3200 approx.<br />
no idea what spawns it.<br />
<br />
sassafra bloodreigns<br />
65 dread lord<br />
the tribunal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bagged him today. Right around -7000 -3000.<br />
<br />
Definitely not a triggered spawn as I was only half way to Kael when my brother announced that he had engaged Blizzent. <br />
<br />
Guess he was just rare after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rezzinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a side note, but the giants you turn in the Kael quest pieces to are on Kromzek faction, while Reivaj or whatever is a Kromriff faction giant.  it takes a lot, I mean a lot of killing Kromriff to lower Kromzek faction noticably.</div></div><hr />
