<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Onlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tuesday July 20th Update<br />
<br />
- Augments can now fit into multiple slot types. On an augment the text could read &quot;This augment can fit in these slot types: 3, 4&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Zoning pets will now properly save their taunt toggle settings.<br />
<br />
- Spell damage messages done to yourself will no longer be displayed for others. Cannibalize and Mana Convert spells were examples of this.<br />
<br />
- Summoning a Sand Giant in Oasis with Monster Summoning will no longer cause your pet the next time you zone to be HUGE! Monster Summoned pets will no longer save their size<br />
<br />
- Pets will no longer poof when you get Call of Hero'd.<br />
<br />
- Weapon augmentations will again proc properly<br />
<br />
- The EverQuest process is now more friendly. There is also a slider bar to set your Max. FPS. in the Options window under display settings. This will free up more resources while running EQ. Also, when EQ loses focus it will use less resources.<br />
<br />
- New commands for consent:<br />
<br />
/consent group -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by all of your current group members<br />
<br />
/consent raid -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your raid (including people who join the raid later)<br />
<br />
/consent guild -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your guild<br />
<br />
/deny group -- removes the flag<br />
<br />
/deny raid -- removes the flag<br />
<br />
/deny guild -- removes the flag</div></div><hr />

<br />
and &quot;/consent raid&quot; is a godsend (pun not intended)<br />
<br />
I feel balanced now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How long do you think it'll be before they take these changes LIVE?  Also, how much of that will get nerfed in rapid order before it goes live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uhh, i think these ARE live as of the patch. Also, how the fuck could any of this get nerfed?</div></div><hr />

What specifically is wrong with aug procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">something is wrong with them on TEST at least.<br />
i haven't noticed anything on live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So, have you noticed any difference in aug text or have you not seen one since they put that on Test?  I'm curious as to how they've gone about making augments fit multiple slot types.</div></div><hr />

now THAT's worth a few bucks.  jesus christ why give us frogloks or berzerkers (or cat people) when you could have made the game RUN BETTER???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">when you could have made the game RUN BETTER <br />
It doesnt run better now, it just prevents the eqgame.exe from hogging all its ressources even if its running in the background.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
