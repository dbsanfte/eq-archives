Of course, as you've pointed out, you're not any richer until you sell the stock, or receive dividends.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Plubius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Man, this one is classic - I almost think it is an April Fools joke.  Here is my favorite parts of their press releases:<br />
<br />
Of the 800 billion authorized shares  of common stock, CMKX currently has 703,518,875,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding to approximately 2,032 stockholders of record (excluding shares held in &quot;street name&quot;). In addition, effective March 1, 2005, CMKX has relocated its executive office address to 5375 Procyon St., Suite 101, Las Vegas, NV. Lastly, CMKX's current officer is Urban Casavant (CEO/President/Secretary/Treasurer) and current directors are Urban Casavant and Robert A. Maheu (Michael Williams will join the board of directors upon CMKX's obtainment of D&amp;O insurance). <br />
<br />
and from their Edgar online SEC 8-k filings:<br />
<br />
On March 1, 2004, the Company's board of directors and a majority of its stockholders, approved the amendment to the articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares from Two Hundred Billion (200,000,000,000) shares to Five Hundred Billion (500,000,000,000) shares at a par value $0.0001. A copy of the certificate of amendment to the articles of incorporation is attached hereto as exhibit 3(i)(b). <br />
<br />
On July 13, 2004, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to the articles of incorporation to correct a typographical error. The Company's original articles of incorporation filed on June 9, 1998 had a stated par value of $0.0001. A subsequent amendment filed on December 26, 2002 and all subsequent amendments which increased the authorized shares mistakenly listed the common par value as $0.001. Article 4 of this certificate of amendment was amended to read, the par value of common shares is $0.0001. A copy of the certificate of amendment to articles of incorporation is attached hereto as exhibit 3(i)(c). <br />
<br />
From the SEC filing when they merged with the &quot;mining&quot; company in canada:<br />
<br />
The corporate charter was amended to increase authorize share capital to 10,000,000,000 common voting shares in order to effectuate the merger. This increase in share capital was necessary in order to complete the merger with the Casavant Mineral Claims since the value of the properties to be assigned to the Company exceeded its nominal cash reserves of $344 as reported in its 10-QSB dated September 30, 2002. All 3,000,000 Preferred shares were cancelled.<br />
<br />
I do have to admit using the minimum trading decimal rules to pump up a stock is genius.  I also enjoyed the fact that a $344 company somehow merged with a $10,000,000 in asset company.</div></div><hr />

Why do people keep bringing up these horrible memories? Four years ago my brother died... He was in the basement when a freak hot flash came (it got to two degrees above freezing), and the igloo melted around him. He didn't know how to swim, and he drowned.<br />
<br />
And no part of Canada uses fish for currency, because the rest of Canada doesn't consider the French part of Canada actually part of the country.</div></div><hr />
