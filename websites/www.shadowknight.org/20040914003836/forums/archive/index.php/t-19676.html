<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have many AA's I want, but am trying to determine if I really really want this now, or much later.<br />
<br />
Is this all it's cracked up to be?  How does it work?  All I see is that your pet won't attack when you are FD splitting or when I get hit with AE.  Is that it?  If I do send it in and want it to back off, will it hold if I tell it then or continue to hit back if struck by the mob? If so I would have to do a little spaming of &quot;sorry master calming down&quot; anyway.  What if I want it to go back to its guard spot or to me and I tell it to hold?  Will it just stop where I told it to?<br />
<br />
Pet back off seems to work just fine-- need to use it anyway to place Goober where I want him to be hitting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I’d recommend getting it, but it isn’t the greatest thing since sliced bread like some people have made it out to be.  It’s a nice pulling tool, but I always feel bad asking the Cleric to keep an eye on my pet and making sure he gets healed between pulls, depending on what I’m fighting.<br />
<br />
On normal risk LDoN’s, I don’t tend to use it too much.  I’m not as concerned with pulling singles in these situations, since the mobs are so weak, so I tend to prefer that Jabober just follow me around and attack of his own free will.  If a room is packed I may use my pet to get the first two solo and then I just tackle the whole room.  It is truly handy to be able to tell your pet to hold off if he’s getting shredded by damage shields, so you can get him a heal and not have to summon a new one.  Takish, I’m looking at you…<br />
<br />
One of the annoying things about /pet hold is that it’s not a persistent command, like /pet no taunt.  Hit /pet hold, and he’s holding.  Hit /pet attack, and he attacks, and he’s back in his normal auto-engage mindset.  If you want him to stay held, you have to hit your /pet hold hotkey again after every mob.  If they made /pet hold persistent, I’d be much happier about it.  They could make /pet guard me the command to return to auto-engage, and /pet follow and /pet guard here would make him stay put or follow you around without changing his attack status.  But if wishes were Unholy Steeds….<br />
<br />
I didn’t end up getting /pet hold until I was in my low-mid 100 AA’s.  I wouldn’t do it differently a second time around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
this made me laugh very hard, so true. it's so annoying because you know you are not going to swap in a pet spell and deal with that annoyingly long cast time to bring him back. no more bone boy for this adventure.<br />
<br />
question i have about pet hold is this. if you have your pet in guard mode say at the back of a room and then you send him off to attack a mob to draw it back to you, when you hit pet hold will he simply stop attacking and stand where he currently is or will he return to the guard position. i'm guessing it's the former so the way to get him back with the least possible damage would be /pet attack , /pet hold , /pet back off. is that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elysea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/pet hold will make him stop attacking and return to what he was doing before he was told to attack.  When I need to use him for pulling, I summon him, /pet hold, and let him follow me.  I feign wherever I need to feign, and order the pet to /pet attack whichever mob I’m trying to get.  As soon as his feet hit the targeting ring around the target, I hit /pet hold again and he turns around and returns to my feign spot with the mob chasing him.  Once the mob is clear of his friends, I stand up and voila, I have the mob solo.<br />
<br />
If you want to use /pet guard here for this technique, when you hit /pet hold, he should return to the spot you previously told him to guard .  Think of /pet hold as a super-/pet back off + mem wipe.<br />
<br />
Four things to remember: If you send in the pet to attack and he doesn’t immediately turn around when you hit /pet hold, it probably just means that he took a bash from the mob and is stunned.  The command is working, just give Jabober a second to get his skull back on straight.  Second, once you bring the mob back to your group, don’t forget to hit /pet attack again.  It’s embarrassing to forget this.  Third, it doesn’t always work, even if you feign before you send in the pet.  The upshot is that if it doesn’t work, you should know right away.  The mobs will all immediately monkey-pile on Jabober and you can let him die without consequence, just stay feigned.  Fourth, an hp buff on your pet will help a great deal.  Faith or Protection of the Nine is usually plenty, don’t ask your Cleric to waste a peridot on him unless you’re pulling something truly fearsome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, let me make a correction here.  You do *NOT* need to feign to pull with pet, and if you are feigning, you are kinda wasting mana and time. <br />
<br />
Pet pulling works well because of some changes that SOE made to pets a while ago.  If your pet is low enough level, then if it attacks a mob, nothing around it will attack back.  If you are fighing stuff that's light blue, you will get adds unless you pull up a lower level pet.  Shamans and other classes that try pet pulling have to always use a lower level pet, because if they use a light blue or dark blue pet, they get adds just like anyone else that pulls.<br />
<br />
Here are my opinions of pet pulling from quite a bit of pulling with my pet.<br />
<br />
Pros<br />
Single pulling most mobs that you will be fighting as a group.  Especially if you don't waste time feigning, the pulls are almost as fast as just pulling with a spell.<br />
<br />
Pet can be kept from aggroing on mobs that nuke you from a distance and making it hard to pull them close<br />
<br />
In general pets become useful and worth casting.<br />
<br />
Being able to clear rooms that wouldn't be possible in some circumstances.  I've been in small groups (3-4 people) that have told me that we couldn't do a certain area without an enchanter.  After we cleared the entire area of densly packed mobs, they ate their words and admitted how awesome I was. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
We have very wussy pets.  Ideally they pull best when they have a virtue and you have a healer healing them after every couple pulls.  If you don't have a chanter in your group, this isn't bad though because it takes less to heal your pet than it would take a cleric to heal multiple people in a party when you get adds.<br />
<br />
You have to tell your pet to attack.   I lose a lot of DPS quite often because I forget to make pet engage after I backed him off.<br />
<br />
You can't pull things that are too tough.  Hard LDoN adventures for example.  I have also heard that elemental level mobs can't be pet pulled easily either, although I havn't tried yet.  Pet dies too fast even with virtue. Anything below elemental can be pulled though.<br />
<br />
Sometimes if you try chain pulling and you aren't the main tank, the pet doesn't like to leave the first target you sick it on and even though you tell it to hit the new target it will sometimes go back to old pet.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
I still feel that pets are well worth the AAs.  I haven't found any method of pulling that is faster or more consistant.  Even rangers pulling giants in BoT with harmony have resists sometimes and get adds.  Pets never have this problem.  If you don't pull, or if you don't care if you get more than one mob at a time, then don't get the AA for a while.  If I was making another SK from scratch, I'd be doing the pet AA right after my horse, followed by the rest of my defensive AAs.  Some will disagree, but in the groups I'm in, single pulling helps more than anything else, and I burn far less cleric mana if I only have one mob on me instead of two.  Although it may be a pain to have clerics heal pet, I make up for it by always using Zevfeers to recharge any mana they may lose healing pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, you DO need to FD some times.  If you are pulling crap like normal mobs in LDoN you don't need to worry about him getting ganked.<br />
<br />
However, if your pet gets ganked on the way back and you are not FD you are going to pull all the adds he prox agroed.  If you FD when you think your pet might die you at least give your group a shot at tagging the mob solo.<br />
<br />
If you sit down while pet pulling...it will also pull adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is this all it's cracked up to be?  <br />
<br />
...and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pet doesn't proximity aggro if you are doing it right.  I've only had one or two places ever that pet would pull more than a single mob, and with a little playing around, I could usually figure out why and get lower level pet, or do something else to get it back to single pulls.  When I'm pet pulling, the ONLY time I feign is when something goes horribly wrong and pet is bringing back more mobs than what the group wants and I sacrifice my pet, feign, and then let mobs go back to their home location and try again.<br />
<br />
I have been pet pulling for over a month now and loving every bit of it.  I have pulled named mobs in BoT right out from a group of 5-6 mobs that would have aggroed if I had just pulled with spell or arrow, and I've even had a pet pull mobs right over the top of and through other mobs without any adds.  In one example in particular, I used pet to pull a mob right through another mob, that when I had done the exact same pull a month earlier with pacify/harmony, the mob got close enough to another that I got an add from it.  Pet pulling is much better and more reliable than harmony in most cases.<br />
<br />
There have been times that I screwed something up and cast a spell on a mob too soon and got aggro on myself instead of my pet while it was still in aggro range of other stuff, and then I got adds that I had to deal with, but that was my own fault, and I feigned, let pet die, and got up and cast another pet after everything left.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of how little I have to feign, I pet pull almost  single day, for at least a few hours, and on weekends even longer.  When I'm pulling, I have very honestly considered getting rid of feign in favor of another spell while pulling because it's so unnecessary.  I havent actually done it yet because feign has saved my butt so many times in the years I've played a SK that it's hard to want to give it up, but I can count the number of times I've had to feign on a pull on one hand and still have fingers left over.<br />
<br />
I suppose that if you sit when pulling with a pet you can screw it up, but I've never tried that and don't really know why you'd want to.  The trivial amount of mana you'd gain for the couple seconds that you pet pull is insigificant, especially if you use MC, like I do.<br />
<br />
The main thing that I was trying to get across is this.  Some people have the mistaken impression that you need to feign death, send pet in to attack, bring pet back, get up, and fight, when all you need to do is send the pet in and skip the feign death part.  Feign can always help save your butt if you screw something up, but if you are pulling properly you won't need feign like some people felt, and if you are getting adds from the pet being too high of level, you are going to get those adds whether you are feigned or not, so there isn't any advantage to using feign regularly on pulls.<br />
<br />
and /agree Siilvir.  :)  Best AAs I've used.  My personal opinion is that no matter how good people say it is, it's underrated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tried pet pulling in The Deep while soloing for the Wand of Imperceptibility, but Jabober would aggro everyone. Even when I used a lower level pet. Guess it just doesn't work in some zones. That camp is caster heavy and pulling off a FD sometimes can be tricky. I did succeed tho, grats me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">but if you are pulling properly you won't need feign like some people felt, and if you are getting adds from the pet being too high of level, you are going to get those adds whether you are feigned or not, so there isn't any advantage to using feign regularly on pulls. <br />
<br />
This may be true; however I don't use fd/pet-pull as often as you do.  That said, I've never failed a pet pull due to pet level either -- so I guess until the day I see the pet get an add, I'll stand by feigning before sending the pet in on those critical difficult pulls.  Usually if I'm pulling a mob that cons the pet blue, I don't even use the pet, I just pull it myself.<br />
<br />
However... upon thinking this over, I don't believe I have specifically tried or had the need to try pet pulling on known LINKED mobs (where Pacification would also fail normally, and standard FD pulling is a bitch to pull off), perhaps this is what you mean above when you say the pet would get adds.  If so, I agree fully, and will have to experiment in a zone that has linked mobs.</div></div><hr />

chania=Kk for now....:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From what I understand, Chania, pet pulling doesn't work if the mob has a pet. Many mobs in the deep are enchanters, and have pets. That was probably your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">16 hours in that camp and Kox is being a stingy bastage. Grats Chania.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm Kyfe that may be it. Every second mob there had a pet it seemed. Good to know that tidbit of info. <br />
<br />
And thanks all, was fun getting down there and holding the camp for an item I actually needed. 25 PH's but only 2 named to do it too. Next, I think I'll solo the 10th ring. Never did get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You FD before sending pet in, because there are many cases where even a focus'd shrew'd nine'd (my normal ldon hard group) pet gets one rounded.  Gratz you on aggroing everything in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Squigle D'Muerte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One more con to the pet pull. Other party members.<br />
<br />
In LDoN (particularly on Normal because people who do hard usually know what they are doing) some people just crowd around you no matter how much you tell them &quot;Stay back so I can pull.&quot;  With a chanter this is still usually cool but without a chanter/bard, there are a few dungeon configurations (Sunken Library in Tak)  where normal pulls can bury you in adds even with FD and Lulls are very hard to pull off due to corners.  You can break with pet pull but stupid group mates can screw that all up fast.  Nothing pisses me off more then doing a perfect pull only to have some damn ranger fire an arrow while mob is still in the next room. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh, and for what it's worth, there isnt' anything wrong or bad about feigning before a pull if you want to do that.  It does offer a small amount of extra protection if your pet does during a pull.  I never do it just because of the extra hassle and that it's not needed most of the time.  There have been a few times I've had adds from pet dying, and if I feigned it would have prevented that.  Not a big deal either way.<br />
<br />
If you do pet pull, it's good to communicate well with your cleric though.  I've had a few times in LDoN that the cleric cast a heal on me while pet was aggroing.  Ended up with a nice train whacking the cleric to death.  Kinda funny, but the clerics don't appreciate the humor.  Luckily I always group with the same cleric, so she's getting the healing and timing down.<br />
<br />
As far as the Deep, I haven't had any problems with pulling there.  When I was working on my shard, I was consistantly single pulling.  You do have to watch that you aren't too close to the mobs when pulling, or aggro transfers to you too soon and the pulled mob is still in range of others, but I was able to single pull all the way to the bridge and then all the mobs that can drop the shard.<br />
<br />
Linked mobs seem to stay linked even when pet pulling.  If you attack one of vindi's guards for example, they all jump and then kill the pet.  Kinda funny, but the pet doesn't appreciate the humor of it when it dies either. :)<br />
<br />
Squigle is right about party members though.  They can screw pulls up pretty good.  I usually have good groups though.  Today I kinda laughed when group told me not to pull a named because there were four other mobs near it that would add.  I told them to trust me, and I single pulled him right past the four mobs.  After we killed him, I asked what that was they were saying about adds. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daikoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It is not an end-all/be-all aa, but it is nice, if you are pulling some non LDoN zone, you can hold him and  still get benifit of the dps.<br />
<br />
That was enough to get me to go back to kurns.<br />
