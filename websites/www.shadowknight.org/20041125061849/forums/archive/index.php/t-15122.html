<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arbaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the coding avail for DoT dmg to increase per tic I wonder if we can now get a similar AA to the way healing classes get Healing Adept, Advanced Healing Adept?<br />
<br />
What did I have in mind you may ask? Something along these lines...<br />
<br />
Affliction Adept, archtype AA<br />
<br />
lvl 1, 2 AA, increases DoT dmg by 2% per tic<br />
lvl 2, 4 AA, increases DoT dmg by 5% per tic<br />
lvl 3, 6 AA, increases DoT dmg by 10% per tic<br />
<br />
Affliction Mastery, PoP class AA<br />
<br />
5 AA, increases DoT dmg by 15% per tic<br />
<br />
I was just lookin for some feedback from various ppl to see what they thought. Thanks in advance for any feedback on this particular idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems like a lot if it stacks with the new focus items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think its a great idea. <br />
<br />
If i am reading it correctly ( i am sure i am) then this would make festering darkness do 150 more points of dmg ( with full aa). Seems to be fairly balanced to me.  <br />
<br />
Even with Focus effect items stacking this would still be balanced. So the extra dmg this does would not be game breaking by any means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">17 aas for a repeatable (not random, that is) 10% + boost to regular grind DPS seems flagrant... and that's just considering my normal attempt at dotting when exping, i'd hate to see the numbers with someone with a much larger manapool and higher int and mana regen dumping more mana into dots than me getting 1/3 more DPS just due to dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rykor Bloodscream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want a F***in' self buff duration/pet buff duration increaser.  You kill one frickin' mob in PoP and you have to rebuff MC, Deadeye, and rehaste pet before the next pull it feels like *sighs*<br />
<br />
1 AA:  Buff timer + 20 minutes<br />
1 more AA: Buff timer + another 20 minutes<br />
1 more AA: Buff timer + another 20 minutes<br />
<br />
Adds one hour to the existing buff timer at the end. Again, these are self buffs.  Extended Enhancement IV (if I could afford it) makes my deadeye last an extra 3 minutes  *twirls his finger* :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Or at the very least...do what they did in the old days and FIX the damned spells instead of making AAs to fix a useless spell/bad implementation.  15 minute duration buffs at lvl 60+ is rediculous   :(<br />
<br />
/rant off.  I hate marathon play sessions...all gleaming errors get to me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lets stay on topic.<br />
<br />
It's a decent idea, one that will probably need a bit of playing around with to get numbers that they'll like, but I think it's reasonable.  Lord knows it's hard to come up with ideas they haven't flat out rejected already.<br />
<br />
And a better name!  Affliction Adept is just so bland!  Something to do with Bertoxx maybe, since it's affliction based.  Aura of Bertoxxulous?  Blessing of Bertoxxulous?  Ooo.. I like that one.  Perversion of a light word like blessing.  Blingbling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true. But look at how healing adept works out. Passive ability that gives priest classes and priest hybrids the ability to heal more. Healing Adept also stacks with focus items that increase the ammount of each heal.<br />
<br />
Example a paladin using spell Light of Nife(NOT counting Crit heal)<br />
<br />
no healing, no adept AA - 850heal<br />
<br />
healing adept maxxed(arch and pop)- 1011 heal (19% improvement)<br />
<br />
healing adept, focus Marr's Gift(25% increase/random)<br />
- up to 1300 point heal  (random: 19%-44%)<br />
<br />
This is true for all priests with the Healing Adept AA's and increased healing focus. There are restrictions on foci, CH and percentage heals excluded for instance. Vary per focus.<br />
<br />
I do not think what I propose is out of wack, but rather balanced. With Burning Affliction 4(20% increase) and 15% increase(proposed AA line) on dmg per DoT tic, would give us a comparable increase in power which our counterparts gain.<br />
<br />
Any/all feedback encouraged. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sounds good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alehop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its a very nice idea, would be a very nice AA.<br />
<br />
Althrough, looking with soe eyes, I could say that maybe its a bit overpowered too.<br />
<br />
As you said healing adept + Marr's gift would be 19%-44% random. And burning alfiction + this AA would be a 35% permanent.<br />
<br />
Even they are different kinds of AAs, If I were a healer for sure would chose a 35% permantent on heals than a random one.<br />
<br />
The solution?<br />
<br />
Maybe remove the affliction mastery, that would mean a 10% increase on dots + focus (max 30%).<br />
<br />
Or maybe adding to burning affliction and his lower versions any kind of random component like healers got on their focus versions.<br />
<br />
Anyways as I said this would be a really nice AA to have, I hope someday this, or anything similar comes live :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're forgetting the fact that he didnt include heal crits in there alehop, which would bump it another 10% (average over time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a good idea. I'm sure you'd find necro's, shamans, etc all for it too. The necro board has been dreaming about crit dot's for a long time as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wouldnt be over powered for necros and shammies?  I mean necros can already acheive sick dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was just thinking of something along these lines as an aa, imo would be a great addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Necromancers have been debating the need for some kind of AA to increase the damage of DoTs for a long time.  This idea is one that we have been discussing and has merit.  Hopefully with the new DoT damage focus items about to be launch SoE will extend that code to a new DoT AA.<br />
<br />
Bril</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like the idea.  And I think we should name it after Rodcet... Just to get Dregor's panties in a bunch.<br />
<br />
I know he runs around the house in Cazic Thule print underoos. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like it.<br />
<br />
Even if they made it random/crit based I would be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Duke Malagen Shai'Kar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Certainly would turn BoH into a nasty DoT.<br />
<br />
Considering that we now have Theft of Life, I doubt SoE would give us another form of spell enhancement. Nice idea though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Question: Would burning affliction increase the amount we get healed by lifetap dots like Bond of Death? And would Arbaal's AA idea do the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arbedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When you use BoD, vexing or Saryrn Kiss or what ever spell along that line, the hp you regen are from the recourse effect of the dot.<br />
I'm guessing burning affliction will only affect the dot itself, though I really wish recourse will be affected too, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Evilangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sounds good.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we will see some more class specific  AA's coming with further expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I like it. That should be a viable addition to aaxp list. I don't see reason why can't it be on it.. DD got aaxps, Healing got aaxps, melee got aaxps, missile got aaxps, offensive/defensive got aaxps, where are dot aaxps? They are due..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is what I have wanted to see for a LONG time.  DoTs have lost their supremecy in the category of efficiency a long time ago.  That was the reason for the &quot;stronger&quot; focus effects when they were concerned.  SoE stated that they were in need of a little help to keep them balanced.  Okay.  Great.  So the Affliction Extension line added 20 percent to the overall damage... assuming the mob didn't DIE first, which it always does in XP groups unless the DoTs are the 6-7 tick variety... and perhaps still then.  On raids, the foci doesn't increase the damage produced by DoTs AT ALL.  It just means 20 percent longer lasting... so you cast it one less time on quick fights, and 2 or 3 less times on long fights.  So you end the fight with more mana, or you nuke more for added DPS.<br />
<br />
I had a long paragraph here about the spike efficiency of wizards, but I realized I'd most likely be preaching to the choir.  I'll leave it at &quot;Wizards can achieve damage to mana efficiency with nukes that DoTs can NEVER achieve with any combination of focus effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I have been hoping to arrive is a way to let DoTs crit.  I'm not sure how difficult the mechanics would be to code, but it would be pretty much as follows...<br />
<br />
On a &quot;crit,&quot; the damage on the first three ticks would double.  Granted, that's much less than a base wizard crit, but for non-wizards, the first level of SCF is only a 33 percent increase on a crit.  Each level beyond the first would let the damage be doubled for additional ticks.  If one class had to be given the chance to do it innately, I would suggest that it be Necros, as Shamans still have their intense amount of utility (as do Necros, it is simply less known).  This would be very unimpressive on the 20 tick DoTs, but would achieve a HUGE boost to the 6 tick dots... but if the maximum number of ticks boosted was 6, it would be perfectly in line.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yea, what I was referring to was this boost being granted to *all dotters*... or at least some others. I can't see this boost being given to necros, shammies, druids without increasing the chasm between caster and melee DPS...<br />
<br />
But, yeah, it'd be swell for us. It's not overpowering to *us* in that I wouldn't consider it over the vital AAs anyway <br />
(lifetaps, procs, scf, hps, defensive etc.), but I could see that other classes would prioritize this.<br />
<br />
It's a can of worms comparing us to the healers and their healing boosts, also, even though we have nothing to directly compare to them. Perhaps it's due to the power of dots already?<br />
<br />
That is to say, with a healing dot it's implied that someone has the potential of getting damaged or is actually getting damaged (a tank, or by AE)... but with damage dots, you are isolating yourself from the mob. you are hurting them, and can be doing so with little or no risk to yourself. So, boosting this form cannot be considered 1:1 to a healing dot... as one of them is preventative and needs to be accelerated to maintain pace with a mobs output, where the other serves nothing except decreasing the time it takes to kill the mob. Not the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">honestly i think we need extend buff aa more, maybe even something to reduce recast time on voice spells. it sick i have to keep 2-3 of those perm memed on raids+ deal with 27 min spells that really last 27 mins hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think it's a fantastic idea.  If they put this in, I would buy it asafp.<br />
<br />
I would also like the buff extender.  Not having to keep Aug of Death memmed would be so nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Btw... I dont mem Bond of Death like... ever.  It's 720 hp for 360 mana, barring death before it is done.  Extended Affliction doesn't change the recourse.  Just makes the DoT last an extra two ticks.  It is a 2:1 hp to mana ratio.  Great.  Alternately, I could cast Touch of Innoruuk, which heals 470 for 330, hear a 3:2 ratio.  Great.  An ID foci usually makes it closer to 510 hp, better than 3:2 ratio.  Maxxed SCF and Theft of Life mean I have a chance for a 940 (or more with ID4) healed for 330.  I crit often enough that it is, over time, on par with Bond of Death for efficiency, with a shot at a HUGE boost in the heal.<br />
<br />
Bond of Death is a sure thing that isn't that great and is slow.  It's alright for kiting, but horrible for when you NEED to be healed with any kind of urgency.  Just another demonstration of how nukes are better than dots on so many levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think this idea sounds more then reasonable. It would help improve our overall dps in groups if nothing else which is always a benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I use bond of death all of the time on boss fights to up my dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bond of Death is a good way to counter boss AEs.<br />
<br />
And I love your idea Arbaal, I'd actually XP to buy it I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vincente</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This would be a Necro's wet dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think an AA that increases DoTs is a great idea. Honestly, I think the 15% (in the end) with the PoP as you suggested is too high though. SCF is kind of random. With &quot;Affliction Adept&quot; or whatever you want to call if, you're talking about a 15% increase in CONSTANT spell DPS. <br />
<br />
The idea about buffs lasting longer is pretty short sighted, though. If you're buffs are wearing off too soon, have someone else do it. In any PoP group you should have someone hasting, and that haste for your pet will be better than your own. And almost every pure caster as a sight buff. Why should you use your own mana to buff when the buffers are casting DDs and DoTs?</div></div><hr />
