<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elviscerat0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine gave me a bunch of the ice burrower silks off these worms (an ice burrower in western waste) when I returned to the game to sell in bazaar, I like the return on these, is this a mob i can solo at 64 with the gear in my sig?<br />
<br />
Also, can anyone recommend a good cash farming spot for my level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">welp he doesn't summon, i used aggro kite him on my nec at 60 pre pop. his melee is pretty rough i doubt you could go toe to toe with him, have a dim recollection of hits around 340ish<br />
<br />
you might want to get sow if you try to aggro kite him, it would take forever though. probably at least 40 min solo.<br />
<br />
just get a dps partner, build up some good aggro, keep him snared and let your friend burn him down.</div></div><hr />

Hope that helps some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Every now and then we wind up having to fight one of these bastages with the 3 player group we do the lesser dragons in WW with (62 cleric, my 65 shaman and me 64sk).  I wouldn't want to try to fight these toe to toe without a slow...most likely you'll lose.  They dispell like crazy, so plan on being buffless. <br />
<br />
Compared to the other loot available in WW, they're just a royal pain in the ass.  Invis, and go for the better mobs.  One greater dragon head will fetch you a Frostbringer (if on Kael faction) that will sell quick for 6k.  <br />
<br />
Compared to dragon loot (drops and quest) they're not worth it, even though their silks and hides sell for a fair amount.  It's a long pain in the arse cr if you wipe.<br />
<br />
Honestly, these guys are about 2-3 times the hps of a guardian wurm in SF.</div></div><hr />
