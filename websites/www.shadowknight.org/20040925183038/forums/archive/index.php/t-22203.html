<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigormortis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently had a hard drive crash, bought a new HD and reinstalled eq. I played for a bit then logged so I could readjust the video settings to the way I had them before. eq crashed, and now crashes every time I try to load it up. The patcher comes up, finishes patching, and then &quot;eqgame.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the inconvenience.&quot; I've tried deleting my config files and my ui files and repatching, still crashes every time. Any suggestions? should I reinstall?</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
But why did you log in order to adjust the video settings? You can adjust alot of 'em from the options menu in-game. Like screen resolution etc.</div></div><hr />

ATI drivers have to be removed before new ones installed too (can't upgrade over current drivers).</div></div><hr />
