I shouldn't have to worry about mobs walking through wall, this game's lousy clipping makes me wonder how much effort they put into programming this game.<br />
Also shouldn't have to worry about mobs walking into walls, coming out invisible, and still attacking you while you can't target them, and guards won't kill them either, you have to zone.<br />
These bugs have been here for a while and I reported them many times, I wish they would do their job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirnan</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant logic amuses me.  If the mob can walk through walls, become impossible to target and kill you... it is working as intended OR we are going to fix it someday.  If a mob gets stuck to the lamp post (all you old schoolers know what Im talking about) then its an exploit and you get banned.<br />

so the logic is as long as it hurts the customer leave it alone.  If it can be used as a tactic to defeat a mob its to be blamed on the players.</div></div><hr />

For gods sake, a mammoth can climb a tree in EQ better than I can!!</div></div><hr />

Today was the best. Everyone hunting in Oasis on Fennin Ro - when the MOB started its death march it would gate away - orcs, skele's you name it. Much fun.</div></div><hr />
