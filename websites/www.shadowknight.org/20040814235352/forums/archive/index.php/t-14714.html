<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all it is I again your friendly Eq shadowknight sitting here in the deserts of kuwait and thinking about some things I pondered a while back in game.... <br />
<br />
I was once told by a gm and later had it confirmed by a friend that works in miramar at SoE that 60 percent of the quests and many tradeskill recipes have yet to be unlocked.<br />
<br />
I know in all of our adventures we have all seen many items and such that we cannot figure out purposes for. I also know we all have abilities to use different languages. I consider languages as an important skill. Who here from the older days of the game remembers the Lance that the Fairy Princess in LFay would give as long as you were ally and could speak fairy. Not to mention all the books mobs drop in dungeons that are coded in the language of that race that require language skills to decipher. <br />
<br />
I left before I had the chance to research more but  has anyone ever checked to see if there is a way to raise faction with mobs like the Shissar and such that may actually have valuable quests.. Remember most of the mobs we fight and consider just mobs were the Emperors and superior races of Norrath prior to the making of man. Whats to say those mobs don't have knowledge of better tradeskills or quests for superior weapons.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for the ramble but believe me I have plenty of time to sit and research things out here ;) It would be interesting to know what anyone has discovered or if anyone shares the same thoughts. <br />
<br />
I'm a quester by nature , a 62 shadowknight Human with his greenmist, 9th dain ring, 7th shawl , eyepatch of plunder and finishing his IC, i enjoy the depth of this game and love discovering new things putting the puzzles together. ;) I could easily be one of those many 65's with 200+ aa decked out in all elemental by now , but I spent more time questing than leveling.<br />
<br />
I'd like to use this thread to start up conversation on this topic a little more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem with 60% of the locked quests is that they are mostly crap,but hey,Im up for another Greemist type quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dregor Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, no.  60% of the quests are not not unlocked yet.  I can maybe believe a few tradeskill recipes slipped through the cracks, but I even have trouble with that.  Tradeskillers are a fanatical bunch ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The guy you talked to neglected to mention that 90% of that 60% were broken beyond repair.<br />
<br />
As for making friends with Shissy's, is that even possible?  I know that there are some factions in game that it is impossible to raise, they can only be lowered.  I was under the impression that the Shissar were one of those factions.<br />
<br />
In any case, I've got more than enough quests, items and zones to explore without adding that many again.  Considering all the crap I keep around in my bank just waiting for the day that I might feel like working on &quot;crappy_timesink_quest_022301834&quot;, I'll probably never finish 20% of the quests and tradeskills that are already out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rajak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Real interesting topic. I've been playing  since 3/99 so some of the past world history blurs to me, but I remember the assertion by the company that said most of the quests were yet to be uncovered. Seems like it was a long, long time ago and they never repeated it ?<br />
<br />
What I'm remembering was before any expansions when the SK community was still spamming NPC's looking for the equal of the flaming paladin sword, which of course turned out not to be there, and I remember at the time being surprised all of the searching didn't lead to any new goodies. <br />
<br />
I was just thinking about this again the other day in Rathe Mountains where I tried hailing the troll SK again at the tower with the blue flame. For some reason I go and do this every few levels like maybe someday he'll say something to me.<br />
<br />
In the very beginning, I also thought languages were going to be significant, but then again I also thought I'd be able to hail my god Cazic, talk to Vox, or get a better quest than a rusty 2 hander from the SK guildleader. After LoY and no discovered way to get Broken Skull faction, or receive a bounty for dead Frogloks, or for that matter the apparently dead Grozmok storyline, I concluded that the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br />
<br />
Traditionally, they don't fix broken little things quickly (how many undiscovered bugs with undiscovered quests), or even big ones sometimes, and without some kind of clues it would be a hellish effort to discover, say, that Cazic Thule actually speaks Ancient Erudite and will only look upon you favorably if you're carrying precisely 9 dark elf meats......but yet that strictly random discovery which wouldn't likely be understood could go into the undiscovered quest pile.....<br />
<br />
Add to that, the fact that the vast majority of players could care less about new discoveries but just want to be 65 in Time with 500 AA's and uber gear as fast as possible, and it becomes more unlikely anything much will turn up. It's a been there done that, next zone cycle, because there just can't be anything there someone else hasn't already found.<br />
<br />
Makes you wonder, in a game called everQUEST, why they wouldn't offer clues for the various classes toward finding the undiscovered, even general statements like &quot;mastering suchandsuch language could have benefits on Kunark&quot;, etc.......<br />
<br />
I still hope though....every once in a while I throw a few random phrases at NPC's. Haven't found anything unique in over 4 years though. How hidden is too hidden ? <br />
<br />
Sure wish an SK would find SOMETHING......SOMEWHERE....to indicate a new level of achievable wonder......but really doubt it will be me. Heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it's no longer EverQuest.  It's EverPound uber mob for any decent item worth the effort.  Quests anymore dont reward squat worth keeping because hence rewards can be replaced quickly with a small raid.  most items can be won with DKP earned in less time then it takes to complete an item you worked your ass off to finish.  Sure you get that warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment.  But other then that you are basically scofed at for even bothering to do such a quest when you could have just gone the bazaar and bought a weapon that is three times better.  <br />
<br />
No, quests aren't supported by Sony.  Not like they were before.  The Kunark era was the beginning and the end of great quests.  now it's simply go kill Million_HP_Mob_03 with your guild and loot items and wait for respawn.  Or camp a rare spawn mob for 57 hours straight and hope he pops at the designated time and hope that after you killed him he drops the item that is his rare loot which has a 2% chance to drop.  <br />
<br />
Beyond a shadow of a doubt the 6-% unfound stuff is like everyone has said thus far...  they are broken with no chance of repair.<br />
<br />
Hell sony wont even fix greenmist and SK epic since the last patch and hoiw they hurt the user rather trhen heal but they can waste time trying to fix lame ass run animations that no one cared if ever were implimented to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Rusty two hander from the Troll guild. I finally banked mine at lvl 54 but I still hold it dear.<br />
<br />
An interesting thing to note. Upon hailing him after completing the quest, he gave it to me again !<br />
<br />
Just in case, I tried it 19 more times.....and got 19 more rusty 2 handers !<br />
<br />
Clearly they put vision into this quest. As people grew in levels since 1999 when I first did this quest, they foresaw people would move beyond level 3, and that they would someday lose a corpse carrying the weapon, but would be able to get another !<br />
<br />
A visionary Troll SK weapon quest that I cherish to this day.<br />
<br />
As I type this I find myself remembering Absor posted that he saw no foul with a race losing a home city, and I am filled with an understanding he likely based his reasoning on this previous dev favoritism for Trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was hoping that someday sony will publish a book with all of the quests listed.  No one ever solved the original paladin avenger quest and they had to redo it (no doubt cuz it was broken, imo.)  I havent seen Prince Kyrmt Keroppi in Lake Rathetear since then and I really want to know if my hunch is right that he was part of that quest.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday they will publish such a book.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, LDoN is coming. I can see real potential to bring back the quest as a way of life in EQ. Am I holding my breath? Uh, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The nurga revamp offers some new quests there is a ring event that lest you ste slaves free, the slaves then respawn in loio, maybe othere locations too, once they are free and give out quests involving nurga.

At least the pet they get doesn't turn on them and hurt them instead of the mob.<br />

The game should be called EverBroken. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>hardcoredummy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are we playing the same games?  What games are you guys playing that questing were more popular or better in the past than it is now?  I've started playing Everquest DAY 1... i don't remember the exact day, but it was in March of 99.  Might have been a Tuesday i believe.  I remember the first day actually, logging into EQ, not knowing what to do... wandered around Felwithe for literally an hour, and thought it was cool as hell.  Then walking out of Felwithe, and seeing literally hundreds and hundreds of newbies, running around killing stuff.  It was unreal seeing hundreds of other players in the same game (and back then corpses lasted for days at a time, so imagine the lag from thousands of corpses on the ground).<br />
<br />
But back to questing... EQ started out with VERY little questing.  Heck, i don't even remember any questing back then.  The very first quests i recall of any value were the class specific armor, when they took rubicite out of Cazic.  Were those the days you guys are talking about?<br />
<br />
What exact time period were questing so much better than today?  If anything, i think questing today is much better than it has ever been.   What exactly was better in the past that's not available today?  Or what is it today that's ruined the quests of the past?<br />
<br />
it's no longer EverQuest. It's EverPound uber mob for any decent item worth the effort. Quests anymore dont reward squat worth keeping because hence rewards can be replaced quickly with a small raid.  <br />
<br />
It has ALWAYS been like this... the only time it wasn't, was one there was only a single magical armor available in the game (after they took out rubicite).... well, aside from the occasional drop like mithril bp.  Do we really want to go back to that era?<br />
<br />
Of course rewards can be replaced with raid forces.  There are multiple ways of obtaining items in this game.  Either you find a drop, quest/tradeskill it, buy it, or raid for it.  Hmmm which should produce the best results?  Something that a single person can do, or one that requires a group raid effort?  hmmmmmm<br />
<br />
Certainly, the glory days of the quest are in the past for this game, as the epics grow increasingly obsolete and the devs eschew quested content for big fat raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whine whine whine.  That's the nature of EVERquest.  It's always a progressive thing.  There is nothing in this game that you can obtain that will be forever the best item... and this includes epics.  You may want this game to be static with no further progression, but that's not what i want.  No, i don't have the SK epic... i do have the chanter epic.  3 months of work, and you know how long i had it and it was useful? exactly 1 week, before i looted the C3 wand from VT.  After that, i banked it.  Do you hear me whining?  Um no, because i couldn't have foreseen that i would have gotten better so quickly.  But i'm glad something better did fall into my lap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darknyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">still, quests are becoming obsolete... because instead of trying to &quot;SOLVE&quot; anything... we simply look it up on a spoiler site and break it down into easy step-by-step no storyline hand-ins...<br />
<br />
is that good? depends on what you want... easy items, or content...<br />
<br />
IMHO, there needs to be more &quot;interesting&quot; quests... something that might be more random than just, hand in this, hand in this, kill this, hand in this... get/loot item...<br />
<br />
big monster raids are fun, but not everybody can guild themselves into Vex Thal or the Elemental Planes... and it leaves some of the more casual players, (like myself) to wish for some more interaction that doesn't require a billion people or 400+ hours...<br />
<br />
My heart raced through the Crusader's Khukri Quest... but a full week camping for one piece for the Hero Khukri's is just wrong... making quests difficult and rewarding is probably the hardest thing... difficult + rewarding sometimes = fun... but long + tedious does not always = fun, and in most cases isn't even rewarding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">so, <br />
<br />
is it the quests have some goofy initial text that no one has figured out, or is it that the majority of players dont give a whip about quests and would rather kill?<br />
<br />
i know i fall into the 2nd category...are there alot of people really working hard on quests?<br />
<br />
i spent some time in a guild with vaslin (safehouse) and he was always excited about quests, but he is one of the very few i can think of who were.<br />

<br />
But if they did, I'd be willing to bet the word &quot;broken&quot; would cover alot of ground.<br />
<br />
I still randomly spam npc's from time to time for the hell of it, haven't found a crap in 4 years.<br />
<br />
If there are any unbroken ones with obscure initial text, you'd think they'd try to point it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The problem is mudflation renders a quest reward to obsolite statis in an expansion or 2.  Why do you epic which can take months of work, when you can go farm for 5 hours and buy a more damage weapon?<br />
<br />
The problem with quests are they are worth it at the time, but becomes less worth it as new and more uber items start to trickle down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know I for one really want to see more Greenmist, Dain Rings, Shawl type quests. I don't mind them being time consuming if they are interesting. I loved the storyline for the GM. I thnk Vezax hit the nail on the head though, how quests become obsolete. That said i would like to see Verant perhaps add on to quests. give them reasons to upgrade etc. I mean i was dissapointed getting my GM and then Luclin comes out and for a simple day of hunting in SSRA you get weapons that compare nearly as good. I mean in lore the GM is the most feared weapon to the Snakes, I mean the Mist is what drove them out and forced them to live in a vacuum for protection. Anyone else feel the same way ?<br />
<br />
I am hoping this bonding gear coming out with LDoN helps with some of this kind of upgrading , maybe DPS enhancement not just stats.<br />
<br />
Also more quests like Dain ring where you gain good gear from doing the quest. IE Narandi's Crown, Drakkel Dire Wolf Claws, etc..<br />

I would, however, like to do quest. There are many kids that play EQ, simple powergamers, that think getting 72 ppl to zerg some mob is fun and and they deserve ubber loot for that. The thing is, it is more economical for SoE to catter to these needs, as there are a lot of players who like to show big numbers on a screen, more than actually 'play' an RPG. But, more &amp; more folk are going this route, do to those rewards, and who can blame them? Get a rusty from a tedious camp &amp; three event quest, or couple with 72 ppl week after week and get an item you *might* be able to use to kill a mob solo or in a small group? I dunno...they really need to make the quest less obscure &amp; more rewarding, but that ain't where the money is I guess. =/</div></div><hr />

When I rolled up Zaith, I found a fire brand forge weapon quest in Lava Storm. Quest was removed. What dumb idea. Newbies of every race and class could get a magic weapon and something they could sell for spells or what have you.<br />
<br />
They should have just stopped expansions at Kunark. EQ was EQ back then. Since SOE took over, its become more about $$$ than the game actually being fun. I dont know why they even call it EverQuest. When SOe took over they should have just made it a sequel with the new expansions. Atleast let the Verant guys keep building on EQ. Could have changed the name to NeverQuest.<br />
