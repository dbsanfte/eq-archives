<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sallar909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read all the other post about him and just have two easy questions:<br />
<br />
1: Is he Slowable?<br />
<br />
2: Any idea of the AE range, can cleric/shm/casters be safetly oor of it and still be within range to heal/nuke?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he is honestly not bad at all, had 2 clerics 2 druids healing tank + RT and MGBing for the raid. I tried to slow boxing the shaman with every kind of debuff and slow including Nihil and no go. He might be just resisted me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apokx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did Falmont last night,AE was doing over 1k,was partially slowable(shaman had alot of resists) His melee is weak,and the AE only hurts if the fight goes on for a long time.<br />
<br />
One warrior/knight for MA/RT and alot of dps.<br />
He is not hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killed him today and he spawned a chest when he died.  Chest dropped <br />

pretty nice for the ease of the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">seems pretty gimp... ae is kinda mean, but less hp than most elemental mobs, so despite pretty decent max hit and the manadrain, he's still pretty easy.<br />
<br />
They need to fix chest spawning though, I've yet to see one spawn in dozens of epic kills with the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vandil_TM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For all us Non- Ele uber peeps i went after him last night twice....i went with 28 people 5 cleric's and alot of casters... Tanks were 10.5k Warrior, 10k Warrior and a 9.5k SK (me)  Basicly the thing i did wrong was to many casters =P the AOE raped us even with 400 resists most werent resisting it.  We had a bard in the clerics and the Tanks groups and it helped a little but not ehough once AOE hit a few times Clerics couldnt keep up heals it was all over.... As for Low melee yeha hes pretty sad but if ur a non ele guild going in there u need to bring like 30 strait DPS melee's such as monk bst ect... We got him to 60% twice and we are going back tonight with alot more power. =)</div></div><hr />
