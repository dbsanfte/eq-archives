<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can the 4 SK's be duoed? Trioed? Im at that part now :p Just wondering how rough these guys are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They can be soloed... However, if pet pulled, they can easily be duo or trioed. I used my pet to seperate each, then logged my sk out and my shammy on, and trio'ed them with 65war, 65cler, 65shammy easily. It is best done during the day time, as wandering undead green adds are annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im talking about the Shadowknights in which you get their heads..Not the Paladins in Kith :) <br />
<br />
How tough are the SK's? Duoable? Trioable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, reading something before responding to it is totally unamerican.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I soloed the gnome, but 1-grouped the other 3. Once slowed, the mobs aren't tough, probably duoable, but it was nice having a 2nd, unboxed healer when the Ogre took several minutes to get slowed. You could probably trio it with sk, cleric, and chanter (or similar combination) - it would be worth trying anyway. I tried to trio basically all of the tougher epic mobs before resorting to asking for assistance. I couldn't do these guild, cause my slower is on the sk account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is there an order in which to kill them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no you can just do them<br />
<br />
id bring a whole group, they aren't that hard but they have a decent number of HP so it easier to have a groups worth of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The IO one as stated is soloblabe.<br />
<br />
Did Tim's Deep and OOT with me tanking and 2 druids healing (I have a willsapper for what that's worth).<br />
<br />
Did Swamp with a few more, failed first attempt with 2 druids then some other people logged on, prolly coulda done it with the druids if I had to. Was taking damage spikes cause my MR isn't perfect.<br />
<br />
8344hp 2094ac unbuffed, lvl 70, MR 253 (matters for deadly lifetap)<br />
<br />
As stated, they aren't hard, 3-4 people should do you fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did most with a grp to speed it up. I could have easily done them all with hydra cleric and one or two dps tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>runcade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did the TD one with a bard slowing and a 52 boxed cleric healing with a rog and another sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I duo'd the TD one to ~40% with my cleric bot .. got a lag spike and my CH cast and hit late .. so I died.  I came back with a group and dominated it.  If I tried it again two boxing I would've won most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did them with a group and it's almost annoying how easy they are.  The fights aren't very fun, they could have made these guys much tougher for one group.  The fights were all over in a minute, my necro never even got to recast any DoTs.  Getting to the mobs was much harder than the fights.<br />
<br />
The Iceclad fight was a snap with my Necro.<br />
<br />
So far the best epic fights I have done are the rogue ones.....lots of fun.  They did a good job coming up with some original encounters, with the exception of Renux 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree, the rogue fights are pretty fun.  Not exactly on topic, but sort of related, anybody know if the armor the final mob is wearing is truly artifact armor like the tag says, and there can only be one copy on each server?  If so, should be interesting to see that bitch spawn naked next time I fight her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>xikraazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just did IceClad SK with a low level Shammy for the occasinal heal if needed. He ended up just dotting him.<br />
<br />
Otherwise i kited him for 10 mins or so - 40% mana left full health<br />
<br />
Xikraazy - Druzzil Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IC: Me / Druid Bot Healing - Not in to that hole Running away from shit...<br />
OOT: Me / Druid Bot Healing<br />
TD: Me / Druid BoT healing and 67 ENC for Slow<br />
SoNH: Me, +10-15 people ? shit i dont know i was smashed at this point of the night (You know how Guild raids get on fridays) and the guild was doing Epic mobs i pointed them in the right direction...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Covi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">can these be killed any time during the quest? or do you have to complete previous steps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">can these be killed any time during the quest? or do you have to complete previous steps?<br />
<br />
Previous steps.....they are non agro until you hail them, requiring the proper quest flags.</div></div><hr />
