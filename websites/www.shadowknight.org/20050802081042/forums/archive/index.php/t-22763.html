<br />
Tell me more about the rune.  What was the name of the rune?  Any idea where to turn it in?  Was it NODROP?<br />

He gives an expedition into the nearby tunnels, which lead to instanced zones.  Mobs hit for 508 and did not have special attacks (unlike GoD).  They were fairly well spaced apart.  We reached the end of a path (took all left turns) and on our way back encountered repops, including two named.  One of them dropped a Minor Muramite Rune;  it was not LORE nor was it NO DROP.<br />
<br />
Back in Dranik's Scar, on the hill just prior to the south western corner, you'll find Karsor the Mad.  Hand him the Minor Muramite Rune and he'll give you a spell.  The received spell is NO DROP.  I've read that this system of runes is such that we will never receive the same spell twice.  How it actually works I do not know.</div></div><hr />

Now to get to lvl 68...damn exp is slow, but I kinda like it. ;)</div></div><hr />

We had to kill them at least once for the named to spawn.  The actual mechanics, the pattern of this expedetion will be figured out eventually.  Right now all I have are hypotheses.<br />
<br />
* Adventures could be similar to LDoN adventures where you need to kill a certain number of mobs before a named will actually spawn.<br />
<br />
* Named mobs could be present when you first enter the zone or can repop from any mob.<br />

Also, I received the spell Dark Constriction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5322&amp;source=Live).  Does everyone receive that spell when turning in a Minor Muramite Rune or do we receive a random level 66-67 spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We figured out the exact pattern for one of the Grand Historian expeditions.  This is for the one the has the name Murkwater in it (can't remember the names of the expeditions offhand but it's always the leftmost cave when facing the caves).<br />
<br />
There are two PH's in that expedition, one is a rat and one is a bat.  They are named a hideous rat and a tatterwing bat.  These are PH's for Scuttling Darkrat and Frenetic Cavebat.  These named are never up until you kill the PH's first.  No other bat or rat is a PH for these two named.  Now there MIGHT also be a murkwater named but we've never seen it.  But the attractive thing about these two are that the rat and bat are one tunnel apart, with one cave connecting them.  You can clear back and forth between these two and pharm both nameds.  Drops muramite rune, lesser muramite rune and minor muramite rune, plus mnk/bst staff, caster mask, caster range item, melee ring... all droppable although none of which are uber but not shabby (staff is 50/41 w/105 hp I think) either.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
