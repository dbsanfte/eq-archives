<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, probably not the right place for this, but just a &quot;little&quot; excited and semi-gloating, but I was lucky enough to cook me up a chicken sandwich on Friday night! Stormfeather style! Woohoo!<br />
<br />
For all those interested, SF died at 10pm CST on BB on Friday. And using times given to me by a guy in the zone, I can vouch for a 8.5 hour spawn time for Lodi.<br />
<br />
Man, I was actually shaking when I saw the bird...I even changed my face to have an eyepatch on it now! HARRRRRR! ;)</div></div><hr />

I am a lot sexier to the females than those 'other' SKs! :P</div></div><hr />
