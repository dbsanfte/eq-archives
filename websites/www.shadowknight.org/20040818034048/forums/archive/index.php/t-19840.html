<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BobTheIksar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at the Twilight Sea armor, and since I'm near the level I can start it (I'm 36) I was wondering if anyone knows of a guide to getting it (the SK armor of course).  Being on the relatively new Mac server everything in the Bazaar is obscenely expensive, and very little good stuff is in there (all the high levels are still getting it).  So, does anyone know of a guide to getting it all (or most of it?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't bother.   By the time you have collected all the pieces to make the full set, you will be 65:P   There is very cheap stuff available elsewhere, that is better.<br />
<br />
Unless of course you enjoy long drawn out quests:  if so, more power to you:)<br />
<br />
To attempt to provide the information, The Ranger's Glade had a list of all the luclin Quest armor drops at one point.  May be worth a look.  Not sure if they still have it up or not, its been a year or two since I read anything there.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try Allakhazam (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=133). It has all the quests listed, by i have to agree, Twilight Armor isnt all that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of the twilight sea armor is ~ darkforge or worse then it.<br />
<br />
If you must quest a set of armor, go Dark Forge. It will be, easier, faster, and more rewarding.<br />
<br />
Saddly for just a few 100 pp a slot you can find much much better then even DF though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had 2 pieces of Darkened Knight's a while back.  The bracer and the pauldrons.  Basically I was too lazy to quest a second DF bracer and there were no DF pauldrons.  The turn in NPC's were KOS to me in Twilight, I had to have a friend do the turn in's for me which is okay since it's tradeable.  I looked up what the items were for that I had been picking up EXP ing in Scarlet Desert and found they were used in armor quests.  Just go to Item Lookup on Alla's and look for Darkened Knight.  That'll tell you all the parts you need for which piece if you have all these pieces lying around and want this armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the same thing.  Because of faction issues with Katta quest NPC's (how stupid is it that they make the NPCs who give SK armor KOS to SK's?) and the relative rarity of the drops, combined with the fact that for many of the turn-in items, the mobs that drop them are a bit... rough... for the level, it's just not a great set to quest.  Stick with Darkforge and pick up what you can as you earn plat and level.  I've known level 60's who were still wearing a few pieces of Darkforge.  There's no shame in keeping it until you can reasonably pick up something better, and the Twilight quests simply are not reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naaklum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They dropped the ball when they did this quest.  Lemme first say that I did the ENTIRE noob armor and weapon quest w/my sk, and it took 3 weeks.  I also did the ENTIRE DF armor quest, which took about 2 weeks, and was much more rewarding IMO.  I finished noob quest at level 15, and had started at level 5.   I started DF at 30 and finished at about 34 I think.  I immediately started the TS armor quest after DF and by the time I had about 2/3 of the pieces, I had made enough plat selling stupid mushrooms to buy better stuff in the bazaar, and I think I was level 42 when I gave up.  I don't think you could solo this quest at the level that you could use the armor at, no way, no how.  Anyways I still have all that crap for the TS armor sitting on a mule, and NO ONE will buy the crap.  For the 8 levels I was working on it I was only able to actually make the boots and one bracer, and that included buying many of the quest pieces that I found for sale in the bazaar at 50-100pp each.  This quest was THE biggest waste of time for me in the game by far and away.</div></div><hr />

His name is BobtheIksar and I didn't think Iksar could wear the darkforge.<br />

The Twilight armors get dissed because of thier insane time sink with a reward that is not awesome.  Best bet is get friend groups some of the mobs and bazaar camp for the pieces.  When put all togehter this isn't an awful set.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />
