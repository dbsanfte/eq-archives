That was long but it is just combining MC and Shroud of Death into 1 buff with longer duration and better resist check. SA would only effect the Damage component of the buff.<br />
<br />
So with SA 3 this buff proc would do 150 damage to target, Heal you for 150 hit points and give you 100 mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brael: <br />
<br />
Some interesting spells there bro.<br />
<br />
Aura of Shadow:  hot if it was -30 to all resists +30 all resists  6.0 minute duration Group Resist Check at -200 DR or Unresistable.<br />
<br />
Similar to how our old Torrent of XXXX spells are. Now if you ask me, this is how Aura of Darkness should have been coded in first place but would have been too powerful for 61, so knock it down to -15 all/+15 all.<br />
<br />
Then this spell would have been actually used lol. As it stands this spell is worthless.<br />
<br />
Spear of Bertox:<br />
<br />
Really would kill to see some -DR checks our spears.<br />
<br />
Shroud of the Vampire:<br />
<br />
Any new Self buff proc we get should have the following regardless of type of buff proc or damage.<br />
1) Resist check set to -500 or Unresistable<br />
2) Range set to at least 100.<br />
3) Duration of Self Buff Proc = 2.5 hours<br />
<br />
Man rebuffing every 20mins, hell even 1 hour is annoying as fuck.<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for the hits off the crak pipe bro, who's turn next??????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't mind seeing a line of cold-based nukes similar to our spears so that we could actually use some DD against disease-immune mobs which seem to be more and more common these days.<br />
<br />
Maybe a cool undead illusion spell other than lame skellies all day, something to make us &quot;dreadfull&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though I have to admit, I would just be happy if they fixed the skelly (and other) illusions that overwrite my Ultravision with lame Infravision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice spell ideas. Here some thoughts I have on a few of them.<br />
<br />
Arua of Shadow should be -75dr to stay in with arua of darkness. Or scaled in line so that it is easier to land then arua of darkness.<br />
<br />
Spear of bertox should have a 0.5 sec casting time, same as other spears.<br />
<br />
Minion of the warlord should probably have more hp. I'm pretty invoke death already has 2k hp(i might be wrong).<br />
<br />
Improved deathpeace should be 0.5 casting or somewhere around there. <br />
<br />
I would also like to see us get the upgrade to disease dot debuffer and are fire based dot. Be it in the necro line or a new one created.<br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Inquestion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Brael in that we need our OWN spells.<br />
Not lower level necro spells, like having our own pet.<br />
What I want to see most are DPS spells such as fast acting dots, a new MC, a new DoT lifetap, and a new pet, tailored to a SK.<br />
<br />
Maybe a cool idea for a spell would be a fast cast spell that takes hp from our pet and gives it to us. Don't know, maybe not that great an idea, but I hate tapping to get HP back while off tanking as it can break mez. Maybe it could offset the fact that pallies can heal themselves or another for 900+ without breaking mez while we would have to break a mez to heal ourselves for 500+.<br />
<br />
Though if we needed our pets out all the time, I'd hate to see a SK turn into a weak beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gaxx, 2.5 hours would be nice I'll admit, but to be honest I would be happy with just 1 hour if for no other reason than it wouldn't fuck with my manapool as much when I'm switching between the two semi often.  Didn't list the rest check for the proc buff, but ya it should be -500 as well.  Spears don't really need some resist mods in them, actually I think they would be a bit too good if they had them.  The reason the debuffing part is lower on this resist tap is the same as the reason for Aura of Darkness.  They don't want to consider SK's also when creating mob resists.<br />
Darkquark is next for the crackpipe hit btw, but I think he already had a few hits before us.<br />
<br />
Sithanthor, the reason I stayed away from .5 sec cast spells is the &quot;Spell recovery not met&quot; error, it happens with 1 sec cast spells occasionally but its 100x more common with .5 cast spells, its a simple solution to fix it.  Aura of Darkness has no resist mod if I remember right, an upgrade wouldn't really need one either.  Our current pet has 1750 hp, the one before that had 1600, a 250 hp upgrade in pet hp isn't that bad.  I care more about the pet being able to heal up from an occasional damage shield or a couple of riposte hits than its total HP anyways.<br />
<br />
Inquestion, we've gotten our own spells since Velious for the most part.  In some cases theres no need to make a new spell for us with the same functionality as something else so we might as well share that spell (sacrifice, res, pet haste, ignite blood, conjure corpse, etc) I'm not a fan of ripping off Necro spells since I believe we're our own class now and not a Warrior/Necro mix so that means not getting their exact spells, in some cases however it's just easier.  The main reason I want our own pet is because lower level necro pets are too low level to land lifetap procs on exp mobs, and to be quite honest asking Clerics, Paladins, Druids, etc... to heal my pet every 20 min is a pain in the ass.  The other reason I want our own pet is so the casting time could be lowered and the DPS it puts out customized instead of looking for the closest spell to what I would like us to have and going with it.  The idea behind the new DoT tap I suggested is the same.  I would rather get a 1.5-2.0 cast DoT tap thats a bit weaker than Vexing Moridina than getting Vex and casting its ungodly long cast time like the case with Bond of Death is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A cripple like tap.  Basically something that reduces mobs dex/ac and give it to us.   <br />
<br />
Also want a combined cloak/SoC, I hate rebuffing =P.  <br />
<br />
A pet that can fd would be nice too, but that would probably way over trivialize pulling.  <br />
<br />
A better undead lull.  <br />
<br />
A life tap damage shield.  Make it targetitible, give necros a better version.<br />
<br />
a 55 + fear.     <br />
<br />
A AE hate spell, like terrors, only useful when mob is in melee range (HA~!)<br />
<br />
New cool spells lines like zeefers.  I swear sometimes sony gets some good ideas.<br />
<br />
PS give warriors our voice line, I dont want it or need it, and it just takes up my spell gems =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would like to see a fear that works on 55+ mobs.... perhaps a spell that fears up to level 60 mobs.

/Trolleze off<br />
<br />
I saw someone mention an illusion for us. Although my SK is only 52, the best thing I've seen so far is the Guardians next to Terris's zone-in. If not an illusion, then let SKs branch off the Necro line a bit more with that look for our pets at 65 (or above, if they boost the cap in the next expansion).<br />
<br />
A line of cold-based DD would be awesome too, as would something like Screaming Terror (or something similar for CC). Pallies get Soothe/Pacify, Rangers get Harmony/Harmony of Nature...I could be missing something, but don't ours only work on undead?<br />
<br />
Now, while HT is nice, an AA (or even spell) similar to Slay would be a decent addition, even if it only worked like two spells I loved on a MUD called Nightmare (way back before it was ruined).<br />
<br />
Rapture could be cast by both Monks (a cross between EQ monks and a cleric, i.e. the &quot;Friar Tuck&quot; type) and Kataans (a bit like an SK, but could also backstab, dual wield, and were masters of projectile weaps i.e. darts, etc.). This spell damaged all in an area, drained/destroyed mana of both caster and mobs, and did more damage to NPCs and players of evil alignment.<br />
<br />
Demonfire was similar. Only used by Kataans, it drained/destroyed mana, AE damage, and not only did more damage to those of good alignment, it actually lowered their alignment to the point that after a few casts, you could work them over with Rapture. You couldn't drop someone below neutral though :( <br />
<br />
They could even call it &quot;Anti-Piety&quot; for all I care, hehe. Well...ok...maybe not THAT...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Super Improved invis to everything.  Spell sos.<br />

We have monk abilities as a spell line that takes time to cast, I see no reason we shouldn't have rogue evasive abilities as a spell that takes time to cast...and has the same issues as spell feign death compared to skill feign death.</div></div><hr />

Never seen an Enchanters spell list have you?  If we got any lower aggroing spells they should be self only btw.  Just to extend on the theme of our already rather impressive aggro control abilities.  Speaking of which, wow thats my main reason for wanting SCS activated!</div></div><hr />

AoD adds +30 to all resists though only for 1 min. Not worthless at all imo, even though the duration means frequent re-casting, which sucks. I use it all the time (on AoE-ing mobs which aren't disease immune anyway). I think the Aura of Shadow sounds like a great upgrade to one of our &quot;tap&quot; spells I actually find useful on a regular basis (yeah I've been slacking on resist gear...).</div></div><hr />

Spear of Suffering Recourse<br />
1: Increase Hitpoints when cast by 1500 (level 65) - 2000 (level 70)<br />
<br />
First, let me explain the purpose behind the spell. It's a 'Save your ass' type of spell. It has a fairly lengthy recast, 2 minutes (which may be too short, 5 may be better). It is also critable, I'm thinking this may be possible via Theft of Life AA. <br />
<br />
The reason for the recourse is 1) no aggro, 2) no lifetap/DD component 3) Self only.<br />
<br />
Just through day to day activity and raids, I would personally have this spell memmed at all times.<br />
 <br />
___<br />
<br />
I also want to see a new snare put in without a DoT component. Something with a ~15ish second recast that has two functions, (1) a small lifetap (maybe 250) and (2) a fixed duration snare about ~3-5 minutes. Fairly mana intensive, about 350-400ish mana. Mainly a CC tool. Explanation: &quot;You command the fallen to subdue Target,&quot; &quot;Target's movements are hindered by the grasp of undeath.&quot; Probably Level 66 with some lower level versions introduced with reduced efficiency/efficacy.<br />
<br />
___<br />
<br />
Also been thinking along the lines of a new Asystole type spell but with a few surprises, but I haven't given it enough thought... needless to say it would end up with target's heart exploding in their chest. It's sort of a splurt like dot, but not really. More of a 'mega-tick' dot. Think, delayed blast fireball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Silence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">that would be pretty damn sweet ive always wanted a nice non dot snare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Really interesting ideas furor.  Pretty outside the box.<br />
<br />
I do think the 1st one seems a bit overpowered.  Even with a prohibitively long casting time, the mana cost seems way too low for for something in the ball park of what the 58 shammy heal, healing power wise, and estentially an unresistible spell.   I guess its level of over/under poweredness of such a spellwould have to put up against other caster 65+ spells (If they do decide to expand levels).<br />
<br />
If anything it would give great &quot;you have crit for (2) damage&quot; screen shots =P<br />
<br />
Id love to see more high damage per tic dots, seeing that blood of hate is one of my favorite spells.<br />
<br />
As for the snare, Id actually like to see its life tap component reduced to the point where it could noway get a mob to summoning mode.  But maybe that would be the balancing factor of the spell i guess.  Sometimes using it will get you summoned, sometimes it wont.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of anything the snare would be used for honestly.  Atleast not in a raid situation that is.  Theres Clinging for aggro and Festering for taunting.  I'm guessing the lifetap component is a dd on it?  If you're going out of the way to get a non damage snare you might as well just make it a healing recourse instead of a lifetap.  Unless you're going to use the snare on charmed pets or somewhat fast moving mezzable mobs I can't see where you would be using it.<br />

<br />
Yea, that's pretty much one of two things the spell would be used for, raiding crowd control and some 'special' pulls.<br />
<br />
The Asystole type spell I mentioned would be something along the lines of &quot;Heart Explosion&quot; based on a megatick. Time undecided but it would basically do 'nothing' for 24-36 ticks and then have two effects, i.e. At 36 seconds (6 ticks) it would 'destroy the the mob from the inside out' in two massive chunks. One 1200 point burst + 1500 hate and then 24 seconds later another 1200 point burst + 1500 hate.<br />
<br />
It would have its... uses :)<br />
<br />
Naturally, longer than normal recast for a spell like this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">While I can see wanting to augment the darkness lines with a no-damage snare for several reasons, mostly for increased safety on mezzed mobs, and for agg-kiting summoning mobs, I feel that it shouldn't be given to SK/Necro. The damage portion of our snare does very little damage, in the comparative sense, as does the damage portion of the higher necro snares. Rather, it functions as a kind of limiter on what we can accomplish with those snares. Yes, it's a small limitation, but it's also one that's been relatively well balanced since the beginning. <br />
<br />
I do like the idea of a delayed effect spell. However, I'd like to see one where the maximum effectiveness happens in a timespan of about 30-36 seconds: I expect the next expansion will reflect LDON kill speeds. Also, neither SKs or rangers have curse-counter LDON dots, this would make an excellent curse.<br />
<br />
However, I think I'd like a bit more than just damage / healing out of our spells. Our debuff line is effectively stripped from us at high levels, and was basically meaningless in the first place in terms of effect on the mob. Giving us minor, but potentially meaningful debuffs could be interesting. Therefore, I would suggest:<br />
Blinding Fury: <br />
Ugly mana cost(600+, essentially raid target only), enormous aggro, high resist spell that reduces a targets accuracy. I Would suggest that this reduce mob DPS by about 5-10%: Significant, but nowhere near the ultradeath that is 75% slow. <br />
Soul Shatter:<br />
Again, ugly mana cost, high aggro, high resist spell to reduce target combat effects.<br />
Confusing Shadows:<br />
Introduce 10-15% spell failure rate on target.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High mana cost and mana dot reduces our caster abilities when active.... most non-uber SK's are gonna be pretty close to oom by the time this wears off... sooner if they burned their mana early.  30% gives it lesser efficiency than warriors, and shorter duration.  Also, wears off after 300k melee damage is taken- fine for many mobs, but if the mob has really sick dps, it's gonna wear sooner.  Giving it a relatively costly component means you won't be casting it in exp groups very often.  Values can of course be tweaked.  In addition, we have to give up a spell slot to keep it ready.<br />
<br />
Throwing in a nasty damage shield just seemed like a very shadowknight thing to do :cool:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Bleh, was tired when I wrote that reply.  I meant to say Clinging for aggro and Festering for snare.  The pulls could be accomplished just as well with Festering unless theres one in LDoN I'm not aware of yet (couple raids I haven't tried or reached the end of still) that requires a non damage snare but I can't imagine that situation right now, espically when a Ranger could just overwrite it anyways.  Darkness doesn't provide enough damage to place a mob into summon mode, it just makes it unmezzable which in my expierence so far is only an issue on Rathe, and I doubt you're referring to that encounter when thinking of the spells use in pulling situations.  Snare pulling with a tagger maybe?  That damage from Festering still shouldn't be an issue for you though if that's what you were thinking of.  Getting a couple of snared mobs together and being able to fd them off to add more to the pile without dot ticks reaggroing you?<br />
<br />
Really like that idea of a delayed spell though, good way to get in a bit more burst damage at certain points on mobs if you're capable of timing it well.  For some reason I'm seeing it more as an ability mob's would get for ae's instead though.  It's a good idea however.<br />

Also would like to see a DOT/lifetap with group heal and less than a minute for duration.  It would increase agro but just accept it, in a group with anything other than a WAR, given nearly the same levels, the SK is the Tank, just easier to hold agro.  It is like the necro Auspice (300mana = 30/tic dot and heal each member of the group for 30/tic for 9 tics)line, not exactly gonna make or break a fight but nice still, another option for healing using the lifetap and as a bonus healing the group at the same time.

I would like to see /pet hold beeing std for an sk not an aa ability my sk is 65 so i have pet hold available to me but.......In most group situatuations untill it was available i couldn't use my pet because he would run to my (aledged aid por little thing thinks he helping) mid pull / FD. I would assume the same goes for most SK. /pet hold would at least enable use of our gimpy pet all of the time.<br />
<br />
Like many that have posted i would like to see more hp and dps from our pets,  and an increase in our usefulness to a group via better debuffs and possibly even combining them into one buff slot so we are not overbuffing the group making HoT spells unlandable.<br />
<br />
As another idea possibly allowing our pets lifetaps to mend our Hp when pet is full health and vice versa would  mean many procs would not be waisted and help keep us and ole boney  standing longer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Doesn't seem to be extra levels planned for this immediate expansion, but arcane spells are on the feature list. So given that levels are staying the same it seems spells should concentrate on broadening our current spell abilities or refining them. So...<br />
<br />
Sk pet focus spells. All levels. Boost sustained dps in experience groups a bit.<br />
<br />
Sk Bond of Death (as opposed to actual borrowed from necros BoD). 65. A more melee-friendly, faster-casting and acting version of Bond of Death. Boost self-healing a bit in experience groups and also raids.<br />
<br />
Mental Corruption upgrade. 62. Slightly more damage, keep mana the same, but a whole lot longer lasting (like Shroud of Chaos).<br />
<br />
Blood of Fear. 54. Intermediate between Blood of Hate and Blood of Pain for the mid-50's crowd.<br />
<br />
Call of Blood. 64. 16hp for 100ATK. Shamelessly ripped off Brael when the hp/atk spells were mooted. A higher grade one still seems like it should fit.<br />
<br />
Higher undead lull. Not my personal cuppah, but i can see why people say a higher one ought to be around, so i thought i'd list it.<br />
<br />
Debuff-DoT. Many moons ago Lejina once suggested a dot which also contained a dex-debuff to reduce rampage. I always liked that idea since debuffing of some sort seems like it's part of the sk concept but we don't do so much of it. Could be an asystole upgrade just as well.<br />
<br />
Fix Terrors so they work like Fear does now and then there never has to be fits of vapors about aggro being tampered with here again.<br />

That is about all I can hope for without a level increase to improve our existing spell lines. Some people have mentioned a pet focus spell, but I would prefer an AA which increased our pets lvl by 20 or so, just enough so that its lifetap proc will land on anything we fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>evilmite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">New spells I would like to see in nor particular order.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a health to health transfer like was posted..750-1khp to another Player would be nice. If you want to make it fair add a stunn effect to it..say 2 or 3 ticks something that you would not use on a raid... like 250hp per tick transfered to target but during the proccess you are stunned. Not only that..each tick would needed to be checked for our exception heal check(we can exception heal with our lvl 15 spell I have done it)<br />
<br />
A pet Heal spell...for use it should just be a complete heal spell for our pet since there is NOWAY for it to take a lightblue mob on it's on nor will it ever be a tank in ANY group....even with buffs out the wazoo he will never be more then a Dot to us. Give us a faily simple spell..300mana CH pet 8sec cast time....<br />
<br />
A mana lifetap dot would be nice but most likely unbalancing.<br />
<br />
I think they should make any of our Undead illusion spells cause our Unholy steeds to become undead and skeleton as well...that would rock!!! just add that to our horses.<br />
<br />
I think we should get a Zombie or a ghoul as a pet instead of the skeleton.... we are GRAVELORDS right.....why not a Ghoul as a pet and give it the Root ability that ghouls have...One if we are tanking with it it is not like we will be able to back our pets off and effectivly DOT them but it MIGHT save the casters a hit or two if the mob does not resist the root plus it will distinguish us from necros........early lvls we are like necros with out spells and all but later on we are our OWN class spell like....make our pet different.<br />
<br />
I think they should give us a New Illsuion spell.....Just like our Pact of hate but make it a Vampire islluion, ADD Undead to our chracteristics(so undead dd's would hit us, as well as undead slows so no dueling necro's, make us immune to fear which we can be after all,  add a lifetap proc...maybe 100point or at least 75points, NO DOT but since we are undead we CAN NOT regen any health at all..this includes effects, clickies and spells.... so regen, protection of the nine, spirtual virgor and all of them have no effect on us, but mana does, we also gain 5mana per tick and it stacks with all mana spells. Also, since we are in vamp mode up our attack by say 100, ac by a little, hp's and our str/dex......Make this a combine nation of our cloak spells and an illsuion spell..... we can't use our horse  with this spell. This would freaking rock and would not make us overpowerfull... it could replace 4 or 5 spells like pact of hate, cloak of luclin, deathly temptation, arua of hate/pain and siphon str.<br />
<br />
Pet buffs......we need something besides pet haste. Let us add procs, debuffs, dot's, something to our pets so they aint just complete mellee and that lifetap ability. A pet buff proc that gives us something would be awesome... a 25point lifetap proc that gives it to use instead of the pet, mana proc same way. necros could get an upgrade where it effects the whole grouup.<br />
<br />
A hate type dot...like our terror line of spells but adds hate every tick and increases over time. <br />
<br />
How about Dot Proc buffs. Each proc does 200damage but over 4 ticks, proc wait 6secs then 50damage, 50 50 50. would be the same as some of these other dd procs but without the crit's... not to mention it woudl take time for it to effect the mob.<br />
<br />
How about an undead charm spell....works on mobs 45 and under...Not dire charm jsut regular charm<br />
<br />
I have several others but I will not post them..what do you all think?</div></div><hr />
