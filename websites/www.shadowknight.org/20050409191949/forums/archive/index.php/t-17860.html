<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Me will shows you da secrets bruddah, just send me a tell in game and i'll teach u's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woot okies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems simple enough -<br />
<br />
Run up, smackify, run away untill weapon timer is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How am I supposed to know when weapon timer is up lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Melee button would pop up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">O well now I feel idiotic lol, I just figured it out thnx guys dont harass me now lol...I thought jousting meant only when weapon timer was still coming up and u needed to time it perfectly...Hehehe...Guess it doesnt always have to be perfect...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone can run back and forth and joust..but the problem there is that the other person will smack you just as easily as you've smacked them..they key to joustin is to straif around and try to make'em miss ya while u smack them.  IT takes a lil gettin used to but once you're good at straifin and smackin, u can killz peeps dat are much better geared den u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iyyce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does SoW help with &quot;strafin&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>seizei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">autoattack off while you're running toward opponent, as you pass and strafe around, hit autoattack on.  Takes some finger dexterity to do all that at once.  Autoattack off right after so timer will be refreshed for the next pass.<br />
<br />
 I'm used to doing it with a rogue more... autoattack and backstab as you strafe around and past....  pretty sweet when you quad hit and double backstab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im guessing if you joust a good rogue youll get eated up aye? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No real need to joust a rogue... hit em with spells and keep at a distance, and make sure to have all your damage-shield spells / right clicks up.<br />
<br />
Make sure you keep facing them so they can't get a full backstab in - Chaotic Stab makes them harder in duels but a full damage backstab is a lot more dangerous.<br />
<br />
In general it's very hard for a SK to lose to a rogue unless the rogue is much better equipped than you.<br />
<br />
Which spells depend on their gear - usually you can tell by their guildtag or reputation... if you know their resists are good, just use low resist spells (ToI)... if you know they aren't uberly equipped, try to land a snare... once snared charge in and melee the hell out of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yea...no rogue should ever kill a sk..no non hybrid melee class should ever kill a sk either for that matter...warriors..rogues..monks..they all suck :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh pure melee = ignite blood+toi and joust every once in awhile if your bored :).</div></div><hr />
