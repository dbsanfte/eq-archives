<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Babaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">does anyone know where does spawn a mimic since revamp? i killed many chests and didnt get an key yet... also looking for a link to a new map of the hole btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Laymon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mimic = a chest. they just renamed them. <br />
getting the key is a bit hit and miss. you'll clear the chests 5 times and get nout then get 2 drop on the next clearing.<br />
<br />
As far as i know the hole hasn't physically changed in the revamp. ratman guards dont spawn in the jail area anymore, difficulty has been changed. just stuff like that.<br />
<br />
The map on eqatlas is a bit pants. check out the ones on www.eqmaps.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brildayr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">like the above post mimic = chest<br />
<br />
they spawn in the same place they always have, down in the city by the docks, in the basement of the bank.  Think there is a fake wall in the back of the bank, but not remembering for sure.<br />
<br />
ratman guard spawns just past the the docks, still in the city tho.  he's a roamer with a ratman inhabitant for a ph.</div></div><hr />
