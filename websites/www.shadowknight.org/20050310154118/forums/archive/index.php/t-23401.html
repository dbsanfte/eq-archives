<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fastest, cheapest, cash methods of getting tailoring to 100?<br />
<br />
All the guides are talking about velium spiderling silk and whatnot....<br />
<br />
tailoring is the bitch tradeskill, aint it...;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Friend of mine recommended going to the Karanas and slaughtering lions for a few days to get a couple hundred HQ Cat Pelts, and then make tailored quivers.  That'll get you to 115 or something skill, more then enough, and it's cheap.  It also only requires two ingredients, one of which you simply purchase from a vendor cheaply.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have the cash, HQ Cat Pelts tend to be around 40 plat each, at least on my server.<br />
<br />
-edit- Also, the velium silks aren't too hard to get in large numbers, from either Velketor's or Crystal Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I followed Chania's post on this site.<br />
<br />
Basically buy Crystalline Silk in the bazaar, combine to make swatches, then go to Abysmal and make masks with pattern and silver thread until 100. Fast and not too expensive.<br />
<br />
There is also a tradeskill quest that takes you to 50 or something, didn't bother doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went the swatch, leather/silk gear, backpacks, quiver route when I went through tailoring.<br />
<br />
You basically just camp the hell out of Karana killing spiders and lions for hours.  It's not very hard and doesn't really take that much time if you are trying to conserve cash.<br />
<br />
I think I was 115 finishing quivers in just a couple nights, farming all the pieces.  It doesn't really get time consuming until later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're really cheap, do 1-54 through the abysmal sea free skillup quest. Otherwise (or after that) just combine 2 x Mandrake Root (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1166) until 66 (costs around 3pp per root, vendorsold).<br />
After that I would do crystalline silk armor if I were you, which really only requires you to spend some time in crystal caverns slaughtering spiders. Much much much easier than running around at random in the karanas to kill kitties and hope for a hq pelt, and it'll take you to the skill required for the epic.<br />
<br />
Click me (http://www.eqtraders.com/search/search.php) and search for &quot;crystalline silk&quot; to get exact recipes.<br />
<br />
Myself, I'm at 187 and heading up... not something I'd recommend if you want to keep your sanity (or your bank account) though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another thing you could do is mass slaughter greyhoppers in Marus Seru... they almost always have either a greyhopper hide, or LQ hopper hide. The Greyhopper hides make greyhopper armor, trivial at 95, and are absolutely the cheapest thing you could possibly make. If you like farming... you could turn all the LQ pelts into padding and turn a profit if you want too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been working on Tailoring for a bit now but moreso because of the Prayer Shawls.<br />
What I did was basically follow How to Become a Mistress Tailor (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g110&amp;menustr=040110000000) guide from EQTraders.<br />
I avoided buying anything in Bazaar that I could farm myself to save cash.  The only overhead in that was my time.  There are some things that you might find are better bought when you weigh the cost against time spent, though.  If it's super-cheap then there are some time savings.<br />
<br />
As per the guide, I did Studded Masks which got me to ~56.  I had hunted the pelts in both East Karana and Nedaria's Landing, both zones have very good drop-rates for differing qualities.<br />
<br />
I did Cured Silk stuff up to ~84, which required Spider Silk which I got from Crag Spiders in East Karana.  (Save extra for later skillups)<br />
<br />
When I was making the crystalline Armour, I farmed the silks in Crystal Caverns.  Doesn't take too long to get a lot of them.  I did this to get skill from ~115 to ~126.<br />
<br />
From ~127-143(current) I have been farming in East Karana for Spider Silk off the Crag/Carrion Spiders and pelts off the numerous cats.  Last night I got about 144 silks in a little over an hour.  I was alone most of he time until a Druid showed up and obviously drops for me started to dwindle but were still rather frequent if I could find the mobs before the Druid did.<br />
The drop rate for HQ Cat Pelts here are very frequent which leads me to believe they have been adjusted.  The Spiders frequently drop 6 silks at a time, too.<br />
Ater making the Wu's stuff from the latter until ~158 I'll move on to farming for Superb Rockhopper hides and Acrylia until ~188.<br />
Unsure of what I'll do after that.<br />
<br />
If cash is not an issue, then buying rather than farming will save you a LOT of time but in a pretty hefty outlay of plat over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lenerien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My tailoring was at 119 and it was trival</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Abysmal Sea Quest to ~54, mandrake root to ~66, greyhoppers to 90s, crystalline silk to get over 100. Took about a day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Skill points to ~25 (or wherever the stupid guy told me I had to stop)<br />
<br />
Mandrake root to 66.<br />
<br />
Crystalline silk to 103.<br />
<br />
At 330 intelligence I was getting skill ups about every 2nd or 3rd combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they did in fact make the epic combine no fail though right? so a skill of 101 is sufficient for doing epic 1.5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bumluk Rayrspaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did mine at 102 with no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Skill points to ~25 (or wherever the stupid guy told me I had to stop)<br />
<br />
Mandrake root to 66.<br />
<br />
Crystalline silk to 103.<br />
<br />
At 330 intelligence I was getting skill ups about every 2nd or 3rd combine.<br />
<br />
FYI...<br />
2x Mandrake root = Woven Mandrake to 66 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1136&amp;menustr=035000000000)<br />
then Steel Boning + Woven Mandrake = Picnic Baskets to 76 (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1138&amp;menustr=)<br />
<br />
Just a friendly tip from a sukshaman that lurks your boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just did Mandrakes to 66, then went to SS the farmed CSilk and made Crysaline Silks till 100, Took me about 2-3 hours top to go from 0-100</div></div><hr />

Same here - piece of cake - 111 in tailoring in just a fairly short time. Took longer than I expected because I had to go back and look the thread up - silver thread, not silk thread lol.</div></div><hr />
