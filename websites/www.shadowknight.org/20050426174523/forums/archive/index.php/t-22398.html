<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dumpbush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is an FAQ, but as a non-Iksar SK (Eru in my case) what faction do I need and what's the best way to get it in order to get this series of quests going?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not answering this on account of it being answered at least 5 times on this board. Try search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow pls nael, why did you post at all then heh.  i'm posting to not respond to your post about his post, k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fuck you, hoser. You know you're in awe of my greatness. *Chuckles to himself, all the while crying inside*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dumpbush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Posts I saw talk about bone chips and explorer knives to raise faction. Explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, now you've asked a specific question, I'll help you out. There are two quests (you can look both up on alla's), one involving handing in four bonechips at a time to a non-KoS (I *think*) NPC in either FoB or LoIO near Cabilis, one involving talking to a Cabilis guard (so you must get to be non-KoS before you start this quest) where you hail him, say a few words, run halfway across LoIO and kill a tower full of mobs with 600 hp. Both of these quests will raise all Cabilis faction except for the necro faction.<br />
<br />
Now, there is also a third quest; the Veksar weapons quest. You turn in 4 of the steel (? ...... they crappy common weapons from veksar) weapons (they need to be the same.... so four 1HB weapons at once) to a non-KoS NPC on the shoreline of the big lake in LoIO.<br />
<br />
I got my faction by doing the veksar weapons quest, soloing mobs with weapons (I was level 65 with horrible gear), and buying any weapons that others had. Within about 3 days, I had 8 or so people farming weapons for me (because they were there farming named, and the weapons were dropping for them, and they had no use for them). I did this for about a week (would have been a lot shorter had I not taken a few day's break in that week), and this quest also gives you all Cabilis faction, sans necro. After turning in about 25 sets of weapons (of 4 each), my faction was doing fairly well. At this point, I did the explorer survival knives quest, for a day. I maxed my faction out with every faction in Cabilis except for the necromancers.<br />
<br />
The necromancer faction is very, very easy, as long as you have the level 64 or 58 (?) pet. Go to Warsliks Woods, and find the destroyed buildings that are full of bandits. Toss some mage summoned items on your pet if you want, find a spot in one of the buildings where 3 mobs will agro you without you doing anything (I found three such spots), and then AFK for a few hours. Do this for maybe 12 hours total while you sleep or while you're at work, and you'll have decent enough faction with the necromancers that they won't kill you; which is all you need.<br />
<br />
Once you've done all of that, your faction should be fine. If you want to cut down on some time, get an illusion: iksar potion, or else get a chanter to cast ikky illusion on you. It took me about 5 or 6 days total to get my faction to where it needed to be to do my Greenmist. I hope this helps.<br />
