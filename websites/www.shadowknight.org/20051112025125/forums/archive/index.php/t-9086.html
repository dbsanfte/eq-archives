<br />
The people I generally group with as Aurie are a 17 Monk, 19 Druid, and her.  I can't keep aggro off the monk without her FDing.  Aurie has been shown to take damage better than Kal, so how do I avoid this?<br />
<br />
My primary ideas were to cast Disease Cloud and Darkness right away, followed by ATK debuffs (Yes, my pansy L9 and 15 spells :p), then just firing away with Lifetap, punching Bash and Taunt.  For weaponry, I have a Crystallized Blade, a MoSS, and a Stalagterror spear (Fear those of us who are too stubborn to sit in the bazaar or vendor things..).  I can get a Throneblade Yak off of another character for her, but that doesn't get useful until 20. :p<br />
<br />
Suggestions, comments, or am I going to be shot as a paladin posting on a shadowknight board? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">synnoira</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ATK taps/debuffs have next to no taunt value. Lifetaps are low value too. Disease Cloud had it's aggro castrated ages ago. Stick to Clinging Darkness. Use it early and repeat a couple of times as necessary. <br />
It sounds like you are using an awful lot of mana per fight, cast the ATK tap once only when it fades, cast lifetaps only when you're getting into the bottom end of the red bar and the cleric is low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liabach</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">chain cast clinging darkness.  its fast cast, lowmana, and i still use it for agro at 60.  situationally the terrors are better agro, but only on mobs im tanking because no warrior came (warriors like to tank, and I'd rather watch them die than fight with them about it;-) )<br />
<br />
clinging darkness, even after you get the less resisted longer duration engulfing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this time us a fair one hander like a MoSS 19/29 with a sheild.  This is a better combination that most 2hs weapons at this level.  After 20 once your damage cap is removed and your double attack skill takes effect you will have an easier time holding agro.  Chain casting spells will help but your at the weakest point of the SKs life compared to the other classes.  Its hard to compete argo wise with someone dual weilding and double attacking when you only get one swing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this case I would just get the monk to back off occasionally so the aggro passes.  True that you will loose some dmg output on the monk, but at least he wont die.<br />
<br />
I was once told that even in melee, the closer to the target you are decides the aggro.  I'm not 100% convinced but as a 50 SK I can take aggro from 50+ BSing rogues and taunting warriors without using aggro spells just by getting closer to the mob.  Especially if the mob is rooted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dzenith</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like aooeaogaoo said, once you hit 20, your damage is going to increase significantly because it is currently capped and you aren't reaching your max damage.  The monk on the other hand is swinging much faster than you, so will be swinging more below the cap and thus will be doing a good deal more damage than you.  Like has been posted, casting clinging dark several times is a good taunter, even at higher levels.  However if you are still having a hard time don't sweat it until lvl 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stwongbad Soulkrush</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a quick question about the damage cap:  I always thought that you weren't able to hit for more than 29 on a swing until you reached lvl 20, but I was hitting for mid to high 30's from 15 on.  I even had a few low 40's.  I was wondering if the dmg cap might have been raised, or nerfed somehow.  I was using a MoSS at the time, with an atk of around 550 (I think) self buffed.  Can anyone confirm this?  Thanks in advance.<br />
