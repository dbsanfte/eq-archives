<br />
Thursday Jun 23rd Update<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
- New Augmentation Window is in. For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the augment sealer.<br />
<br />
- You no longer need a specific slot solvent to delete an augment. Any of the 3 will work and you delete your augment by selecting which augment to delete from the list. In the future there will only be one solvent to delete augments.<br />
<br />
- Augments also no show in the item display window which solvent is needed to remove them without destroying them. You will be able to remove your augment safely using the new window. These items should become available shortly. You will be able to remove your augment safely using the new window.<br />
<br />
- NPC debuff slots have been increased to 50. This mainly effects raid NPC's.<br />
<br />
- Players will now &quot;Pre-pay&quot; for benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br />
<br />
- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be &quot;Pre-pay&quot; (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br />
<br />
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected Benefit loadout, but will not be able to &quot;preview&quot; the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the Benefit will do when activated.<br />
<br />
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active, grey when they are not.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Monday Jun 28th Update<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet.<br />
<br />
- Tainted Axe of Hatred will now summon stacks of 20.<br />
<br />
- Various AA's fixed. Please continue to bug any an all related bugs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pets that can zone, I kind of like that.  I wonder if the &quot;real&quot; pet classes can suspend their pet and zone with it suspended, or if they have to get it out of storage first.

Hah, why must it be POK? You can avoid POK if lag is a problem for you. It can be at LDON camp, Natimbi, Barinbu safe spot, etc that cleric preferred to do group buffs OUTSIDE instanced zone that can suck with pet affinity. Now its SOLVED!!! We can summon our pet BEFORE we request a trial or an adventure and our party will BSS, HOV, SD, etc etc to our group PLUS our SK will receive FULL group buff this way if we have pet affinity skill up. Pet Affinity skill now had moved up in notch or 2 for its usefulness for SK, heck, for any pet classes. :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah very true. Lot of NPC skellies can see thru our invisible (not undead inv one) easily. Why can't our pet do the same?? That will be a BOON. I had to kill pet when I pulled in hard area cuz I needed COS to scout ahead and pull. With pet that can see inv. I can finally use pet and use /pet hold AND use COS or invisible spell to inv. myself to pull. That would be a nice upgrade too.<br />
<br />
Just pray to Innoruuk that we will get NICE SK pet upgrade post 65 instead of gay necro pet upgrade that its proc is 100% useless against our mob level cuz its level is way too low..

Several AA's are currently broken on test. One non AA issue that is also known and has been /bugged is that /alt activate 86 doesn't work and instead gives some message about a casting skill I dont currently have.<br />
<br />
Other ones that are currently broken and are known and bugged and being actively investigated are:<br />
<br />
Innate Enlightenment *Bugged* <br />
Run Speed AA's *Bugged* <br />
Enchanter: Animation Empathy *Bugged* <br />
Enchanter: Project Illusion - Dire charm issue *Bugged* <br />
Critial Spell AA's *Bugged*<br />
Stonewall *Bugged*<br />

These issues are being looked at and should be fixed lets hope without making it to live.</div></div><hr />

- Melee damage should be working correctly now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Pet classes have it good now at lower levels as well.  Pets aren't restricted in terms of buffs the way players are, but in the past finding a cleric to follow you to your level 30 exp camp and buff your pet was kinda tough.  Now you can head to PoK, get the pet buffed as much as you'd like, then head out to your exp camp and lay waste to it.  Beastlords and mages will be able to take super-buffed pets into low-level LDoNs.  I hope they don't put level-limits on pet buffs now.</div></div><hr />

You could quite possibly be the stupidest person I've ever seen on a message board.  See, this is the way things work in the real world, major fixes, like, say, making a code so the backflagging works correctly, take time, and probably lots of time.  They also require a certain number of people to do the job.  Minor fixes, like a zone line, or torches on the ground, don't take as much time, so they can knock many little changes in the time a big change or two comes around.  Now, I'm sure you're thinking, why not have the one or two people it takes to make the little changes go to the big change department and just ignore the unattainable dropped torches?  Well, that's all well and good, and you may move up a scale on the idiot level if you had thought that, but you probably don't, and even if you did, it's still wrong.  You'd have the one or two people making minor changes go to the big recoding change department and making coffee, because they don't know how to implement new things, just fix old ones, and the people doing the backflag change probably have enough hands to push the change out as fast as possible anyways.</div></div><hr />

the charmed pets will default to human models.<br />
<br />
But what if the pet Breaks charm in PoK?  I thought it was a non combat zone...OR take a charmed pet to bazaar, stand among AFK traders and /q out.  What would happen then?</div></div><hr />

I believe currently summoned pets do not have a level restriction on buffs.  This means a level 1 necro could go to PoK, ask for single target Virtue, FoS, VQ, pet weapons, etc. and book it back to the newbie areas (or one zone away from the newbie areas now) and Zoner will be a killing machine.<br />
<br />
I mention this publicly because it can be done now as is (just that the buff caster has to go to the appropriate zone instead) but isn't as popular now, since other than PL'ers, no one is going to go to a newbie zone to Virtue pets.  With pets being able to zone soon, this might become more prevelant -- I can only guess impact on PvP servers.</div></div><hr />

Very very true, my cleric stealth virtues newbie pets all the time, and if I don't feel like blowing the peridots, I faith them (HP buff that is a required level as well) I am sure that will change, just like not being able to cast on players with lower levels.</div></div><hr />

kinda late to respond to this but heh 2boxing in GoD kills my 768mbs of ram heh, then again thats probably my 1.2ghz process slowing me down :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Bellemorte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My understanding is that charmed pets will not zone. Also, suspended pets will not zone with you. The pet has to be player-summoned and unsuspended to zone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Actually, at this point, suspended pets do not zone.  Only active pets survive the experience.  Mages would of course love to see suspended pets included, and no one knows whether that was an oversite, bug, or planned exclusion, so we will just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I think it is incredible that we can get little Jabober all buffed up and then go beat things down.  I bet it will help out our PVP brethren as well, since it will be just one more thing for oppenents to deal with at all times against SK's.<br />

- Footsteps for people stopping behind you not turning off until you look at them is fixed. <br />
<br />
- Suspend Minion pets will now save their height. <br />
<br />
- (Test Only) Fixed /pet report after you zoned with a pet, it was showing a list of unknown spells. <br />
<br />
- (Test Only) Wizards will no longer get a second familiar as soon as they zone after casting a regular familiar. <br />
<br />
- Made it so that pets now follow the same rules as players when it comes to buffs. If the caster is not high enough level for a spell to land on them, then it also will not land on his pet. (This sucks!) <br />
<br />

<br />

- You can now remove augments intact if you have the correct solvent, listed in the item display window for the augment. Mimzit Furnov in Butcherblock currently sells all of the solvents. <br />

Actually, that is outstanding.  That means that a level 65 SK can get level 65 buffs cast on his pet.  Imagine how screwed we would be if they based it on the pet's level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I agree, they did exactly the right thing.<br />
Now, a lvl 25 necro can't get lvl 65 buffs for his pet, but we can get lvl 65 buffs for our lvl 25 pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Heh, that was a copy and paste from another board. Not my comment ;) I agree with the way they are implementing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">im wondering if they'll put the 15 buff limit+ bard song box for pets. i spent 20 aa on that, hope it not nerfed.</div></div><hr />

OMG! they did it right this time!<br />
<br />
I think one thing they should add on pets is an HP/AC bonus based on the owner's current max HP/AC.  something like adding 1/3 of a player's current HP/AC onto your pet, so that a pet somewhat reflects the player's power. <br />
They already have a similar scheme for pet's resists, dont see why they can't do the same for pets.  this would be a lot more useful for other pet class, but would be especially good for us, our pet won't die from DS's</div></div><hr />
