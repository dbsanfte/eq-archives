New sk here. Hey hey.<br />
I did some searching on pull and pet* pull but was unable to find an answer to my questions. For my question I will give you a monk pull scenario and see if anyone can answer my question afterwords.<br />
<br />
Scenario is Guardian of the Seal in the Hole.(ruins of old paineel)<br />
<br />
As a monk, it is possible to split the garghoyle guards from the GotS by using the gloves that cast a low level poison dot. Basicaly the monk casts the dot, aggroeing all 3 mobs, fd's. Upon the mobs return to spawn points, the monk stands and only the dotted mob comes. This is VERY rare in these times as the gloves are only available in the SH casino now. I have done this and seen it done (provided it wasnt resisted).<br />
<br />
My question is this: could an SK cast a dot, FD, and stand after the mobs return and get the same result? or will all 3 of the mobs still aggro? If all 3 aggro, why would it only work for a monk?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zedlepln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pet pull on the guards works like a champ with the 64 pet. GotS has a pretty big assist radius, so get the guard to the rock at the ledge where nortlav stands before tagging, and keep it on the ledge or in the water. The right guard (that drops the SOE quest piece) is a wizzy and requires a little patience since he will try to nuke Goner a bit before engaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get your resists buffed.  Boner shares your resists, he'll need them to survive up against the wizzie long enough to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>methos911</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understand how the pet pull works. I did read the post about it during my searching.<br />
In the example I used, I wanted to know if you dot a mob, fd, let it return, then stand, will it come single or with adds? And has anyone tested it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think people are not followng that you open a thread saying its a pet pulling question but then change up to a dot/fd pulling question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just figured he didn't understand...<br />
<br />
Same strategy that works for a monk will work for an SK<br />
<br />
pathing there is odd though GoTS has a large argo radius and it's hard to pull the far one w/o agroing it (i.e. more trouble than it's worth)  and you'd have to wait for full reset on the two you wouldn't want.<br />
<br />
if you use a snare dot iyou might be able to pull this off befor the ne you dotted even resets...might make it trickier however (placement of mob in another's agro radius or pathing through)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Truth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say no I suppose. from my own experience anyway, ken has snared a mob to spit two or three, Fd'd, and generally when I got back up the dottted/snared mob just sat there and let the darkness fester, but after I fd'd, the mob I casted on would stay put, like he was rooted or something and the others I aggroed wuold go back to their spawn points or whatever. When they were out of range all I had to do was get close to the sanred mob and he'd run after me. I havent played in a while, maybe I dont remember.<br />
<br />
otherwise pet pulling does the same job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>methos911</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think people are not followng that you open a thread saying its a pet pulling question but then change up to a dot/fd pulling question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
not to get off on the wrong foot but where up there did I say it was PET pull question? I said I did searching on pull and pet* pull and did not find what i was looking for. even the subject says another pull questions.<br />
<br />
ANYWAY<br />
<br />
thanks for the info keevel and all. I only used gots as an example. Same could be used for any 2+ mob situation. guess I will apply my other techniques and see if they work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was figuring if you searched for &quot;pet pull&quot; you were trying a pet pull I guess.<br />
<br />
Also, just because your monk does something one way, doesn't mean that you should do it that way with the SK.  You have different tools, different re-use times on FD.  It'll make something a monk can do easily much harder on the sk and vice versa.  <br />
<br />
In this case a pet pull might be easier than your fancy trick anyway. <br />
(which is probably why the advice defaulted to pet pull)</div></div><hr />
