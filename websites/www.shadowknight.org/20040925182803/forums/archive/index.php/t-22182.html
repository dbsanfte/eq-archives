<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at the point where I've gotten a decent number of leadership aa's.  All the ones that I consider crucial.  I'm at the point now of trying to figure out if the remaining ones are worth it or if they are a waste of exp.  And if they are worth it -- which is best.<br />
<br />
Any good sites out there that discuss leadership aa's?  Searched the forums here, but didn't find much useful about leadership aa's.<br />
<br />
Currently have:<br />
<br />
Mark NPC 1<br />
Delegate Main Assist<br />
Delegate Mark NPC<br />
Spell Awareness<br />
Offense Enhancement 5 (max'd)<br />
Health Enhancement 3 (max'd)<br />
Health of Target's Target<br />
<br />
Don't have:<br />
<br />
Mark NPC 2, 3 (more can be marked at once)<br />
NPC Health (shows % health next to name)<br />
Inspect Buffs 1, 2 (look at GROUP members, see their buffs)<br />
Mana Enhancement 1, 2, 3 (add to max mana pool size)<br />
Regeneration Enhancement 1, 2, 3 (add small amount of hp/tick)<br />
<br />
Basically I figure that NPC Health and Inspect Buffs are fairly worthless.  I'm not overlooking anything with these am I?  Like if I could inspect opponent's buffs during pvp combat, this might be useful to see if they're fully debuffed or something.  But as far as I can tell from reading it, it's only group members.<br />
<br />
That leaves Mark NPC 2 or Mana Enhancement 1 or Regeneration Enhancement 1 as my next group leader aa.  They all cost 4 points.  I have 3 now.  So I need to pick one.  Any advice?<br />
<br />
After that.. I really need to figure out at what point it makes sense to stop doing leadership aa's and go back to 100% regular aa's.  If it's worth getting the leadership aa, I'd do it.. but if it's a complete waste.. why bother?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my experience, inspect buffs is handy for your buff casting group members, especially inspect buffs 2.  The chanter/shaman/cleric/druid/beastlord can see exactly what you have, and with level 2, how long till it needs refreshed.  Alot of buffs are group target, so they can see on themselves, but it is handy. (my other char is one of the aformentioned buffing classes.)<br />
<br />
Mana enhancement and regen enhancement are nice but minor abilities. <br />
<br />
NPC Health and mark NPC are essentially useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have 2 levels of Mana enhancement... At some point I'd read that each level was 100 mana... It's not, its only 30 mana for each of the first 2 levels. Guessing the 3rd level is then 40mana. Either way not worth it till you have nothing left to get.<br />
<br />
I do have inspect buffs. Its nice for the buffers you group with, but I've not found much of a use if you are not a buffer. Of course this was the last one that I got, so maybe something will present itself soon. I think the second level gives you durations, which is real nice for the buffers also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogrukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, inspect buffs 1 is just a list of the target's buffs, level 2 gives remaining duration.  It works on group members only, no PvP use i can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So... not npc health, a good custom UI can show you the percent if you need to know that.  Not inspect buffs.  The people that I normally group with know how to say when they need a buff, it seems.  Probably regen next.  Guess every little bit counts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I would (and already have) buy Mana Enhancement all the way to 3.  Particularly now that people can see the numbers, why not give yourself and the casters in your group an extra boost?  Hell, I waste a buff slot half the time for an extra 250 mana as it is.<br />
<br />
You have all of the important ones already I would say, but I'm not sure why no one buys an extra 100 mana for the same cost as 100 hps.  The way I look at it, whenever I am leader it's like having an extra slot filled with 100 hps/100 mana/50 atk.<br />
<br />
Oh, and please, for the love of God, give us a toggle for spell awareness.  I hate the spam from it and will never buy it because of that.  Nothing bugs me more than being put into someone's group in a raid that has it.  I have a hard enough time reading everything that goes by as it is.  I know it doesn't actually add any more lines of text, but it certainly fills up my chat box a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amen on the toggle for spell awareness.<br />
<br />
Bolas, would agree with you and get regen, then possibly mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's no extra spam associated with Spell Awareness. Instead of:<br />
<br />
Chania casts a spell<br />
<br />
you get <br />
<br />
Chania casts &lt;&lt; Aura of Pain &gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
or whatever. If the spell spam bothers you, just turn off spells in the filters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had all the Leadership AA's completed for some time now, and IMO, you have the good ones.<br />
<br />
Wait, you don't have Find Path to PC yet?!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry do have Find Path to PC already.  Just wasn't looking at the possible chioces when i filled out what I had from memory.  Guess that one isn't memorable LOL.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I said I knew that it didn't add more lines having Spell Awareness.  It still is far more spam, space-wise, whether you want to admit it or not.  I know a lot of people love it, but personally it drives me nuts.  And turning off all spells isn't an option.  Besides, I'd probably still get the BL and mage pets casting every 2 seconds even if I did turn it off.  I can tell when a mob is trying to CH, and it says specifically when they are trying to gate, so I could care less to see exactly what everyone in my group is casting.  I do like to know that they, or the mob, are casting...but if they are casting summon food all day, I'll probably figure out they aren't contributing soon enough anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's all personal preference obviously...which is why I shouldn't be subjected to it without having the option to turn it off I think.  I have to specifically turn on ToT, and if I didn't like the targetting rings I could turn those off, and I have to make a hotkey to inspect people's buffs...so why don't I have to turn on spell awareness?  It's the only one like that, and it's the most annoying to people that don't like it.  Make it require activation like all the other ones of that type, and the problem would be solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason why I would support Spell Awareness on a toggle is that it also shows bard songs. You don't get the xxx begins to cast a spell but it just says &lt;&lt; Harmony of Sound &gt;&gt; for example. And that can get annoying if you see it everytime the bard twists a new song.<br />
<br />
Or they could just fix it and remove this &quot;feature&quot; to see the bard songs too...</div></div><hr />
