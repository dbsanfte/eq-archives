He's 40 now and iggy BP doesn't help to much anymore so I think its time to get one with some stats. I can't decide really though whether to get a Shishar BP with 15 agi and 15 dex since my ogre is lacking in those departments or PSC or just put a lil more money with it and get a BE BP. I'd like to save a little bit of money but if BE is really good i'll buy it. Also is there any other BP's I should look into to buy my SK, i'm looking at a 35k limit to spend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fally</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Blood Ember BP would surely be enough until you can get Quest Armor or Eradication / Vindicator / etc... Since you are level 60 Archmage I don't think that it would be all that impossible or ?<br />
<br />
On the other hand since you are level 40 already you could wait until 48 or so and get Umbral Armor, it's very good and costs nothing except time to raid :p.<br />
<br />
Imo I would try to get a bit more money and buy a Fungi Tunic, that would be awesome even until level 61 *g*.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cragnor</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would definitely go with blood ember if you can afford it.  There are a few options you could go with rather than the BE but the BE will be able to serve you with no problems until you can raid areas to get yourself a Thurgadin bp or higher.  If you can't quite swing the cost of a Blood Ember you could look into possibly going with an Incarnadine or PSC or even a Dragonhide bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definately recommend BE BP. I just got mine last week, finally, and is great. Also it gives you access to a nice buff spell, great for when you solo, and also stacks with all out spells (maybe not with Cloak of Akheva). Now I just need a BP with Invigorate and I'm rocking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyriellebloodykisses</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get fungi it ownz BE  heh ( if fungi is not more then 35 on your server)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Askeer</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Major Shielding stacks with Cloak of the Akheva.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fally</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I am wrong but I think Major Shielding doesn't stack with one line of the Shaman buffs, can't remember which one atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synd D`nys</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding doesnt stack with the Talisman/Focus line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ueuelr</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, does not stack with the shaman spells. I meant to say it stacks with all our spells, so is great for soloing. It also stacks with Cleric spells, so that's a nice little bonus, since it has MR as well ( AC HP and MR). Also getting a spell from the pure caster's line is great.<br />
<br />
Fungi is great, but is better used on a monk. With Deadly Temptation, AA regen and Soul Abrasion, epic or some other life tapping weapon, fungi just does not hold it for me. Call me crazy but I would never use a fungi on my SK, especialy if I get a SS BP or better and epic. Just having the epic effect on constantly during a fight is better than fungi effect.</div></div><hr />
