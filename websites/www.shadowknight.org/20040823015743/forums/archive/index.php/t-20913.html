Hey NEWTARD, thanks. That means a lot coming from the Poster boy for coathanger abortions.<br />
Oh yeah, and you know how your dad told you if you were the one fucking him in the ass, it didn't make you gay? He was lying, because you're gayer than Kenny G wearing Assless leather chaps and  playing a pink Saxaphone while walking a french poodle on the way to a Carrot Top comedy show. If a condom infected with AIDS stuck up rip taylors ass met you, it would think you were too gay. Keep Reaching for that rainbow, you squallid bitch.<br />

I give you the plight of Edward the 2nd who was kidnapped by the French.  The English threatened the French with war if they even put a mark on his skin.  So...they but a metal tube up his butt...which he probably liked, he was a homosexual, and then eviscirated him with a red hot rod!  It was said his screams could be heard 2 miles away...even though he was in the dungeon :-(  The French then produced his unmaked body to the English.</div></div><hr />

That's gotta be about the funniest thing I've read all year.  Newtank, you're the one that ought to be banned for the BS you spouted on this forum, and your stubborn attitude.<br />
<br />
You lost.  Your &quot;15 mins of fame&quot; thread is now a flame, as it should have been after page 3, when you started spewing the diareaha about your theoretical DPS, and the uberness of AA's at 55.<br />

Oh, shit, he's twinked to the NUTS! fuck, shut up, keevel plays more like the game was originally meant to be played than probably 90% of the people here, go lick a nut you dumb piece of shit.<br />
<br />
Mantisrose, go kill yourself. And when you do, make sure that it's as painful as can possibly be, may you rot in gay hell with Suddam's cock up your ass.<br />

 Your a disgrace Naelyan defending twinks 90 percent of the game wasnt suppose to be played  with twinks.  real sk's are better then  twink Sk's<br />

Probably the only reason he is posting so much now is because he is jelous of the amount of attention that Newtank got and wants to try to out do him. Ignore him and he will go away.</div></div><hr />

ROFL<br />
<br />
At the time my idea of twink gear was a tree weeve and a 2 handed sword forged from the fiery ore in SolA that a guildie made me.<br />
<br />
Now Keevel had a WMBS and a Noc blade, from a retired friend of a friend, a cloak quested by a caster guildie and given to me for favors and a couple of pieces from the guild bank (earring of dark faith and necklace of curled cacti.  There are a couple of boughten pieces (high end cultural bracer in bazaar for 2K - coun't pass up, and a moss).<br />
<br />
I still feel like I'm a bit too twinked even though I've been in on every other kill that resulted in his gear (that I can remember off the top of my head).<br />
<br />
I made an SK because they seemed challanging and fun and a seemed like a great melee character.  For over the year I've been playing him I've enjoyed it emmensely.  <br />
<br />
I can't flame Mantirose for calling em a twink, even though I don't usually agree with him, because I feel a few of those pangs of guilt myself.  That said I don't feel that Keevel is so over-geared that the challenge is gone and I will continue to play him as long as he is fun.</div></div><hr />
