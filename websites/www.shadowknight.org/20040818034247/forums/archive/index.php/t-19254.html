<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent some time in seru and got up to warmly on the quest guy for this but still kos to the magus faction.   Anyway i decided to just do the quest with my shaman and MQ the ashes but when i had the 2 pieces to Phenic with my shaman he hands them back... is this not MQable ? I had heard it was.  Anyone else have this issue ?  or possible MQ nerf for the shield ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done the Loyalist Shield via MQ about 5 times now, the most recent being about 6 weeks ago.  My druid did the MQ's on all of them (including my SK, who was the first one I tried MQ on -- and 3 of the 5 MQ's were for KOS-to-Phenic characters).<br />
<br />
I've never had item(s) handed back to my druid, so I'm a bit at a loss; but again, my last MQ was 6 weeks ago.  The only thing I can think of to watch for is that the Badge of Service &quot;changes&quot; at various parts of the quest.  I'm at a loss for words how to describe that but basically the NPC's know if you have the 'right one' somehow (it gets flagged or has a different ID or something).  For example, if you screw up somehow along the way, and decide to shortcut and do the rest of the quest but invariably skip part of it because you think you have the right badge already (visually it's indistinguishable) but it hasn't been flagged or exchanged by Nathyn yet.  Remember, sometimes you hand the item in and you get it back but it may not be identical.<br />
<br />
That would explain the badge being handed back but not the token, because you get that from the robes hand in near the end and it's not cycled like the badge is.<br />
<br />
Did you hand in the scroll to Phenic before handing the badge and token in?  It might be the scroll hand in which 'flags' those two items as the final hand in items.  I am guessing of course, please keep that in mind.  Worse comes to worst, you can't go wrong as long as you don't hand in the ashes until you are sure.  If in doubt, I would do everything with your shaman again, destroying every item related to this quest first.  The only thing hard about the quest, as you know, is Zevfeer, and then the shades fight; so you can repeat everything else easily in a single night.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I turned in the scroll and farely certain I presented the badge to everyone that it needed to be.  Got up to threatingly today with magus, gonna get up to dubious with them and hope i can just do it myself.  Hope it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think that is it -- but could be wrong of course; when I did my MQ I was maxed at Amiable with the Katta guards (Validus Custodus) from killing vamps, Threatening with the casters (Magus Conlegium), Amiable to Nathyn, and Scowling to Phenic (Concilium Universus?).  Katta Citizens I don't remember.<br />
<br />
My druid was indifferent to Phenic (now amiable from all the MQ's) but don't remember the other factions offhand.<br />
<br />
You might want to check on the [/cringe] Paladins of Norrath boards, they have several threads on the Loyalist shield quest that may be of some help.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to post that I was indeed able to finish this quest yesterday for my Iksar Shadowknight, despite being KoS to everything in Katta. <br />
<br />
I ran through the entire quest except the final turn-in with my wood elf druid and got the Badge of Service and Magus Conlegium Token. I then camped Zevfeer (6+ hours), and looted his Ashes with my SK. <br />
<br />
I then had a 65 chanter guildmate (thanks Haary!) accompany us up to Phenic and Pacify him. My druid turned in the Badge and Token, then my SK dropped invis. and slowly inched closer until the trade window opened. My druid then cast invis. to make my SK indifferent, he clicked trade, and got his shield! <br />
<br />
A few interesting notes on the Zevfeer fight: <br />
<br />
I setup my 65 necro, 60 SK, and 51 druid on the balcony, in the middle near the edge closest to the mountains. I had no problems single pulling and killing mobs here without adds. I was there killing for 6 or so hours when Heratius Grolden finally spawned on the north side of the balcony. After medding to full, my toons pulled and killed him. Not a hard fight, just kept him slowed. <br />
<br />
Once he died Zevfeer spawned right in front of my toons i.e. his spawn point is in the middle of the balcony along the railing. We wiped on the first try with Zevfeer at around 80 percent health. Fortunately, a kind 65 chanter and 65 cleric (THANK YOU again Stonehearted and Adarank(sp?)) offered to help me with round two. I can't thank these guys enough for the offer to help. Some nasty people would have brought in friends to gank the mob, but they offered to help with another try instead /cheer good-hearted people. <br />
<br />
By the time my necro and SK got back in the zone - BOTH Zevfeer and Grolden were up! The chanter was able to pacify/mez Grolden while we pulled and killed Zevfeer. It was a long fight, but he went down and my SK got his ashes. After looting him, we killed Grolden again and pop! another Zevfeer. Sometime during the course of the second Zevfeer fight - *another* Grolden spawned. Killing him, however, did not spawn another Zevfeer. <br />
<br />
The cleric got the second ashes drop and the chanter got Grolden's nifty 2-hand Int caster drop, so everybody won out. Looooong night, but what a great finish. Good luck to all those embarking upon this quest. It's definitely worth doing if you have the patience for the final camp. <br />
<br />
thanks, <br />

this was posted on about December 15/16 so i'd say it's still valid. hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye I read that on allakhazams.  I did end up finishing this several days back and thanks for the ideas.  I did the quest without MQ.  I had good faction with everyone except for the magus conlegium so I ended up doing the whole scripted event inside the conlegium being KoS.  I brought an enchanter friend who pacified everything I came near and I did all the hand ins using hide.  Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good show!  Still baffling with respect to the shaman handing in though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm currently MQ'ing this using a friend's wood elf druid. i was planning on using my sk during the shade lord fight in the magnus congelium.<br />
<br />
do you know if this will be possible. i know the 3 npc's that performed the summoning depop when the fight starts but i wondered if there are others around that will aggro my sk if he assists in the battle.<br />
<br />
also, curious what your forces were for bringing down zevfeer, i've heard such wildly different stuff on this it almost seems not possible.<br />
<br />
he's only got 40k hps / he's got 100k hp's. he summons / no he doesn't. he can be aggro kited and won't gate / he gates, don't try kiting. disease lands / no it doesn't. LOL<br />
<br />
everyone seems to agree that fire and ice work well, that he's really easy to slow, that the vampyre bane stakes work just fine for melee dmg. and that getting him to spawn really sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Voch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can do the fight with your SK after the npc's depop. Thats what I did because I was KoS to the conlegium.   I actually did the trigger and everything though with my SK.  Enchanter just pacified everything, and I had to FD a few select times too.   With the trigger mobs pacified I could get close enough to open up trade window then i hit Hide so they conned indifferent and then clicked trade.<br />
<br />
Zevfeer wasnt really that bad for the group I had.  He's like the other vampires there, Disease/Pois doesnt touch him.  I fought him some piece of shit bane vampire dagger, and was boxing my wifes 65 shaman.  I also had the help of a 65 beastlord and another 65 shaman, and all 4 of us have AA's ranging from 80-160.  He slows pretty easy and after that his melee is very weak.  Just have to make sure you keep your hitpoints at a decent level because he occasionally lifetaps for over 1k, I cant really remember the exact number now.  Ice landed well for the shamans and the shaman epic dot landed fine so i'm guessing any magic/cold based spells will hit him fine.  I have no idea on fire.  I suggest fighting him near his spawn location, I pulled him down the stairs and we had him at about 10% health and he warped to his spawn location (i'm farely certain there was no gate message).  Well he was full health after he warped so we basically killed him twice.  This was like a 30 minute battle for the 4 of us because of killing him twice.  I think 40k hitpoints seems pretty low, I harmtouched him for around 8k and no way in hell did it take 20% of his hitpoints.<br />

Hope this helps..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I MQ'd a half dozen or so Loyalist Shields for guildies, but mine was the first one we did.  At the time, I was still KOS in the Magus Conglegium building (even the green guards would aggro on me), so I used my human monk to 'tank' for the shades fight.  It was a mistake although no one died and the fight was successful.  My monk was in 3 years+ old gear and wasn't very effective at all - hehe.  Also that fight, the shades were bugged and we got double spawns (2 shade lords and 6 shades).  The second time we did the quest for someone else, I did use my SK.  During the 2nd fight, after the dialog (I just stayed invis till then), I ensured that I was in the center of the platform at all times.  The other 3 shades did not even aggro or join the fight until I pulled them after killing the shade lord; whereas the first time around one of the druids must have aggro'd them all and had to run around until my monk could peel one of them... if you could call it that.<br />
<br />
As for Zevfeer, I scheduled a raid on the coterie castle and it turned out to be a 5 hour flop, as we couldn't get Grolden to pop.  So after that day I just duo'd the castle with my druid during offtimes hoping to see him pop.  I could almost keep the castle cleared but not quite -- the bottom would spawn while I was just finishing off the top floor.  If it was the named cycle, then I had no hope of keeping it cleared.<br />
<br />
Then one day, while I was still on the 2nd floor and hadn't even killed the 2nd named yet, Grolden showed up on track.  Only one guildie was online, a 65 necro... it was early and no one else would likely be on for hours.  Had to decide whether to try this guy or not (hell, this used to take a raid force for this guy) and it was the first time any of us had seen Grolden/Zevfeer first hand.<br />
<br />
We gave it a shot: 65 SHD, 65 DRU and 65 NEC.  I'd been carrying around a bag full of stakes, so we outfitted the pets and myself with 'em and gave him a shot after Grolden went down.  Fought Zevfeer up top but not on the balcony (yes he did gate too).<br />
<br />
Final result:<br />
