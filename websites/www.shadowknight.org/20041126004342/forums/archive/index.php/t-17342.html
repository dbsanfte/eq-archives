<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>olddreadlord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of attention has been directed at the balance of power between warriors and <br />
their hybrid counterparts (Paladins and Shadowknights).  The purpose of this post<br />
is to present a compilation of evidence that may lead to an unpopular conclusion. <br />
 If an individual were to skip to the end of this post, and read just the conclusion, the popular opinion would be to disagree with it.  However this Article is going to present both Historical facts from EQ and facts that are still very relevant today.  I believe part of the problem lies with each class’s expectation of themselves.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the history of class &quot;balance&quot; between Warriors and Tanking Hybrids.  Spare yourself the embarrassment of arguing against these points in the history section.  They are not meant as genuine balance arguments today.  I'm only bringing them up so the reader can have a good understanding of the evolution of this &quot;balance&quot; between the 3 classes involved.<br />
The old saying was &quot;75 percent Warrior and 25 percent (insert Cleric or Necro)&quot; was what hybrids were.  Hybrids would joke that that ratio is true, they had 75 percent of the melee-skills of a (Cleric or Necro) and 25 percent of the casting skills of a warrior.  Shadowknights who were reasonably equipped during Classic, Kunark and Velious (Hereafter referred to as CKaV) would hesitate to cast several of their spells.  Some spells like heat blood for example would eat up 2 or 3 solid rounds of melee ability (due to a bug that was later fixed pertaining to the melee round being reset after casting).  On raids in CKaV, Shadowknights couldn’t use a majority of their spells for a couple reasons.  Remembering that until PoP most PAL/SHD spells were just &quot;Old-Cleric/Necro&quot; spells, certain spells just didnt stick to the raid level mobs.  If the Shadowknight's spells did stick, they would be overwritten by the Necro version anyways.  Paladins had a similar problem.  No raid functions without a cleric, therefore all paladin buff-spells (except Brells) were useless to the Paladin's group.  During Classic and Kunark, most serious EXP groups also needed a cleric with few exceptions, making the Paladins line of buffs again, useless.  In Kunark, the perception of most was that certain areas of Sebilis could not be done with a Paladin or Shadowknight.  Remember that there was no &quot;low-aggro-celestial-healing&quot; spells, and no KEI.  If a Paladin or Shadowknight was tanking, the cleric was pouring mana into them that they actually needed to med back.  In these groups, Paladins and Shadowknight sat up at the entrance spamming &quot;LFG&quot; in the /ooc chat if they didn’t bring a group of existing friends.  The tanking skills of Paladins and Shadowknights were severely lacking, their spells were unusable or trivial at best, and finally there melee damage was *not* 75 percent of a warriors.  The problem lied in the skill caps.  With weapon skills capped low, Paladins and Shadowknights suffered from the &quot;Swwhish&quot;- syndrome more than any other melee.  If your not familiar with the &quot;Swwhish&quot;- syndrome consider yourself lucky.  Being unable to connect a swing against higher level mobs was a widespread problem for Paladins and Shadowknights.  With all these problems, Paladins and Shadowknights were not only the least desirable classes, but they paid *additional* experience for the honor of being so undesirable.  During CKaV, there was only one tank, The Warrior.  There were no substitutes.<br />
<br />
As I stated earlier in this article, the preceding paragraph is history.  To argue on behalf of Warriors or Hybrids based on just the preceding paragraph would be an embarrassment.  Most of the aforementioned problems did eventually get corrected.  Let’s take a look at Warriors versus Paladins and Shadowknights today.<br />
<br />
On raids, Warriors are still the only true tank, this will never change.  Its often not pointed out that the warriors disciplines scale upward with content.  The &quot;main tank&quot; gets the advantage of taking less damage when he flips on his Defensive Discipline regardless of what encounter.  Discipline defensive is arguably much better when used against Quarm than it was when used against Trakanon.  Because it is on a percentage, it stays undeniably useful throughout all the Everquest encounters. This percentage works to a Warriors advantage, compounded with the Warriors rising hitpoints throughout the expansions it means that warrior can take more and more damage.  When incoming damage is reduced by a percentage, you effectively get more use out of the hitpoints you have.  If we arbitrarily added 1000hps to a Warrior, he will get more use from them than his Paladin or Shadowknight counterpart would.  Warriors do keep a significant hitpoint advantage over Knights, however since it is based on a percentage Warrior's say the gap is &quot;closing&quot;.  Instead of having 20 percent more hitpoints than a Knight (common in CKaV) the Warrior HP advantage is down to around 12 percent.  If a Warrior claims 12 percent is insignificant, you have to follow the history.  The Warrior was the *only* tank through CKaV and was so far ahead of his Knightly counterparts that they were barely considered tanks.  If tommorow SOE added an AA skill that gave 12 percent more hitpoints, you can bet the warriors would be the class most excited.  Hitpoints are one of the few stats that really matter to a Warrior.  <br />
<br />
Which brings me to another Warrior advantage: Gear Selection.  <br />
In order for a Warrior to do his job he needs to worry about HPs, ATK and AC.  When it comes to selecting gear, the warrior (usually) needs to select the piece with the most hps on it (this is the case with Time gear).  Warriors can get geared well naturally without having to make tradeoffs.  A Paladin may be interested in HPs, ATK and AC as well, but he is also interested in Mana Preservation, Spell Haste, and Improved Healing.  A Shadowknight is interested in Mana Preservation, Burning Affliction and Improved Damage as well.  On the FOH Message board in Kruegans post &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; he mentions a &quot;Superknight&quot; phenomenon.  Where some people posting on behalf of warriors wrap-up all the powers of a Paladin and Shadowknight together as one &quot;Superknight&quot; then compare warriors to them.  Not only does that happen, but often these same posters also assume the Paladin and Shadowknight has 2 sets of full time gear, one for max effects on focus effects and one for max hps.  Then when convinent, The &quot;Hitpoint&quot; Knight template is compared to a real time Warriors illustrating only a small hitpoint difference (it helps their case) then when they mention spells they'll shift to a &quot;Spellcasting/Max-Focus&quot; Template when they discuss Knights spell casting ability.  Gear choices are much harder for Knights than for Warriors.  There is much more to balance.  Warriors still have several advantages, lately those advantages have been &quot;Swept under the rug&quot; and the spotlight has turned on the Knights who finally got fixed when PoP was released.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights have enough hitpoints and AC to realistically &quot;add-tank&quot;.  There is one encounter in the plane of time that may have been designed by SOE for hybrids, but many guilds found a way to use Warriors on that encounter anyways.  In small groups, Paladins and Shadowknights now bring more to the table than they did during CKaV.  They offer &quot;acceptable&quot; tanking skills with one added benefit (SHD's add the benefit of tremendous aggro, and PAL's offer the benefit of decent support healing).  If the healers have good mana regeneration and can afford to spend the extra mana healing a Pal/Shd then a small group will gain more from the Pal/Shd than they would with the Warrior.  Currently in a 65th level, LDON normal mode adventure where the cleric (or alternate healers) have VOQ or KEI, most groups if given a choice of the 3-Tank classes would pick Paladin or Shadowknight.  This isn't imbalanced in and of itself, its just a trade-off that most people at the moment will make.<br />
<br />
Summary and Conclusion:<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
There are still many advantages to being a Warrior, some Warriors have done a great job lobbying for improvements to their class.  The problem is that it is just that, lobbying.  The advantages are written on the wall, and they stay the same throughout EQ.  Some of them desire their &quot;old-glory days&quot; of CKaV where they were the only tank and Knights had zero value.  Those days are gone, and now they have to deal with being the best tank of the three.. Instead of just being the only tank.  The purpose of this article is not to have warriors nerfed, the purpose is to show the reader that the warrior situation certainly is not as grim as they paint it.  Knights are finally a viable class, but that is what has come under fire.  Some people posting on this issue seem intent on driving Knights back into the CKaV days.  Even a certain uber-guild leader (who’s mother obviously used timeouts instead of spankings) proposed that when Knights put on a piece of gear they should suffer a penalty so they cant use the gear fully.  When Knights were dead last on the list of desirable classes for grouping in CKaV the warriors did not seem to mind at all, now when they have a little competition for pickup groups their all aggravated.  Add that to the fact they have *no* competition for raids, they *are* the tank.<br />

<br />
ya your right... they have no advantage over us...<br />
<br />
<br />
the problem is... being a warrior required no real skill ( button masher)  now that it finally does require slightly more than just button mashing they're bent out of shape  cuz they cant keep up and we can <br />
<br />
  i wont go back to the CKaV days  and any knight saying warriors are right didnt come from those days so  you can all set yourselves on fire<br />
<br />
*edit*  oh and we tried to give them a reasonable solution that wouldnt make button mashing so boring    ( the rage bar post)  but no one cares  they just want the nerf to put them back on their throne,</div></div><hr />

In an exp group, that 12% difference is nothing because, in the average exp group, healing a knight will take the same mana as healing a warrior.<br />

<br />
Not in a position to comment.<br />
<br />
Warriors will always be the class that gets to stand toe to toe with the highest encounters.<br />
<br />
Relevent to exp groups how?  Oh, and out of curiousity, if we get passed over for exp groups how do you expect us to get the exp to get to the level required to tank those highest encounters? <br />
<br />
Warriors will always have at least 20 percent more melee dps than a Knight with the same weapon due to skill caps.<br />
<br />
Again, how is this relevent? Neither knights nor warriors are DPS classes and neither are invited to groups for DPS (unless it's versus undead and then the (mis)conception about pally uber DPS versus undead leans towards them).</div></div><hr />

Are you talking about kunark drops , velious drops , Sol drops , PoP drops , SoL Raid zone drops , PoP God drops , Time drops ?  Be a bit more specific . Not everyone has access to what you might have .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of fixes concerning taunt would greatly patch up warriors. as it is warriors are still in demand as exp group tanks, ive often been in groups that prefered a warrior tank were i ended up as puller and it worked great, yes knights are in higher demand atm then warriors but its defenitly not that warriors are unwanted now. <br />
<br />
Giving warriors some improvements in taunt would bring them up quite a bit on the aggro keeping department and thus their desirabillitie. I may sound ignorant but heck.. ive put some suggestions up in the &quot;Is nerfing us really the answer?&quot; thread  that wouldnt really involve lots of new skills or whatever, just some tweaks to taunt and aggro, near the last page if anyone is interested..<br />
<br />
Tho what im mostly saying here and to stay in on topic: i dont think warriors have it as bad as it is thought by them, they have competition from knights now so some warriors are being turned down as tank for exp groups, but this is NOT always the case..(tho i do agree warriors need some fixes)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is crap.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with warriors are the fact they cannot obtain snap or strong initial agro.  It wasnt a big deal before with mobs maybe hitting 150 ish-200.  But the with the advent of normal xp mobs hiting 500, and the fact that casters can actually die in 1 or 2 round of combat as opposed to before where they could eat a round or 2 and let the warrior restablish agro.  With mob DPS being as high as it is, it really does but an premium on classes that can tank and generate lots of agro.<br />
<br />
Potential solution:  Create a new warrior ability that generates pure agro (say 300 ish) refreshes once every 30 sec (general life span of mobs).  Make raid level mobs immune to this ability so not to trivialize content.  Also make it scale to level of warrior, maybe something aloung the lines of 5 hate/level.<br />
<br />
The second biggest problem in my estimation lies in high end itemization.  From best I can tell once youre in a time level guild, especially with the time item changes, you dont have to do much trading off of tanking ability vs caster ability.  The warriors margin of hp vs knight remain relatively the same (about 7-900 ish ) but their % advantage of HP get cuts from a 20% advantage to about a 10% advantage.  Lets face facts, warriors are supposed be the best tanks, its fair they trade off all flexability to be this.   They should maintain a strong margin of tanking over knights. <br />
<br />
Potential solution: Create a warrior modifer on items for thing such as AC/HP.  Make it roughly 10% or so.  So say a 50 ac 100 hp helm, becomes a 55 ac 110 hp helm.   Put such a modifier on maybe VT, and elemental + gear.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm very happy where SKs are.  I'd rather have warriors get a bit of a needed upgrade then worry about a nerf bat over my head.  We maintain superior agro abilities, while they get an upgrade to agro and a restablishment of tanking margin lost in high end itemization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You know what they should really review? Casters. Having a sustained dps of nearly twice a melee can do over mobs fights and running oom only after encounter is done. Warriors cannot hold aggro against 6k crits. The aggro of a slow is neglectable for a good war, 1 maybe 2 taunts is enough+aggro proc. We are talking exp groups here, I aint talking about in planes where i dont have access to *ie, elementals* but so far i have never really seen a caster or priest get creamed brutally. Even then, since when in xp groups is a cleric/druid lom?<br />
<br />
Its the trouble that others dont know how to control their aggro imho, not the warriors taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This little bit of &quot;standard wisdom&quot; has always baffled me....<br />
<br />
Lets face facts, warriors are supposed be the best tanks, its fair they trade off all flexability to be this. <br />
<br />
Why is this &quot;the standard wisdom&quot;?  <br />
<br />
I assume that when people use the word &quot;tank&quot; they are talking about being hit by the mob, ie our relative defensive abilities.<br />
<br />
While warriors are the best situational tanks for a certain part of the game (ie Raid mobs that require defensive) knights are the best tank for the rest of the game at all levels (except 1 - 8 where a knight and warrior are basically the same).  And realistically knights have always been the best standard tank in the game (and until the release of kunark were the best raid tank as well).  <br />
<br />
The real imbalance of the Kunark and Velious area  (in our tanking ability mind you)  was at the top raid level, but popular opinion filtered down and affected all levels ability to get groups.  (It's interesting how popular opinion has affected all classes at one point or another in EQ's history, no matter what the reality of the class' situation at the time.)</div></div><hr />

I swear to god where do all these morons come from?<br />
<br />
By this same token druids are useless peices of crap, bards are a joke, and who would ever invite a bst into an exp group!<br />
<br />
Back in the real world, clerics sit on their asses selling symbol cause druid dps is higher (yes friends healers do contribute to dps) and chanters still get now &lt;3 cause who wants a chanter when you coudl have a bard, or a bst.<br />
<br />
And yes lets face the facts, warriors ARE the best tanks, they take damage BEST, sure they may not be best at agro(but then again they never were), but as far as taking damage nothing beats a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Darko, you kinda shot yourself in the foot with that argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hrm, did anybody ever put forth the idea that perhaps the problem isn't with the tank classes, but with the caster classes?  I'm not talking about caster DPS necessarily, which is worlds better than melee DPS from what I've seen, but caster hitpoints.  If casters could survive the beatings that result from a failed taunt check, would we still have this problem?  Or if slow wasn't a requirement for a PoP experience group, the way it used to be?  Warriors aren't the only people getting passed over for exp groups, I've seen plenty of Shadow Knights, Paladins and Monks get passed over for groups, not to mention the times I've seen Shamans and even Enchanters get passed over for Beastlords.  There are only so many group slots to go around, one for tank, one for slower, one for healer, rest for DPS, it is real easy to be looking for a group for hours at a time no matter what your class is, depending on the needs of groups and crowding of zones.  To me, the real problem with EQ is that spell cost is too low compared to mana regen and encounters are simply too hard to survive without slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1.  It doesn't matter how balance was in the past, if a class is fucked over the class that screwed them for years shouldn't be put in a similar posistion nomatter how tempting and entertaining the thought is.  It just isn't healthy for the game.<br />
<br />
2.  Pre-Kunark you're completly off base, we were absolute gods back then and you didn't need a cleric at all you could use any priest class for healing just fine.  This changed drastically in Kunark.<br />
<br />
3.  The &quot;bug&quot; wasn't really a bug, but the way spells were coded, when it was determined that casting spells hurt hybrids more than helped them, it was changed for only them.  It still exists for casters/priests.  The other thing that prevented us from using spells (Kunark era) was from 51-60 our spell cast times more than doubled, while mob delay decreaed from 35 to 25 or so (unslowed, it was about 38 slowed for frogs in seb... so whatever the math works out to), our spells in that level range were designed with the mana regeneration of Necromancers in mind, and to not be getting hit when casting them, we had neither of these, and to top it off even if a spell landed and didn't resist we lost enough melee damage while casting it to have lost damage even when the dot went its full duration.  Those problems were fixed by mid Kunark.<br />
<br />
4.  Kunark was the era of pure classes.  Warriors tanked - period, Clerics healed - period.  It wasn't just Knights that lacked during this time, druids suffered from poor heals and were incapable of performing their role, all hybrids suffered to as did some other classes, it was a problem due to poor design (Hi, Kendrik hope you're fucking up Sigil's upcoming game too).<br />
<br />
5.  Knights are defensive based, we arent supposed to be all that great with weapons, its the price we pay for our spells, and we don't really miss much more than other classes, this calculation is based more on level than actual skills for some screwed up reason.  With that said, Kunark took our poor damage to an extreme, my pet outdamaged me while I was using the best Pre-VP weapon there was.<br />
<br />
6.  Warriors aren't the only true raid tank, remember if you can keep a non disced Warrior alive on something you can usually keep a Knight alive.  Knights tank quite a bit with PoP and LDoN, this is good actually, the problem comes from the fact that tanking doesn't really stack so people get left out.  Personally, I have tanked every encounter in time minus TZ, RZ, and Quarm.  Are Warriors better tanks?  No question about it, they definatley are (and should be), but we are capable of doing the job as well.  <br />
<br />
7.  Defensive needs to be removed from the game, thats all there is to it, that discipline screwed this game and it screwed more than just Warriors.  It was responsible for our tanking problems in Kunark, Velious, and Luclin, it has forced mob dps to be geared for a defensive Warrior as well, and in some cases (Quarm) it has forced mobs to hit extremly hard to ensure that only a Warrior can tank it (non disced hes capable of hitting for 15200 damage a round, 1 roundings on Quarm aren't uncommon).<br />
<br />
8.  The HP gap between Warriors and Knights is closing, it has closed 5 times now, and Warriors have been given 4 upgrades to fix it, and each time it has just been a static upgrade which cannot account for mudflation or even different levels of gear (Ssra vs VT for example), what Warriors need in order to fix this is to have their HP/level and Sta tables placed on the same as Knights (read on before flaming) after this is done give Warriors an innate 13.5% Natural Durability type mod, starting at level 1.  Make it apply to gear, base hp, and sta.  There, the HP gap is permanently fixed from that point on.<br />
<br />
9.  Unfortunatley, Warriors don't understand that Knights (and all hybrids) have more than 3 primary stats to look at.  If we go for all hp/atk/ac we lose the focus which is required to make our spells effective, a hybrid gains strength from different areas if you focus on just one point you end up weak overall.  Let me give an example:  A K goes for a straight tanking setup, he goes 1h, ignores all focus/ft, and maximizes only HP/AC.  In top level time gear he would be around 8000 hp, 2050 ac, 5500 mana, 1203 ATK, 17% shielding, 10% avoidence, and an FT of 6.. maybe, all focus minus Disease DD focus would be missing.  This would mean you would be able to heal yourself for 470 hp every 14 sec at a cost of 5% mana per cast, have your dots at minimal efficency, and deal nothing for damage.  In short, you would be absolutely useless unless you were being hit.  Now take a balanced SK, with top level time gear you would be looking at 7600 hp, 2000 ac, 6800 mana, 1453 atk, 8% shielding, 0 avoidence, 15 FT, 35% magic focus, 35% disease focus, 20% dot focus, and 20% mana preservation.  Now you're able to heal yourself decently, do damage, tank respesctfully, and most importantly, can fill in all roles your class is supposed to.  This argument about if a hybrid takes xxxxxxx loot they're as good as us is bullshit, 1.  We arent as good were still worse and 2.  We need to be versatile, Knights who look at just a couple stats sell themselves and their guilds short.<br />

We make plenty of sacrifices on time gear, Amulet of Crystal Dreams vs Phase 5 necks, Ring of Thunderous Forces vs higher hp/ac rings, Armguards of the Brute vs Elemental, RZ mask vs Bertox mask, Elemental legs v CT legs, etc... I could go on if you want, but these are all correct comparisons for every one of those items we have to give up either a part of our damage dealing or spell casting capability to tank.<br />
<br />
Relevent to exp groups how? Oh, and out of curiousity, if we get passed over for exp groups how do you expect us to get the exp to get to the level required to tank those highest encounters?<br />
<br />
Correct, raid balance has nothing to do with exp group balance, SK's (can't speak for Paladins) would like fairness and get a better raid role though, just like you would like fairness and have a better exp group role.<br />
<br />
Again, how is this relevent? Neither knights nor warriors are DPS classes and neither are invited to groups for DPS (unless it's versus undead and then the (mis)conception about pally uber DPS versus undead leans towards them).<br />
<br />
While melee DPS is not directly focus of either of our classes, our damage does add up in adventures where you have a time limit, plus it means more aggro for us, with both of us just meleeing and using the same weapon (Vanazir for example, or even GoC for me Vanazir for you), in straight melee you will outaggro me.  Oh, and Paladins do way to much damage to undead mobs, I'm looking at the parses I've taken of my guilds Paladins in time raids and looking at the DPS... it's crazy.</div></div><hr />

We can snare, fear, fd, invis, summon a pet, nuke, buff ourselves.  Pallies get stuns, heals, buffs, root.  What do warriors get?  The ability to tank marginally better and their what, 3 mins of glory on raids?  Remember they have no utility (unless you count /shield and defensive, but i think ill keep our utility over theirs =P) where as knights have a ton.  They should be the best tanks period for that trade off.<br />
<br />
I hate the ignorant position of we used to suck, now they should suffer.  If anything we should be more sympathetic, being we were once the red head step child of classes, and work toward ways toward a more even class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nope, that doesn't work. That was Kunark. And the utility existed prior to PoP yet the average number of sk's at 60 on MT or Saryrn (the servers i've been on) in primetime was 13-15. Utility doesn't get you groups. In a team game people pick balanced groups of specialists to be most effective, render any class the absolute best at something and you make all others who fill that role redundant. <br />
<br />
Frankly it's bizarre to point to the problems caused by warriors one-dimensional specialisation and say &quot;well, they need more of that&quot;. They are terribly imbalanced because if they're not MT they're spare wheels. Controllably applied aggro and some changes to allow them a sense of usefulness when not fulfilling their primary role, yes, &quot;best tank period&quot;, no.</div></div><hr />

I am more annoyed at the conventional wisdom that seems to be driving this debate about warriors and their taunting ability and that is &quot;warriors are (or should be) the BEST tank&quot; and that tanking ability has become defined by taunt.  Warriors should be one of the choices for a tanking class, and a viable one (which they are).  No class should have the monopoly on any position in a group.<br />
<br />
The knight classes have always, let me repeat ALWAYS, been able to generate much better snap aggro than warriors.  This &quot;problem&quot; is nothing new.  In fact the gap in our taunting abilities is less now than it used to be.<br />
<br />
Its just that in the old world of pulling to a static camp in an outdoor zone, the taunt issue was never that much of a problem.  In a fast paced dungeon environment it has become more noticable.</div></div><hr />

Darko, you kinda shot yourself in the foot with that argument.  <br />

Actually no not really, a good chunk of my damage is mana dependent and only in the end game is my sustained damage (sustained in most situations not all) higher than that of a warrior.<br />
<br />
And no that is not unbalancing cause in the end game warriors are far superior tanking wise, so it is only natural for me to have more damage.<br />

So give warriors better snap agro for exp only and convert their hp bonus into a % like Brael already outlined and finally stop making these retarded threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Back when I was fighting in Dreadlands on the wall of Karnor's, there weren't aggro problems to speak of for a number of reasons.  One was that the &quot;supertwink&quot; of the Luclin era didn't exist yet, so even somebody that was completely untwinked wasn't completely overshadowed by somebody that was, with a few exceptions.  The puller was usually the tank, so he or she already had the initial aggro from the pull.  The mobs weren't able to take half of the tanks hitpoints in one round of attacks, so people didn't bother to cast slow.  Mobs didn't have hitpoint totals a good ten times larger than the person tanking them, so they didn't take over a minute to kill.  KEI didn't exist, Flowing Thought didn't exist, Focus Effects didn't exist, so wizards and mages weren't constantly casting, and they certainly weren't landing critical blasts, so they weren't stealing aggro anywhere near as fast.  And lastly, and perhaps most importantly in my opinion, people could afford to wait for taunt to work if they overaggroed because they could take a round or two of attacks without folding like a cheap lawn chair.  Everybody makes a huge deal about the hitpoint differential between warriors and knights, but what about the hitpoint and AC differential between any of the three tank classes and any of the dress casters?  Granted, the most uber of wizards will have enough hitpoints to be able to tank a normal LDoN adventure if he has to, but what about the non-uber people who don't go raiding Elemental Planes or Vex Thal?  When mobs have the ability to quad hit for 750 and you only have 2500-3000 buffed hitpoints, and no mitigation or avoidance to speak of, you're in for a world of hurt.  Things are certainly out of whack, and the ones who seem to be suffering the most right now are Warriors and Monks.  I also don't see any easy fix that will make things work the way I'd like to see, but then again I'm of the opinion that people with at least 3/4 of a brain should be able to work within the limitations the game imposes and still be successful.<br />

ACtually the 2nd part of my post wasnt directed at you, but at thread starter and people who support thing along the lines.  It was more on a non sequitar line of thought supporting breal then attacking you.  Sorry if it came off that that I was putting you with those people who are &quot;we sucked, now you suck&quot;.  I didnt mean it that way.<br />
<br />
But back to what I said, we start infringing on warriors tanking abilities toward the higher end of the game.  Pre VT (which the level my guild is at, 1st emp killed sunday =D) I think the balance of tanking is fine.  The tanking balance thing was directed more toward the end game type warriors, where their % margin of tanking advantage, measured as HP, decreases from a strong 20% ish advantage to a much weaker 10% ish advantage.  And your wrong about our utility.  We use our utility (spells) to produce agro, which in turn helps us find groups.  Also we use our utility to in so many situations that we tend to forget how much we have and how useful it is.  I never realized how much we had till I started playing ALts and started missing things like snare and FD (shammy alt btw).  Now imagine a warrior, they cant invis so getting around become much more difficult.  They cant FD to escape bad situation or use it as a pulling tool.  They cant snare nor fear which can be both used as a soloing device or an escape method.  They have none of these things.  Don't discount our utility, its a huge trade off.<br />
<br />
Edit: and the problem didnt start with the dungeon environment, it started when Mob DPS got so high that people could ( and would) die if/when a warrior lost agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ok, a total brainstorm, but I wanted to throw a twist on the conversation a bit...<br />
<br />
since warriors are &quot;the&quot; MT on boss encounters on raids, this means certain attention has to be paid to the warriors in the guild ( aka gear ). LDoN is about gear - AA is not bad, and neither is plat...for now anyhow...but LDoN is really a way for nonraiders to get decent gear. Now, with this train of thought, yes, knights are useful in raids, and there is knight gear, but knights tanking shine most in groups. Warriors tank in groups, and can get LDoN gear, but shine in raids as MT.<br />
<br />
Do you see where I am going with this? Sure, there were many a warrior /LFG before LDoN, but LDoN has really started the outcry. Sure there are raiding knights, and there are nonraiding warriors, but maybe, JUST maybe, the way things are, is the way they are suppose to be? MAYBE warriors trying for LDoN groups are meant to have a hard time finding a group, just as knights have 'specific roles' ( aka, not as high a demand as warriors ) in raiding.<br />
<br />
Like I said, TOTAL brainstorm, and a twist I wanted to add to the conversation. *thinking outside the box</div></div><hr />

We have a 24 page argument on this exact topic on the same page as this one. There isn't much left to say that hasn't been said on that thread.

Olddreadlord is a troll, nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thuggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm so sick of the word utility being flung around like it's the alpha and the omega of being a SK.  We are not one armed warriors who were gifted with a spell book because Absor loves us.  We are Shadow Knights a complete and seperate entity from warriors.  Spells are as intrinsic to us as our weapons are.<br />
<br />
I always thought our utility spells were bobbing corpse, dead eye, gather shadows, etc and there are certainly large numbers of items that can duplicate these effects.  Our lifetaps, snares, dots, fears, etc. are not utility; these are our bread and butter.  If you consider them utility you are believing too much warrior propaganda.<br />
<br />
Soloing.  I hate soloing.  I did it when I had to when I was leveling up because at that time warriors were the only viable tank.  I grouped as much as I could and solo'd when there was no other choice.  I will count the number of times I've solo'd over the past year on one finger for you.  Soloing takes the MMO out of MMORPG, it's no damn fun.  I assure you warriors, you aren't missing anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok what utility does a warrior have?  Snare has no utility value? fear has none? what about Fd? invis?  Err sorry wouldnt trade that &quot;overrated&quot; utility for about a 20% better tanking ability defensive sheild and aetaunt.<br />
<br />
Sorry tanking is the only thing warriors have.  Improving high end tanks to the margin they naturaly enoyed throught out the rest of the game is really a bad thing?  <br />
<br />
Also they do need help in agro.  You can let them generate agro all day but they really cant keep up in the world of 4k nukes and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yes it's a really bad thing. Tanking doesn't stack at all. Improve the individual warrior and you do damn all for the other warriors hanging about waiting for their turn to press Defensive.

<br />
And utility counts for nothing in getting groups. You cannot on the one hand contend that people are so uptight about efficiency that the difference between knight and warrior aggro is a deal-breaker, but then all of a sudden they're so relaxed about maximising groups we can pretend knights will get spots because they have &quot;utility&quot;. <br />

You cure a one-dimensional class that lacks utility by adding utility. Not further specialising it back to the point that two other classes are redundant in their primary role.</div></div><hr />

I certainly don't believe it is beyond the ken of man to give warriors something to do when not tanking. They did after all work out what they wanted sk's to do eventually.

I just don't think that fixing the aggro issue alone results in a balanced warrior. <br />
<br />
The problem with the suggestion about further increasing hp/ac warriors seems to me to be that you just further reduce the need to have any more than one or two warriors hanging around. I don't have any objection to the existence of an hp/ac gap at all. It's that concentrating on that route seems to me to be following the vicious circle of specialisation warriors are stuck in, where they are great for the big mobs, but being great for the big mobs has stymied changes to other aspects of their class.<br />
<br />
Gameplay ought to give a sense for the player that the buttons you push have some influence on the game world, even if just on a hit-button-see-mob-go-boom level. Warriors pretty much hit buttons and wait to see if the RNG goes their way this time. Aggro is the most obvious and visible issue, it's just not the sole issue. Also suggestions that sk's get groups because of utility give me hives which rather colors my reply on this topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Nikumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I agree Synnoira, I left the SK class for about a year to play a warrior  (actually 2 warriors on different servers).  I came back to the SK because I found the warrior class incredibly boring to play (I still do).  After all if I wasn't the MT my whole combat consisted of hit autoattack,  recycle kick (or slam), until the mob was dead.  There were no options.  (I dabbled with a monk as well and left it for the same reason, although the monk could at least FD pull.)<br />
<br />
Warriors need some way to contribute to a group other than being a meatshield.  Stamina based &quot;spelllike&quot; abilities that contribute small effects (less than actual spells, but all related to combat) would add alot to the class.<br />
<br />
The only real choice a warrior has to make is whether to kick or slam (bash) on a caster mob to interrupt casting.<br />
<br />
Just off the top of my head I can think of several abilities that could eat stamina (or mana if they want to make warriors have a mana bar) and give some small effect.  Just make these abilities have very short activation times and relatively short durations.<br />
<br />
Improved Taunt - small % increase to aggro (stacks with voice line)<br />
<br />
Flanking - small % increase to damage while behind a mob<br />
<br />
Distraction - small AC debuff.<br />
<br />
Bleed - small damage DoT (stacks with each hit)<br />
<br />
Weapon Shield - small Damage Shield (stacks with other damage shields)<br />
<br />
Shield Block - moderate +% to block while using shield<br />
<br />
Dodge - small +% to dodge<br />
<br />
Finesse - moderate +% to damage while dual wielding<br />
<br />
Furious Attack - moderate +% chance to crit<br />
<br />
Rage - all crits are crippling blows, lower warriors ac<br />

That took about 5 mins......I'm sure others can think of more....<br />

Ooh,they're the raid tank. WTF do you do with them anywhere else? Multiple SK/Paladins aren't redundant at the same level multiple warriors become. Is it any wonder the pissiest PC in Everquest plays a warrior? They deserve to be pissed. You'd be pissed if all you were was /defensive dummy.<br />
 <br />
They need some combat techniques that have a player-restorable limit and are not disciplines/timered abilities. We don't need to see warriors with a Harmtouch/LoH type trick. But they need something at the same levels that us &quot;hybrid&quot; melees get. We develop as a class from 9th on up, paladins actually do so even more. Warriors stagnate by comparison.<br />

Stamina-based techniques would work. A solution should use the least amount of coding resources possible- the less new code, the less likely it's fucked-up to begin with.<br />

From making unholyaura being disease based, to change the name of the undead Spears to Scythes, with Harmshield and pet buffs added to our spell lineup as well as fast acting dots such as Blood of Hate, even the orientation of the class between being defensive or offensive based back on Kunark was a community choice and theres certainly more that im not thinking of right now.<br />

Now, multiple classes can fill the critical roles.<br />
Pal, SK, War can all tank fine<br />
Ench, Brd, Shm, BST can all slow fine<br />

Cle, Dru, Sham can all heal fine<br />

The differences between all those classes is what they bring along with their main focus.<br />

The problem with the old specialist classes, its while still being superior to the other classes in their field, the other classes can fit the spots just fine. This means, the other stuff brough on the table become relevant.<br />

The Warrior community must stop to look so badly toward alternative abilities. Yes, they do need an agro boost, but to gain some non tanking related abilities would make the class much more healthy.<br />
<br />
To ask for tanking power and say fuck to everything else was a good choice back on Kunark for them : this made the other tank classes obsolete and they got monopoly of tank spots.<br />
<br />
This is not possible anymore, the developpers finally understood its much more healthy for the game to have multiple classes able to fill the critical roles, so the warriors cannot hope to gain monopoly of tanking anymore. While tanking must remain their primary focus as a class, they must start to look somewhere else as 2nd and 3rd ability.<br />
<br />
Not only making the warrior class more &quot;hybrid like&quot; will make it more healthy, but this will also add a lot of fun to the gameplay experience of this class.</div></div><hr />

The differences between all those classes is what they bring along with their main focus.<br />
<br />
The problem with the old specialist classes, its while still being superior to the other classes in their field, the other classes can fit the spots just fine. This means, the other stuff brough on the table become relevant.<br />

I think smurfette is spot on here.  Aside from adressing snap agro the best thing SoE can do is to add more utility to warriors.  Personally, one of the things I think would be great would be to make shielding a viable ability with a quick refresh; that'd be something unique and probably very much in demand...our &quot;stranglehold&quot; on agro wouldn't mean so much if, in exchange, you get a tank that can save you with damage absorption while re-establishing agro.  Other &quot;fun&quot; things are the way to go; it's a game, and at this point in EQ, playing a 1-diminsional class is not that fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Frankly, I think the reason warriors hold onto the ability to tank at the top is very simple.<br />
 <br />
They're deficient elsewhere.<br />
 <br />
Given more useful things spread out over the levels, warriors would BE more useful in the long run- and not bored to tears.<br />
 <br />
EQOA had the right idea in that regard, as I'm betting EQ 2 does. Heck, in EQ2 that's essentially what's going to happen. We'll all progress from a base melee class and develop unique abilities from there.<br />
 <br />
Warriors are a base melee class with an under-developed ability set compared to paladins and knights.  Give them the tools and reasons to fit in other than a MA role on raids at high levels and the class will -shine- compared to it's current state, and life is good. Warriors hold on to the &quot;tank the ubermob&quot; ability for dear life because it's all they -can- hold on to. That's just wrong.<br />
 <br />
Paladins are &quot;social&quot; meleers with their clerical-style spells (not that all of them are, of course!). We're more &quot;selfish&quot; but the Torrent/Bite lines let us share as well. Warriors might well do best as the most &quot;selfish&quot; of us all- though I'm betting those techniques would benefit a party as well as a soloing Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Darkreapyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">humm Techniques that could benefit groups like auras would be nice but not use a spell slot or bard slot<br />

One thing that warriors NEVER bring up is gear based abilities.  The fact of the matter is, all discusion about utility issues MUST include every ability available to warriors through items.<br />

<br />
Want to know an aa I think would solve warrior issues for good?  The proc button.  Require all three levels of ingenuity.  Creates a button that causes your primary weapon to proc in its next hit, and the button grey out for an amount of time dependent on the proc rate of the weapon.  Have this time allow half as many procs at first level (double normal time), 75% as many procs at second level (1.5 normal time), and same proc rate at third level (1.0 normal time).<br />
<br />
I.E.  if a weapon proc'd an average of 2 times per minute, the grey out time would be 60 seconds at first level, 45 at second level and 30 at third level.<br />
<br />
There you have it, a gear based solution to the warrior problem, giving them the snare, the stun, the whatever combat utility they feel they need in a warrior based manner via the ability to TIME the use of their EXISTING gear selection.  Enough of this &quot;i need to tank better&quot; bs.</div></div><hr />

Let's see. Invis? Cloudy potion. EB? Fishbone/Lodi ring/whatever. See invis? Summon throwing items? Damage shield?<br />

These are somehow related to the fact that the warrior sits there and hits autoattack and not bloody much else? Fear doesn't lose it's utility at high levels- it goes from being a kite method to a superb taunt method.<br />
<br />
Allowing proc-on-demand? No. Broken from day 1. We'll start with a Tash stick *click* then a Willsapper *click* and we'll pick and choose from there.<br />

<br />
What I have seen in groups and raids to date is the belief that just because Knights CAN take aggro from a Warrior; that doesn’t mean it is the right thing to do. The same is true of Casters with powerful nukes. Aggro management is the groups responsibility and not a function of which class has an iron-clad aggro lock. Certainly Warriors seem well-equipped to take the punishment and to deal it. That they cannot raise aggro as well as a knight to me appears to be a disadvantage that levels their melee ability. Sure we can GET aggro well, but we will do less with it than a Warrior so it is in our best interests to help the Warrior hold aggro. I have offered Voice-line spells in group and Raid and have received favourable responses. To me this is group/raid members working together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Lyrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Well.. to start off i havent seen this posted once yet.. yes wars tank mobs that hit for 3k+ and possibly 2k+ depending on availability of wars but who the hell you think tanks everything else on a raid? SK/Pal ma/sa (not in that order) We tank damn near 95% of the content in game, yes in time too. I run about 9.4k hp raid buffed im lacking maybe 800hp under the avg guild war, i mean 800hp more would be nice but 800hp is by no means 12% dif in hp, hell pals run 9.75k, i dont knwo where the original poster pulled 12% from. More like avg of 5 - 10% maybe. I mean yeah wars have suq intial aggro but you know what, unless a pal or sk is chain casting that war in a couple secs will by all means out aggro his ass and hell keep the aggro. Wars dont need new skills they need skill, plain and simple. Ive seen some wars do some awesome shit with aggro, this is 4 pages of useless ranting about several subjects. (FYI the mellee/caster balance issue is being worked atm, SOE is having a hard time deciding how to scale mellee dmg to casters, and any 65sk with a decent weapon should outdmg a war by ohh 20dps atleast) This wasnt meant to offend anyone just a little insite into the EP - Time scale of the class'. And i swear to god if any of you bitches about AA ill slap you, there isnt a damn thing you should have a prob with as far as that goes. WTB disease cloud aggro back though =P<br />

1. All those items are hybrid capable to. So not only do we get them, you get them, but don't have to spend any mana on it. Explain how that helps us out, when you can do it, too? It doesn't.<br />
<br />
2. We won't stop the &quot; 'we need to tank better'  bullshit&quot;. We need to tank a noticable difference at the 55+ game. You think 1khp is a big difference in the majority of zones where people exp? It's not. At the MOST it's 2 hits, most of the time not even. So, no. We won't cut the &quot; 'we need to tank better' bullshit,&quot; as you so elegantly stated.</div></div><hr />

You already tank better than us even with out disc, you take less spikes, its true that doesn make or brek a exp group but than again it shouldnt.<br />
<br />
If warriors took damage significantly better than knights, than why get a knight to tank? you think my pissant dps can match up with a rogue/wiz?<br />
<br />
For balance to be achieved in an exp situation all 3 tank classes need to be equal tanks, their only difference should be the other things they bring to the group, pally: heal/buf/res, sk: tap/dot/fd, a warrior needs abilites that will make them wanted, not better tanking.</div></div><hr />

Enchanter CAN bring lots of DPS via CoD pets, apart from CC and slow. So even they're not better than bard/bst, at least not worse, in most of the cases.</div></div><hr />

In the post you miquoted, I was commenting on how DPS is important for any class, mainly cause DPS stacks really well.  Also note that the post was made b4 the upgrade to hard missions patch.<br />
<br />
Now as far as CoD pets, 1st of all they are not always available, 2nd a chanter with a CoD pet is not able to CC nearly as well since they have to worry about the charm breaking etc, and 3rd a well geared bard brings more dps to a well geared group than a cod pet (with out hampering the bards CC)  4th beastlords are a DPS class with CC capabilities, that means even if you have a cc class a beastlord is still good, and 5th you are a clueless n00b.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time that reason lies in the fact that allot of SK's go by the letter of the spell.  Our Terror Line isnt all that great.  All things considered Clinging Darkness generates more agro faster and for cheaper than our Terror line.  Fear also works better.  SK's aren’t as easy as all that to play and it takes allot more testing to see what works better in what situation.<br />
<br />
And as far as Agro and Wars go, somewhere along the line an old tactic of Agro Management seems to have gotten lost.  What happened to the days when casters waited till the mob was at so and so level of health before they unleashed?  Seem these days in most groups caster just strait up unleash before the War has even captured agro.  Have they grown dependent on the Snap Agro of Pally/SK's?  Not all situations can be treated the same.  We all have to compensate the weaknesses of other classes while their strengths compensate for our weaknesses.  This seems to be lost these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Zantor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">With similar gear Warriors will always have more AC and HP and better Mitigation, SK's and Pally's always had the better aggro control.  As with all Classes you have to look at what it lacking and work on it to fix it, I know some warriors that keep prefect Aggro control, they get weapons that Proc alot, especially Planar Stun (Mobs hate that one).  At higher lvls for any SK / Pally to Tank well they need to focus on good gear, or as some do it, theyh prefer to be a offensive Sk / Pally instead of Defensive.  Me i 'm doing the Defenseive SK route and I put alot of time and effort into my gear (alot of PP to..hehe).  Warriors will always be needed for Raids.  I know alot in game and they always get groups.  In short, see what your lacking and get the items to improve, all classes are lacking something, don't bitch moan groan and complain about it.</div></div><hr />

They went away when exp mobs started to hit for 550/350 proc instead of 100/no proc. Remember during velious sometimes it was accepted that a shaman had to eat a death from an early slow because the tank wouldn't be able to survive to build up agro? And those only hit for 450 or so.<br />
<br />
SOE simply didn't realize that snap agro would become people's priority when they upped mob dmg output so drammatically with PoP, and when it became obvious the expansion was already out, they couldn't just take it back - so they're fixing warrior agro to make it keep pace with the game. Hell, why do you think mobs in LDoN hit for les than those in PoP? It's because they didn't want to make the gap between tanks even bigger, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Khayenkil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Just my 2cp worth on the subject. I dont claim to be a expert on the subject, nor even close to one. I have been playin eq since july 2001 and my first toon was a shadow knight and before i even installed the game on my harddrive i knew i wanted to be a shadow knight.<br />
  Basically the way i see it warriors still do what warriors did when eq first became a game... auto-attack... taunt kick... wait for recycle tuant kick. Sounds pretty boring to me. Thats why i <br />
didnt want to be a warrior. Nor did i want to be a true caster, sit, med, stand cast. I wanted the best of both worlds, might not be able to stand toe to toe w/ the mob but my spells give me an <br />
advantage. So I became a shadow knight... knowing that my spells are far lacking then others my lvl, and knowing that i dont have the hp/ac to stand toe-2- toe w/ certian mobs. That was my choice as was it the choice of each and every warrior out there.<br />
  I dont know that much about ldon as i have only done about a dozen adventures... i sure dont know much about the planes let alone going on a planer raid.  But it seems to me that the classes<br />
are doing what the classes should, and there's only a lil bit that needs to be changed to bring warriors back to some of the glory they once had. Some added hp/ac and a better taunt.<br />
  Where the real problem lies in my opinion is in that soe made time limits on most if not all the ldon adventures, and it doesnt help that most casters have mana to burn. And alot of these casters dont know alot about grouping. The menality is nuke nuke nuke... and while they are casting the most damaging spells they have. Some of these casters rarely grouped before ldon came out... and then there's the player like me... Im not in a uba guild where we raid 5-7 nites a week. I dont have the best gear there is, so there for ldon is very apealing to me in that i can improve my crap gear or might get a chance for a nice drop.<br />
  Im not gonna say warriors sux... or that knights are the best tanks. Each class has its own unique style of play, as each person plays each class a lil differently. I have a 54 shammy (passed my sk due to the fact i didt know where to go, and can get in a group faster)  But my shammy has the mentality to stand<br />
toe to toe with mob rather then stand back with the cleric and casters.  And there for I get alot of &quot;silly shaman&quot; when i ask the chanter in our group for a haste. <br />
  I dont know maybe instead of nerfing the knights or making the warriors the supreame tanks again that maybe someone ought to give adventures more time to be completed, and maybe peeps that group alot should tell these casters that they can do just as much DoT ( damage over time) w/ 3  500 dmg spells as they<br />
can with one 1500 nuke that gets em all the agro they dont want.<br />
  I know that on my shammy i wait for the tank to get agro b4 i slow, debuff and maybe toss on one dot just for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
  /shrug... maybe we need better players not  just better characters.<br />
NOT SAYING IM A BETTER PLAYER... or anything remotely close to that.</div></div><hr />
