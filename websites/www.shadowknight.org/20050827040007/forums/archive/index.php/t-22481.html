Its empty all the time so no trains, and AA exp is good imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silku</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truncheon of Doom or wave crasher is not great stat wise but slow still works.  Either that or grab a shaman instead of a cleric =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would do Veksar.<br />
<br />
1 - Undead get harder as you go back, so you can tune the toughness to your character.<br />
<br />
2 - Both characters have better undead DPS.<br />
<br />
My tuning with my cleric goes like this.  If I can have a CHeal land that I can start at 50% health on my SK then I can 2 box it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to have a shaman but the guy who originally owned the account took it back after I got him to level 65 needless to say we dont talk anymore. Why I quit EQ this last time. I used to 3 box shaman cleric SK. Wasnt much I couldnt kill.<br />
<br />
Nothing I could of done oh well..<br />
<br />
I really dont feel like leveling another shaman to 65 either, man that would be grueling although these ldons seem to make it go fast. <br />
<br />
I have done LDoN's last few nights and gaining almsot a full aa after each one not to shabby..<br />
<br />
Since my return I have found it allot easier finding groups which is why I 3 oxed before got sick of yelling for one. Now I just need to work on my SK skills again figure out what spells I need loaded.. Been so damn long I forget what each one does.. of course I still need some of the hard to get spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is NPC in PoK that can send you to Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there not anymore of those stupid little roamers anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there an Exit or do I need to gate out some how.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhantes</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i just want to 2box with my sk/cleric i grab a kei and do like pov golems or hoh basements... main thing you want to avoid is summoners so that if your cheal is gonna land abit too late you can back off for a sec. With a 59 cleric grab a kei and maybe try pon hobgoblins or some such pov cave might also work...<br />
<br />
Make sure you get your cleric a horse if he dont have one start farming for one having a horse makes 2boxing with him a LOT simplier. Load up on DS banshee aura + cloak of luclin + have cleric cast his reverse DS spell and when he gets 65 if you see the 65 reverse ds for sale buy it, it lands evertime on exp mobs pretty much and helps alot. Say PoV golems should die in like 2-3mins with kei+horse+zbite your cleric should be able to stay FM if all he does is reverse ds and cheal you at about 50%...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilvir</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Inner AC with no AA's and very poor gear solo, so you can for sure do it 2 boxed.<br />
<br />
Can try the Deep as well, you will be alone for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I was thinking about the deep. Nobody likes going there I guess...<br />
<br />
If I could grind 2 to 3 AA's a day I would be happy thats with not much time to play either. So about 15 AA's a week would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cames</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So not much playing time and you want to 2 box an AA per hour?  Good luck sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kynan</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I say not much time to play I got about 4 hours a day. so 2 aa's and a few more on weekends. Thats my goal anyways. So 10 or so during week and weekend try to get 5. If I cant do it 2 boxing then I will return to doing LDoN's where it was screaming pretty good.<br />
<br />
I swear the experience in those LDoN's is suped up....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 62 - 65, I take all my toons to HoH.  But getting through 61 so I can go to HoH is the worst part; but what I've settled on now is PoN gargoyles (just beyond the PoNb guardians).  The gargolyes are all lvl 57, don't summon or enrage and can be single pulled without pacification, etc.  I can do about six before they start respawning and then I start over at the first one.  Generally a low traffic area, drops gems, and you can go afk pretty much if you need to because even if they fully respawn, there is no re-breaking/splitting to do.<br />
<br />
My gear now is much better than it was when I started xp grinding and 2-boxing here (see my pre-ldon alternate profile if you want to see how bad).  While it's certainly true it's easier for me now than it was previously, I had a druid bot as healer and he kept up just fine; without slow.  I took my retired-during-Luclin cleric from 60 to 65 there too a few months ago during a lull in guild activity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sadandroid</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in PoT near the PoK book stands Realm ...., she is a Due, who ports you to hate (just give her the soulstone you can buy in the Neriak Cleri Guild). There is no Zone Out so you have to port back (Port-hammer, potion..)<br />
With Clr/Sk you should easily handle the Tier I mobs near ZI. If you feel save go to the stairs before Maestro and try some Tier II mobs. <br />
There are some roamers, but I can tank 2 Tier I mobs without to much probs.</div></div><hr />
