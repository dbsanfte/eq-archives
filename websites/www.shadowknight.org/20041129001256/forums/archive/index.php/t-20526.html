On the Shaman's Crucible, in a GoD related discussion of possible improved shaman heals-over-time infringing on cleric heals in this thread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20190&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=3 we see:<br />

 Just to expand a bit on what Brenlo said:<br />
<br />
The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.<br />
<br />
The frequency of slow immune NPCs in Gates is also being looked at, and there is the possibility of some adjustment in certain areas if we find it necessary. Although this will likely only apply to a few specific areas where the concentration is especially high.<br />

Now here's where we can have a bit of fun.  Substitute &quot;Warriors&quot; for &quot;Clerics&quot;, and &quot;tank&quot; for &quot;heal&quot; and you get:<br />

While we certain maintain that warriors should be the best at tanking, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate tank in a single group setting.<br />

<br />
Could it be because of the petition they were making?<br />

I have not seen any SoE comment on any forum thread regarding the Knight tanking GoD trials issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meneltel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How many SK's in EQ compared to Shamans?  Sony may only care about the numbers of accounts and mains.  If far more shamans are mains, they are more likely listened to.  Since we have a hard class, may not be enough of us for Sony to listen to as we are below the required minimum number of accounts worth noticing.  Perhaps why Sony doesnt care about us is because there arent enough of us to make a difference or we are just not worth the hassle, in their eyes.<br />
