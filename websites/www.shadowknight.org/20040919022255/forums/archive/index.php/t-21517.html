<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I expect first three posts to be links flaming me telling me to do a search and hopefully one of them will provide a link of an old thread like this, I did a search didn't get resuslts I was looking for...<br />
<br />
To my understanding we have four GOD spells:<br />
Miasmic Spear (spear upgrade)<br />
Mental Horror (MC upgrade)<br />
Black Shroud (SoC upgrade)<br />
Ancient Bite of Chaos (ZB upgrade)<br />
<br />
I at the moment have none of these, I'm looking for some info on where they drop... I've heard Ancient Bite of Chaos is from Qvic (not getting that anyitme soon) and that Black shroud if from the turn in A taelosian Geomancers Stone, and I have heard they drop in Kod`Taz and beyond, but I dont' know off what mobs (random off any, named only, raid only?) Mental Horror and Miasmic Spear I heard drop in instanced zones + ferubi and barindu, okay so I know a whole lot of instanced GoD zones, 4 sewer trails 2 mountial trails 3 ikkinz trails... what ones do these two come out of, and are they random or off named, and same for ferubi/barindu are spells random here or only named<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate some of the requested info above and if you have mob names that you've gotten drops off of that would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm curious...  What search criterea did you use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, i did a quick search myself, and found everything I need. I'm not gonna post a link to that forum, because I'm an asshole. Try again. <br />
<br />
(Yay, just need one more of these for the three he said he expected)<br />
<br />
But anyway, I had Mental Horror drop for me (well, for the other SK in my group) the other day in Vxed off of a named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">only have mental horror so far, but i'm not real concerned about miasmic spear as its such a small upgrade.  that being said, mental horror is a great spell, especially for like table kite grps or situations when not tanking.  the duration and amount of mana stolen are much better its really quite a tasty spell<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only have black shroud, got that from the first Ikkinz raid trial. I've seen Mental horror drop in Kod from the one groupable names and heard of our spears dropping in sewers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got spear and the 105hp shield from a ____ the Lost in Lair (sewers 3).  In the spellbook and spellbar it reads Miasmic spear, as opposed to Miasmic Spear, heh.<br />
<br />
I got Black Shroud from a named aneuk in Kod'Taz, along with my earring.  I still find myself using mental corruption in most situations.  Mental Horror wru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mental horror/spear are from any instanced zone, maybe some others to, ive seen them both in sewers even</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viserys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And Miasmic spear with it's crappy resist adjustment is basically useless.  Usually a waste of mana because of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hardly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Miasmic spear is nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When your to the point where casting most spells actually lowers your DPS due to lost time melee'ing, spears are basically the only way to burn your mana for DPS gain.  Even if they are easily resisted, and their independent DPS potential is still lower than that of lifetaps, it's better to cast them than to either let your mana rot or cast something that'll lower your overall DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viserys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe I'm just frustrated seeing the full or large partial resists that DON'T happen with Spear of Decay.  But I'm certainly not letting mana rot by not casting a resisted spell over and over.</div></div><hr />

neglecting your spears is like disliking DPS. like Brael i always have 2 memmed for double blasts<br />
Spears blow, I never use them.<br />

<br />
and his parrot too~ ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viserys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I swear I saw a post of Lucy data somewhere that showed the Decay had a -200 resist check and Miasmic only had -25.<br />
<br />
Now I can't find it...I'm losing my mind.<br />
<br />
I just don't know why Miasmic is resisted where Decay is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">didn't miasmic originally have like -10 or -30 or something resist check? hehe checked lucy myself and appears it has none but i originally thought it had a mod if small.<br />
<br />
Hehe and yah window when i read brael's comment i remembered him originally saying that :) just chose to ignore it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Please explain to me,<br />
<br />
During EXP sewers instance, nameds are supposed to pop right when we enter the instance or after killing a large bunch of mobs and progressing through the sewer ? <br />
Every sewer are supposed to pop nameds ? I tested 3 crematoriums, stood 1+hours in all of them without seeing a named.<br />
<br />
Are the Trials Sewers largely harder than the XP ones ? (I found the XP ones easy, qanats excepted).</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding and experience is that after someone enters the expedition, X number of mobs will not be spawned. After roughly 20 minutes those X number of mobs that were not spawned initially will spawn. These X number of spawn locations have the chance of spawning a named.<br />
<br />
As far as getting 3 in a row with no named. That is definitely possible. I think I've seen up to 5 in a row with no named in them. But on average, for me i think it still averages about 1 named for every 2 dungeons, and sometimes you will get 2 or 3 named in a dungeon to bring it to a 1 to 2 ratio.<br />
<br />
As far as dificulty, I don't think there is any difference between the normal trash mobs in the xp and trial version. What is more difficult is anything that happens after certain events in the trial version. For example, in the lair expedition, the mobs that spawn after the initial hand in seem to be higher in level and hit harder. At least thats the way it seems to me.</div></div><hr />
