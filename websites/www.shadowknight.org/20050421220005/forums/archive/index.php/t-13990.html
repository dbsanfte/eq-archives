<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khristof Errdegahr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it worth the trouble to go for Greenmist with all the PoP weapons out there? Or is it more of a status type thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WHY !!!!!<br />
<br />
It's your first post so i'll go easy on you.<br />
<br />
First off all... when you surf to www.shadowknight.com you see a lot of forums. Now unless you are jacking off and just random clicking on the first links READ THEM. <br />
<br />
You will notice a forum called Greenmist: Unholy Khukri of Rile (http://forums.shadowknight.org/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=17) it's even has a subtitle &quot;Discussion about the Greenmist: Unholy Khukri of Rile Quest&quot;. WTF do you think it is for ?<br />
If you cant find it there, try finding &quot;the armory&quot; i'll keep that one for you to find out, must be a challange.<br />
<br />
Now also hidden on this board at the right upper corner is row with buttons, one is called &lt;a target=&quot;new&quot; href=&quot;http://forums.shadowknight.org/search.php?s=&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://forums.shadowknight.org/images/top_search.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. CLICK IT.<br />
<br />
Now before you do anything now, THINK, USE THAT FUCKING BRAIN and if that doesn't work, try the rangerboards.<br />
<br />
And for those that dont believe in the power link (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12482&amp;highlight=greenmist+better+weapon) <br />
But my patience in still providing links after i teached the way of the search is getting slim.</div></div><hr />

That was beautiful Jupke I would even say that was one of the best post you have made..<br />
<br />
Khristof, go play a paladin or ranger. You have to be one of the special people my mom always talks about..you ride around in a short yellow bus?? Next time why dont you use either the search button or if you cant find that use the power button and turn your comp off then, go down to the pawn shop and sell it because your to stupid to use one..And have no right to infect us with your lack of intellagence.<br />
<br />
and no dont even bother getting any quarters..unless your going to try to call someone that cares..which i dont see happening..<br />
<br />
Ba-bye now...</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to search for old posts, things might have changed since then. Maybe some new people to the forums will have something to add.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, I don't have a PoP weapon, so I don't know how Greenmist compares. I have a darkblood sword from Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Welcome to the SK boards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ouzestinkeefeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think if you are not in a very large guild, and if you like to solo, and are from lvl 50-60 or so, Greenmist is a pretty great weapon. As far as it being &quot;worth it&quot;, it's hard to quantify that. I hated some of the boring camping parts of the quest, but I have a small sense of pride in earning it - a little bit more since I think I may have been the first troll on my server to do so - and you just can't get that with something you bought in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Like they say about IC - if you are asking if it's worth the trouble, you probably shouldn't bother.<br />
<br />
And have no right to infect us with your lack of intellagence <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Geez, the search nazi's come out in force fast.<br />
<br />
I do think saying use search is disgraceful.<br />
<br />
But ... THERE IS A WHOLE FUCKING SECTION ON THE MESSAGES BOARDS ABOUT GREENMIST ... Moron.   Why should people bother to reply, when its obvious you can't even read.<br />
<br />
And fuck going easy, there is a whole area of the boards dedicated entirely to the Greenmist.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
I anwsered his question too Vici, instead of just complaining to me that i say he should use his brain, maybe you should try and click on the link. It's redirected to a discussing thread in the armory instead of just making a new one.</div></div><hr />

Ill answer this even though i now think your as stupid as the first guy..BECAUSE ITS NOT OLD POSTS IT HAS ITS OWN SECTION ON THE FIRST FUCKING PAGE YOU IDIOT!!! forums.shadowknight.org you can get to the it from here its not like its hidden or anything..<br />
<br />
I'm not going to search for old posts, things might have changed since then. Maybe some new people to the forums will have something to add. <br />
<br />
Im sorry your(and a moron) a lazy twit, are you paying for this board using up the HD space, so one of the mods have to take there TIME not yours and delete usless threads??? no you didnt think about that did you??<br />
<br />
 Well anyway, I don't have a PoP weapon, so I don't know how Greenmist compares. I have a darkblood sword from Luclin.  <br />
<br />
Well arent you just uber, what are you 12, and about 250lbs cause you havent gone out side and played in like 2years and mommy keeps feeding you twinkies by the truck load...<br />
<br />
Only thing that has changed is how lazy you people who come here expecting us to spoon feed your ass this info when you have posted in the wrong section..<br />
<br />
Now Vici please leave this board and never come back..and be happy Im not a mod cause I would have just baned your ass for not thinking of the poeple who are responcable for this SK board..and take up valuable space..so go take your twinkie eating ass and turn your comp off cause yet again your another one of the special people...and i dont mean the ones who are born with it you have grown in to it..<br />
<br />
Ok now go hook a garden hose up to the exhaust of the car and suck really really hard..ba-bye now.Retard!</div></div><hr />

Irony, Thy name is Antihero.  <br />
<br />
Ok so I cant spell all that well, BUT at least I can frelling use the damned search button and not start usless posts..<br />
<br />
You never seen me ask for something I could have found by using the search button or how about *my armor needs up grading I have 10million plat what should I..* Or how about posting about something that has to do with spells, and posting the questions in the armory...<br />
<br />
SO fine I cant spell as good as you..but Im not as stupid as the idiots who cant even after comeing to the page scroll down just alittle bit and see that where is a whole section to the greenmist..<br />
<br />
So thanks for picking on me for misspelling *Intelligence* (spell check is your friend)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">why do you guys act like children? I'm just saying that he asked the questions, and wanted to discuss it.<br />
<br />
Then just discuss what he asked. Instead of all the search button responses.<br />
<br />
It's funny you tell him he's not using his brain, that he's a moron. That I'm an idiot and retarded for posting. That I should be banned and never come back.<br />
<br />
I came here to discuss changes to the game and get some feedback from others who play EQ SK's. What I don't come here for is to read is people trying to cut each other down by calling names back and forth and people complaining about using the search button.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and looked over the Greenmist in the mean time, and I think it's not worth it to get. I think you should go for a PoP weapon, that's my plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*laugh*<br />
<br />
I'm as big a search button nazi as anyone at times, but get a grip, Jupke.  If you come unglued this badly seeing the same question asked more than once, what the hell are you doing on a message board? A simple &quot;See this discussion and try the Greenmist section&quot; would take care of it without getting spittle all over your monitor. :P<br />
<br />
Besides, that was only a 6.5 as &quot;use the search button&quot; rants go.  Okay, 7.5 for enthusiasm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sapper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/em Falls on the ground - Rolls around laughing uncontrolably!!!!<br />
<br />
Okay yah the newb should have done some reading before he got flamed to the hilt.  Totally agree - was it a bit harsh?  Well thats all in your opinion.  I personally don't really care but do think a few of the above posts are pretty damn funny.  <br />
<br />
It is pretty bad when your first post on the boards is HI and what about XXXX - which in turn has its OWN forum LOL - that shit is pretty damn funny.<br />
<br />
And as stated and If you have to ASK if the quest is JUST TO HARD and you don't KNOW if you want to do it then DON&quot;T!  <br />
<br />
Lastly - I love my Greenmist - Use it all the time and lvl 61.  If you want to see my lengthy post on why I like it and etc etc and all the SK nostalga FYI stuff search my posts in the GREENMIST forum - ROFL!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You search nazis KNOW you relish the opportunity to jump down people's throats.  If it weren't for these repeated questions, you'd all have nothing to do except sit at home refreshing the Arena (seeing nothing new to flame) while tweezing your nuthairs for hours on end.<br />
<br />
But whatever makes you sleep at night....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im shocked you guys jumped on him about search when theres a much better reason.  Why ask if a weapon is worth questing for?  Wtf does that mean?  Why give us absolutely no information?<br />
<br />
1. What are some of your guild's current targets?  If its old-world planes, yah its probably worth it.  If its VT its really not worth it at all.<br />
2. What level are you?<br />
3. What do you currently use as a primary weapon?<br />
4. WTF DO YOU MEAN BY 'WORTH IT?'<br />
<br />
Jesus dude, can you *try* to bring something to the table besides an unanswerable question?  This is all I can say ... when I was 54 and was in a planar guild I did the quest and it was worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Toltanus Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally, I prefer to be called a Search Quaker rather than a Search Communist.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Kristof... you should look at what your goals are in-game and see if the quest is worth it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is worth it because the whole quest is a lot of fun.  But it takes time-- you can't just decide to get Greenmist one day and have it the next.  There is a lot of faction work, a lot of camping, and it can be frustrating.  But all in all, I think it is worth it.<br />
<br />
But use the Search button next time... :p</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I mean, it's bad enough that he didn't use search or the proper forum, but he could have at least asked a solid logical answerable question.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i enjoy my greenmist very much. <br />
<br />
my equipment sucks ass (no my magelo isn't updated=P), and i use a blade stopper and the greenmist. the ratio on it is nice and the procc keeps me capped off when fear kiting, or not main tanking. when i'm main tanking the procc is just more HP flowing in. it proccs usualy 3-4 times a fight for me(tho usualy back to back so no extra benifit other than extended duration on the dot heh).<br />
<br />
dunno how it does in the dps department as i've never parsed it agasint anything else.<br />
<br />
plenty of folks coment on it too, makes you feel all warm an fuzzy<br />
<br />
i just know I like it and thats good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Chardrok,<br />
<br />
1)  Yes, Bick is helpful now.  There's something in the water.<br />
<br />
2) Just because it's funny in your head doesn't mean it reads that way.  Try saying it out loud in a room full of people next time.  If no one punches you, grimaces or leaves the room, you can post it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Khristof,<br />
<br />
In a word, if you Min/Max or are worried more about DPS and stats than you are questing, then no , it's not worth it, just ignore Greenmist and go on your merry way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jupke,<br />
<br />
Buck up brother, you did the right thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ouzestinkeefeets</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's just sad to see once more another question has devolved into silly bick-ering (was that a pun? lolzroflmaoomg) over someone asking a question. Yeah, you know what, it was sorta a stupid question. He could have made the basic effort to do a simple search. <br />
<br />
You guys claim that useless posts like this asking the same stupid questions (as if after 4 years of the shadowknight class there are really any truly insightful questions left) bring this board down and waste bandwidth, but I posit it's the use teh search people who are the problem. There are 2 pages of this thread now, with maybe 5 posts by people answering his question, with 19 more people arguing he should have searched, people saying the search gestapo need to relax, people attacking the search gestapo police, and then the usual juvenile dribble.<br />
<br />
People who play a game come here for more information. They sometimes ask questions that could be answered by searching first but didn't. Either make the effort to answer them, or just ignore them. It's tired already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rukog DethBryngr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good point.  Sidestepping the haters, here's my direct input on the GM.<br />
<br />
It is probably more of a status thing for me at this point...even when I got it last spring.<br />
<br />
The stats are ok...certainly not something that can compete well with current weapons, but then again...there's not a lot that came out of Kunark that still can.<br />
<br />
If you are a masochist and like to feel pain and desolation...do the Greenmist quest, especially if you aren't an Iksar.  I did faction work when it was still possible to park a pet and agro the Warslik Woods mobs all day...and factioning STILL drove me nuts.  You've got an even bigger hurdle now.<br />
<br />
Is it &quot;worth it&quot;?  If you are fighting only Kunark mobs/old planes now, then probably...especially if you have a decent shield to make it worth it.  With the big AC on Ssra mobs, it can't compare to big 2handers that will shine with their damage bonuses, but you do get kinda tingly seeing 100+ point hits on a 1 hander.<br />
<br />
The proc helps a little bit - but I wouldn't say it's an all-out reason to go for it on its own.<br />
<br />
All in all, if you like questing, then it might be something you'd enjoy working on.  If you don't anticipate getting better anytime soon, then it might be worth it.  One of the most group-focused item, the Greenish Metal Shard, can even be seen pretty regularly in the Bazaar these days.  And there are probably lots of Mirror MQ's sitting out there for you too.  But for most at this stage of the game, it's a &quot;personal triumph&quot; or status symbol.</div></div><hr />
