<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GROKKITT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told that the frame for shards is soloable is this true?<br />
Was thinking I could let pet take the remains while I do the drop n flop. Have you guys solod this?  I just hate bothering my guildies for shit like this. Didint find the info I needed via search <br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis, run through to the right room, FD off all traps and whatnot and wait for them to despawn, voila. Stand up and kill remains until the npc spawns.<br />
<br />
Did it a couple of weeks ago, simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GROKKITT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well yah, I meant specifically where is the best place to pull them to, so as to not agg the 4 arms and the robes? Ill figure it out ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You dont pull them.  The remains will die in 1 hit.  FD hop to right in front of them, stand up and kill them.  If it doesnt spawn the handin guy, lay back down for another round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's a small window of space you can stand on which you won't get aggro from the 4-arms above (this is on the remains platform).  Flop there, then stand up and flop again if you get aggro, move a tiny bit one way or another, repeat til you don't get aggro.  You can't be large-sized, you have to be at biggest, human sized.  Kill all the remains except the one closest to the cloaks out in the room (they will aggro).  Bring a gate potion so you don't have to flop back out. =)  It's very cool to get frame this way.</div></div><hr />
