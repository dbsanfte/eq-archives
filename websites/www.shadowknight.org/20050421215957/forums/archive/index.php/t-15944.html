Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kentsin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The explorers that drop the knives give that faction that the guard is on. By the time youve killed enough to get the amount of knives you need, you should be dubious or near dubious. If not, go back and kill more.<br />
<br />
I tried turning them in while he was threatening to me...you can't do it. Invis will drop if you try it like that, and if you try it FDed he will tell you he is busy. Just gotta kill more and get dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talonmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can also kill the goblins in LoIO and the Sarnak in LoIO for the correct hit.  As I recall, hes Legion of Cabilis faction.<br />
<br />
Fastest (most fun) way to get the faction I needed to do the turn in was to kill the level 1 goblins in WW (near the lake south of the giant fort.)  One wack, dead goblin.  Also a bunch of skellys pop there so you can pick up some more bone chips too.  Its not as big a hit as the explorer knives, but there are fewer negatives.</div></div><hr />
