But some times you have to reach over the table to grab the bag of chips.  And by reaching I mean posting on their forums.  And by grab I mean post.  And by bag of chips, I mean the post that SoE representatives will actually read.</div></div><hr />

4 years ago, I was pretty non-political.  Didn't give a fuck.  Since Bush has taken office (even after not even winning the electoral vote), and having had a chance to see what kind of person he is, and what kind of a president he is...  I think I'm most likely going to vote for Kerry.  Because he's not Bush.  I'm not Democratic.  I'm not Republican.  I'm not anything.  Bush is just plainly a bad president.<br />
<br />
I thought the 700 dead soldiers line was pretty good though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vaeluur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the soe boards are the worse waste of time i have seen....that being said let me comment ont he other half of this thread, which interests me a great deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
how does an american oil company gain money by allowing oil from the middle east into the market?  i would think that supply and demand would dictate that if we had only us oil, it would be a lot rarer, and therefore more expensive.  by lowering the market price of the product are they not making the profits lower?  price that shit at $20 a gallon and people will still pay till they cant get anymore.<br />
<br />
now, how many of you know someone from iraq?  i have had instructors from iraq, who have not been able to go home and see their families in 20+ years.  people who watched neighbors disapear after critisizing the sadam regime at neighborhood events.  chova and signa, you would be in some dark room being tourtured right now for your comments, and your family would peobably be with you.  as someone that has the means to stop this, shouldnt we?<br />
<br />
and the us soldiers are not saints by any means.  a larger number of those deaths than you would think comes from some backwoods hick not knowing about the culture or tradition of the region, and leads to actions that are offensive to the locals, who then defend their beliefs from the &quot;evil american&quot; that they were grown up being told about.  do you think we would have let the french help us as much in the revolution if they were pushing thier own culture and agenda into our fight?  i bet not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm a pussy huh derakolwtf?  I think you would find that painfully untrue if we met in RL asshole!!  Go ahead and vote for that dumbfuck Kerry.  I predict him to be the worse president in American history.  The guy has no character and will ruin us.  At least Bush has the balls to do whats right and stay with it.  And whats with the thinking that the military is somehow not for fighting?  Do you think any of those that died in the war were under the impression that it wasn't a possiblity?  The military isn't a big social program it's a killing machine to win wars through controlled violence.  When I was in I knew it was a possiblity, but that is the risk you take when you enlist.  Hell 700 killed in a year I believe that is by far the lowest deal toll we have ever had in a major war.  I realize that everyone of those killed has a family that is suffering, but that death toll is very very low.  It could be so much worse.  Alot more people are killed in accidents every year than that.  As you can see I am very political to, but I believe you should keep it where it belongs not on the SK boards.  So go fuck yourselfs!!</div></div><hr />

The people that DID 9/11 are already dead. That would be the hijackers. They're fucking ash like the rest. The conspirators and people behing 9/11 sure as fuck aren't in Iraq now are they? Osama? Osama who? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Osama Bin Laden was trained by americans to kill soviets. Now ur pet is against u.<br />
<br />
No weapons are found in Iraq, why did u attack them? nobody knows. Well everybody knows, oil -&gt; money and take under control an strategic country in next orient. Money for lives, and u are the country of freedom and democrathy. lol.<br />
<br />
I am spanish, i am from Madrid and on 11 March of this year, an islam terrorist group kill thousend of Spanish people. Why? because our president in that date was Mr. Aznar, another fucking fascist like ur president Bush, who help Bush in his crusade against islam people. At least our country had realized of that and now, thx god, Mr Aznar is no longer our president. We have a real Democrathy, no like urs, hehe Bush bought his charge, amazing.<br />
<br />
In Irak Bush is making State terrorism, u lost soldiers they are losing citizens, well the best army of world against people who fight for they country and the chance of an own culture, u are an Empire and wanna control all the world. All the empires has fallen before and u will fall. Ur country wanna make world follow ur &quot;culture&quot;(500 years? lol) and can not realize that are others countrys, other people who wanna keep his own CULTURE( more than 2K years).<br />
<br />
 I say u when i will say we, because we are ur allies, we must accept all ur &quot;democrathy&quot; says. That suck, but u got the money, the army and the rest of the world must follow urs thoughts or will be killed. (Chile's president, Salvador Allende, who was democrathic elected was derrocated by ur country, Pinochet take the control of Chile. Pinochet fascist dictator who follow ur orders. He killed thousends of Chile citizens. Great Job agains USA people, /clap)<br />

South Amreican,Orient and african people are Occidents slaves, they can not live this way and someday(it is happening now, terrorist attacks) they will kill us.<br />

<br />
And if we have this magical mass abundance of oil, then why the hell are Gas prices in America reaching record highs? I mean if we have access to all this oil in Iraq, Logic would dictate more oil at our disposal which would mean gas prices should be getting lower, not higher right?<br />

Spain take its army out of Irak because we are a democrathic country. BEFORE terrorist attack in Madrid, Mr Zapatero (Spain president now) tell us he will take out of Irak army if he win elections. 90% of spanish people said not to war when Mr Bush ask for help to Mr Aznar. Aznar went against people thoughts, he is out now.<br />

U already owns a lot of countries. hehe,u already nuke a lot of countries. U did what u want with a lot of countries.Why do u continue blocking Cuba? is Cuba ur enemy? when did Cuba attacked u? U say u block Cuba because Fidel is a dictator...how many dictators have u put the last 50 years? (Pinochet,Noriega,Sadam,etc...) No mates, u block Cuba because is Communist, heheh what a freedom country is U.S.A.<br />

 Who did ask u for help? do u think u are the wrold's heroes? or cant u live with others cultures and u nuke them to the end? <br />

U are all so funny, u are a sick country where ur citizens kills one others like nowhere in the world. U.S.A = Violence.<br />

U must read more books, not only pro-American books and watch less T.V.U must learn what is the world u are making, well now what is the wolrd u have made. <br />

<br />
Wow, it's amazing that I have to inform you about your own country's political situation.  Before the Madrid attacks, Aznar was handily beating Zapatero in the polls.  After the attacks, he lost favor and the attacks were directly linked to his defeat.  So no, not 90% of the population said no to war.  Only after the attacks did Aznar start losing significant support because I guess unlike Americans, spanish people don't feel they need to punish people who murder their citizens.<br />
<br />
&quot;hehe,u already nuke a lot of countries.&quot;  <br />
Really?  a lot?  Thought we only nuked Japan and uninhabited islands.  But I guess once again you know more than everyone else. <br />
<br />
&quot;No mates, u block Cuba because is Communist, heheh what a freedom country is U.S.A.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're right, we do block them because they're communist...they're everything that goes against the American way.  And you know what?  we have every right to do it, so you can come kiss America's ass.<br />
<br />
And don't try to give me any bullshit about not knowing the outside world, I've travelled to many different countries and experienced many different cultures.

While I am definately a student of Wilson and Kennan (yes that's not a dichotomy), Um what did Cuba do?  Mmmmmmmm....Cuban missle Crisis, Bay of Pigs and Monroe Docterine will be your English lesson for the day.  Though your English is good.  We block cuba because during the cold-war when we were on a policy of mutual deterence, they asked us how much we'd give them and then they asked the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union bid much higher to get nukes 90 miles from the U.S. but never paid half what America offered.  Cuba is a bad example because they tried to play a game with international politics and lost.  Bay of Pigs only came when we knew we lost and tried to make any negotiation null and void.  By the Way, did you know we have one of our largest military bases is Cuba?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I am not entirely sure how this works but here goes. By the U.S. invading Iraq and &quot;securing&quot; the oil fields we have caused dissention in the oil markets. The U.N. was distributing Iraq's oil to other countries in trade for food in Iraq, though this went sour and the U.N. started taking bribes and skimming oil off the top for themselves (hence several countries not wanting to join into this war *surprise*). The U.S. then refused to let the U.N. take over the reformation of Iraq and the oil industry due to this fact. There is currently a hearing going on about this. Now, all the oil in Iraq that is being produced is being mass stored now due to export treaties being voided. And since Iraq was contributing 25% (not sure of %) of the worlds oil into the market, it has now left a gaping hole that needs to be filled OR raise the price of oil in general until Iraq's oil is released fully back onto the market. Well, of course now we are all paying $2.00 plus for a gallon of gas. <br />
<br />
If the United States had invaded Iraq purely and solely for their oil, I think we would have gone about it a little different. Though, if you think about it, who is making the most out of this ? Well, I would have to say the owners of the oil refinery's... and who owns those ?? Hehe. <br />
<br />
I wonder where the Bush family is going to retire ? Maybe they will just buy Iraq and get it over with.<br />
<br />
* Yes I am American and no I do not think we as American citizens went to Iraq for oil. I think Bush and his oil greedy father had a secret behind the scenes thing going on to profit from this war. Yet, I still believe we did the right thing in taking out a dictator like Saddam. If you have ever watched the History channel they did a really good documentary about Saddams life of crimes and the genocide he performed on millions of people. And yes, he killed (MURDERED) many... many people. When you see little babies laying on top of a pile of bodies that are blistered and discoulored due to chemicals... it makes you feel relieved to know his reign of terror is over. Almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Oskuro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">/agree Dkhar. U did the right thing taking Sadam out,he is a mudered, but we(i say we because my country helped urs) are killing citizens like him now.And before that, u put him there. U trained and financed his army. U trained Osama too. Now Osama is killing us, Osama is killing Occident people. MrBush and MrAznar are not losing friends or familiars(i do, i live in Madrid, some friends died in that fucking trains. I take that trains everyday, i am alive because this day, i dindt go to my University to protest against war, some friends went, they are die now). They are earning money with all of this shit. But people there and here continues voting them. Amazing.<br />
<br />
We (occident) must wonder why there are people who wanna die to kill us. Is so radikal. Someone can tell me is all about their religion, and is true, but i think islam terrorists are capted by people like osama because they are in a critical situation, they have no way out, they dont mind to die. And that is a big problem.<br />
<br />
We can solve this situation, we must help that countries, but not with armies, with money. Humanitary help. Making their countries a place where they can live in peace.<br />
<br />
90% of world wealth is under the hands of 4% of the world population. That is not fair.<br />

We tried this. Giving money and food in trade for oil was a big step forward in humanitarian aid for Iraq. It's a shame greedy countries like Russia, China and France took advantage of it. It's funny how they blame us for this war yet they were only hesitant at first because they feared we would find out about their bad deals when we tore down the mask of deception they had put up.<br />
<br />
And yes it is true we set Saddam up and aided him but back then they were in a different situation. Let's take my brother for an example. I once aided my brother, who is a shady kinda guy but he is my brother right. Well, after working with him for months he turned on me and stole my money. The point is, I gave someone a chance because I am an understanding and nice guy (in real life I'm too fucking nice), he screwed me over. I then beat his ass. <br />

<br />
You take one ignorant person and say all Americans don't know where Spain is?  Do you actually believe this or are you really that stupid?  Do you realize that in every country there are people that don't know their geography?  No, you probably think everyone in Spain knows where every country is in the world.  They probably know where America is, but guess what?  America is the most powerful country in the world and most people know where it is.  On the other hand, Spain is a beautiful country but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things (no offense mate but that's reality).  You also never responded to my argument about Aznar being ahead in the polls before the attacks.<br />

<br />
If this is true, then how come for every one immigrant that comes to Spain for an education 1000 come to America?  Guess they crave an inferior education huh?  And if the Spanish are so much smarter than Americans, why isn't Spain the most powerful country in the world?  Surely with such smart people you could develop technologies far greater than the most technologically advanced country in the world.

<br />
So because we nuked Japan 50 years ago, we can't take any military action now?  Well, I remember when Cortez came over from Spain and wiped out many of the cultures that lived in what is now South America.  Guess that means that Spain can never step in and prevent other countries from being wiped out.  You can't use what America did in the past to say that we can't take any actions now....that's very naive.  <br />

Typical Anti-American argument.  It's not Fidel making people die, it's America.  Get a clue bro.  <br />
And by the way, Fidel is a Communist, and don't get me started on your beloved Communist theories.  I know you'd rather have Spain be a communist country, but Democracy is the way to go if the people are willing to support it.  Communism works in theory but not in practice.  (Cite former Soviet Union, Vietnam, North Korea, China).<br />

Humanitary help has failed.  If you want I can list instance after instance of the U.S. spending billions of humanitary aid on countries only to have it squandered and go unappreciated.  The U.S. is the world's biggest provider of humanitary aid, but I don't see you mentioning that....most likely because you don't know that.  You ask me &quot;who asked the U.S. to be the hero?&quot;  Then you go on to say that we should provide humanitary aid to foreign countries.....well it looks like you asked us to be the hero &quot;mate&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Only because Americans are sick of the generalization.

We're losing the war? Pfft....when we went into fallujah we got about one third through the city, wiped out about 1000 insurgents, and then the insurgents got on their pussy knees and begged for a cease fire they didn't uphold. To say we're losing this war shows how ignorant you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do u think this &quot;war&quot; is only in Iraq, hahaha, well mate, do u think that ur american ass is safe in ur country, u can not stop violence with violence. This situation is a global situation, and not mate is not a war, is terrorism against state terrorism.<br />
<br />
&quot;krudler<br />
<br />
You take one ignorant person and say all Americans don't know where Spain is? Do you actually believe this or are you really that stupid? Do you realize that in every country there are people that don't know their geography? No, you probably think everyone in Spain knows where every country is in the world. They probably know where America is, but guess what? America is the most powerful country in the world and most people know where it is. On the other hand, Spain is a beautiful country but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things (no offense mate but that's reality).&quot;<br />
<br />
If someone like a nurse, a person with University studies doesnt know where is an european country, mate that show how low ur culture level is. U can be right, that nurse was an ignorant, then explain me how my friends can pass urs exams without studiying anything, explain me too why ur country stop consume  mexician food while was spain who take out their troops, the same happened with french chips(i dont know how do YOU call this kind of chips, but u stop consume that becasuse france dindt help u with war) when it was only ur name, in france that kind of chips are called diferente, etc. The most anoying thing was when the Bush presindent brother come to Spain and say we are a Republic, lol, we are not a Republic. That show how ur culture level is in average, like in every country in the world(spain too) there are diferent levels of culture, but the most important is the average. My god, a country that voted Bush, that is the most important signal of ur culture.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; You also never responded to my argument about Aznar being ahead in the polls before the attacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
lol,who told u that, NBC, CNN or what? stop watching ur t.v  mate. Mr Aznar dindt lose elections, he wasnt candidate, ingnorant.MrRajoy was his &quot;succesor&quot; and he lost elections because war, Prestige(ecological catastrophic? &lt;-sorry don know this word),corruption, and the most important thing, he lied us, he dont respect population thoughts and we are a democratict country(democrathy, greek word that mean people gobernement). When War begun, 90% of spanish people said not to war,Mr Aznar omited that because he thoughts his economic gestion will make us forget that, bu we didnt forget. Polls? do u want me to send u severals polls of that date of differents Spanish media?Each media was telling differents things.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If this is true, then how come for every one immigrant that comes to Spain for an education 1000 come to America? Guess they crave an inferior education huh? And if the Spanish are so much smarter than Americans, why isn't Spain the most powerful country in the world? Surely with such smart people you could develop technologies far greater than the most technologically advanced country in the world. Here's a tip: when arguing politics, use &quot;friends&quot; in a country as a source. &quot;<br />
<br />
U have the money mate, and spanish people only go to U.S.A to learn english. All spanish scientifics are in U.S.A because u have the money. And why do u have the money? because u invade a country, kill all their native population, kidnap people from africa to work free and then u beccame rich and powerful. It is all ur merit. lol.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about? Is this something else your &quot;friend&quot; told you? I wasn't happy about spain pulling out of IraQ but i didn't stop going to Taco Bell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hahahaha, u are so silly. What the hell is Taco Bell, heheh, do u think is Spanish? hahahahaha. With this name,Taco, it is must be Mexician. Mate we are not mexician,i have nothing against mexician, we are spanish. We are in the other side of Atlantic Ocean.Ignorant.<br />
<br />
&quot;So because we nuked Japan 50 years ago, we can't take any military action now? Well, I remember when Cortez came over from Spain and wiped out many of the cultures that lived in what is now South America. Guess that means that Spain can never step in and prevent other countries from being wiped out. You can't use what America did in the past to say that we can't take any actions now....that's very naive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ur problem is ur lack of history, u only have 500 yeras or so. When Cortes come to America and did what he did, spain was a kingdom,whit a king and a queen, medieval people do u know what i mean? not a democrathic country. When U.S.A nuked Japan, U.S.A was a democrathic country talking about human rights and freedom, so u can not compare that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical Anti-American argument. It's not Fidel making people die, it's America. Get a clue bro. <br />
And by the way, Fidel is a Communist, and don't get me started on your beloved Communist theories. I know you'd rather have Spain be a communist country, but Democracy is the way to go if the people are willing to support it. Communism works in theory but not in practice. (Cite former Soviet Union, Vietnam, North Korea, China).&quot;<br />
<br />
I said i hate Fidel, but ur block is making the situtaion worst. I think u dont know what communist is, and that is becasue ur political system only with 2 parties. In Spain there are communist political parties. And they are democraticts. That countries u have named were communist countries under the gob of a dictator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humanitary help has failed. If you want I can list instance after instance of the U.S. spending billions of humanitary aid on countries only to have it squandered and go unappreciated. The U.S. is the world's biggest provider of humanitary aid, but I don't see you mentioning that....most likely because you don't know that. You ask me &quot;who asked the U.S. to be the hero?&quot; Then you go on to say that we should provide humanitary aid to foreign countries.....well it looks like you asked us to be the hero &quot;mate&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here i must say sorry for my lack of english. When i say humanitary help, economic help, i mean we MUST STOP opress them to make us richers. And ur country is the most oppresive countrie in the world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Well, for one, I did not vote for Bush.<br />
<br />
In fact, Bush didn't even win the electoral vote.  It was so close, and they were going to do a recall in Florida, and before they counted them all (the revote), they claimed that it was taking too long, so they just went with Bush.<br />
<br />
So they hadn't counted all the electoral votes, and just announced Bush as the winner.  Think of it as a TKO in Boxing, only the other contender hadn't been knocked down 3 times.<br />
<br />
And so far... Bush hasn't done anything presidents don't do.  He's a retard, yes, but we can't impeach on that.<br />
<br />
Don't think that one's actions hold any weight in the decisions of our government.  If I had it my way, Bush would have been out of office after proclaiming that it was Mission Accomplished.  And then didn't withdraw our troops from Iraq.<br />
<br />
I do believe something needed to be done about Sadam.  And we did something.  And we just need to get the hell out.<br />
<br />
We didn't know all this shit would transpire if Bush was elected.  If I had the ability to see into the future...  I probably would have voted Gore, even though I think he is equal in retardation.<br />
<br />
Bush's term is almost up.  I'm almost positive he won't be re-elected.  I've seen a similar attitude in most Americans (that I've talked politics with).  I think Kerry will make a much better president than Bush, because most big issues I have with Bush, he has with Bush as well.  I'm not really political, I'm not a democrat, but it doesn't take much to see that Bush isn't the right choice for 2004.<br />
<br />
I guess you could say a lot of Americans are going &quot;...Oops&quot; right now.<br />
<br />
Democracy isn't perfect.  But it is better, in my opinion, than everything else out there.</div></div><hr />

As for getting out of Iraq we can't, the mentality over there is such that if you topple a dictator you end up having to be in charge if you disappear another who is just as bad will surface and all that gets accomplished is a few Americans died, alot of Iraqi's died, and a bunch of civilians probally die (not to mention get their hopes up for nothing).  That can't be done, you have to sit there and occupy it with the firepower to keep other dictators out until they have the ability to set up a stable government and a national defense.  Until then were pretty much responsible for keeping them safe from themselves so we can't leave.  This isn't anything new, we have bases in Germany and Japan because for 50+ years after WW2 neither is/was (not entirely sure if it's still in effect) allowed to have any sort of standing army.</div></div><hr />

Geography and medicine are two different things bro, and frankly if they don't know where some insignificant country like Spain is I don't give a rat's ass as long as they know how to treat their patients.  And you keep talking about your &quot;friends&quot;....what exams and what schools did they go to?  BACK UP YOUR STATEMENTS WITH FACTS.  Not a hard thing to do.  And as far as your classes and education being so much better than America's, most people from America that study abroad in Spain or other European countries do so because they know the classes there are much easier and they'll have a lot more time to experience the country.  I studied a semester in Spain and believe me, it was a complete joke.  I'm not saying that's indicative of the entire education system in Spain or not because unlike you I don't take one example and generalize an entire country based on that.  My American education taught me better than to do things like that.  It's just plain ignorant.  <br />
<br />
And yes, we voted for Bush.  And the fact that most of the European countries and the terrorists don't want bush re-elected is one of the reasons why I'm voting for Bush again.  He doesn't have to answer to insignificant foreign countries.  The only people that Bush is going to answer to are the American people when it's time to vote.  And I hate to break it to you, but if the elections were held today Bush would win and you'd have to deal with another four years of an American president who doesn't care about the interests of has-been countries.<br />

Haha you have to be the dumbest person on Earth.  For someone who talks about how smart you are, you can't even form a logical argument.  We kidnap people from Africa?  I assume you're talking about slavery, which no longer exists.  There's a news update.  You want to start talking about what countries did in the past?  When Spain actually mattered, they were an imperialistic nation that invaded other countries and enslaved the populations.  They wiped out entire civilizations in what is now South America.  Did your excellent education not teach you your country's history?  But the point is that doesn't matter....it happened a long time ago.  You say that America is the most powerful country in the world because of slavery?  If you actually believe this then you have very flawed logic.  We fought a war that destroyed much of our country that ended slavery, so no your point is not valid.  Please get your brain scanned.<br />
The truth is that people come to America because they know that if they work their asses off eventually it will pay off.  They don't call it the &quot;land of opportunity&quot; for nothing.<br />

No I don't think it's Spanish you moron.  I was using it as an example because you said americans stopped eating mexican food when Spain pulled it's troops out of Iraq.  Taco Bell is a &quot;mexican&quot; fast food restaurant, and no one stopped eating there.  No one stopped eating mexican food because Spain pulled its troops out of Iraq.

Hahahahahhahahahha......this has to be the quote of the day!  500 years huh?  Please do a little research before posting with your ignorant bullshit.  America has a little over 200 years.

<br />
Couldn't agree more with you Brael...  <br />
France does everything in its power to undermine our efforts in Iraq but when the war is over they're outraged that their country was taken off the list of countries that can bid on contracts.  <br />
<br />
We're expected to provide humanitary aid to other countries but then when we mention it they say that no one asked us to be the hero.<br />
<br />
The UN expects us to contribute troops for peacekeeping missions but when we try to defend ourselves we're called oppressors and imperialistic.    <br />
<br />
Frankly no matter what we do, they're not gonna like us.  The superpower envy is so great it has turned to hatred in many countries and there's nothing we can do to change their minds.  That's why when people say one of the problems with Bush is that he ignores much of the European community I'm not bothered.  They never said Clinton ignored the European community, and when he was president I distinctly remember many European countries burning effigies of him.  I also remember the hatred and animosity that was directed at me and many of my friends when we visited those countries during Clinton's presidency.  So we're damned if we do, damned if we don't.</div></div><hr />

And as far as your classes and education being so much better than America's, most people from America that study abroad in Spain or other European countries do so because they know the classes there are much easier and they'll have a lot more time to experience the country.<br />
<br />
Actually, i think you got that wrong, the european univeristy degrees are valued higher then the american ones.<br />
The european education system is rated the best in the world. <br />
<br />
Oh and krudler, you should stop posting too before you swallow in pride.<br />
<br />
The more posts I read from Europeans in general the more I start to believe that lots of these posts really are made out of jealousy, or the belief that double standards should exist for everything but only be of benefit to them for various stupid reasons.<br />
<br />
The more posts i read from Americans the more i start to believe that most of them are a bunch of rednecks that cant see past their own pride of ruling the world and hide behind their oh so great military power and weapons.<br />

And the Americas were not really &quot;discovered&quot; by Christopher Columbus.  They were already inhabited, and &quot;discovered&quot; prior to Columbus.  The American Indians that were here, had been here for thousands of years.  Immigrating over the Bearing Straight during the Ice Age.  He was the indirect cause of the European colonization, but I would in no way credit him for any sort of &quot;birth&quot; of our country.  The world is only so big.

Heehehe Krudler, i have understood all of u have wrotten. But u are who can not see far away of ur country. U.S.A is no the world u are part of the world. That is a fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't know how safe I am in America, but I know since 9/11 our homeland has been attacked one time less than Spain's. Looks like we're safer than spain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looks like u are safer? hahahaha, do u want numbers? how many people were murdered 9/11? how many were murdered in Madrid? I dont care how many, i dont care how many times, i only care there and here people were murdered and will be murdered in the future. Thx U.S.A for all of that. What a great nation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I studied a semester in Spain and believe me, it was a complete joke&quot;<br />
<br />
Where? and what did u study? Do u ask me for facts now tell me where did u study and what. I dont belive u have studied in Spain, a semester, tell me something in Spanish please. 6 months here sutdiying would make u able to write something in Spanish.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yes, we voted for Bush. And the fact that most of the European countries and the terrorists don't want bush re-elected is one of the reasons why I'm voting for Bush again. He doesn't have to answer to insignificant foreign countries. The only people that Bush is going to answer to are the American people when it's time to vote. And I hate to break it to you, but if the elections were held today Bush would win and you'd have to deal with another four years of an American president who doesn't care about the interests of has-been countries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do u really think that? do u know how nazi is that? Do u want ur supremacy over the rest of the world? I guess u want, and like u a lot of american people. Fucking fascist.<br />
<br />
&quot; You want to start talking about what countries did in the past? When Spain actually mattered, they were an imperialistic nation that invaded other countries and enslaved the populations. They wiped out entire civilizations in what is now South America&quot;<br />
<br />
Past, 50 years ago?, it is not the same something that a country did 500 years ago that something u did 50 years ago.I tell u again, Spain was a kingdom with king and queen, feudal country, <br />
u were a democrathic country when u nuked with nuclear weapons another country. It is not the same. But u dont care u take pride of kill japos, do u? I guess yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We fought a war that destroyed much of our country that ended slavery, so no your point is not valid. Please get your brain scanned.&quot;<br />
<br />
hahahahah when did black people in ur country get the same rights that white people? During ur civil war? dont make me laugh. Nowdays they are still being opressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can and will do what we want, regardless of how much that pisses you and your commy friends off. We have that right because we are the most powerful country in the world, and all of your ignorant bullshit posts won't do a thing to change that. Your argument about America not having any history makes it clear that you're extremely jealous of America. All of the years of history that Spain has doesn't make up for America's overwhelming economic and military power, and that's just something that European countries that were powerful in the past but have faded are just going to have to get used to. Deal with it.&quot;<br />

Mostly harmless except to property owners / businesses due to trying to restrict actions with personal property. Main goal seems to be to attack other liberals and accomplish nothing. <br />

~40% = Middle of the road, right side. Tend to vote republican. Most tend to be poorer or less eduicated although not all are. Gets all of their news from abc/cbs/cnn/fox and believes it to be true. Made reality TV and flags on cars popular. Main goal of this group is not to be fucked with. <br />

<br />
the total difference in the vote was less than 400,000 people (at Highest estimate), and who actually recieves the majority of votes is a matter that differs according to course. (though most say Gore won the popular election).<br />
<br />
Also in a republic such as we have, (note: the U.S. is a republic not a democracy), there will never be a candidate that completely represents all the beliefs of the voter.  Often we vote based on percieved ability to inact positive change rather than voting for a candidate with whom we totally agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i said democracy i mean ur presidnte was voted by the majority of the people. And if there will never be a candidate that compretely represents all the beliefs of the voter u would vote blank. To vote is a very important citizen responsability and in ur country is more important. U.S.A people vote for his president and for the most powerful person in the world. <br />

We don't need 3rd world countries who only keep themselves going on hatred of us being the ones who determine what we can and can't do.  Same logic as many other treaties we pulled out of, what about the human rights group in the UN?  It's run by the last people who should run it.  Oh ya, where was the rest of the world crying about what Iraq did to it's prisoners before we took it over?  What they would do as standard practice was far worse than anything we've done in extreme examples.  Hi double standard, we're better than them and have proved it with the way we treat our enemies.  What happened shouldn't happen but it did so punish the soldiers and go on with life it's a minor incident people are making a big deal out of.<br />
<br />
Often we vote based on percieved ability to inact positive change rather than voting for a candidate with whom we totally agree.<br />
<br />
Actually the last couple presidental elections it's just been voting for the least bad president.  I wish that just one election year there would be 3 of 4 really really great canidates where people had trouble deciding which one they liked the most but I don't see that happening any time soon.  As long as Republicians are in power Democrats are just going to turn any election to shit like they did with this one.  Kerry has yet to say one good thing he would do, it's just Bush is bad.<br />
<br />
Please dont vote Bush again, he is the worst president u have ever had. And belive me when i told u that ur exterior image is going down due this mad cowboy who has no respect for human life.<br />
<br />

Well, if you think you're insulting me by saying I have too much pride in my country, then I guess what you consider an insult I consider a compliment.  I love my country and am proud that I'm an American.  I wouldn't trade my citizenship for anything in the world.  Not really sure how I'd swallow in pride either.<br />
<br />
And Oskuro, I've given you every chance to back up your statements with facts, but you refuse to.  All you do is take one example and generalize my whole country.  If I wanted to I could say all Spanish people are ignorant morons because you are, but I don't.  I'm not going to generalize your whole country based on your stupidity.  I know that there are many in your country that are educated, informed, and rational....unlike you.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you are understanding what I'm saying, but you don't have the ability to respond logically.  You say blacks don't have the same rights as whites do in America, a black person responds and says he does, and you say he's just proud?  Once again either you didn't understand what he said or your logic is severely flawed.<br />
<br />
And if you must know, I studied for a semester at the University of Salamanca...Northwest of Madrid.  My focus was Spanish culture.  And I don't give a rat's ass if you don't believe me.  I'm not posting for your approval.</div></div><hr />

But just to say, you totally misunderstood my post. You said black people don't have rights. I said they do. Then you say I'm proud of it ? Errm. Yes. I am proud my country fought a war, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, just so I can have the same rights as the man next to me. Our ancestors screwed up, our government realized it.

Extreme examples? I dont think so, hundreds of iraq's prisioners were liberated yesterday and a lot of them told to international periodist that they were being tortured. U can belive ur gobernement explanation or u can belive the people who was there.  Torture was (or is) an standar practice. <br />

<br />
- C.I.A pull down Salvador Allende, democrathic president of Chile. He was Socialist so U.S.A didn like him. Instead U.S.A make Pinochet (fascist dictator) rules the country. Thousend of Chile people murdered.<br />
<br />
-U.S.A trained Osama Bin Laden. Now si our enemy.<br />
<br />
-U.S.A provides billions of dollar to Sadam, this way Sadama could buy weapons to kill Iranies.<br />
<br />
- C.I.A agent Manuel Noriega, pressident of Panama, disobeyed U.S.A orders, U.S.A invaded Panama and removed Noriega, thousends of Panama people murdered. <br />
<br />
- Bush father,(whata  family) invaded Irak because Irak had invaded Kuwait with american weapons. Dicatator of Kuwait could come back.<br />

If someone were to try and invade the US, they would meet resistance from the populace at every step. Which would lead to our 'civilians' deaths... so yea.

<br />
Do I have to remind you of Pearl Harbor and the Rape of Nanking?<br />
<br />
Now lets go back to 1945.....(way back machine is on)<br />
<br />
Japan is arming every citizen no matter how young or old to repel the invasion that is coming.  They are preaching the code of Bushido that tells people that its better to die than be captured (see the tapes of people jumping off the cliffs in Okinawa for examples of this at the time).  The estimated cost of invasion on both sides was in the millions of lives lost.  The bomb ended the war without this invasion.<br />
<br />
Now for Spain:<br />
<br />
- Shall we talk about the Spanish Inquisition?<br />
- How about the treatment of Spanish Jews?<br />
- How about the treatment of Moors?<br />
- How about the biological weapons launched into the Americas?<br />
- How about the enslavement of indigineous populations?<br />
- How about the Spanish Armada?<br />
- How about Franco?<br />
- How about having Hitler train his airforce on your forces of democracy?<br />
<br />
Before you give me a history lesson, I think you should look inward and realize you have about a 30 year history of democracy.  Before that Spain has long history of violence and torture. Tell me when you can say you were proud of Spanish actions in the 1930s - 1940s before you speak about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
<br />
Back then we faced evil in a State overt way.  Now we face evil in a state sponsored way.  Only thing to do is to root out the states, and you have to make one an example.  Otherwise nothing changes.  We have been living with this in the Middle East for 40 years.  Time for this crap to end.  And as usual, when Europe can't solve a problem on its front door...TheUS ends it.<br />

Do u really think so? i dont, Violence can not be used to stop violence. And please explain me how can U.S.A attack Irak with the pretext of Masive Destructions Weapons when u have that weapons and u have used taht weapons? hypocrisy?<br />
<br />
Well u have rebated one of the facts i have listed, u nuked japan to save lifes, extrange but at least is something.<br />
<br />
Lest go to the rest of urs &quot;facts&quot;:<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we talk about the Spanish Inquisition?&quot;<br />
&quot; How about the treatment of Spanish Jews?&quot;<br />
&quot; How about the treatment of Moors?&quot;<br />
&quot; How about the enslavement of indigineous populations?&quot;<br />
&quot; How about the Spanish Armada?&quot;<br />
<br />
500 yeras ago or more, spain was not a democrathic country. All the facts i have listed were done when U.S.A being a republic.<br />
<br />
&quot; How about the biological weapons launched into the Americas?&quot;<br />
<br />
What the hell are u talking about? when had Spain have biological weapons? oh my god, what a lack of knowledge.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Franco?&quot;<br />
<br />
heheh is funny u have mentioned Franco. Franco was a fascist dictator who help hitler and mussolini. Ok, but U.S.A support him after 2nd wolrd war. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about having Hitler train his airforce on your forces of democracy?&quot;<br />
<br />
what the hell are u talking again? how could hitler train his airforce on our forces of democracy if hitler lived when Franco (dictator, no democratic) rules Spain?<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you give me a history lesson, I think you should look inward and realize you have about a 30 year history of democracy. Before that Spain has long history of violence and torture. Tell me when you can say you were proud of Spanish actions in the 1930s - 1940s before you speak about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&quot;<br />
<br />
And again talkig about the same. First off all Spain has not 30 years history of democracy. Before Franco, we had a republic, and before that we had another republic. Well that was just information to grow up ur Spanish history level. I am not proud of whatever Spain did under a dictator gobernement or in the feudal age, is again the same problem, ur country did all of that things under a democratic gobernement.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as usual, when Europe can't solve a problem on its front door...TheUS ends it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes U.S.A will going to end it, and will going to kill a lot of people ending it.<br />
<br />

P.D: Cames dont write whatever u want, u have only demostrated how ignorant are u. Oh my god Spain launching biological weapons? hitler training his airforce in a democratic Spain? who told u that? Have u watched it on ur T.V? or it is just ur imagination...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Jaellah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Oskuro,<br />
You have a right to your opinion, which is as everyone does here. But have you been to Iraq? Have you seen what is going on there first hand? Do you have first hand knowledge of what you are talking about ..or is everything you are saying based on what you have heard or read somewhere?<br />
<br />
I think everything we know is based on what we assume by what we have read or heard, unless we have infact &quot;been there&quot; and it's ok to talk about it, but that doesnt make you an authority and to continually plead your cause is about as futile as trying to make a horse drink when you lead him to water and he's not thirsty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>frotty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">I have family in Iraq. I've read very little insight, and much jingoist chest thumping from pro-US actions here.<br />
<br />
What the US have done in Iraq is far, far, far, far, far beyond any simple summation done in a few sentences.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing is that in all of your posts there is a little bit of truth the question remains, however: WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE? <br />
<br />
Are you going to believe semi-neutral European media who on one hand easily dismiss our pseudo-monarchical colonization and rape of Iraq, where on the other hand somehow wish they could have the best of both worlds: a stabilized economy and social system AND a cash cow war machine.<br />
<br />
Are you going to believe jingoist American (republican) judeo-christian moral minority? They quickly rush to the side of Herr Bush and show pictures of the &quot;brutal torture&quot; done by Hussein (funny, last I checked people in Iraq were free to leave, which is how my family came to this country)  while they dismiss that he came into power mostly funded by Americans when we were at war with Iran in the 70s and 80s. Didja ever ask a GI how fucking awful it felt to be in Iraq and realize that the weaponry you were up against was in large part US made?<br />
<br />
Are you going to believe the elitist American (democratic) liberal media, who use their civil liberties at whim without understanding that things like us bombing the fuck out of other countries and us taking over various 3rd world economies and us funding a war machine allow us our &quot;arrogant&quot; opinions and freedoms? They seem to claim that this war and government stink, in spite of the war and government serving to protect their rights to think so.<br />
<br />
There's always the conspiracy theorists, who claim things like how Cheney and Bush orchestrated the 9/11 attacks via remote control of the liners, how the federal government sold off most all of their shares of stocks in companies which were centralised in the WTC. This wouldn't be the first time: there's publically available documentation of plans to orchestrate a Pearl Harbor like attack to give us an excuse to engage Japan in WWII, and to claim Cuban terrorists the culprit for an attack on US soil to allow us to eradicate them.<br />
<br />
Pick your side, but realize that any &quot;opinion&quot; you have has the following baggage along with it:<br />
<br />
~you're relying on a media source<br />
~said media source has a political agenda<br />
~you have an agenda in believing a certain source<br />
<br />
I just like looking at facts. And even then, these factoids are highly cooked and biased, all you can do is absorb a ton of sources and assume that somewhere where the data overlaps is the truth.<br />
<br />
*Haliburton was given an uncontested contract to provide &quot;oil security resources&quot; for billions of dollars LESS THAN A WEEK INTO OUR INVASION. Now, you can claim we're not there for oil, that we'd just do that to securing their commod. for the &quot;new government.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, the Euros aren't jealous ... they don't have the weaponry we do to kick ass and take shit that isn't ours in the name of &quot;justice.&quot; The Euros are crying foul that in the name of justice we'd implant our own goddamn companies to run the infrastructure of the country, rather than help building those companies, or, the second most obvious &amp; convenient choice, go through European contractors. Last I checked, Europe is closer to Iraq than we are. <br />
<br />
The haliburton contract didn't go through proposals. There wasn't a bidding war. The fucking actual amount of money they were profitting wasn't even written into the contract, it was: &quot;whatever it takes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally. Give us all a fucking break. Do you have any grasp of &quot;real life&quot;? Cheney is one of the head honchos at haliburton. I mean, jesus christ at least use some other fucking company that you have a lot of stock in or something less dicksmack on the forehead obvious?<br />
<br />
* The ~4,000 US lives killed in one day, in one action. Yes, it's sad. It's tragic. But it always is. What it isn't, is sad &quot;for america.&quot; That'd be like feeling sorry for the Goliath figure. <br />
<br />
See, we can carry out the largest bombing attack in the 20th century (remember Bosnia? Gee wasn't that such an important event? Three words: Secure Chromium Deposits), larger than anything the nazis did. A string of attacks that killed TENS OF THOUSANDS of civilians, both ally and &quot;enemy.&quot; And kill another FIFTY THOUSAND civilians in Iraq/Afghanistan but somehow the thorn in our paw is the worst pain the world should ever know and some assert actually JUSTIFIES our behavior?<br />
<br />
Interesting that 9/11 even gets brought up in a thread talking about Bush fucking up Iraq. I guess these few years will just be known as The War on the A-Rabs. <br />
<br />
At times I feel that the &quot;shock round the world&quot; about 9/11 was more about the bully finally getting a suckerpunch from &quot;his enemy&quot; than about the actual loss of life or &quot;civilian soldiers.&quot;<br />
<br />
*The good of the nation. The thing most of these posts ignore is that there is any possibility that people are really just fucking in it for themselves, that somehow there is simply no way that any government decision is anything but fair and just for the people of the world (who should all hold hands) as Evil and Pain are vanquished from the lands.<br />
<br />
A pessimistic viewpoint might sound like this:<br />
Government is clearly in place to enforce and modify a set of rules to protect the money-holders of this country. Those with more money in effect purchase politicians by contributing to their campaigns. Foreign policy is based on expanding said money-holders' interests. Outsourcing is currently supported by our government, as is mass destruction of a country to secure their resources for our use.(where are the WMDs? I dunno, perhaps falling out of american bombers?) <br />
<br />
Pretty simple, no? Put it in another way, in regards to the paper-democratization of Iraq: <br />
<br />
Pretend Iraq is a little retarded kid with candy.<br />
We are big and bad united states without candy and 2 baseball bats because in our culture, you cannot simply TAKE the candy, you have to have a fair'n'square baseball bat duel.<br />
<br />
So we &quot;upgrade&quot; the retarded kid and welcome them out of the 3rd world dictatorship by handing them one of our baseball bats.<br />
<br />
Oops! Time for a baseball bat duel. Then we beat the shit out of them and take their oil, errr, candy.<br />
<br />
So, supposedly, this now toothless and brain-haemorraging retard is supposed to thank us for removing us from the evil clutches of non-democracy? Give us a broken thumbs up? <br />
<br />
Nah, we demonize the retard: say he was retarded and who would want to deal with a retard like that! Look at what you did with the baseball bat, why, he tried to attack us with it during our duel!!! (And he wasn't very good, at that!) So, here, now retard your leader is uhhh George Gore. He's totally unique and will understand your personality fully. Sure. Yep. Ok, well it doesn't matter to us because we've secured your oil, errr, candy anyway so who really gives a rats ass.<br />
<br />
Hell, we can even expand our war budget by letting people die there every so many days to make it seem like we're really butting heads to attempt to harness your retarded ass. Nah. We have the candy, we're just letting the issues pile up so that that motive might be clearly obscured.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS &gt; Look out for the new International Borders in 2006, since your beating you've lost some mass/blood and now yer smaller. Hey, but at least you're on the good team... well, maybe. actually nah, you're still fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />

Reading all of this information I had to laugh bro.  You post this but leave out everything good the U.S.A. has done.  We nuked Japan but bailed Europe out of WW2.  Without us you would be speaking german my friend.  You say that you can't end violence with violence?  After the second nuke landed in nagasaki, the Japanese surrendered and that violence ended.<br />
<br />
You say we overthew Arbenz in Guatemala, but you fail to mention how he was oppressing and murdering his people.  <br />
<br />
You blame us for training Osama, but you fail to mention that it was to keep the Communists dictatorship out of Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
You fault us for invading Kuwait (boggle)....would you rather have saddam in there instead?  If we didn't do anything no one would have.<br />
<br />
You bring up guantamo bay, but fail to mention that the people there were captured fighting against our forces.  <br />
<br />
You bring up the Iraqi prisoner abuse, but where why weren't you complaining about saddam when he was torturing and murdering people in Iraq?<br />
<br />
You say we're bad to block Cuba, but if we did business with Fidel then you'd blame us for doing business with a dictator and say we're supporting a dictator.  Right?  Or do you want us to get rid of him instead so you can call us imperialists?  No matter what we do, you'll find a way to accuse us of treachery.<br />
<br />
So after all of this, it is very clear that you are just flat-out anti-american.  You are jealous of America's greatness, and that jealousy has festered and turned into hatred.  You want your country to be as powerful and influential as America, but you know that won't ever happen.  So you try to pick at everything America does, hoping that people will listen to your bullshit and rally to your cause.  But guess what?  Your country will never be as powerful as it once was, it will never be as influential as it once was, and it will never be anything more than a stop on a tourist's trip.

&quot;Reading all of this information I had to laugh bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes because u are not reading it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You say we overthew Arbenz in Guatemala, but you fail to mention how he was oppressing and murdering his people.&quot;<br />
<br />
???? Arbemz oppressing? did not u read 'democratically-elected'?<br />
<br />
&quot;You blame us for training Osama, but you fail to mention that it was to keep the Communists dictatorship out of Afghanistan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha. Very funny. Intead of Communist Taliban take the control. Good change. <br />
<br />
&quot;You fault us for invading Kuwait (boggle)....would you rather have saddam in there instead? If we didn't do anything no one would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all when i have said u have invaded Kuwait? Are u reading or imagining?<br />
Hehehehe. Why dont u stop all the wars then? If u do not do anything no one will have. Maybe is an oil and money problem?.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bring up guantamo bay, but fail to mention that the people there were captured fighting against our forces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fighting against ur forces in their own country. And now jailed whitout any human right. But that is ok with u.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bring up the Iraqi prisoner abuse, but where why weren't you complaining about saddam when he was torturing and murdering people in Iraq?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because i am talking about U.S.A. Are u trying to told me that u pull down Sadam and now u can do what he did? And now Sadam is jialed and his army destroyed, why are u still there? to stop violence? dont u realize taht all teh violence is against ur forces?<br />
<br />
&quot;You are jealous of America's greatness, and that jealousy has festered and turned into hatred. You want your country to be as powerful and influential as America, but you know that won't ever happen&quot;<br />
<br />
No thx, i dont want my country to be as powerful and influential as America if we must kill other countries people to succes. No thx, i like my country, i like Spain to be a stop on a tourist's trip. <br />
<br />
&quot;So go ahead and keep posting your anti-American bullshit...it will get you absolutely nowhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
I knew that before posting anything here, but is funny read people like u and help me to understand ur country behavior.<br />

Yes I am reading your posts and your &quot;facts&quot; are still not backed up by anything.  So laugh all you want, it makes your posts look even worse.  <br />
<br />
You say the people in Guantanamo bay were fighting against the U.S. in their own country, but they were in fact foreigners in Afghanistan and Iraq.  They did not wear uniforms, so they are not entitled to the rights of  the Geneva Convention.  I suggest you read up on that.  <br />

And yes I read that Arbenz was democratically elected, but that doesn't mean he still wasn't oppressing his people.  While he did do some good things for the Guatemalans, he also continued the military oppression that already existed there.<br />

<br />
lol who did tell u that? or did u watch it on ur T.V? Do u really think all guantanamo prisioners are Irak and Afganistan foreigners? And yes they did not wear uniforms because more(not all) of them were not soldiers, and if a foreign country army(U.S army) invade my country murdering my family and friends (colateral casualities as u call it) then i would fight against them. If that make u free to do whatever u want with prisioners then u are like Sadam, Osama and have not respect for human rights. But, wait a moment, what am i telling u? all of this is ur modus operandi, u are living in a country with death penalty(medieval procedures). If u have not respect for ur citizens human rights how are u going to respet rigths of other countries people?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...you mean if the USA didn't do anything there would be total world peace? No nations would ever got to war? Maybe you should rethink your bullshit statements before posting.&quot;<br />

NO mate, i am not meaning that. U invaded Irak to pull down a dictator, why dont u pull down all dictators? U only pull down oil countries dicators or strategic countries dictators.Why dont u pull down North Korea dictator? why dont u pull down Kuwait dicator? why dont u pull down Moroco dicator? why dont u pull down all african countries dictatrors? U dont pull them down becasue the dont have oil, or they are ur friends, or u can not pull them down (Korea,China). Do u know now what i am meaning? I hope so.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yes I read that Arbenz was democratically elected, but that doesn't mean he still wasn't oppressing his people. While he did do some good things for the Guatemalans, he also continued the military oppression that already existed there.&quot;<br />

If he was democratically elected why didnt u let Guatemalans pull him down whit his vote? mmmmm that is the way democrathy works. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you still haven't responded, like I asked you to, to your assinine statement about slavery and blacks being unequal in America after Grulknar responded. Guess you're ceding that point&quot;<br />
<br />
Well one person opinion can not change my point in this subject. How many U.S.A presidents were black? none.How many black people are living in poverty? more than white. who has power in ur country? black people?no mate WHITE PEOPLE HAVE IT.I mean black people in U.S.A are still not equal to white people, i dont care what do u think. Racial minorities are opressed in your country mate, that is a fact. <br />
<br />
&quot;And as far as being proud to be a tourist stop on someone's vacation, that's sad bro. It also still doesn't explain why you're so jealous of America. Why are you so jealous of America?&quot;<br />
<br />
When have i said i am jealous of America? I could now live there and work there earning more money, no thx. A country where everybody can have a gun, it is not a good place to live in. A country where foreing people is hated like u have demostrated is not a good place to live in. A country where my child are going to take very bad basic education, it is not a good place to live in. A country where medical assistance is not a citizen right (instead of that u must pay for medical asssitance) is not a good place to live in. A country where university studies are better if u pay more is not a good place to live in. Extremes are a mistake, and ur country is a Capithalist extreme, NO THX.<br />
<br />
And it is more sad being proud of a country that kill people and dont respect human rights. It is more sad being proud of a country that has not signed Kioto treaty. It is more sad being proud of a country that has not signed International Tribunal treaty. It is more sad being proud of your country international behavior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now all of a sudden you know more about blacks in America than an actual black person himself?  Wow man, you must know everything.  <br />
<br />
Ok you're right about everything Oskuro...America is filled with culture-less, murderous, stupid people.  Spain is so extremely enlightened and intelligent.  With all of the stupid people in America, it's amazing that we were the first people on the moon, it's amazing that we invented the airplane, the automobile, and that computer you're using to spout your lies.  It's amazing that with our stupidity we're the most technologically advanced country in the world.  It's amazing how people from countries all over the world want to come to America to get an education.  <br />
<br />
You never said you're jealous of America, but you don't have to.  It's clear to anyone who reads your posts.  All you can do is list the things that America does wrong.  I noticed you have never once mentioned the billions of dollars worth of humanitarian aid America gives to countries.  I noticed you never mentioned that America is the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid.  I noticed you never mentioned that America provides the most peace-keepers out of any country in the world.  You ask why we aren't taking down all dictators, but you don't mention that we took out Milosevic who was murdering the Arabs in his country.  I suppose that was for oil as well.  <br />
<br />
You say Iraq was for oil, so answer this question:  how much oil have we taken out of Iraq?  I want facts.  So far the facts are that all of the oil proceeds have gone to rebuilding Iraq.  <br />
<br />
Yes you are jealous of America and that's a fact.  I find it humorous that America has accomplished more in 100 years than Spain has in its entire existence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Mijax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Dear all, <br />
<br />
Im Spanish too and I fully agree Obskuros opinion. Im not comunist, Im not religious, Im not Capitalist, Im not anti-musulman, Im not anti-americans but I AM ANTI AMERICANWORLD POLICY.<br />
<br />
You are hurting so many people in the world just for your profit. When I use &quot;You&quot;, Im talikng about your &quot;Policy&quot; not about the people, there are good american people, there are bad american, like Spanish people, and any other citizen in the world. <br />
Let me explain and clarify some points that are a bit missed:<br />
<br />
1. Aznar was not beating our actual President Zapatero before elections and Terrorist act, he was already loosing before because of his arrogant policy. When our Goberment decided to sent troops to Irak, 90% of Spanish People were oppopsing  with a huge manifestation in all Spanish Cities, Million of people were in the streets because this bastard was ignoring the population desire. This Goberment did good things but involving a country in a War just for Petrol, mmmmmm we willl never support that.<br />
<br />
2. US have supported and financed Sadam against Iranies and Osama against Soviets. Ironic,right?. You facilitated them loads of weapons, including Biological,Chemical development,.... Do you think these countries could research such kind of weapons by themselves? <br />
<br />
3. Of course Sadam is a bastard person, but his goberment was being support by you, he conquest Kuwait because he though that his Ally (US) will never punish him. He was wrong. Yes, Sadam killed so thousands of  people, but let tell you that US have killed Millions of people, directly and indirectly. Also let me remind you that Turkish killed more &quot;Kurdos&quot; than Sadam and nobody has say anything about Turkey.Even more, Kurdos are living in Irak Terrotory because they are not allowed in Turkey. So first you should punish Turkey (OTAN Ally, ironic right?) before Sadam. And if you wanna remove Dictators in the world start in Africa and South America or China, where in such countries their Dictators have killed and violated human right thousands times more than Sadam.<br />
<br />
4. You invade IRAK because of the Petrol, Strategic placement and further more facilities. Im working in a military support company and I have seen by my own eyes how people in my company is requesting to go Irak and take a piece of cake for future profits. &quot;Please, come to Irak and extend your bussiness here just for free&quot;. How many Civil people (Americans,Germans,...) are now in Irak looking for their bussiness?? More than soldiers, believe me. They are sharing Irak among them, and people in Irak wants only to leave in Peace without any invasion forces there. IT IS THEIR COUNTRY!!! They are not terrorist they are defending his country, like Vietnam,like Indians in America, like Palestians, like Afganistans against soviets. Even more, US is always supporting Israel who conquest a piece of ground in Next Orient invading Palestina Territories and what?? Nobody quick them. They killed much more Palestins than viceversa, however only Palestins do Terrorism, that is not Terrorism they are defending his country.<br />
<br />
5. About Cuba, Fidel sucks now, but you sucks more allowing their poorness beacuse of the fucking block. Do you think Fidel is dangerous for USA? Dont make me laugh. I understood such Block durin Cold war, but now, there is no reason. They dont have medicins,they survive from their own manufacturing goods,this means food and cigars.<br />
<br />
6. When you talk about Comunist, please read Marxs Books about the comunist he developed it. After read him, I asure you never hate comunist, another thing is how comunist has been implemented in the World,there is a huge difference between the Theory and the reality. Comunist is an uthopy, it is a pity but it is true.<br />
<br />
7. Your are talking that American is the biggest Empire and so on,hehehe, as Obskuro said all Empires have been defeated along the History, all. And the mayority of such Empires were 10 times bigger than Amercians one, lets say: Romans, Spanish, English, Germans, French, Musulman,... Let me remind you that the real amrericans were such Indians that you almost exterminate. You all come from Europe, the most poor people in Europe desesperate to find solution to their poorness travelled to America. So, please beind a bit less arrogant since your History sucks. You are a mix of Chineses,South Amercians, Africans, Europeans,...and so on which gives you so much culture richness, but again it is ironic that you hate most of them except White people. <br />
<br />
8. Talikng about Weapons, your country is completly crazy allowing anyone to use weapons just buying in a supermarket. You are same violent as in the Far West period, you have not matured. How many people die in US because of weapons and how many poeple die in the world? Yes,you win all of us. And about children killing others in the School, you should fix your policy inside before try to extend it outside.<br />
<br />
9. I hope the best to all of American people, and hope one day we will live in peace and harmony with the rest of the world without incite Terrorists acts because of your Outside policy. You suffer and we suffer such terrorist acts because we have increased the HATE to occidental live, instead of being a policy to be followed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Mijax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">I forgot to reply you when you are talking about America is the most powerfull country because of their people.<br />
Well think about your sources and about your Strategic position, I would like to see you inside Europe Continent during 1st and 2nd World War. You have never suffered any invasion in your own country, and i hope you will never suffer in the future.<br />
Because that would destroy your magic country.<br />
<br />
You should kick you actual goberment and get a new one more focused with Human rights than in selling weapons and getting Petrol refineries. You dont realize you are becoming the most violent empire more than magnific and owesome empire like Romans and Musulmans which developed and teached loads of usefull things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>brian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">wow... spanish people are lame.<br />

You guys have become really big pussies since you lost your colonies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Mijax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">You are right lovely ignorant, we lost California as well. Remember California and Florida was a Spanish Colony!!!. <br />
You never will have as many colonies as Spanish had.<br />
And remember, you come from Eurpean a bit centuries ago, the real americans were almost exterminated by the actual people called themselves &quot;Americans&quot;.<br />
Even more you are not Americans since America is a huge continents composed by North Amercia (US, CANADA), Central America and South America. Remember that Cristobal Colon (Spanish) develop America, to be more precised Caribean Islands first. Afterwards we conquested south America, we went up to Mexico, then to California, Florida, then we explore North America but we found that North America had very small sources in comparison with South America and we stop conquest at California Limit. Afterwards North America was Conquest by English, French and some Germans. And some part of South America by Portuguese (Brazil).<br />
<br />
We should be more proud about our Nation than you, believe me, however we are not since we are humble and we recognize that any kind of violent invasion is unfair. So stop being arrogant since your actual empire is a shit comparing with Spanish Empire for instance.</div></div><hr />

What happened, did Oskuro have to go find his buddies to start posting for him?<br />
<br />
You only come to this board to spout about how America is, but learning about something second hand, makes your anti-American crap bullshit. <br />
<br />
<br />
When September 11th happened, more than 3/4 of our country was screaming &quot;kill the bastards, nuke them all, who cares&quot;<br />
<br />
So as for the two of you saying &quot;our people didn't want war, so we unselect our president&quot;.... It doesn't work that way here, a ton of people were war set a few years ago. Yes things have gotten out of hand, our troops want to come home, British troops want to come home, everyone wants to come home.  It isn't going to solve anything with your babble here, you are speaking to deaf ears. <br />
<br />
You two like to point out all the bad America is, but you neglect to point out the good. Which is an unfair point of view, bias to say the least.<br />
<br />
Here in America we learn that certain newspapers are either republican, or democratic... Two different points of views, so depending on which newspaper you read, as to what information you get.  You can have both newspapers with conflicting views... Just like this same situation, you come from a completely different place, so you will have a different view, you learn different things... Doesn't mean you know everything, your TV, and Newspapers can be leaving a hell of a lot of information out because their views might be distorted as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Mr. Oskuro, and his black oppression bit.... Did you know our country is run by more people than just the president? We have something called Congress... Just about everything goes through Congress.... Okay that said, do you know how many African-Americans are IN congress? The president doesn't act alone, he is just the poster child.  We have blacks, whites, Asians, Mexicans, and a whole handful of other cultures, running our government.. Get over yourself.  <br />
<br />
Now, I have heard rumors that in a few election years, Hilary Clinton is going to run against Jesse Jackson.  Part of the rumor was that the Clintons are a big part of the Democratic  election committee, and that they put up someone who would loose against Bush, (Kerry... And if he doesn't start getting his act together, and figure out where he stands on most issues, it might just happen) just so they could have a clean election in the coming years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How old was spain before they began to form an empire?  More than 230 years.  Give us some slack cuh-- we jus got started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">Mijax, you say that America is a small empire compared to the empires throughout history.  The reason for this is that the empires throughout history aggressively conquered nations and made them a part of their country.  The U.S. doesn't do this.  If the U.S. wanted to do this, we could, so I'm not quite sure what the point is that you're trying to make.  What other country in history could topple a dictator in a war without losing one soldier?  We did it with our air force in Serbia.<br />
<br />
You say all empires fall, but fail to mention that the U.S. has the oldest written constitution that is in force today.  The difference between the United States and other empires is that the U.S. has a democratically elected leader and a system of checks and balances.  The other empires throughout history had dictators in charge that made most of the decisions.  This led to power struggles and civil wars after the dictators died.  The U.S. is not going to fall and we're not going anywhere, so get used to us.<br />
<br />
I also find it funny that you keep bringing up Fidel and Cuba.  You say we shouldn't block Cuba, but then people like you and Oskuro fault us for doing business with dictators.  So if we ended the embargo and started doing business with Fidel, you would say, &quot;oh you're helping a murderous dictator in Cuba.&quot;  No matter what we do we can't win.  <br />
<br />
And I've read Marx and the Communist Manifesto and I still prefer Capitalism.  <br />
<br />
The fact that Oskuro (a.k.a. Mijax) doesn't want Bush re-elected makes me want to go out and campaign for Bush '04.</div></div><hr />

Well mate there are facts that can not be distortionated by periodist. Everybody have seem ur tropps torturing irak prisioners, everybody are waiting Massive Destruction Weapons to be found, everybody knows that Sadam was not an ally of Sadam( Sadam was agnostic, Osama Islam terrorist), etc. If u want more facts read my posts, i am a bit tired of ur dominance, ur irational pride for ur country, it doesnd matter what does ur country do, u are all agree with U.S.A international behavior.<br />

U have a democratically elected leader, that is sad. How can a democrathict country want to be an empire? oh my god. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I've read Marx and the Communist Manifesto and I still prefer Capitalism.&quot;<br />

'Everyboy against U.S.A international behavior is Obskuro', no mate, there are a lot of people with the same opinion. American people, well U.S.A people(America is too big to call U.S.A citizens americans) must realize there are other cultures, countries and people in the wrold.<br />
 Well and voting Bush because u have read foraigner people talk shit about him and without any other reason is something that define yourself.<br />

&quot;So if we ended the embargo and started doing business with Fidel, you would say, &quot;oh you're helping a murderous dictator in Cuba.&quot; No matter what we do we can't win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why dont u block China or North Korea? too strong too block them? well so we can not block all of our &quot;enemies&quot; lets block weakest &quot;enemy&quot; making their people suffer. Please dont block anybody, dont invaded more countries and if u like so much ur country make ur troops stay there, please save the rest of the world of ur imperialism.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Chayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">please give me numbers...how many non-white people do u have in congress? give me that numbers please. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell does that have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
You said they are opressed, and even after someone who happens to be african american tells you they aren't, you come back with the question about no black people run the country, which I just told you they do, now you want numbers? What does numbers have to do with the fact that they DO indeed hold high paying jobs, that run the country?<br />
<br />
Even if the ratio of white:black is low, doesn't make them opressed, just makes me think they choose other professions, like football, basketball, laywers, doctors, judges, mayors...ect. <br />
<br />
 Equal rights.   That means, if they are qualified, and want to do it... they can. They don't need some one from another country telling them they are opressed. Where you got that bullshit is beyond me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Everybody have seem ur tropps torturing irak prisioners <br />
<br />
&quot;our troops&quot;... You mean 17 people... SEVENTEEN... 17 out of 150,000 ....17...   So 17 People do something their commander orders them to do, even if it goes against their best judgement, they do it because they were ordered to....doesn't make the rest of the 150,000 guilty of torture. One of the statements was given that  some  of those pictues were posed, just for intimidation purposes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All 17 face court marshall, and jail time.  I can't say that I am proud of those 17, or what they were doing... But I have friends, and family over there, doing what they are told. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now... here is something to consider:<br />
<br />
Mejia claims he deserted his unit in part to avoid orders to abuse Iraqi prisoners. His attorney, Louis Font, told jurors that members of Mejia's squad will testify that the soldier of nine years was a fine officer and &quot;a good squad leader who took care of his men.&quot; <br />
<br />
This guy Mejia, is also facing court marshall because he didn't do what his commanders told him to do... So, the 17 in that troop were stuck between a rock, and a hard place... Jail time for saying hell no, and leaving... Or risk never getting caught, and claim their superior told them to do it... For this instance, I will lay blame with the one person giving orders... The one person incharge if interogating... but I will NOT Lay blame on all of America, and I will  NOT  lay blame on all the troops, because of a few bad people.<br />
<br />
You sir, are pissing me off.<br />
<br />
(by the way, I will grab those numbers from Congress, let me wade through all the congress pages, and count for you... Will take time, seeing how I have other responsibilities.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Niladen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Then u are silly, no doubt about that. U can said Communist is utopian and can not be implemented( i doubt it) but that is worse tahn capithalism...u are silly. <br />
<br />
So you are completely content to wallow in the sea of mediocirty that is Marxism? Congratulations, I doubt that many would share in your revere. Furthermore, your utopian soceity would be oppresive to those whom would wish to do more for themselves without nessesarily creating a drain or spreading suffering on those whom would not because the system can not adapt nor can it be flexible.<br />
<br />
I for one can never imagine a world where everyone is under some alturistic trance of benevolent co-operation and &quot;for the many&quot; mentality. That permeates the boundaries of territorialism, which is something that our genetic ancestry is predisposed. So the only thing silly here is your complete disregard for anything logical in reference to what communism is. Karl himself understood this, and if you have read the manifesto then that point would be abundantly clear.<br />
<br />
Huamanitarian aid to countries u have destroyed, hehehehe, ok. We destroy u but not worry we are going to give u humanitary aid. Ur country is so absurd. <br />
<br />
Your right, every country we provide aid too we first decimate then rebuild. Please go to your local periodcal repository, read, then remove your head from your ass.<br />
<br />
Well mate there are facts that can not be distortionated by periodist <br />
<br />
So your saying, that every 'factiod' you consume from any media source has had absolutly no spin, alteration, or slight or perspective applied? That is so completely naive it is sad. Even your experience has an agenda applied.<br />
<br />
Please dont block anybody, dont invaded more countries and if u like so much ur country make ur troops stay there, please save the rest of the world of ur imperialism. <br />
<br />
Tell ya what, why don't we get an oppresive ruler, give him a truck load of funds, troops, and arms depose Spains current ruling body. Allow said rule to continue to oppress, maim, and tourture the Spanish people and allow this to continue because of our evil 'imperialism'.<br />
<br />
You want to tote that banner stating that if we intend to take care of evil rules we must take care of them all? Fine, then you foot the bill, you provide the infrastucture, and you provide the troops. Hammering on a point of all or nothing is ridiculious, namely in the fact that it is impossible.<br />
<br />
It is entirely too easy to soap box on the other side when you are absent of the responsiblity of the actions in question. Your repititious flouting of arbitrary arguements of superiority clearly indicates that. Your complete disregard of your own history shows that, regardless of what type of reigme is under control, it is ok to be a hipocrit as long as it fits your needs.<br />
<br />
Do I care about the absense of WMD, not really. I for one fully concede that the WMD edge was lofty at best, but it is all about perspective. Do I believe that taking out Saddam was nessesary or even justified? Yes, for our protection as much as yours. Leaders such as that will not just step down because on a moral level we condone him. That being the case, sometimes the only way to deal with people whom do what they wish when they wish, ergo ignore *any* rules (moral, nation, international, or otherwise) is through force.<br />
<br />
Now we are left to clean up the mess. You can scream at the top of your lungs about how imperialist we are, but I know for a fact that under different circumstances you would be begging for help. However after years of oppresion, indignity, and for all intent and purposes marshal law, a population will become accustomed to that style and consider that normal. The precise reason the Iraqi people never cried for help and all the more reason to oust such a reigme.<br />
<br />
So the next time some other terrorist performs such atrocities that costs innocents thier lives, you can take pride in your decision to sit on your laurels because it would be 'imperialist' to act against that organization. If you want to take the philosopcial stance of 'I can not judge, act, or otherwise comment because who am I to do so?' just as you are saying 'Who is the US to act in such ways?' then practice what you preach and be silent.<br />

What the hell are you saying?  But as far as your love of communism, I think you should refer to Niladen's post.  He pretty much owned you.  Especially since your only argument is to call me silly.

Citizens will die in every war, that's a fact.  Way to totally spin the situation &quot;mate&quot;.  The situation was that the Christians were slaughtering and torturing the Muslims in that country, and we put an end to that.  And before you go saying that no one asked us to do it, don't start that.  The U.N. was calling on us for help.  Respond to that.<br />

We are &quot;blocking&quot; North Korea dumbass.  Get your facts straight before posting.  And &quot;blocking&quot; China would be near to impossible considering the fact that they opened up their economy.  You tell us not to block any countries, so that means we should do business with more dictators then.  Then you'll be crying about the fact that we do business with dictators.  My original point stands that no matter what we do we can't win.<br />

<br />
I'm amazed that you're tired of posting facts, considering you haven't posted any.  You confuse facts with opinion.  All you do is say what you've either heard on your anti-american news or repeat what you heard from a &quot;friend&quot;.  No one supports torturing Iraqi prisoners except ignorant morons.  Just because a few Americans make stupid comments supporting the torture doesn't mean that's what America stands for.  That is why the people who committed the torture are in the process of being severely punished.  IF you watched any American news you would see the outrage in America over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners.  That story is getting more attention than the beheading of Nick Berg.  You can't tell me that in your country there isn't a small population of ignorant people who make stupid comments.  When you say everybody you show that all you are doing is generalizing a population without any supporting evidence.  By that same standard I could say everyone in Spain is a Communist, even though that's not true.<br />
<br />
While Sadam was not an ally of Osama, he was a sponsor of terrorism.  He gave thousands of dollars to families of suicide bombers in Palestine.  You need to remember that our war isn't just agains Osama, it's agains terrorism all over the world.  We don't care what their position is on Osama...if they are terrorists they will die at our hands.  <br />
<br />
And I don't agree with everything America does, but I also don't agree with an ignorant, closed-minded, naive person like you who only mentions one side of every story and generalizes an entire country to try to prove your point.  <br />
<br />
I find it funny that you call my pride irrational.  But I see how you don't really understand the concept of pride; being an American I have so much more to be proud of than I would if I were Spanish.</div></div><hr />

Once I have clarify this feeling, let me tell you that when hundred of people died in Madrid Terrorist act nobody though to kill all musulmans. We all thought about....why? Why these people could kill incocents?<br />
The answer is very simple, because we are killing thousands of them in Irak,Afganistan, Palestina,.... The best way to Stop Terrorism is not conquesting a country like Irak and Afganistan, the best way is to not incite more hate against occidental. And we are only increasing such hate with Irak War, supporting Israel against Palestina, and so on.<br />
Lets leave them in peace, lets cooperate with them, helping them with development,teaching, instead of take advantage of their resources. If we dont stop the current Policy we will NEVER solve the problem. As much hate we incite as much terrorist people we will create.</div></div><hr />

Mate, first of all, we dont have Anti-americans news or books. I can confirm you that such word is totally stupid for us. This is not a crusade against USA Citizens (Again America is not only USA).<br />
We are only criticizing your bad things,of course you have good things, nobody doubt it. You have a great research facilities and you develop a lot of usefull things. You also help so many people in the world and so on.<br />
<br />
The objective of our criticism, is to show all of you how USA Image is in the rest of the world. And to improve it, if you are doing bad things why dont you fix them?? Is it bad to criticizes all bad things you have done? I think it is not.<br />
<br />
When you are talking about Terrorist you are always talking about people who carry a bomb and detonate it. What a about an  M1 Abrahams or an B-52 firing their bombs and killing incocent people? Is that not terrorism? <br />
<br />
You are practing terrorist but instead of using Human bombs you use Tanks, Helicopters, Aircrafts,missiles,... give Irakies your equal weapons and we would see how many Irakies inmolate theirselves. They do it,like Palestines because it is the unique way to defend their terrotiry. And please stop talking and defending you did a good work because you kick Sadam arse. There are many,many dictators in the world more dangerous and criminals than him. For example China, where Millions of girls have been assained with the State consent, I repeat Millions. And what is USA doing?....NOTHING. Why? You threw the first stone guys, and that hate has been increased along the years and you suffered it in 11September. Hope such act will never repeat again, but apply it also to you please. Stop, oppresing Musulman world.<br />
Sadam, was completly innofensive after UN resolution. All UN inspectors agreed on they didnt find such weapons and that such USA attack was not necessary. USA, China, URSS,Israel,France,India,Pakistan,.... all of them have Nuclear weapons and these countries are much more dangerous than Irak which the unique massive weapons they got were coming from USA support in Iran-Irak war.<br />
<br />
LEAVE THEM IN PEACE!!! Lets deal with them  making bussiness agreed by both parts not forcing them. They are Human as any Spanish or USA citizen, they born like you and me, it is question of education. We should help each other with knowledge interchange, making these countries better informed, understanding their culture, respecting each other.<br />
<br />
I think nobody oopsoite the OTAN when they strike in Serbia, but we (OTAN) killed incocent people as well(Never said your army is so good and can finish a war without any casualty,that is impossible). However we save millions of people lives from Serbias dictator hands. I supported such military strike, for sure.<br />
Army is necessary when a genocide is involved, no body doubt it. And whether USA kick Sadam when he killed thousands of Kurds in the 80th I would rather support your strike to stop it, but you did NOTHING. Even more, Turkish have killed more Kurds than Sadam.<br />
We MUST support UN institution, we MUST improve otherwise USA, or any other military powerfull country will do what they want for their own benefit as USA is doing now in Irak. Be honest , you are there because of the Petrol, the same as in Afganistan mate. You are in Afganistan because it was the country where a huge Oil Conduct was involved to carry the oil from North Caucaso to the Indic Ocean.<br />
All current Terrorist groups that you are fighitng against they only want to leave them in peace, they dont want anything more, just leave musulman people in peace.<br />
USA and Israel are overpassing UN resolutions without any prejudice and that must be punished and must not be allowed.<br />
<br />
And I repeat, I have nothjing in opposition of USA citizen, only your policy. I woulf like to visit USA, Irak, Afganistan, China, Australia, .... without having any hate against myself. Lets live in peace with all the world, it is something very easy but putting away any economic,military interests.<br />

Of course I can't seeing how it goes against thousands of years of human evolution and societial developement. You seem to pose the vision that Spain or the rest of the world is consumed with philanthropists and somehow the only country playing iconoclast to that role is the US. You speak of yourself as being cultured yet your ignorance of the world is dumbfounding.<br />
<br />
Might I remind you the entire reason this situation arose was because of religious differences. Some might attribute this to the Crusades (which your precious Spain participated in), but I would attribute it to 12th and 13th century xenophobia in the middle east region due to the advancement of a few native scientists/philosophers breaching acceptable grounds of study and bringing into question the power of whatever god(s) you choose to believe in. Something else your precious and pristine Spain participated in, wanton slaughter of infidels and non-believers.<br />
<br />
I think it rather ammusing that you press with this Communist attitude, when clearly if you expressed it in practice you would surely come to the conclusion that the US hunting down terrorists, deposing dictators, and spreading our global reach is for the good of all people in the long run. However, you are to short sighted to see any such thing. Thus, you make arguements about how terrible and evil we are, prostrate yoruself as a Communist martyr, yet play the hipocritical role because you *won't* see into the future and see what is for the 'greater good'. Clearly your clarivoiance is superiour.<br />
<br />
All you see is the present, what is happening now. The process of arriving at a better world is just that, a process. Not all steps are going to be liked by all people, but right now it seems to be only the US and it's active allies that are doing anything about it. <br />
<br />
No mate, i say that u only take care of countries dictators that can give u economical profits. <br />
<br />
A rightfully they should be the first to go. Increase your available reasources and increase the effectivness at which you can excersize yourself so that you might be able to do more in a shorter time. Expending energy without return would be a perfectly sound decision to make *if* there was enough of it to last the duration required. But that is not the reality of the situation is it? Emphatically not, reasouces are finite. Therefore we must play our aims to that in order to continue. Complete expenditure is not even an option.<br />
<br />
U.S.A people calling me hipocrit? hehe where are MDW? and again do u have this kind of weapons? dont u think that attack a country because has MDW when u have this weapons and have used it is some hipocrit? <br />
<br />
Yes, I am calling you one and no I don't think that our country having WMD going after Saddam is playing the hipocrit. Perhaps on some grade school playground level yes, we have the ball and no one else can have it. But on in the global theatre that scene changes now doesn't it? Quite, all of sudden the other kids who are too small to beat us up conventionally, want to sucker punch us with a WMD. So what, we sit and wait till they make one, murder countless people in thier own and surrounding countries, wait some more, allow such weapons to proigate into the hands of those with nothing to lose? If a 1 megaton warhead went off in downtown Madrid you'd be singing a different tune. After all, your still infidels and you( meaning Spain ) did kill countless Moores. If you think that has gone forgotten you would be sorely mistaken. But your not on top now are you? No, your just Spain, a tourist trap. <br />
<br />
We learned our lesson long ago in WWII when we sat back for too long to allow Europe to take care of its own. We are not going to sit around anymore. <br />
<br />
U have just defined ur country international behavior. <br />
<br />
Well I am glad that you being so well versed in our countries foreign policy can boil it down into such a simple model. Your absolutly right, we do nothing but blow up countires and rebuild them. Except for all those areas in Africa, and South America, and some in the Southern Pacific, and we never did hit Russia.<br />
<br />
The fact that u are NOT able to understand the facts i have posted doenst mean i have not posted any. <br />
<br />
Appropriate a dictionary and read the term &quot;misinformation&quot;. If your going to espouse it in spades, at least know what it is first.<br />
<br />
They dont think their country is doing bad things, they are proud of their country behavior. No way with this kind of people but is still funny read u all. <br />
<br />
No we don't. Will inoccents die through the remaining course of this campaign? Yes. When the enemy hides behind the backs of women and children, sits in waiting in hospitals and schools, and wear street garb to further obscure themselves you can bet that someone who is not a militant is going to get hurt/killed. What we are doing is right. Sitting around allowing evil men to perpatrate evil things and allow it to continue because 'its not our problem' is taking hand in that action. <br />
<br />
Your pulpit of indifference is exactly what we don't want to happen. We don't want what ever forces that wish to rise, do so by whatever means nessesary, to characterise our global climate. Its not just about oil, or WMD, its about human life. As a human and a resonable person I understand and accept that there will be bumps along the way. I will vote for those bumps to be taken, because what is at the far end of the road of action is immensely better than what is at the road of indifference.<br />
<br />
It is entirely sad that those who died in Madrid died for absolutely nothing. The evil presented itself on your doorstep, took your peoples lives, and you all caved and voted yourself into reclusion. You think that not helping the US is going to stop such action? You (Spain) are just as much the enemy as we. You shame yourself with your own actions.

Stereo-types like ur president, the person who the vast majority of U.S.A people has voted. If u voted him u are agree with him, so it is not an stereo-type. <br />
<br />
Not really.  Bush lost the general popular election, it's debateable that he lost the electoral college as well.  The Supreme Court made him President.<br />
<br />
*I* sure as fuck didn't vote for him, but you're still an asshat.</div></div><hr />

So 90% of Spanish people are Obskuro buddies?  <br />

<br />
Well, the fact you just registered to the boards a day ago, and have only posted under the same forum as Obskuro, you are either him, a buddy of his, or too damn scared to post under your original handle and had to make a new one. Either way you don't belong here.<br />

It is called simple justification that if someone is going to explicate how the US is some imperialist regime, foaming at the mouth for conquest, under the guise of auspicious reason, and stop at nothing to perpetuate itself then the accusor needs to have a bit more backbone and integrity than what is shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Oskuro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">&quot;Some might attribute this to the Crusades (which your precious Spain participated in), but I would attribute it to 12th and 13th century xenophobia in the middle east region due to the advancement of a few native scientists/philosophers breaching acceptable grounds of study and bringing into question the power of whatever god(s) you choose to believe in. Something else your precious and pristine Spain participated in, wanton slaughter of infidels and non-believers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Spain was not a democrathic country when that happened. I am not proud about that, u are proud about ur country behavior. That is the difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;to the conclusion that the US hunting down terrorists, deposing dictators, and spreading our global reach is for the good of all people in the long run&quot;<br />
<br />
do u really think that? hahahahah U.S.A people are very funny.<br />

A rightfully they should be the first to go. Increase your available reasources and increase the effectivness at which you can excersize yourself so that you might be able to do more in a shorter time. Expending energy without return would be a perfectly sound decision to make *if* there was enough of it to last the duration required. But that is not the reality of the situation is it? Emphatically not, reasouces are finite. Therefore we must play our aims to that in order to continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
hahahahah why do u think u have the right to do that? why do u think u are the world heroes? do u want to become an EMpire to make the world better? dont make me laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am calling you one and no I don't think that our country having WMD going after Saddam is playing the hipocrit. Perhaps on some grade school playground level yes, we have the ball and no one else can have it. But on in the global theatre that scene changes now doesn't it? Quite, all of sudden the other kids who are too small to beat us up conventionally, want to sucker punch us with a WMD. So what, we sit and wait till they make one, murder countless people in thier own and surrounding countries,&quot;<br />
<br />
The global theatre is that only 1 country have used nuclear weapons against other countries people, and that country is U.S.A. U have no moral right to invade other country with WMD. And that weapons are still not founded.<br />
<br />
&quot; When the enemy hides behind the backs of women and children, sits in waiting in hospitals and schools, and wear street garb to further obscure themselves you can bet that someone who is not a militant is going to get hurt/killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe there are not enemies, they are just women and children, or maybe there are just people fighting for their country. Think about it. It is only a posibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is entirely sad that those who died in Madrid died for absolutely nothing.

You (Spain) are just as much the enemy as we.&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont want to be an enemy of nobody. And we didnt vote MrZapatero becasue Madrid terrorist attack. We voted him because Mr Aznar lied us and ignored population opinion, and in a democratic country that can NOT happen.<br />
And yes we are the enemy as well, but at least there are not spanish troops killing inocents in Irak. Irak was an agnostic country under U.N supervision without terrorist before ur president begun to nuke them. This war is an ilegal war, ur army is making war crimes. why dont u sign up in International Tribunal treaty? becasue urs commanders will be now in jail.<br />
<br />

Hehehehehe what a country where the president lost general popular election but his friends of The Supreme Court made him president. mmmmm, yes is a great nation.<br />

<br />
Becuase right now, we are the current Hegemon. Just as Rome was once Hegemon of the 'civilized' world, just as China is trying to make its ascension to that position. We are the most influential force currently on the face of the earth. As such it is inherantly our responsiblity to have vested interest in all facets for our own preservation as well as others. <br />
<br />
If China asscends to that position, you will see them do the same thing. If Spain arose to that position, they would do the same. Its not manifest destiny, nor divine right, its called taking responsibilty and to the best of our ability attempt to take care of everyone else when they need it.<br />
<br />
As for becoming an Empire, hardly. Make the world better, yes.<br />
<br />
The global theatre is that only 1 country have used nuclear weapons against other countries people, and that country is U.S.A. U have no moral right to invade other country with WMD. And that weapons are still not founded. <br />
<br />
Maybe from your perspective we have no moral right, but from our position things are quite different. Again, its easy to critise when you don't bare any burden.<br />
<br />
Maybe there are not enemies, they are just women and children, or maybe there are just people fighting for their country. Think about it. It is only a posibility. <br />
<br />
If they are revolutionaries fighting for the New Iraq they are firing upon the wrong people. <br />
<br />
And yes we are the enemy as well, but at least there are not spanish troops killing inocents in Irak. Irak was an agnostic country under U.N supervision without terrorist before ur president begun to nuke them. This war is an ilegal war, ur army is making war crimes. why dont u sign up in International Tribunal treaty? becasue urs commanders will be now in jail. <br />
<br />
Being offically agnostic doesn't really have anything to do with this. As for being without terrorist, there certinaly were those present, there was also one in power. <br />
<br />
What crimes? The prison abuse? Those persons will be dealt with accordingly. What other war crimes have been commited? <br />
<br />
As for innocents dying, that has always been part of war. Again, when the enemy hides within the inncoents, there will be accidents. Accidents they shall remain, as it is not policy to kill them outright.</div></div><hr />

Do you even know what a fact is?   The fact that all you can do is try to personally inuslt me shows that you really have no arguments or facts.  It is common knowledge that if someone is in a debate and they resort to personal attacks, they have lost the debate.  Thanks for playing kid.<br />

We nuked Iraq?  Wow I didn't know this.  Maybe you should provide some facts about this.  How large were the nuclear bombs we dropped on Iraq, because if we dropped &quot;nukes&quot; like you said, I don't think there would be much of a country left there.  And saying that just our president is responsible for this war in Iraq shows your ignorance.  There was a vote in Congress and the majority of our members of Congress approved the Iraqi resolution.  But it's ok that you didn't know that because I know that you feel you don't have to do any research or fact-finding before posting your ignorant, uninformed, and misguided opinions.  <br />

But there are ignorant fascist in all the countries around the wrold, but ur country have record numbers on it.  <br />
<br />
Ok &quot;mate&quot;, let's see the data behind your assumption that there are record numbers of ignorant people in America.  Or is this another generalization that you are trying to spin into fact?  Don't post again until you have this data.  It's time to either put up or shut up.  If you can't provide any data then don't post again.<br />

<br />
Yes, I'm proud of about 90% of what my country does internationally.  It is America's responsibility to look out for America's best interests, and frankly other country's interests should merely be an afterthougt.  I don't really care if other countries don't like America, but I do ask that they be honest, something you are not.  I find your jealousy of America to be quite humorous...you are so jealous of America that you have to keep posting here to try justify your opinions.</div></div><hr />

You're right Grim, the truth of an assertion doesn't depend on the virtues of the person asserting it.  It depends on the facts and data that are used to back up and support the assertion, and Oskuro has shown us neither facts nor data.</div></div><hr />
