<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasudeva</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question:<br />
<br />
Argent Protector vs. A Massive DragonClaw Shard and Shield of the Green Dragon Combo.<br />
<br />
Setup A:<br />
Argent Protector   <br />
Damage: 42<br />
Delay: 49 <br />
Damage Bonus: 21<br />
Ratio: 1.166 Amazing <br />
AC: +10 Str: +10 Wis: +10 Int: +10 HP: +25 Mana: +25  <br />
Weight: 10.0 <br />
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Slash <br />
<br />
Setup B:<br />
Primary<br />
Massive Dragonclaw Shard <br />
Damage: 28<br />
Delay: 30 <br />
Ratio: 1.07 Amazing <br />
Wis: +3 Int: +3  <br />
<br />
Secondary<br />
Shield of the Green Dragon    <br />
AC: +25 Str: +10 Agi: -5 Cha: +10 Magic Resist: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Poison Resist: +30 Disease Resist: +30  <br />
 <br />
Assumptions: Not fighting a caster or any mob where stun/bash is needed. Assume high base Stats. I'm strictly comparing the two weapons not the class or character playing them or the mob they are used against. That being said...<br />
<br />
Questions: <br />
1) Which setup is better for being an MA?<br />
2) Whish setup is better for dishing out the most damage?<br />
3) Which setup is best for not being the MA?<br />
4) Which would you rather have personally (given the two options)<br />
<br />
Please be sure to state A or B for all of the above questions. Thanks for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NarcosisDOA</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in this specific setup, the MDS and shield does more damage. I compared them a while back using an older parser, I dont know if it took in account the 2h changes. <br />
<br />
 As a MA, the sword and shield are better. Sword swings faster, shield gives ac.  For non-MA, go with whaever does the most damage. I'd probabaly like to try out the MDS + shield, already have a AP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasudeva</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*bump*<br />
<br />
Any other opinions? Thanks for the reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Which setup is better for being an MA?<br />
AP, better aggro, more hps, negligible ac difference.<br />
2) Whish setup is better for dishing out the most damage?<br />
AP if you're 60, MDS if you're 50 or under.<br />
3) Which setup is best for not being the MA?<br />
Same as above. <br />
4) Which would you rather have personally (given the two options)<br />
AP</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: oh and I wield the AP at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malaegue</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 95% 2hd user... and in this scenario I'd choose the 1hd. It is simply a better weapon... and speed helps SK's more than other classes due to Proc's...<br />
<br />
AC from shield's nice too..<br />
<br />
What're the two items from? Off top of my head defender is much easier to get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasudeva</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Argh..<br />
<br />
Half say the 2HS and the other have says the 1HS. I was afraid of this.<br />
<br />
Shield Drops off Dragon, the Shard in DN, and Protector from Chardock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sleestok</div><div class="date">04-11-2002, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At what level are you asking this about?  MDS is good for twinking IMHO, but when str bonus really starts to kick in, even an Ebon Mace will do more damage.<br />
<br />
The 2 hander is awesome for doing damage, but not so much for taunt (miss on a 49 delay weapon and you're more likely to lose<br />
aggro).  I'd use both for different situations--MDS for MTing and resist set if you have a shield like SBS or Rainbow Hues, and the 2HS for raids where you want to do a lot of damage without getting aggro.<br />
<br />
For below level 40, though, damage will probably be pretty comparable, so I'd go with the shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasudeva</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm taking post 50 here.<br />
<br />
So the way I interpret most of these posts, is to use the 2 HS when I'm not MA or just want to deal damage, then the 1HS when I'm trying to hold aggro better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EldraedVD</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use sword and shield for ma/mt (no brainer) and the 2hs for damage. Well, with the right buffs you can still wield good dmg with that claw over AP, AP is a lousy 2h compared to some of the other 2h but you can get similar dps in some cases with these 2.<br />
<br />
I use a hoarfrost hammer atm, hoping to kill zland soon on my server, first Vindi down earlier tonight on firiona vie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coufu</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i had the same problem.<br />
<br />
I use Carved Dragonbone Spear (25/30 2hp) And shard of night (21/24 1hp). Can't decide which one to use while soloing.<br />
<br />
I feel that the 2hp has a LOT more DPS tho. So I was go with AP in your case. If everyone agrees when my question is answered as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekhmeth</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AP is a lousy 2h compared to some of the other 2h but you can get similar dps in some cases with these 2. <br />
<br />
Oh yes a weapon that is droppable with Epic ratio and nice stats AND is not that expensive too boot... now that is a lousy weapon! :p<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of 2h you compare the AP to but it is an excellent weapon in its own right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystina</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw just for info: you dont loose aggro when you &quot;miss&quot; hits.<br />
<br />
You attack with a 42 dmg weapon and miss = you gain 42x aggro<br />
You attack with a 42 dmg weapon and hit for 200dmg = you gain 42x aggro<br />
You attack with a 52 dmg weapon and hit for 70dmg = you gain 52x aggro (more than the 200dmg hit from above)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krushum Gudended</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would use AP all the time- but thats just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synd D`nys</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2hand &gt; 1hand.  <br />
<br />
No buts about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you Synd about 2h, after they added the last round of damage bonus they own 1h that have a similar ratio.  My question is this why do so many warriors still insist on using 1h weapons with far lower ratios when there are some really awesome warrior usuable 2h that dish out more damage?<br />
<br />
I know with my own warrior I switched almost exclusively to 2h weapons a long time ago because of the damage increase.....(and to tell the truth I haven't noticed any real problems keeping aggro...just my opinion)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duel wield &gt; 2hand in most cases still.</div></div><hr />
