<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rezrril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i realize its hate, and know about the drop rate.... but it seems to be getting ridiculous, ive been in hate for almost 2 weeks now through about 8 or 10 PH spawns a night and have yet to see the mistress spawn. Anyone else have to go that long? Im not good enough to solo the camp yet, and i hate having to drag people up there every night for 3+ hours. On a side note, i was thinking i could go ahead and do fraga and some other stuff i have yet to do, but someone told me i wouldnt be able to loot unless i was flagged up to that part in the quest, i know this was an issue a while back but has it been fixed recently or is it meant to be like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Senatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been doing the same thing for about a week now, I am there usually from about 8-12 every night trying to get it to spawn, switching b/w Overlord and mistress camp sometimes, and its a pain in my ass. Fortunately I dont have to drag anyone there, I got a shammy camped there =P that I just dual box. Been here for a week and I have seen other shit spawn but not mistress or freaking overlord. Oh is Overlord duoable by a shammy and a 8k shammy buffed SK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lynxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I did it with a shaman so my HPs were not even 8k</div></div><hr />

<br />
An as far as doing stuff out of order there is a thread somewhere already explaining what can be done out of order an what you need to be flaged for to do.  just do a lil searching im sure youll find it  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Djehuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does anyone have the correct LOC for this tramp please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once again... ignore the goddamn mistress, she NEVER spawns.<br />
<br />
Start with the overlord and kill any and all Tier 4 spawns.<br />
<br />
Here's a map: http://www.davealvarado.com/eq/images/skepic/hateb.jpg<br />
<br />
A friend of mine got it to drop and I picked it up from one of the Tier 4's. Just drop them all, and it'll come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Camped MIstress For 5 hours. Got essence on third spawn. Got some rng blade on the other 2 times. Had a shammy with me, camped the bottom spawn. Then her ph, and mobb beside her.. sat on the steps for 30 min watching a movie, rinse repeat. After reading your posts, im thinking i was lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Djehuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got lucky, 3hrs..1 spawn and got the drop :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grobobos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">got the mistress to spawn and drop the thingy in less than half an hour from wich most was spent going to the camp... but anyway...<br />
just to say the mistress drops it... just have to be lucky...<br />
on the other hand she is pretty much soloable !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Souldor Dvi'Tokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As I was camping ashenbone drakes for Epic 1.0, I got lost and ended up being in tier four with a few friends, so we tried out the Overlord.<br />
<br />
Six hours passed, no overlord.<br />
<br />
About three days later I read about the Mistress, so I went with a beastlord and warrior friends of mine, and I was lucky as Mistress spawned after first PH.<br />
<br />
Guess it all depends on luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamvenya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I took a group up there and we killed only the Overlord.  To pass time we pulled adjacent buildings.  I think we camped there for around 3 hours before named popped.  We saw several other named pops as well during our course of pulling the buildings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i did this camp solo actually took maybe 3 spawns i killed once logged on alt for a few then logged back on killed ph then the next time i logged on the overlord was up</div></div><hr />
