<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Theres a new NPC in the bank at the evil outpost in OT he is a Tin Banker assistant and stands between the original Tin Banker I and II.  you cant bank with him but when hailed he says something to the effect of &quot; *whirr* insert key please&quot;. anyone have any info or leads on this guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been wondering about that myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doesn't he ask for a metal key?  I'm guessing that he's there in preparation for LDoN, but hell, I could be way off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">iksar necros have a hat quest similar to the greenmist quest.  when your necro makes level 20 you get the identify spell.  been a while, but you go to the outpost and talk to a skeleton or something and do a turn in, you get a key.  key identifys as either banker I or banker II, you turn in the random key reward of 1 or 2 to the proper banker (after the goons go out for the night, and using invis to get into the bank), and get a reward.  walla, next hat quest done (5th?, check allakazams).<br />
<br />
anyway, they fixed the bankers so you cant actually give them stuff, which broke a couple quests.  This was in all probablity one of them, hence I'd expect they'd add 2 new mobs next to the bankers as assistants 1 or 2 or something so you could do the turn in. <br />
<br />
i havent peeked in there at the bank recently, but it sounds like you no longer need to identify the key, just give it to the lone new mob.  so you can do this quest when you get gather shadows as a necro, and not wait til 20 for the identify spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are some new NPC's up on the beach in OT too...   plus there was the &quot;rumor&quot; that was added to the storyline window, probably all related somehow...  <br />

<br />
Thanks Liabach, that makes much sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wetwurx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think the bankers actualy say the same thing about a metal key if hailed.</div></div><hr />

Yah it seems theres a number of the bankers assistants appeared around the place to fix various quests broken by the Banker Fix.  The new bank clerk something-or-other in Highpass Keep is trhere to fix the Palidan epic which was broken for several weeks because.<br />

I feel for the poor Palli's.  No, Really I do.....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ShkahlTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll feel for the pallies when they have to get a retardedly rare drop off a mob in a zone no one plays in anymore. That is all</div></div><hr />
