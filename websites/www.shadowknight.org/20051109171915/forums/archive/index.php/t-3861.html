I have recently decided to create an Ogre SK and had a question on putting my creation points.  I decided to place 5 into Agi to remove the AC penalty from having low Agi, place 10 into Int, and place the last 5 into STA to help increase his HPs later on in late game play.   I just wanted to get others opinions if setup seems like a good choice.  Thanks to all who place comments and criticisms on the topic.</div></div><hr />

you've got a lot of stamina anyway and you'll pick up Sta gear as you go so personally i'd boost Int since that's the only area you're short in once Agi is fixed <br />
i'd probably boost Dex to 75 too but that's because i'm a human sk and hate having &quot;unbalanced&quot; stats, personal choice though, not at all necessary</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekrosis</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've decided to go all STA for my Ogre SK.  I know his Agi will be below 75 but I'll pick up gear that'll help it in later levels.  I also decided not to put any into Int beacuse I'll also pick up gear that will add to it as well, Sentient armor for example.  Another reason is that STA is the hardest thing to raise thru gear while AGI, DEX, and INT isn't that hard to raise.  If I'm doing something wrong with this setup please write or flame me.  His stats will be STR 140, STA 147, AGI 70, DEX 70, WIS 67, INT 70, and CHA 42 after creation.</div></div><hr />

Even as a Dark Elf I have no problems whatsoever maxxing my Stamina</div></div><hr />
