i did with 143 + geerlock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">for the 143+ geerlok the combine was listed as trivial when you succeeded ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Who has the Lowest confirmed sucess or Triv message... So far im seeing ~143</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Almost positive trivial is 160.  Mine was trivial at 163, but I've seen people say not trivial at 153 and pretty sure 158.<br />
<br />
Geerlok only increases your chance of success, it doesn't effect the trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did mine with geerlok and 155 skill, Wasnt trivial. I believe its 160 as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
no i gained 1  skill tho ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shredler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looks like 160 is the safe bet. Thank you all for the answers guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you've got all the sheath bits all ready and are just waiting to combine, you might want to just put it off until tommorow. I've heard tell that some epic TS combines will be changed to specific-skill-requirement, no-fail combines. So in this case, if you had 160 tailoring skill and attempted the combine, you'd succeed. Or whatever skill level they tie it to.<br />
<br />
It may or may not be the case for our epic, but if it is true that they're going to make that adjustment, it'd probably be worth waiting a day, slogging through 10-20 skill-ups, and not risking having to recamp Plane of Growth and Plane of Fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone try to do the sheath w/o doing the murkglider Breeder? Also if you did did it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would not combine unless told you if I were you ;)<br />
<br />
Without the sheath you can do upto killing the frogster in PoV. The wailing sister and the SKs do not aggro. <br />
<br />
P.S I really hope tonight they will change the combine to skill restricted non fail. I have 193 tailoring but i am skurd to combine due to the 5% chance to fail in trivials. And i was ultra lucky getting the lock off my 7th horsey dammit I do not want to go camp that place again :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Acolyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am wondering if you need to turn in the egg and get a hidden flag before doing the combine.  Did these people with high trailor skills  do the dialouge that tells them to do the combine?  In the BiC quest if you collect all the pieces from Vxed and do the combine without talking to Vaifan in Abs Sea, it auto-fails because you aren't flagged for it.  Wondering if this combine works the same way....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did the combine without having done Breeder.<br />
<br />
I didn't hand it in though, until after I had egg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nah, i havnt done the egg yet. I wanted to get this tailoring shit out of the way. I should have the egg tonight, and the rest of the epic 1.5 done by the end of this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Alehop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tailoring combine done with 130 skill.<br />
<br />
Probably like someone suggested im gonna bet on a hidden flag after you handed tome. Anyone got a failed combine with tome being handed/after handing the egg?<br />
<br />
Guess not many people would like to test trying the combine with 0 skill and risking losing the 3 items. Likely to work but afterall getting tailoring to 150 takes 1hour and half max, so prolly not worth the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">240 tailoring, failed combine. handed in egg and tome beforehand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">160, its trivial (exactly 160 skill here)<br />
<br />
Need someone with 159 skill to check heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone tried to combine after todays patch? would be good to find out if the combine did go no fail and the min skill for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kendril D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I made sheath with the skill of 113 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lugdug Studthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Combined at 151 plus geerlok and it was not trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>DominAtrixxMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">but afterall getting tailoring to 150 takes 1hour and half max <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
                       Please elaborate on how this is done. I have a 26 skill in tailoring and dont want to mess this combine up so need to do skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mandrake root (Shammy's Alc. Vendor ~2pp each) x 2 from 21 to 66 <br />
<br />
from there pick up Silk make Swaches and get some Heady kioas and make cured silk till ~98 skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nytmare Bloodrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Domin, as the combines are now no fail, you don't have to worry about it too much. If you don't have access to heady kiola's you can do Crystalline silk armor from velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nakky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Still really want to see a post from somebudy with real low smith skill saying they succedded combine....my tailor skill is squat, and would like to keep it that way unless I absolutly have to. Just don't have the kohones to try it with a 12 skill : p</div></div><hr />

It is a N0-Fail combine at 100 skill - no matter how you get your skill there (includes +skill items) - you CANNOT attempt the combine until you have at least 100 skill.</div></div><hr />
