<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a way to test Katta faction easily, more specific for the Sigil Earring of Veracity quest?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis is your friend... the only mobs on Katta factions are in Katta or in the two adjacent zones (Katta Castellum Citizens on Twilight Zone side (yes, even the guards), Validus Custodus on Tenebrous Mountains side). There are also the two quest npcs in Sanctus Seru that are on Validus Custodus. Magus Conlegium and Concilium Universus are only found inside Katta, but again, invis is your friend. Would advice you to check Concilium faction on the assling in the garden on the top level of Katta, Conlegium faction on any mob in either of the towers of the caster guild. I just run through Fungus Grove to get there, it's not that long or dangerous a run.<br />
<br />
General advice on the Katta factions:<br />
There are several factions in Katta, but by the time you have killed enough in Seru for the third earring and upwards you should be good to go with the factions needed.<br />
<br />
I was KoS to all, now they all like me (lots of killing in Sanctus Seru later). Last to go above KoS was the Citizens of Katta Castellum faction, which is more of a matter of killing the right mobs. Concilium Universus is what you need for the third and up, or was it fourth and fifth only... well, you need it anyway, but killing to get the reports/shards/head will all give you big enough hits I would say.<br />
<br />
Validus Custodus is the faction you need to raise before beginning however, which is easily accomplished as killing just about any Coterie or Seru will raise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lurker99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG! no &quot;use search n00b!&quot; replies?... what is this world coming to?..<br />
<br />
you search nazis are slacking..<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, thanks for the info Silvershadow that makes a bit more sense than it used to. I hate all this faction work crap. After getting my Cabilis faction I swore I would never do any more faction type quests again, well, guess what.. <br />
<br />
<br />
oh well...<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks again.</div></div><hr />
