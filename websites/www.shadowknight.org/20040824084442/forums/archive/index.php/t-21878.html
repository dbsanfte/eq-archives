Oh, and while we're at it... fuck Jose Mourhino - I happen to like having Gronkjaer at Chelsea, and Gerrard is not the kind of player Chelsea needs to be chasing with the likes of Lampard and Makelele already established.

And believe it or not, I watch American football too - even have season tickets to my city's NFL team, but if we had top notch soccer or rugby teams and I had to pick between the two, you can bet it wouldn't be the american football team I'd be going to... <br />
<br />
Heh, I pretty much watch any team sport that's on to be honest though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grulknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rugby ? You mean the sport where grown men stick their heads between other mens gross hairy crotches and play &quot;pass the ball between your legs&quot;? LOL. What a bunch of fucking tards. NFL realized this homoerotic sport had a flaw and merely made the Center have to pass the ball between his legs to a man standing well enough away as to not smell his sweaty gonads.<br />

In scrums, your head doesn't go between anyone's legs, it goes on the outside around the lower theigh... probably further away from the guy in front of you's dick than the QB in football's is away from the center's.  <br />
<br />
You don't pass the ball between the legs either - that's also american football.  In rugby, you roll it back with your feet.  <br />
<br />
Football (American) is merely rugby for pussies... we hit harder with fewer (re: virtually no) pads and bitch about it less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not a huge soccer fan, and not a big rugby fan even though my unit has a couple of teams.  Dont get me wrong, but if your calling the American version pussies based on size you got some problems..Im a big NE fan, and if you wanna go by size, then Ty Warren 6'4 320, David Pruce 6'8 295, Mroczkowski 6'2 303, and Jack Fadule 6'5 316 are clear indicators that Amercian style football is definatly not for pussies..  Todays athletes are bigger, faster, and far strong due to supplements, better training techniques, and a better diet then ever before.  Todays middle line backers are damn near as fast as running backs and are huge.  Im not slamming rugby, its fun to watch, but pound for pound American pro football players are Bigger and stronger and faster.. How many Rugby players could keep up with Moss??  <br />
     As for the pads, well, when youve got a guy who weighs 300+ pounds and runs the 50 faster then most sprinters you knew in high school barreling down on you, you thank god for all those pads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Size?  Hah, being excessively obese doesn't make you a pussy, it just makes you prone to a heart attack.  No, it's the ungodly amount of padding and tendency toward whining/bitching/show boating/etc. that makes me consider a great many american football players pussies.  Oh yeah, having to take steroids and supplements and shit just to succeed doesn't help your case either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but give me football over baseball, soccer, basketball and hockey on TV (live it pwns).  Though I like curling so what do I know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How many Rugby players could keep up with Moss??  <br />
<br />
You want fast?  I'd like to see Moss outrun Joe Rocokoko, Rupeni Caucaunbuca, Doug Howlett, Nick Evans, George Griegan, etc. - there's a rather long list.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you think football players are &quot;more badass&quot; than rugby players, you're simply mistaken.  More overweight? certainly, but that's about it.  Football players spend most of their time resting - 16secs/minute is the average action in a football game - where rugby players run basically nonstop for 40minuts, take 10 off, and do it again.  <br />
<br />
As for them &quot;needing the pads&quot; - that's your evidence of them being pussies by comparison right there - I'd rather be hit by ANY football player than by Kees Meeuws, and rugby players get the pleasure of being drilled by him all the time... without those lovely pads.  <br />
<br />
(BTW, can you tell I'm a NZ All Blacks fan?  Heh...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You comparing two different types of athletes..Its like comparing War horses to quarter horses..Obviously your opinion is incredible biased..As to the steroid issue, maybe you should look into how strict the guidlines are..Some do slip through, but most dont...Hmm, I wonder if rugby players take injectables.  I wouldnt call rugby players pusses, nor would I call a 6'5 285 pounder a puss.. Some are overweight, mostly your front line wether it be offence or defence, it comes with the territory... Im just not dumb enough to let that size be misleading..They are quicker, more agile, and faster then ever before..And you dont have to take steroids to get that level of skill..  There are a ton of legal non steroid supplements that athletes use to get that level of play.  ON that note, how many soccer players use steroids, or cricket players, or any proffesional sport...  Unless they have a strict monitering system you will have people abuse it..<br />
     So, that being said, I prefer American Football, I dont mind rugby, and Im not much of a soccer fan.. As and far as Im concerned, the only folks who hit as hard as US football player are Hockey players..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm less bias than you.  I follow both sports - I know what I'm comparing.  You're trying to tell me that football players are better athletes/more badass than rugby players, and it's simply not true, if for no other reason than rugby has a larger population to draw from (I.E. the whole world vs 1 country).  More than anything though, football has too many show-boaters; people with enormous egos always trying to steal the show... rugby just doesn't draw that kind of person, there's no room for it in the sport.  Rugby demands higher levels of discipline, fitness, and &quot;toughness&quot; than football too - you don't get to take breaks unless you score, you don't wear pads, you don't get to run out of bounds, you don't have nearly as many safeguards.  Sure there are some badass football players, but there are also alot who simply can't compare too.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I'll wage a substantial sum of money that Kees Meeuws can hit with more pounds of force than ANY American football player, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not to mention the fact that after watching a CFL game (Canadian Football League), it makes you want to shoot most pro football players in the teeth with a 12-gauge. But anyway, I play football, I play rugby, I play hockey, I ref hockey, I play field and box lacrosse, I played basketball, indoor/outdoor soccer, baseball, tennis, curling, you name it, I've done it.... and in all honesty, though I can't say for pro-level stuff..... rugby hurts the most out of all of them. And holy shit, is it fun. There is nothing more fun than getting the ball on the outside and running your ass like no tomorrow, all alone... and getting pounded into the ground so hard that it makes your momma cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">getting pounded into the ground so hard that it makes your momma cry. <br />
<br />
I've seen that happen... was our full back, and he got up and scored a try within the minute.  Was quite amusing actually, but with his pace it's not surprising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">And he says Im biased.../em raises the bullshit flag... Pro ball players in America in general make more then other lesser known, by American standards, sports then most.  Yes they showboat, yes they get paid waaay too much money, and Americans, and Canadians, and countless others love to watch them play.  Go ahead and keep your rugby.. I for one, though only second generation american, love this truely American sport..Football, baseball, and basketball are the top three picks on my list.  While the origions of football may not have been founded in the states, the Americans have definatly taken the ball and run with it....If I were in Europe I may have a slightly different opinion.   Maybe once pigs sprout wings, and rugby and soccer become popular here, I may pay more attention to it..Till them...nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Most watched television events worldwide:  Soccer World Cup, Olympics, Rugby World Cup.  Seem to remember hearing Cricket world cup is 5th, but havn't figured out what would be fourth... maybe Wimbledon or the Melbourne Cup.<br />
<br />
I like how you went from saying football players are better than rugby players to saying football players get paid more though and (here's the winner) you liking football makes you more american... nice twist.  Can't say whether or not its true because they don't make nearly as big a deal out of it in non-american sports and I've never cared to inquire, but I wouldn't dispute it.  The whole system is radically different (in terms of player transfers and pay and shit) than in football though, so it's not so easy to compare.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If you had read a little closer I didnt mention most watch in the world..I said here.. The holy trio ie football, basketball, and Baseball are the most number one watched events, sporting wise, then soccer or rugby..  Since I live here, I tend to support it.. I suppose if there were no &quot;American&quot; sporting events on, and my grass didnt need trimming, or I had to go watch the grass grow, Id suffer through a game or two of rugby..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">And here we have a perfect example of why the world hates us.  &quot;If it aint american, it sucks!!!&quot; syndrome isn't a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Also as a side note, I said the American Pro football players, were Bigger...on average they are, stronger, goes without saying, and faster...Take your speedsters, and have em slap on all those pads and see how fast they go..  Randy Moss in incredibly fast, EXSPECIALLY, with all that gear on..And if watching US football doesnt make me more American, I mearly embrace the culture of the society I live in..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">And here we go again with the football players are better thing.  Any other rugby fans that can spell the name of that South African winger?  I can barely spell normal words, let along south african last names... well, at any rate, I guarantee he or Howlett can take Moss in a footrace, and I fail to see how it &quot;goes without saying&quot; that football players are stronger - I'd put my money on the strongest rugby player being stronger than the strongest football player... or the top 5 vs top 5... whatever.  <br />
<br />
There's no logic behind your arguments; aspects of the game aside, they're all athletes, and rugby simply has a much larger population to draw from, and is popular among people that are traditionally better athlets in various areas.  Your average samoan or tongan is more powerful than your average american; your average south african or kenyan is faster than your average american; etc.  And sure there are certainly some badass football players, but to say that &quot;it goes without saying&quot; that the average football player is better than the average rugby player is simply ignorant.  <br />
<br />
As for &quot;embracing the culture&quot; - I have; I havn't missed a home game for my NFL team in over 3 years (season tickets since I was... 5 or 6).  &quot;Embracing the culture&quot; doesn't mean having blind visions of superiority though.  Like I said, people like you are exactly why the world hates us - you have a very clear &quot;it's American so it's obviously superior&quot; attitude, and that's a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I agree Im very biased on some things...I admit you..You however dont think that you are....Well Mister Pot, Im mister kettle..Nice to meet you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I never said I wasn't bias, I said you were more bias.  That said, I don't consider my viewpoint on this bias - I'm simply making observations as someone who closely follows both sports and using simple logic.  (That's right, I have nothing at all against football, I simply have something against your assertations.  Shocking, eh?)<br />
<br />
Take football and rugby out of the equation for a second and revert to logic.  <br />
<br />
You're looking for the best fish for your aquarium in a particular aspect: you have two samples from which to find it; you much choose one sample to search.  One sample is a single aquarium, the other is a fish store.  Where do you expect to have the best chance at finding the fish you're looking for?  The same logic applys to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Im more biased then you, your less biased then me, it sounds like a bad playground scene... Your analogy of the fish tank has little or no bearing..You stated that I thought that everything american was better, when the entire argument was merely over the preference over Football to Rugby...You can make all the insinuations you like, I like what I like, you like what you like, and its doubtfull that either will change his or her mind from a simple thread..I refuse to blow it out of proportion..Bottom line it was a sports related discussion..Nothing less nothing more..I dont know at what point you thought I was implying that everything american was better, but then again, its your little world, who am I do dictate.....I would never be so pompous as to assertain ones view merely by reading a sporting thread.<br />
<br />
as for the fish, which would you choose oh unbiased worldly one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It wasn't a debate over preference - you were trying to claim that football players are &quot;better&quot; physically than rugby players.  <br />
<br />
The fishtank analogy (dosn't have to be fish - could be anything along those lines; if you're looking for a certain rare CD, are you more likely to find it at the little CD shop down the road or on tower.com?) hold perfectly true in that regard.  <br />
<br />
In the search for the better athlete, football has the US to search, rugby has the whole world.  I'd say that gives rugby an advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">/sigh, you really are full of yourself arent you...Yes..Duh, I stated I thought US football player pound for pound were better then others..I never stated that Everything US was best, that was your little phrase, and Yes, it was a sports related discussion.  Also, incase you hadnt noticed, there is a CFL, and EFL, all of whom the NFL Drafts from...Guess its not just for Americans any more eh..Pleanty of NFL'rs, go to the CFL to improve and to the EFL, and vise versa... I dont know what your trolling for, but its not here..Just to clarify....<br />
1. I think that Proffessional Football players are better..Weather they come from the NFL, the CFL, or the EFL.<br />
2. I never stated that Everything American made was better...<br />
3. I have no clue what your digging for, but keep it up little fella, sooner or later you might find it..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yes, there are the CFL and the EFL, but to a large extent, they're developmental  leagues for americans rather than leagues for their respective countries (well, the EFL anyway, not so much the CFL).  The EFL doesn't draw the best of the european athletes though; rugby, cricket, and soccer do.  If football had that kind of popularity in europe, the best european football players would all be coming to america to play just like good american soccer players go to Europe... that's a rare occurance for football though.  <br />
<br />
I never said you said everything american is better - I said your claims about american football players give that impression and that impression is why the world hates Americans so much (I.E. you're the reason you're stationed oversease for the military).  When the topic is X, and you say that the american version of X is better than someone else's version of X, it's natural that you'd give that impression.  Your statement that you think football players are better than rugby players gives you that image, and it's a rather laughable assertation too.</div></div><hr />

I will say the American Football players are generally more specialized to thier specific role that most other sports.  To me the 5'6&quot; 145lb. kick returner is just as interesting to watch at the 6'10&quot; 375lb. Offensive lineman.  But I hate the showboating too, what happened to the Walter Payton/Barry Sanders style of handing the ball to the ref when the play is over rather than dancing after you just did your job?</div></div><hr />
