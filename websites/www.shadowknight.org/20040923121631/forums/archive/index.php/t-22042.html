<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sebilis aka the worst server ever !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sebilis aka the worst server ever !<br />
<br />
Not because ye be a traitor to your own language that you should misconsider the Frog server Askeerhunan  :D <br />
<br />
Still luv ya though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sebilis is just best for GM event, ping and there're best guilds there.<br />
We're just 1 month late for patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They should just have named Sebilis the Kikou server. Everyone who says Kikou should be moved to Sebilis. And I'm not a traitor to anything, I'm proud to lead a french only guild that rocks big time.<br />
I'm serious about Sebilis being the worst server ever. But I'm glad it was created, cause we have a lot less retards on regular servers now. And hi Simu and Arkis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derraj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">didn't another SK do the exact same thing, but instead it was in english?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Simu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They should just have named Sebilis the Kikou server. <br />
<br />
Do as I do, - 10DKP for everyone &quot;Kikouing&quot;, shut down ooc (wait, it's off since 5 years when I started on Druzzil Ro)... Problem solved.<br />
<br />
Keep the good job on Karana, and post more news !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'll post news when we kill something new :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Imothep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The translations on Seblis always make me laugh badly.<br />
When i am in a bad mood i just go there and my smile come again  :D <br />
<br />
Less expensive than beer, and you don't have a headache the tomorrow morning.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Profett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">reading through that makes me miss the old days, had some of my best times playing EQ back then and hitting all of the same spots that he did.  I kinda wish it was still the same .. you just don't get the same feeling leveling up another char like you do with your first. /shrug, maybe it's just me being all nastolgic :p</div></div><hr />
