<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With rogue and pet class in group how many attackers can be at mobs back and rogue still backstab?  I try to move the mob so that the pets are at its back as well as rogue.  Sometimes it is hard to reposition a mob if you have a beastlord in group.  I find that when I try to step back the mob will sit there and attack the beastlord.  I am assuming this is because they don't turn off pet taunt.  But I'm not sure.  I'll have to ask them to turn it off next time to make sure.  What I don't like is when we have no rogue or pet class and all the melee are on the same side as me taking reposte damage.  I never stand in front of a mob when off tanking.  I am in back or to the side if a rogue is present. How lame do you have to be.  I'm just hoping they are not ignorant and only want to improve on thier defense skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vezax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any number of people of pet/people can be hitting a mobs back, as long as the mobs hit box can fit that many people in the back arc of the mob.  For xp groups hiting the back should be easy peasy.<br />
<br />
Basically what I do for positioning.<br />
<br />
Pull past pets so they attack back, most rogues are adpeted enough to get to the back of the mob themselves.  I try not to corner pin a mob (IE having a mob back to a corner) unless I absolutely cannot get it out of there.<br />
<br />
If there is a ranger in the group I ask if the have archery AAs.  If they do, I try and position the mob away from walls, casue walled mobs cause arrows to poof.  Generally this can be hard if there are 3+ pets (so much push and im so lazy =P).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just an addition to that, when I have a bard pulling and I have my pet using CD and ToT I hold aggro easy, so I just send my pet out to attack the incoming mob.  I have enough aggro that it runs on through to me allowing my pet to attack the mobs back. <br />
          Rouges are quick to move, plus I've talked to the rouges I've grouped with before, you can have the rouge invis and place themselves up front.  Then as you pull the mob through they are in perfect postion to attack.  And just try to keep the mob in the center of a room for xp groups so rangers if any have a clear shot.  Plus if mana allows its fun to play the long walk sometimes.  Use one of the more powerful snares for pulling and a terror spell, the ranger or rangers can arrow the mob all the way in.  Just a thought, I enjoy it from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to admit unless it's someone I know and trust, I usually prefer not to group with pet classes, especially beastlords.<br />
<br />
Strafing (Ctrl left and right arrow) round the mob so it faces in a more or less constructive direction while you follow it up the slope of the wall and into the ceiling is usually the best I can do.<br />
<br />
For some reason, in general pet classes seem to be as bad as warriors for &quot;Stealth&quot; taunting.  Getting them to stop, or even admit they're doing it in the first place is like pulling teeth.<br />
<br />
To be fair, beasty warders are also particularly badly designed for aggro control and positioning with all that DPS, casting and push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Control + Left or Right&quot; makes you strafe?? OMG I seriously had no idea about this.  Talk about learning something new everyday.  That will make it much easier to position the mobs.  Alot better than turning sideways and moving.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yah the beast warder i 2box without taunt on just pet haste plus spirit of storms (lvl 58 or something pet proc) holds agro off me if i try to say drag the mob back into my 2box'd clerics cheal range after awhile. Even then beastlords are still my favorite slowers and one of my favorite classes for a dps position since when mobs run when low hp (like pov castle) i just CD the mob then go out and pull anotehr while the pets+melee finish off the mob rather then say my wife (65wiz) wasting more mana dropping an SoS on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">keeping rogue pets in position is the responsibility of the pet owner, not the MT. i have enough trouble (read - i am lazy) keeping mobs out of walls for rangers in some places<br />
<br />
most rogues dont care if you wall the mob as long as you keep the back of the mob available<br />
<br />
BL pets get a proc called spirit of snow which is like a 132 dmg proc, 2 sec stun and -50 hate everytime it procs. its reasonably rare though quite a few BL dont have it. good for aggro kiting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In LDoN for instance, I hit the puller's assist with festering as soon as it's safe and back up enough, &quot;pulling&quot; the mob to me,  to where I still have enough room at my back to allow for the eventual push. Basically &quot;drag&quot; the mob to me with agro and the pets all end up nicely positioned behind. If there isn't room for that, once I've got the mob and everyone's on it, just dragging it back a bit will get everyone else behind. (people love to send the pets in the instant they see the mob whether or not they've seen you cast yet)<br />
<br />
Yes, BL pets are the worst, as well as their owners. Push is a big peeve of mine so I have no problem asking a BL to counter his pet's push by positioning himself opposite it. Helps a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once everyone's engaged, slight circlestrafe adjustments can help. If the mob's being heavily pushed into a corner or about to be walled a good pet owner will back his pet off if it's the blockage to a reposition. Unfortunately many pet owners don't pay attention to the signs of a tank trying to yank the mob out of a corner or off the wall. <br />
<br />
When all is said and done, I do what's necessary to keep the backstabbing pets or PC's where they need to be in order to maximize DPS. Everyone else is secondary. In a stationary camp (not a dungeon crawl) I try to ensure the mob's engaged as close to the same spot each time, so the backstabbing pet owners can position their pet to be sent in properly. <br />
<br />
Sometimes there's nothing you can do, people won't listen, and you just suck it up, grit your teeth, and do what you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
left and right (without ctrl) while holding the right mouse button for mouselook also strafes.  This lets you strafe and turn at the same time, so you can completely circle a mob while always facing it.</div></div><hr />

Center myself in area or room.<br />
Cast CD on Mob continue to cast until the mob comes to you, if the group is stopping it from reaching you then the problem lies with them, usually 3 to 4 CD will make any MOB head your way even from Slows!<br />
<br />
Lock Aggro various ways all fairly easy (chain CD + Voice of Terris+decent DPS as an example)<br />
<br />
I position the mob as close to center of the room pull  area as possible and let everyone push him from one side especially BL warders which appear to be the mellee pushmiesters! <br />
<br />
Rouges of course have to spin with the mob as it gets turned around you but it seems to work very well for me. I just let the mob slip to my right if hes getting pushed from the left and if I have aggro locked turn to face him and he will run into me only to be pushed to the right of my screen again, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
This works well even if everyone starts attacking from different sides you wil notice the mob being pushed in one particular direction, just side step and let it drift that way, turn and repeat.<br />
<br />
BL gaining aggro I see often but if he does he doesnt gain it for long before I capture it again.<br />
<br />
This seems to work well for me against summoning mobs as well especially if I get their attention to the center of the area on the first CD cast if the group screws up and engages it to early then  chain CD it, youll get summoned about three or four times. Just keep slowly walking it back an it will eventually just follow you to center of room/pull area. (IMPORTANT NOTE HERE:if the group walls the mob I dont recommend trying this! I have been summoned into walls and would have ended our raid if it were not for mages and CoTH to get me out)<br />
<br />
I havent had much luck using a guild tanks method but I have seen him postion a mob to the center by beating on it lossing its aggro momentarily then sitting down were he wanted the mob to come to, works very well for him.<br />
<br />
In short after you have managed to position yourself and the mob so that it circles you and the group starts to follow it as it spins around you they will all just seem to fall into line.<br />
<br />
Everytime I have taken the time to try and expalin it it just becomes a mess best just to make it happen and before you know it everyone will follow suite! <br />
<br />
For those special toons that must have the aggro let em have it! After a PoP mob has beat on them for a short period they will quit or die or the cleric will /tell them with a WTF? shortly their after! (Btw how humilitating is it to be killed by a rainbow colored frog thats no larger than the noob rats!)<br />
