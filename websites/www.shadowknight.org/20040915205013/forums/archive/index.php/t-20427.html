<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering which of these I should grind out first. The are next two AA's im getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LR would be first. Being missed is the best scenario, esp. as a caster/puller. ID does not mitigate max hits or min hits or misses, which  lowers its percentage effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the same situation, LR and ID are the next two AAs I'm getting.  I had been contemplating splitting between the two, but without scaling cost / benefits (in either direction) I decided to just focus on getting missed.  So my suggestion is to do LR first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One could argue &quot;smoothing&quot; damage taken is more helpful.  I'd say the difference hardly matters.  Do one, do the other, alternate...whatever you won't notice the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did LR first and then ID, but in the end it doesn't matter, just get both maxed, as both will help equally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>VeyRonZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">do both at the same time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&gt;&gt;LR would be first. Being missed is the best scenario, esp. as a caster/puller. ID does not mitigate max hits or min hits or misses, which lowers its percentage effectiveness.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
And LR doesn't help with hits, ripostes, dodges, parries, or misses that would have missed anyways.<br />
<br />
It's the same thing.  Percentage improvement is very similar.  The primary reason you might want LR first is less hits means less chance to be stunned or interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Berren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LR is what I maxed first.  ID is a percentage based and doesn't help Knights as much as it does Warriors.  Both are needed, but I'd go with LR first.  Its been said already, but being missed and taking no damage is better than getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LR first because you could FEEL the difference between lvl's of LR but with ID it was alot less noticable. That being said they are alot of fun to do both of them and they both do greatly increase your ability to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually there is absolutely no difference whatsoever as to which you do first.  Originally in the AA discussions where they were ranked, the author had CA listed as being better than CS.  I did some rough math and showed that over time that they would both provide the exact same amount of damage reduction, and the case it the same here.  Won't bother to redo the stats, but it really is exactly the same.<br />
<br />
As far as Dhantes comments on being able to &quot;FEEL&quot; the difference with LR, I am pretty sure that is more placebo effect than any real percieved difference.  The small amount that LR and ID provide helps, but it's so little that a human being would not be capable of discerning a real difference.  1% less damage per level isn't enough to feel a real difference.  People have a tendancy to see more of a difference if they think they will, and the mind can fool people quite readily.  It's hard to be objective in things like that.  Nothing personal though Dhantes.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1% per level isn't terribly noticable, no.<br />
<br />
The 15% or so improvement on both avoidance and mitigation between CA/CS0 and LR/ID5 is, however, quite noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can make the same argument that taking more steady damage and smoothing out damage spikes is just as valuable as having an easier time casting or avoiding getting stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went the route of ID first. they can cause the biggest problems for us knights tanking.  Two, I am a tank.  I don't want to dodge more, I'd rather take a hit better =P<br />
<br />
However, LR is valued as well, as mentioned before.  In the event that LR makes you dodge an incoming melee, it's one less time you would have to go for a channeling roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think that mitigation AAs might be better to do after the avoidance ones if you do not have good AC to start with though. Before any AA is spent, your AC is and always will be the basis of your mitigation of incoming melee damage. With poor AC, damage spikes won't be solved with maxed cs/id AAs alone...<br />
<br />
You need both, so it is all the same in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your gonna get both anyway . so who cares.<br />
<br />
Personally I went LR first cause well i liked the thought of not getting hit at all instead of getting hit for less  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I went LR5 first and dinged LR5 in fact during the Carprin cycle of all places. I went that route because ive been told over and over that it helps w/ casting interupts and that actually leaned the scale to LR's favor first.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
