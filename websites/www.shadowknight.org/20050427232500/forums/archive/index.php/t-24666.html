<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bespoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, over the last week, i have read many many things about shadowknights, a 51 warrior iksar being my main, i decided to trek on over to firona vie, and make a new character. Things i had in mind:<br />
Looks awesome<br />
Solos well<br />
can take things down by just tanking<br />
can take things down by just casting<br />
is overall a great asset to a group, mt, or ot... or just dps<br />
has many great abilities...<br />
<br />
Than i visited this forum, only to see HUGE arguments about different races to pick from, and most forum entries seemed to be focused on, that, it doesnt matter what you play, everything is equivalent, or eventually equivicates in the endgame. My main being 51, and me playing for 3 years, i guess i never really reached the end-game, so i wanted something that was the best, from the begining to the end.<br />
<br />
I picked, Iksar Shadowknight, i knew it would take the longest to level, and i knew everything hated me, (neither of which i cared too much about): so i went forth and put like all my points except 5 into intellegence (knowing that mana should play an important factor in soloing) and those remaining 5 into stamina.<br />
<br />
1-9: field of bone, occasional trip to swamp of no hope<br />
9-18,19,20: Kurn's tower, great to bring up dead spells...<br />
20-27: giant fort in ww<br />
27-30: sarnak fort in LOIO<br />
<br />
soloed pretty much the whole time, staying in character, and teaming up with only iksars, also proceded to accumlate my wealth, which if any of you dont know, is EXTREMELY easily done on the FV server. got given a spear of the four winds by a high level player, sold it for 6k, twinked the shit out of myself, blade of disruption and everything.<br />
<br />
now, at level 30, i can still solo reds without buffs, and completely take out whites, or under with EITHER melee or magic.<br />
<br />
Well, i have to say, i am extremely happy with my Crusader of Greenmist, he has prided Rile well, and continues to out damage all his groupies or solo and insult them.<br />
<br />
Ogre, Troll, Human, Erudite, Gnome, dark elf... All good &quot;end game&quot;<br />
<br />
Iksar: Uber, all game...<br />
<br />
Little quips about iksars bound to come up in flaming:<br />
QUIP: no slam Answer: bash, its a more guaranteed interup, and does more damage.<br />
QUIP: Xp penalty Answer: congratulations, your mediocre, be a man, take the penalty, and gloat that your the slowest leveling class..., pussy.<br />
QUIP: Faction Answer: fine, play a human, theres no answer to ninny'ness<br />
QUIP: No, frontal stun resistance Answer: i admit, this does at TIMES effect my spell casting, but is not as common as most think, and really doesnt bug me that much.<br />
QUIP: Forage suxors Answer: no it doesnt, iksar is officially the only race that can be a SK and forage... iksar win.<br />
<br />
This is all IMHO, but is just a first hand look, (semi objective) at the iksar sk...</div></div><hr />

<br />
At times effect your casting?  Mate, you're level 31.  You've just barely GOTTEN feign, much less learned the pain and horror of trying to train&amp;feign, then seeing a stun.<br />
<br />
Stats, stun resist, et cetera ad nausium - the powergamer pick is Ogre.<br />
<br />
This from a Human SK, mind - I just like the look.  And as many have said - endgame it really does become moot.</div></div><hr />

sorry, if I could reroll.. I would do it as an iksar, Natural AC bonus+regen for the win... most stuns at high level gaming are spellstuns neyhow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bespoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">btw, i like ur magelo kilk, its funny, we both have shade silk robes, i have used it on FV to make people duel me, because they will think i am a necro or something and think they got an easy win, then i HT and crap and its all over, worked real well against an ubertwink human warrior...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye I play a troll and if I could do it all over I would be a Iksar (for AC bonus and dump all my points into CHA)<br />
<br />
all other stats are pretty much trival with the uber drops  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and dump all my points into CHA <br />
<br />
<br />
While you're at it, why don't you dump your brain into the toilette as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DI fool, and cha is only stat you won't have maxed with decent gear and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I picked ogre, I'll still stick with ogre.  I like slam, frontal stun immunity (yeah it's only from melee blows and not from behind.. but.. it's nice).  I don't mind the lack of regen since it becomes relatively moot at high levels, but for leveling up the regen is nice.  And the iksar ac bonus was meant to balance out their inability to wear plate, but end game they get to wear plate as well it seems... so it ends up just being a sweet bonus for them.  Lucky lizards.  Forage would be great to have for tradeskilling but same with being a gnome for tinkering.<br />
<br />
They all have some benefit.  I think I'd do ogre if I did it again.  Heck I might, who knows LOL.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bespoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well, just quite everquest after my expiriment with a firona vie toon, and seeing how uber i got its just an example of how easy the game is getting. Not fun anymore just a chore. Not gonna pay 15$ a month for something i dont absolutely adore...<br />
<br />
Yar har har, i win. Back to unreal tournament 2004 and Halo 2, games that take skill, not just time. Because when you think about it, no one is really, &quot;good&quot; at eq, its just decsion making, and non-leisure activities...<br />
<br />
I would return on one condition, they actually start the free first 3 expansion server, or at least like 5 bux a month...  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wish they would do another server like stromm, but this time never open transfer's.  Keep it exclusively people who leveled and geared up on the server.</div></div><hr />
