<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about some feedback on a minor mana twitch spell.  My guild has like 2 Necromancers and are rarely on for big raids.  Everytime a Cleric says LOM, I wish I had some sort of mana twitch spell that could help out.<br />
<br />
Don't want anything powerful like a Necro's, just minor in nature.  I think it would be a good addition to our raid spell line up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">god..every necro alive despises the fuck out of twitch. we are a damage dealing class, we never wanted to buff / heal / mana feed anyone. being able to do 40k+ dmg on mobs (IV, sleepers mobs etc) vs twitching clerics with poor gear is just frustrating. i can cast twitch, same mana cost as cheal 14 times or so - we have clerics that go oom after 7 or 8 cheals. <br />
<br />
its frustrating to become a mana bandaid to people with bad gear instead of being able to do a ton of dmg &amp; shorten the fight considerably, making it safer all around. dropping the mob 20 sec faster == less healing &amp; no need for twitching, if someone has poor gear and eats up all my mana, it hurts the raid all around.<br />
<br />
don't wish for something like twitch, it is just another thing that feeds into the brokeness of eq (7500 point heal at lvl 39, 70% slow at lvl 52 etc). <br />
<br />
necros do good now that dots stack and pets aren't kos / dont break mez..but we still get turned into twitch bitches a lot.<br />
<br />
part of the reason ive taken up my SK again is i'm tired of being a twitcher etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And I stick by my original statement there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No way in hell do I want to become a major mana spounge like mages before mod nerfs.  I happen to enjoy playing my sk the way its intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind that focus effects don't work with CH, so even though it is the same mana cost on paper that's not the case in game. I do see your point however, just something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you dump all your mana to a cleric and go oom faster, you take away from your own DPS. You should be doing damage to the mob really.<br />
<br />
Z Bite is our form of mana dump, and if your not grouped with a cleric in the CH chain during the raid somethings wrong here.<br />
<br />
Of course if the mob is disease immune wont matter where you are in the raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I beg to disagree - had more than one AL fight where I borrowed EHB and made that fight winnable by tapping my lil' eye for the Clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kirhouk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eq is set up for most raids to require all classes avaliable.  If your raid has necro's,  BST's, mage's, and sk's all there and doing there job, there is no reason clerics will run OOM.  Xegony fight is a prime example of this. <br />
   SoE is not about to give 1 class the primary duty of keeping clerics with mana.  Thats why the long recast on all these classes mana dumping spells and the mod rod nerf. If for some reason SoE wants to make it someone's primary job again, I really hope its not us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You dont want manafeed trust me, you wont just be using it when your low on necros, youll be using it ALL the time, you wont get to tank, you wont get to do damage you WILL sit in the back of a raid medding andgiving mana to people non stop as they die, need more, etc<br />
<br />
As for the ratio, spec+spec mastery saves you about 45% mana, making ch 220 mana or so<br />
Sedulous Subversion. 400 mana for 175 mana, throw in spec/focus/spec mastery thats 65% if you use a focus no necro has (most necros dont take beneficial spell focus for the same reason as us), but lets say they do have one 135 mana for 175 mana (so it could be kept up forever), can do it once every 11 seconds which means 15 mana/tick additional, to bad a cleric regens mana close to 100/tick in a raid enviroment, 6 necros=enough mana regen to have added ONE more cleric</div></div><hr />
