<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I know alota people are wondering what race to pick out sometimes and stuff, or which race is better, but here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
Best Races - For Starting/Ending:<br />
#1 - Ogres ~ No Stun from front end<br />
#2 - Iksars ~ Highest Regen Rate<br />
#3 - Trolls ~ 2nd highest Regen Rate<br />
#4 - Gnomes ~ Alright lvling, good in dungeons<br />
#5 - Erudits ~ Fastest leveling<br />
<br />
<br />
My Favorite on Looks:<br />
#1 Dark Elf *!!!!!!!*<br />
#2 Troll (Very ugly unless no armor on head/body)<br />
#3 Iksars (Look cool, are cool)<br />
#4 Ogres (Just look a lil bad-ass)<br />
#5 Gnomes (Very tiny, not really an evil class Imo, better looks than Erudite)<br />
#6 Erudite (Ugliest class, big heads)<br />
<br />
These are what I think, the best class in the end game no matter what are Ogres, but Dark Elves get a nice Visible Range in the night making it easier to see if you're lost sometimes (:D)<br />
Iksars and Trolls are nice for all time as well, but later in the game you can match their regen rate with armor....<br />
Gnome and Erudite are not so cool Imo, just not really evil enough, look worst Imo, but small and nice exp lvling, no extra special boost really (maybe int/mana).<br />
<br />
In the end, my favorites are Dark Elves, best looking, very evil, and very cool, then comes to my list going down from #1-#5 heh.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps to some people who wants to take a race, just know those Large Races will cause you trouble in the begining if you're going through dungeons, so have a Shrink item/person with you, and yeah, GL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Funny, I thought humans could be SK's too and that they leveled fastest.<br />
Funny, Erudites blasted Kerrans to the moon and created a crater out of thier own city - apparently that isn't evil.<br />
Funny, I thought all the &quot;what race do I pick&quot; questions ended at least a year ago.<br />
Funny, I thought gnomes has the highest stat totals of SK playable races.<br />
Funny, I thought I'd never read posts stupider than newtank's, gensis', goldenpine's again - I was wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, a lot of the OoW mobs are able to stun Ogres from the front, or so I'm told. And the iksar's redeeming quality isn't the regen, it's the ac bonus... unless it's a really long fight with a mob that AE's, you won't notice much of the regen through normal fighting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The misconception is that Ogres are immune to all frontal stuns.  Ever since POP, SOE has thrown in a large variety of mobs with spell stun procs, to which we were never immune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only race with any meaningful advantage what so ever is Iksar.  They have an AC bonus which others cannot get.  You can gain a large portion of Ogres unstunability through AA's.  DPS is so high that regen means nothing (and extra 24 regen negates 4 dps, if you're taking 500 dps tanking... ya thats not major).   Everyone that isn't an Iksar is 100% equal, Iksars are very slightly better and even then their 60 ac bonus or whatever means less as gear improves.  Aside from that one bonus theres no difference besides size and some lame exp penailities between Human, Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre, Erudite, and Iksar... Gnomes aren't a real SK race they're small, bald, smell like carnies, and just can't be intimidating.  Gnome SK's also get denied to joining my guild automatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can't believe you replied either, Brael.<br />
<br />
Unless this is a ploy to convince Fallgore that he isn't the complete and utter moron we are saying he is, to get him to continue posting grade 'A' flame fodder.<br />
<br />
If so, well played, sir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brael that's racial profiling.<br />
<br />
Racial Profiling is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ohh haha, Marruk, you're a moron :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, I forgot Humans, but I never really see any on my server, and Gnomes/Erudites as well.  Only Sks I see really are DE, Troll, Ogre, and Iksar in that order.<br />
<br />
I think Humans are sorta worthless because they get no bonus other than faction...<br />
<br />
Iksars are good for regen/ac, ogres are good for meleeing.<br />
<br />
And Keevel, you're just a dumbass that needs to get laid *grin*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I know this is an old thread but I'm bored. /wave Brael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fallgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nah Marruk, I do wear those as items, but I will get an upgrade sometime *grin*<br />
Only thing is, my life isn't really devoted to Eq heh, but yeah, I am still proud wear my neck item, but my bracers and belt is alright with me, I still do excellent in tanking with the less hp most of you would probably have.<br />
<br />
- Well, that's me, but I think my gear is alright as it is for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still do excellent in tanking with the less hp most of you would probably have.<br />
<br />
You have high HP for your level.  However, and Brael has posted proof, AC has more of an impact on your ability to tank than HP.  Don't neglect either, but I'd like to suggest that you look at the possibility of making AC more of a priority.  Neck, Hero bracer and waist is where I'd suggest you start.<br />
<br />
I totally understand the pride factor of an item that might be lacking in some areas - I use the Jagged sword of the Dragon Slayer occasionally - but only where it's lack of damage doesn't hurt my group (in this case a very high DPS group would ba an opportunity).  If you are tanking, the lack of AC on your neck is hurting you every time.  Spend the 500pp - 1Kpp and get the dragorn neck-piece to switch in for when you are tanking<br />
<br />
Also, you're right, I can never get laid enough, but that has more to do with my sexual appitite rather than lack of current frequency - and I'm still crying.<br />
Actually, a lot of the OoW mobs are able to stun Ogres from the front, or so I'm told.<br />
Make a newb ogre, take him to unrest about 13 or 14 and fight the pumpklin head guys.  They'll stun you repeatedly - because their stun is a proc.  This has always been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need your life devoted to EQ to know how to play it.  Hell, my account is cancelled for WoW.  Honestly, you have a right to be proud of your neck item.  It is a good item, and takes effort to get.  Still, it's not good for tanking.  Same with the other crap items that have already been discussed.  <br />
<br />
If you aren't tanking, fine.  If you are tanking, then, in all honesty, your gear isn't alright as it is now.  It is sub-par.  Getting gear that would be alright replacements at your level barely costs any money, and is well worth the effort.  But this isn't anything that hasn't been said before repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, yeah, I should go for a better Wrist and waste at first, those hurt the most, but I haven't had much time to play Eq at all in the past two months nor have I enough cash atm *grin*<br />
probably sitting with 2k, will buy somethin with that though when I get on again, but yeah, neck item is what I'll upgrade later.<br />
<br />
Thanks for suggestions :P<br />
<br />
And Marruk, yeah, you're right, I still need to get more upgrades, and stuff.<br />
<br />
Well, I forgot to add Humans, but they really don't get a special ability except to be less KoS in some places.</div></div><hr />

Well, anyways, heh, GL to you all, I think that in the End Game, all races are good, but I always like the Dark Elf/Elves the best  :D .<br />
<br />
Not bad in size<br />
Dark Race<br />
Evil in Religion<br />
Etc<br />
<br />
What more could you want? :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah, so DEF are best IMO, but on my armor wise, I think that I do still need the upgrades, just for later heh.<br />

Last i checked all Shd's where 'Evil in Religion'. I always enjoyed trashing teir'dal in RPG arguments using the choice of following evil Vs. the expectation. Pointing out that they are less evil because of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Humans have the highest starting charisma of all the sks.  As Brael has clearly stated, were he to make an sk today, he'd put all the points into charisma, and he wasn't joking!<br />
<br />
Gnomes are small.  While one can get a bracer of the shadow hive or wand of imperceptibility for shrink, not having to deal with shrink is a decent gameplay benifit in it's own right.  Also, the shrunken gnome model is the model best used to corner a mob when you are tanking it.<br />
<br />
Iksar and Troll regen are identical.  Damn the xp penalty is breaking my balls though for being iksar.</div></div><hr />
