I 2 box a 57 shammy and a 59 sk and I am wondering if I could xp there? Also, if it is a viable hunting spot for me, how do I get there and where to set up camp. I am sick to death of 3 trees in PON, so really any xp suggestions would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I dont see it being practical at 59 to tank there with just your shaman and I dont think you could do named. Some of the one group named are still red at 70 although most aren't.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is just to go there for yourself and get into a full group with your sk and see about tanking a mob. This should give you some indication as to how difficult it may or may not be for your level of gear and AA.<br />
<br />
Then once you know how much healing you had to have with a full group present decide if your shaman could do it.<br />
<br />
On Test server I have yet to see anyone under 60 in that zone. But then again we consider it overcrowded with 28 in zone  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to the Ruined City of Dranik, off the bloodfields, with a group, and single pull the noc's right at the entrance called &quot;golem maintenence workers&quot; They hit about the same as WoS's South zone wall. It's just a much nicer, easier, safer camp. Use that to test whether you can tank in WoS.<br />
<br />
Then, when you are comfortable with that, try WoS. The mobs may be the same but you'll learn the word &quot;SHadowhunter&quot; fast.</div></div><hr />
