<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deljan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've been searching all over the internet, and have yet to find out how a non-iksar can do this quest, if you need the weapon that you start out with as an iksar that is no-drop, to do the ascending quests. i figured you could do the &quot;hammer of exoneration&quot; quest to get it, but someone told me that the hammer is not eqiuppable by other races. any help on how you can start this quest with a DE SK would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dinty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Once I had the apporpriate faction all did was get the pack from Gikzic and filled it with the sarnak heads. Started a brand new iksar sk, turned in the Khukri, camped and logged back in my main sk and turned in the bag to get my Knave's Khukri. Easy enough and you should have plenty of time to do the MQ even with one account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jackkal Darknite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That or get a friend to make an iksar SK.<br />
<br />
I found a lowbie iksar and gave him 100pp if he would do that. He was more than happy to do (all my friends &amp; guildies was busy at that time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deljan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks so much for the info, now all i need to do is slaughter explorers and collect tons of bone chips</div></div><hr />

Go out and get your faction.  If you look in this forum, you'll find a number of different suggestions on how to do it.  Choose your favorite.  Once you've got the faction, bring your DE to the top of the SK guild and hail the iksar standing behind the Arch Duke.  He'll give you some mumbo-jumbo about collecting sarnak heads - just follow the text and you'll get a bag.<br />
<br />
Go out into LOIO newbie area right near the city and kill every goblin you see.  Eventually, sarnak hatchlings will start to pop.  Kill them and loot four of the No Drop heads.  Put 'em in the bag, hit combine, and return to the iksar who gave you your bag.<br />
<br />
Sit him down there, camp out, and make a newbie Iksar SK.  You'll land right there.  Hand the note to the Arch Duke and you'll get back the first Khukri.  Turn around and hand it to the Iksar for the bag quest.  DO NOT HAIL ANYTHING.  Camp out back to your DE, and Hail the bag quest iksar.  Hand him the combine bag, and bingo, you'll have the first of the No Drop Khukri's to start that quest.<br />
<br />
If you go into the Dirty Deeds forum, you'll find there's a stickied post there which is all about this quest.  Look it over - you'll get more info than you'll ever need.<br />

I'll even save you the trouble of looking - here's the link.<br />
