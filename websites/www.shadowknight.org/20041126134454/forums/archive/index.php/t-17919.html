<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>angelless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">think skeli form is lowering my dps anyone check that out . no way to check for me but it seem  pact of hate i just don't swing or hit as much :( . check it out see if i'm just crazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about that but since they have upgraded it I find I hate fighting with it since all that bobbing up and down makes it hard for me to position properly so I try to get a kei if I can so I dont have to use it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>angelless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why o why can't they give us something cool like whats his names in pon  at 65th lvl we should have a aa to get deathknight for atleast  someway to set us apart form the necros in forms spells not like they don't have the models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, the bobbing on swings is EXTREMELY annoying.  Especially in high lag areas. <br />
<br />
As far as melee damage decreasing...  Tough to say for sure, but I tried it out with Shroud of Undeath, and it DID seem that I was hitting for less.  Would have to parse some logs to tell for sure though.</div></div><hr />
