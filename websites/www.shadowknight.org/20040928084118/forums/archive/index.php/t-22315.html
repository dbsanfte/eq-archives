<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spanky4458</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all I want to say that I have only played an sk up to 52 so none of these tanking issues really aply to me.  Although I do read these forums a bit, so I think that I have a decent grasp on the issues.  <br />
<br />
I read Braels thread about imunity for x-hits in order to close the gap to pally stuns and it sounds interesting.  I think it could work as a weapon proc that goes off every 15 mins or so.  <br />
<br />
This got me thinking of a possible way to close the gap with warriors without stepping on toes.  Im not sure if this is possible, but what about an aa or spell that makes knight immune from double attack.  I would think similar duration and recast as defensive.  If you figure that each round of combat has about 6 hits (quad + kick/bash + proc) then this would midigate 33%.  This would take care of what seems to be our biggest tanking problem, which is getting one rounded.  <br />
<br />
Unlike the X-hit imunity this wouldnt be effective against all mobs.  Devs could design certain mobs with higher kick/bash/proc dmg ratios to lower its effectivness, or even have a mob hit for double the damage with out double attack for mobs that they wouldnt want us using it at all.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it would wotk or not, but let me know what you think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's certainly an idea I haven't heard before.  I think it may be overpowered due to the simple fact that kick/bash does not do the same damage as a regular hit, and many mobs do not have any procs at all, but it's certainly a new way to reach the ~50% mitigation that warriors have.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sionya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this is an interestign idea, look like an evade disc too heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The idea was getting tossed around to make monks immune to Riposte a while back, and not only make them immune, but to give them automatic counter-riposte.<br />
<br />
1: Increase chance to evade Double Attack (100%)<br />
<br />
It would still be less powerful than Evasive, honestly.  Warriors have higher evasion in the first place, and Evasive makes their evasion even better.  Would be significantly more powerful on mobs with hardwired hit rates above normal, but still unlikely to be more powerful than Defensive/Stonewall.<br />
<br />
I like this.  I like this idea alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow someone is actually thinking around here???<br />
<br />
AND hes a newbie at that? give this guy a cookie..<br />
<br />
I could see how this could tie in with a shield. To make it passable in game lore - call it like &quot;Renewed Aversion&quot; and make it a disc, only useable with a shield - shield takes the 'rest' of the hits. OR else, instead of dodging/evading - mitigate the double attacks by 75%... we'd still get hit for a chunk, and the first strike would be for full damage, but each consequent strike would be for lower...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's getting unnecessarily complicated, imo.  The mitigation boost from a shield is a boost in and of itself.  Tying a defensive ability to it would mean a much greater sacrifice for a 2hander, which is our highest aggro output setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crimson Tears</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its original and inventive, worth some merit and looking into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It seems like a nice idea, but I really do not want to see mobs hitting for 6 to 9k dmg in a single hit..<br />
<br />
Breals idea is far better. (oh and if they want an encounter warrior only they can just code it to have 100% strike thru)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There already are mobs in the game hitting that hard in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">names and zones please.<br />
<br />
We are only in the early part of GoD. Still doing Ikkinz trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorren Y`Kelt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like this idea a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There already are mobs in the game hitting that hard in the game.<br />
<br />
Unless someone here says what mobs hit for 6k to 9k in dmg I calling this poster on his bullshit..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not in a single hit but I bet there are lots of mobs in god that do 6k in a single round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Feriin Cydovu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh I know there are mobs in GoD that can easily do 9k+ dmg in a single round. I was nearly killed by Guardian of Glorification I had nearly 10k buffed and got a feign off at about 100 hp left, all in a single round.<br />
<br />
I was asking if there is any mob that can do 6k to 9k dmg in a single hit though.. Rueeliar is full of bullshit IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The biggest single melee hit I have ever got I think was 3400 by one of those glorifiction bosses.<br />
<br />
That hurt and loading please wait was not far after</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe Xxeric in Tacvi can hit up to 5000 dmg / hit.<br />
I can't think of anything else hitting harder for now, but the following mobs in Tacvi may hit harder. Maybe the Tunat`Muram hits for 10K :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Taskmistress Krisz was hitting guildmates for as high as 7800ish, I believe, when she hit enrage mode. It's a special case and a mob that no one really kills anyways though, so it's not a very good example!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The adds in the Noq fight hit for that damage, before their proc.  Original CBQ hit for up to 9k.  Dozens of mobs around that hit for 4k-5k, some of which (Ixt in Txevu) which have the potential to hit 6-8 hits in a round (9 hits theoretical max).<br />
<br />
Before &quot;calling bullshit,&quot; maybe consider that I have better things to do than waste my time pretending I give a flying fuck what people think about me and toss out &quot;infoz&quot; for guilds who haven't made it there, yet as though this were the Safehouse and everyone and their dog already discusses them.</div></div><hr />
