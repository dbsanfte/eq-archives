<br />
Pull WITH a pet...put pet on guard duty back at camp....do your pull....run back to your pet and hit the &quot;pet back off&quot; untill the mobs are in sight of your pull location...let your pet attack the caster and then feign.<br />
<br />
Wait for the rest of the mobs to go home, then pick off the mob fighting your pet.  The rest of the mobs don't aggro the pet, as it's an npc.  Works best vs casters (assuming your resists are good), because melee mobs will mow through your pet.<br />

Enjoy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utanen</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This works as well. If you have several mobs around back off and pop a lvl 9 pet and send him at the target. Usually the mob kills the pet fast then comes for you all by himself withought his friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesnt always work on big stuff tho, cuz a lot of times your pet just wont survive the pull, but usually even if your pet dies it gives you the distance to pull that aggroed mob a second time and not piss off the first ones.<br />
<br />
i personally recommend picking a pulling location out of aggro range of your group (duh..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korra</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, sometimes the oldest techniques work the best. If you want to split a difficult room, (like BM in Velks) snare a mob, in BM camps case, one of the broodlings, or any of the 4, except the BM (resistant). After you snare the mob, pull all of the mobs out of the room, then Feign Death. After you FD, let all mobs return to the original spawn point, and have someone tag the snared mob, or if it's pulled back from the camp enough, just simply stand up, hit the mob, and pull it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maniacles</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never had a pet not get gangbanged before the pet nonaggro patch when I accidentally pulled with it up.  Was a nice surprise to see the extra mobs just walk on by the pet while it kept the attention of the casting mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airamwu</div><div class="date">09-19-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, if i pull with my pet in a crowded room the mobs will not assist him?  Does this work in most places or is there a certain way you have to do it ie. FD before the pet engages.<br />
<br />
I have never  used the pet during pulls before, only for extra dps.</div></div><hr />
