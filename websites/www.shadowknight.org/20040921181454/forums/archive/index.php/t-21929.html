<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaelyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if anyone will like this nor care but figured I'd post it anyway.  I had a friend paint a picture of my SK a few years ago and thought some of you might want to see it.  He's a pretty impressive artist, done a few book and gaming covers but he hasn't been able to live off that yet.  :(<br />
<br />
The setting was just something I dreamed up and not related to EQ.  Mainly I just wanted a picture of the first couple years of my EQ life.  lol.  Hence the Umbral, the black sword was just something I figured an SK should be wielding, kind of like the dark reaver.<br />
<br />
Anyway here it is.<br />

If you go to his site below you can enlarge a couple sections of the painting.<br />

Feel free to check his whole site out if you are bored.<br />

<br />
I'd bet $5 that the reason &quot;he&quot; is too skinny is because &quot;he&quot; is a &quot;she&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kuvak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yup I'd say so when looking at this (http://www.robkatkowski.com/DarkElf_1.jpg) pic. looks close to the old model dark elf female armors i'd say. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay then she's too flat...where's my double d de sk, j/k and no i just ment that the knight was too tall+skinny for my taste whether it was male or female.</div></div><hr />
