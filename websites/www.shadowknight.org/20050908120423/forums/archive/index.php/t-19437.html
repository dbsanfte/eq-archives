         Anyone know if there some sort of cycle for the Kly's.  Aside from the 2nd floor spawn/despawn time. Searched and someone had said something about leaving the crusader up. Had  65 shammy at 2nd floor, 49 sk at lab and  65 rogue at chapel killing ph constantly for about 16 hours total. Got the lab to pop finally after 3 consecutive 2nd floor spawns. Then went to the bazaar and saw Jagged for sale for 50pp :( I picked it up for spite. <br />
<br />
word out</div></div><hr />

1st Kly spawned after 3 cycles.<br />
Undead Blacksmith came up after about 4 or 5.<br />
2nd Kly still hasn't spawned but I've only dropped two PHs.<br />
3rd Kly spawned on the 2nd try.  :)<br />
<br />
Sitting in the church now....waiting patiently</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking that I just got lucky, but i got all 4 pieces in about an hour and a half game-time, solo.</div></div><hr />
