<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganodoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there fellow sks!! I was wondering but do you all think 400k for Holgresh Elder beads is worth it? Today I was auctioning for them to see if I could get a price check on Rodcet and someone told me a friend of his had them for sale for 400k. <br />
Getting 400k wouldn't be a problem I will say since I didn't have trouble gathering 100k for a Circlet of Shadow or 120k for Crown of Narandi. Just curious as well how much pp you guys had to dish out for the beads? <br />
<br />
Hope to have the Holgresh Elder Beads soon someday but hoping 400k isn't a ripoff even if you can only get them from the casino today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like a good price to me.<br />
I actualy wouldnt sell mine, not for 1Mpp, not for 10Mpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For rare items like this it is entirely dependant on what you are willing to pay.  Personally I wouldn't sell mine for a billion plat if I didn't have another set lined up already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tomic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">400k is pretty common price on beads on Rodcet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't sell my set, either.  My CoS is the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I want to transfer to Rodcet, I'd gladly pay 400k for those.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same as Ask and Mans, would never sell mine, use them nightly, and yes, 400k is a good price. Seen them sell for 600k and 800k on TT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Measles McMumps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dunno whats wrong with the other servers but on brell the run from 10k to 20k lol Brell &gt; ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">id sell it for 1 billion platinum because now 1 billion is just fucking silly you fucker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">id sell it for 1 billion platinum because now 1 billion is just fucking silly you fucker<br />
<br />
So is this statement.  At a certain point, plat is pretty worthless.  If you spend every waking hour twinking, you probably wouldn't be able to spend a billion plat.  If you're a raiding SK and already have all of your tools of the trade, and dont spend a huge chunk of your time twinking, plat has really no use for you.<br />
<br />
Holgresh beads are essentially priceless, especially on servers where the period of their natural dropping was very, very limited.  If they do indeed sell for 10-20k on Brell, you can expect to see me on a farming alt there very soon, but I doubt that they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">they don't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they are definitely worth it it's invuable to be able to lifetap/zef bite you pet makes downtime that much faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">they are definitely worth it it's invuable to be able to lifetap/zef bite you pet makes downtime that much faster<br />
<br />
It means less now with improved hp reg that came in with recent patch.  Just sitting for a while and bandaging WHILE sitting and medding simultanely surely reduce downtime pretty good and you would be FOM and FOH in few minutes. Lifetapping health back only reduce mana and you would have to med up.<br />
<br />
Holgesh was more valuable before the hp reg/ bandaging while sitting changes came in effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">True while soloing, but zevfeering an eye is still very good for the group.   Not to mention scouting and other fun stuff you can do with eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That may be true; I suspect having elder beads is like not having pet hold aa or aa horse or cos: you have no idea how good it is until you have it.<br />
<br />
That said, for a while I did used to carry around gnome tinkered somethings that had charges of the eyes and the main reason to use that to reduce downtime was for the benefit of other group members by casting ZB on it (more so than for my own health/mana).<br />
<br />
Usually on a complete wipe/recovery I get to FM faster than the rest of my group members, by virtue of having less mana... so if I can use a bit of mine to speed up the rest of the group, I should.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine shelling out 400k+ for something that doesn't give me more hp or ac etc but then again, possibly because I have never had one, I don't recognize it's value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">True while soloing, but zevfeering an eye is still very good for the group.   Not to mention scouting and other fun stuff you can do with eyes.<br />
<br />
Aye, that's why I still want bead for damn scouting in advance. Useful for puller and zev biting eye for group sure is nice to have as well to speed things up but 400k? Ouch. ;) I think COS is more valuable to me over bead eye and it costs less (I did pay for one for 500pp before the nerf) but now its about just 120k ish on my server while bead is 500k. That is out of wrack all cuz eye is usuable by ANY classes while COS is only for necros and SKs, hence, demand is much higher on eye over COS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aura of darkness, aura of pain, zevfeers bite in a can is worth 400k, not to mention scouting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After every death in a gorup, the cleric has to perform rezes and all buffing classes have to do their thing.  That leaves the entire group low on mana.<br />
<br />
As a SK, I have very little buffing to do during this time, I mostly just sit there bored, watching the timer click down on my LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
I use the eyes to ZB my group every single time ZB pops.  From experience, I can say that my group recovers from deaths 2-3 times faster if I'm ZBing as fast as possible.  That's huge, especially in timed events, or when you're worried about staying ahead of re-pop.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a &quot;casual&quot; player; I play a lot but I can only put in 2-3 hours per session at most.  Every time I log on and form a group, I sit around for the first 20 minutes of my playtime waiting for all the buffs to get cast.  ZB on the eyes speeds this up too.<br />
<br />
IMO, finding a way to get eyes (beads, gnome clicky, having a wizard/mage in group) to tap is the biggest single utility upgrade a SK can get.</div></div><hr />

Also, there are likely a good deal more CoS than there are beads on most servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zenlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Xegony's average prices on beads are generally 350-500k when there are any for sale. <br />
<br />
imo they are a situational tool; quick hp regen, zbite after a wipe, as well as scouting. They won't necisarily be used everyday but there will be days you'll pop the eyes constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I paid 500 for mine and never looked back.  There are few items that are actually worth prices like that, and this is one.</div></div><hr />

Until the resist checks on AoP and AoD are fixed (yes, its broken when spells that are supposed to help balance the class never land), using them on eyes is a good option.</div></div><hr />

Wouldnt sell mine ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Iohotep-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just got Holgresh Elder Beads about a week ago. Paid 102k for them on CT server. Person who won them gave me a pretty good price and I bought them. Don't think either of us realized they were worth so much. Must say I wouldn't sell 'my preciousssss' for any price. The ability to scout alone makes it worth it in my opinion, but the added benefits as stated above 'aura of darkness, aura of pain, zev bite in a can' makes it priceless. I consider myself fortunate to have them. If they cost 400k on your server, though expensive (but not overpriced), it is most definetly worth it. Definetly rank up there with CoS as one of my best investments ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. F people who keep killin the eye while I'm scouting.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">They go for 400k to 500k on Vallon Zek.  Any time I find them below 400k, I buy them and then quickly and easily resell them for 400k+.  Meaning 400k is a fair price.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tropics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My server is nuts, Prenerfs sell for 300k and up, you will never see one cheaper and seeing them in the 400 range is common. Holgresh beads? Basically never seen them for sale. Do they still drop? I thought they nerfed/removed them but one post above seemed to imply they stil drop? Would love to get some but they go higher then a Pre-nerf on Vazaelle so look to 600kpp and up to even sniff a chance at getting them. 400kpp if you can afford it, yeah do it man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're relying on stalking probes, you're reluctant to just pop an eye and you only use them when you &quot;need&quot; them - when you have HEB's, you can pop out an eye whenever you need it without giving it second thought.  That alone makes it worth the extra money, let alone the convenience factor.</div></div><hr />

Kharan is probably talking about me, lol. He bought the beads outright, and I fucked around with the casino, thinking it couldn't run up to costing 350K...I got halfway there probably before saying fuck it.</div></div><hr />
