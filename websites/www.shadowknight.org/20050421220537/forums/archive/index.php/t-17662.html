<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>IsawaKumo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got my Greenmist, and I thought it proper to pass along some information I had to either dig quite deep for or find out by surprise.<br />
<br />
- The Glowing Cliff Golem is on Venril Sathir faction. Killing it knocked everyone in our (all Dark Elf) group down a full level of faction, ie Amiable to Indifferent.<br />
<br />
- Kaesora - The Spectral (ghostly looking) Mobs near the library are the only ones that hit Venril Sathir faction. Killing 3 of them in the course of looking for the Failed Crypt Raider dropped my faction from Indifferent to Apprehensive.  Killing the skeletal Mobs and the Raveners has no effect on faction.<br />
<br />
- The Mirror Of Lost Souls is NOT reusable. Have Quill, Parchment, and the Shattered Blade Of Rile on you when you use the Mirror.<br />
<br />
- All the relevant Mobs previously in Droga have been relocated to the Bunyari caves in the SW area of Frontier Mountains.  Download a cartography map, you can miss it.  Once inside the caves, keep going down and to the right. All the Penkeepers, Penmasters, and the Enslaved Iksar (Argest) spawn in that cave.<br />
<br />
- Travelling through Droga to the 'pottery wheel' requires Invisibility, Shrink, and Levitation.  No mobs between the entrance and the 'pottery wheel' see through Invisibility, not even the spiders.<br />
<br />
- Faction- Kill explorers in Lake Of Ill Omen, yellow tower NE of the lake.  Once you have approximately 3 stacks of Explorer Survival Knives, travel NE to the line of pillars and con Trooper Vaurk from afar.  Bone chips for residents can easily be obtained in Kurn's while looking for the Glowing Skull. A good spot for Brood of Kotiz is the Field of Bone. A cave in the NW shore holds 10 at a time, and in between killing everything in the pit area nets not only Iksar, but large amounts of Spider Silk!<br />
<br />
-Patience - You will hate Dalnir more then any other zone by the time you are done, as well as Kaesora. Drag a high level friend down into Kaesora to kill Spectrals, as their spawns seem to alternate somewhat with the Skeletals.  <br />
<br />
You will prevail, just don't give up!<br />
<br />
56 Dark Elf SK - Amiable with most of Cabilis, though I raise a few eybrows :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mirror can be used twice.  After you use it the first time it becomes the Cracked Mirror.  However after the first use you will get the pattern if you turn in the three items.</div></div><hr />
