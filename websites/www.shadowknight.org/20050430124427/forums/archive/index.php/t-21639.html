I just hit lvl 40 with my cleric.<br />
Was wondering where I can 3box at these levels, where <br />
the SHM and CLR would get good experience to close the gap between them and the SK, eventually allowing me to 3box LDONs :)<br />
<br />
please , any advice wud ROK ty</div></div><hr />

<br />
After you get your Sebilis key, hunt the zone in of Sebilis and work your way around to zoneout and stay there for as long as your sanity holds out.</div></div><hr />

HELLLO, <br />
I just barebacked my 40th male whore with my cock wrapped in a sock. Was wondering where I can 3box 3 seperate men at the same time to get good experience in the round about felching style to close the gap between my gaping anus hole, eventually allowing me to 3box freely :)<br />
<br />
please , any advice wud ROK ty  <br />
<br />
Ahh, I like that better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">like i said.... goto the hole..</div></div><hr />

like i said.... goto the hole..  <br />
<br />
That would rock but it's too bad &quot;goto&quot; is an old mud command for Immortals. Would definately make travel in Norath easier though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dulak's<br />
<br />
It's a &quot;hotzone&quot; now.  I'm PL'ing an ogre BL, and he's rippin' in this place (31-36 in about 5 hrs) with about 3-4%/kill.  Get a boat if you can (first two should be no problem to handle).  XP similar to Paludal, decent plat drops, and an occasional gem (got 3 BD's, 1 Sapphire, 1 Fire Opal, Opal bracelet, and mithril amulet yesterday)  That's not bad for a 40-45 zone.  <br />
<br />
Mobs will mostly be white to red for your lesser toons.  SK will keep aggro.  Invis works through most of the zone, except maybe the luggald caves.  Get the Shaman his Stoicism spell while you're there (off drunken pirates).  Cleric's may be there to for lvl 44 (duh, temperance - Deepwater emblem drops off any of the boats).<br />
<br />
SK will still get xp there (although many will be lt blue).<br />
<br />
There ya go.</div></div><hr />

You like what better? That quote was the gayest fucking shit I've ever seen in a long time, even if I only read the first 5 words. Lol.<br />
I don't think I could ever write such a thing. But atleast we know that you can, faggot.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I could ever give up such a thing. But atleast we know that I'm a faggot. <br />
<br />
Sticky please</div></div><hr />
