<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a time, back before Luclin when resistances really mattered. You could and would swap out AC and HP gear for resist gear when fighting Vox/Naggy, Trakanon, ST Warder's, etc. However as the resistance value on standard gear has grown, and the resistance value on &quot;resist gear&quot; has stayed the same, this is no longer really possible. You are no longer forced to make a choice, your best resist gear is also your best HP and AC gear. I'm not exactly pleased with this change.<br />
<br />
Under the current spell syetm, unless you can climb at least 200 points above the resist modifier for a spell, it's pretty much going to hit you. Even at 200 points above you're still going to get tagged a fair amount. For example Gelaqua's Embrace (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5760&amp;source=Live) this spell has a -400 Cold Resistance on it and the NPC that casts it fires it off once every 10 seconds or so. Why is this resistable at all? So that we may have the false hope of resisting?<br />
<br />
What is the current cap on resistance with all PG trials and AA done? 5xx? Does it even reach 600? Even with max resists (which not many have) the above spell is going to hit you frequently. Why bother putting a resist value on it at all? Worse still are the dots that cast every 12 seconds and last for 24 with -400 or -350 resist on them. Even asuming you resist half the time you're still going to be dotted for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
What they need to do is either just own up, make these spells unresistable, eleminating the farcical notion that resists matter. Either that or start keeping the minuses and refresh rates at a reasonable level and create some new resist gear to fill the current void.<br />
<br />
How about an AE with -300 CR, 1:30 duration, 1:00 recat, -99 curse counters. Reduce the frequency of testing so that failures are not entirely assured. The 99 curse counters makes it nearly incureable, and 300 is reasonably resistable with current caps, get to 500+ and you're going to be mostly ok. Then create some gear with 50/hp mana, sub standard AC and stats, but like 75 CR and make it level 70 required.<br />
<br />
Since they have &quot;charms&quot; now you could even make something like a &quot;snow suit&quot; that confers reasonable, but lower than normal raid quality gear stats, but confers 300 CR as long as you are wearing every piece.<br />
<br />
As it stands resists don't matter very much if at all. Either remove em all together and stop toying with us or make the system meaningful again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't matter?<br />
<br />
You must be playing an entirely different game then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I stoped playing like 6 month ago and resistances didnt matter back then, what changed Puurrdy?<br />
<br />
I had just about all 5 of my resistances maxed regardless of the encounter. Get buffed, get in song range and wee, 500 to all. How does resists matter in such environment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh.  I was just thinking about this a couple days ago, too.<br />
<br />
Resists didnt really mean squat when EQ was new except for PvP and vox/naggy.  Then SoV came out and it mattered alot more for ToV (that's the only &quot;real&quot; place I remember resists being a focus of aside from single encounters.)<br />
<br />
I think one of the problems is all the gear from VT on seems to have 10 to 25 resists on 3 or more different resists.  There are not many items are are +50 to a particular resist and then weak on other resists/stats.  To me, that's what made resist gear...i.e. gnomish tunic, froglock crown, polar bear cloak.<br />
<br />
It's gonna be hard for them to do that now with so much of the game itemized already and being able to hit resist caps with normal gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Resists became pointless after SoV, everything worth resisting was unresistable or had a -300/400/500 mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xiel_Lostsoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I call BS...<br />
<br />
strip all your buffs off and dont use bard songs, then tell me if the encounter was any different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ndayael Darkomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">new resist cap is 600 , and yes it does matter when u get a neg 350 400 check and resist  6k ae.<br />
<br />
so they not pointless<br />
<br />
And bout gelaqua embrace , dunno if you did fight that mob,  if u get that ae you did something wrong .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Resists seem to matter to me, theres a ton of encounters where 600 in a resist really helps, espically against -350 to -400 check spells.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't be getting hit with Gelaquas Embrace at all though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh I understand that, but why put a resist check on it? If you screwed up, just make it AE DT, same difference really.<br />
<br />
I am complaining about other similar effects that fire off multiple times a minute at stupidly high resist modifiers. If they test you often enough, with a -400 you're simply going to fail alot even at 600, so what's the difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, to one of the popsters above. That's just it, alot of these encounters, people fail so often, even at max that you could do em without buffs, without songs, and it wouldn't matter. HP gear &gt; resist gear currently. Heal it, cure it, don't bother resisting it, waste of buff slots.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me how these two statements are not contradictory<br />
<br />
Seems to me if you believe that the HP gear is that much more important and are not maxing you resists, you think the buffs are a waste of a slot and you are relying on cures rather than resisting then you have little right to complain about “stupidly high resist modifiers”.<br />
<br />
If it’s always better to avoid the hit than have to heal it, why is that different with AE’s (meaning avoiding them doing damage rather than healing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe Keevel you missed the point by over a mile  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You do specialization ever Leafweir?  Espically recently?  Do that then tell me resists don't matter, I've watched people do that raid without needing a single heal thanks to resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Done that one, and I suppose in that one instance they matter. Problem is I can't actively do anything to make my resists better other than raid and hope for better gear. If I wanted to trade off my hp and AC for better resists, I couldn't really. Get a buff, get a song, pray it's high enough. =P That used to be different, whcih was the initial argument. I used to have a bag of gear for Trak, Hoshkar, Vox, Nag, etc and they all mattered. <br />
<br />
I lost some hp/ac in the process but I was able to change my focus to better suit the event. I suppose I could sorta do something similar with augs, but swapping them around is expensive. They need mebbe a new JC metal that takes the old gems and steps them up alot. like Resistium Diamond Wedding Ring +40 to all or something. =P Most people seem to be disagreeing with me though, so maybe I'm missing something here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gonna have to disagree with you there.  I think resists are still very important.  People don't switch to resist gear anymore because it's not unusual that regular raid gear now has excellent resist modifers on them already.  Similarly, I don't want to go back to the days of gear specialization.  With all the weapons, coffins, shards, food, drink, ect that I'm carrying I don't really want to be carrying anything else around :p<br />
<br />
There's a huge difference between doing AE encounters with with full resist (600) and without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Deris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your all arguing 2 different things.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Resists DO matter - but not NEARLY in the sense that they should.<br />
<br />
When is the last time you switched out ANY gear for resist gear Brael? Oh thats right - you don't, a bard plays a faggot song, and everyone is at max resists with a few buffs. That to me is not resists, thats stupid. Whatever happened to gear switching? The only gear switching that takes place with 99% of all toons now is probably 1h/shield and 2h :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Weapons are your new 'resist gear', if you long to swap out gear based on a need for a particular situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">People have to carry so much these days it's a good thing that you don't have to carry around suits of resist gear.  Check out my magelo, check the inventory... a good 95% of all items in it are used regularly.  People these days simply don't have the inventory room to carry extra resist gear around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There are quite a few raid encounters out there that will own someone with sub par equipment resist wise.  Bascially they are a liability that needs dedicated healing.  There is some one and two group stuff that you cant do with sucky resists.  Being able to max your resists with just bard song frees up 1 to 3 buff slots, which is nothing to snub your nose at especially for sks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">20 buff slots is a good thing to have.  Also, not everybody gets a Bard in their group so good resists do still matter it's not like theres an AE Psalm to mess up those chromatic -350 ae's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Leafweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">95% of those are used regularly Brael? I spotted quite a few things that were simply toys or had redundant effects. btw, damn you and your ring of the dead and your BFG. Not that the ring means as much as it used to... but the BFG... WTB Plank of Wood =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I never thought the ability to organize your bags and have one bag, sometimes two, full of gear used for one or two fights was anything of skill or difficulty.  It was rather annoying more than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being able to change gear while we prep for a big fight is not really a skill, its an annoyance, nothing more.  One I was happy to leave with SoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I guess this coming frommy lowbie ass has lieetle weight, but teh way I see it is it's another form od damage avoidance...no matter how out of whack it is (mob dps has gotten out of whack on that note too, so really the spells just came in line with that).<br />
<br />
Ignoring resists altogether is a good way to take unecessary damage, and there's nothing right about that.  In ToV it was crucial since the spells were far stronger than the mob's actualy melee damage.  Still with some of the DoTs and DDs I've seen, it's a pretty good idea to at least have some level of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think the point that is important to note is that there is too steep of a curve on resists.  It seems as that its an all or nothing kind of thing.<br />
<br />
You can get to 500 or 600 on a raid.  Then, depending on the AE, you'll either resist all, or resist not enough to matter, since the recast is so quick.  That leads to healing strategies that results in chain MGB heals.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see a flatter resist resist curve that still allowed resists to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Problem is I can't actively do anything to make my resists better other than raid and hope for better gear.  <br />
<br />
Well that's not entirely the case. You can do AA's to give you a bump in all of the resists. Also if you hit the cap rading you can do single group trials and AA's to increase your cap.<br />
<br />
In my personal experience they do matter. Good resists mean the difference in getting charmed or not charmed for some single group encounters. There are also some encounters where you get debuffed then cast on, so exceeding the stated cap can be helpful.<br />
<br />
And thank god we don't have to swap out for resist gear any longer.</div></div><hr />

OK, that brings up a different question then.  Would it be better to equip the fungi, sit down, and click off lich during the downtime than to stand still while clicking the Noct BP over and over again?  I'm going to have to do some math on this one, I think.</div></div><hr />

Better to tap/bite eyes for regen, which is what makes the sitting regen change irrelevent for us.</div></div><hr />

with ToTC now, one of the fastest ways to regen is equip your slowest weapon, use HEBs and attack your eye. if you're a big race, a weighted axe should give you a proc every other swing.</div></div><hr />

Especially with the Mastery of Farm trial boosted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">That adds to the amount of resists you need.  That trials great with the increase.</div></div><hr />

I love it.  However, there are no new ways to raise your resists that haven't been there since PoP.  So, either you're trying to resist with the margin between the AE adjustment and your cap, or you are striving to get 800+ in the number after the debuff is factored in.</div></div><hr />
