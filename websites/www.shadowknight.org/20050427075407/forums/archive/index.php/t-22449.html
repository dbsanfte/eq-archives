<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's my thoughts.  A level 68 pet makes sense because the types of mobs we'll be fighting at level 69 are such that anything else and the pet will always be one-rounded.  And at 68, the pet will have a chance to land spells, hit, etc, vs the mobs we fight.  Makes sense to me.  I'm looking forward to a level 68 pet.<br />
<br />
And if they give the pet some kind of stun proc... and it lands... then our pet is the answer to pally stuns and it balances out the class with pallys.  And at 68, the pet could land the stun proc....<br />

However, in looking at the Necro pet spells (the existing ones), their Spec pets still say SKEL_PET_xx... so I doubt it's a spec model either (which is good, I play with sound on and I hate the moaning).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, as soon as you explain to me what group is going to wait for you to cast the pet and then buff it up in the situations where you need that lower level pet to pull. /shrug.<br />
<br />
No shit you can cast the lower level pet, just like every other pet class can do right now. But why don't they? Because it's inconvenient. <br />
<br />
We should not need to be inconvenienced to maintain our pet pulling advantage, because if there is inconvenience involved. A level 49 mage earth pet with /pet hold nocast, will out pull our pet any day of the week, simply based on hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Very good points Rhumba.  However, my group does wait for me to bring up a lower pet tho' *if* it's THAT important.  ;)  However, we usually don't buff it except for Sow/Shrew and we do use Bestow Divine Aura on it.<br />
<br />
Even though other pet classes might be present, it's usually preferred that the sk or nec pet pulls because (I know opinions differ on this part) I FD before I send the pet in and don't stand until pet has returned to my side.  I usually creep up to where I think is the edge of aggro range and flop before the pull with the pet held beforehand.  That way if I got too close I can flop and back up and try again.  Most other pet classes won't have that option -- except to die or train the group.</div></div><hr />

If you have a monk and an SK lfg and you need a puller. Who are you goint to pick, if you know you will have to wait for a SK to get the right pet up to pull a tight situation. /shrug<br />
<br />
 FD before I send the pet in and don't stand until pet has returned to my side.<br />
<br />
I used to do this alot, but I've found it much easier to get the mobs off my pet quickly if I do not FD, also I've never had an issue with others aggroing on my pet, as long as I cast on the mob as soon as he is out of range of other mobs.<br />
<br />
and we do use Bestow Divine Aura on it.<br />
<br />
Oooh :) I'm going to have to play with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why are you so worried about pet pulling?<br />
<br />
If you're in GoD, your pet will most likely get smoked.<br />
Hard LDoNs? Besides a handful of Guk rooms with lots of casters in them, I've never needed to pet pull, and again, there is the pet eating it factor ( pet gets stunned = pet gets owned ).<br />
EPs? I have never pet pulled anything there...not even sure what you would.<br />
 <br />
The only places I have used pet pulls in are certain named mobs ( hey, even if the pet has an 80% chance of dying, its sometimes worth a shot vs clearing the room ) or old content, like Hate to clear PHs. Not to say pet pulling isn't nice; its just not that damned important. I have never been turned away from a group or been included in a group bc I could / couldn't pet pull, nor have I ever had anyone pat my ass on the back for being 'a good puller' bc of my pet pulling skills...<br />
<br />
As for the FD thing, its simple...if your pet dies after aggroing the mob, you get all the aggro. If you are FD'd, you're clean, but you can always FD after he eats it to save the group of a train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Apologies for contributing turning this into a pet pulling thing.<br />
<br />
I use my pets all the time in GoD (trials 1 - 6, not beyond) right up until the time it's time to invis past mobs... and thanks to not having suspend minion, I don't bother to bring a pet back up for the remainder of the trial/exp.  But, if I use a pet to pet pull, he's BDA'd and so doesn't die, and under other circumstances doesn't get smoked unless it's a wipe anyways.  Rather than clearing a packed room (i.e. Chavoor room, Ukun room, etc.), I just use the pet to pull and save time clearing... especially if we're in a Vxed expedition and 3 named pop and we only have an hour or so left to play before peeps have to log.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a single add yet in the last six weeks or so, doing this 6 nights a week.  Hard LDoN's with lots of casters: I have tried pet pulling there and yes the pet gets smoked but we hadn't thought of, nor did any of our clerics have BDA at that time (BDA prevents pets being stunned, btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">fair enough, but two issues I have with that...<br />
1) where do you need to pet pull in trials besides the nameds areas?<br />
2) BDA has a 2 hour 24 minute reuse time...<br />
<br />
So, it can't be a staple for every pull that you use BDA, which means he's gonna get smoked on trash, if you use him all the time, and many places its pointless to use him bc its easy enough to get a single. So the point we are back down to is only a situational usage. I'd rather not have a new gimp pet for a few situational times when I can just stop and pop a lower level pet out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">which means he's gonna get smoked on trash<br />
<br />
Where are you referring to? I do hard LDoN's, GoD through trial 4, and BoT and Tactics rarely, and the pet if buffed has no problems pulling there &quot;if he is buffed&quot;. If he is not buffed, ya he'll get smoked fairly often. I routinely can pull Hard Ldon, non casters with him, and maybe 1 in 2 hard ldon's will he die. And no matter how you slice it, pet pulling is much faster than fd pulling, unless your pet dies alot, which he will if we don't get him buffed appropriately.<br />
<br />
So can we FD pull? Yep, but we'll have much more problems with casters, not to mention we'll die more due to our less efficient FD. Pet pulling is the best option we have at this point in time, and I'll say it again. It's one of the few things that truly makes us unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're saying the pet does not have to be a certain level in relation to the mobs? I guess thats always been my impression, not that he needs to be green, he just has to be a certain level below the mobs you are pulling.<br />
<br />
I guess a couple on the front page mention the word green, so nm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Pet gets stunned in GoD or hard LDoN ( only places in the discussion where we both seem to have tried him ) and he's dead. Fully buffed or not, most of the time he dies. Pet pulling is not always faster either, least definitely not for me - depends on the situation, but if you do it right, you can FD pull faster in a lot of circumstances...key is doing it right. Furthermore, we are not unique in the ability...necros, even other pet classes can do the same, with the appropriate pet. Only difference is only the necro can also FD if shit hits the fan. Again, its a weak argument to want a new low level pet for its pulling aspect; that's just gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">the pet does need to be within a certain level in relation to the mob(s) to avoid mob assisting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simply not the case in my experience. But to each their own. <br />
<br />
 Pet pulling is not always faster either, least definitely not for me - depends on the situation, but if you do it right, you can FD pull faster in a lot of circumstances...key is doing it right. <br />
<br />
If you have to FD at all, I'm not sure how it can be faster... Anytime you FD their is a bit of time involved for mobs to reset, with pet pulling, that time simply does not exist. So simply because you don't use it, is no reason to say it's &quot;weak argument&quot; just because you have not learned to use it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Xanathol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Definitely to each his own, but in my experience, by the time the pets gets to me, give it the command to attack, it runs its sorryass down to the mob and makes a move on it, I would have already plucked it, FD'd, and had a reset in action ( saying the mobs are playing nicely ) and if I am not tanking, chain pulling with FD splits is lightyears faster. You want to pet pull, fine, do it - you already have a pet to do it with; the SK class doesn't need another pet that's gimp for anything but pulling to facilitate those that cannot pulloff something as simple as FD splitting in a timely manner...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think no one is disagreeing really, pet pulling is another tool for us to use, just like FD is.  I'd guess that (forgive me if I'm wrong, no disrespect intended) Rhumba may have momentarily forgotten we can use a lower pet for pulling if need be -- but even if she meant it'd be a pain to 'swap' pets for pet pulling and dps, I think with us getting suspend minion it won't quite be so bad (although yes, I realize that it doesn't eliminate the need to keep re-making that low pet for pulling).  So I see Rhumba's point now about pet level.<br />
<br />
Also, Xanathol you are correct, I don't use the pet to pull all mobs, just nameds in crowded rooms (especially with un-Pac'able mobs around).  A rogue/chanter 2-box team usually does the group's pulling.  And because I'm gimpy enough to need 2 clerics in GoD, we have 2 shots at BDA/pet pulling.  ;)</div></div><hr />

That would be why I can and have pulled any raid in any zone in the game with a Mage pet right?  The low level thing is simply a rumor thats been going around for a long long time.</div></div><hr />

move to the lower area and you don't.<br />
<br />
alternatively, try pet pulling a named mob in an ldon that has its own pet. your pet will get adds.<br />
<br />
alternatively, do the caller quest in FG. when one of the shaman named fiends summons a pet, you cannot single pet pull it with invoke death. malignant death (lvl 52 spell, lvl 33 pet) can single them from a crowd of fiends though.<br />

A couple days ago in seb I was soloing at the Myconid Spore King camp. I had the invoke death pet and managed to spawn 2 warrior guards in the king camp. I tried to pet pull but got both warriors on the pet. I switched to our 58 pet and bingo, one of the warriors came alone.<br />
<br />
It could just be that some mobs behave differently in regards to pet pulling. Perhaps some mobs in some zones cannot be pet pulled with our 64 pet, yet in others can be pet pulled with our 64 pet and are the same lvl range.<br />
<br />
As far as pet pulling goes, the only time I really use it is when I am soloing. I find it very useful to pull minis in hate solo and pulling the spore king camp in seb with our pet. Granted it can have its uses in groups but I mainly find it a bother to ask the group to buff goner and heal him while pet pulling.<br />

I've not tested it extensively enough to claim to know the specifics, but for evidence that, at least situationally, relative level plays at least some role, go to the PoJ jail.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for all the &quot;I don't want a gimp pet just for pet pulling&quot; shit... your pets level and it's power aren't necessarily connected.  You could have a level 68 pet with 200hp that singles for 10 at a delay of 50, or you could have a level 45 pet with 10k hp that quads for 150 with a delay of 1.5.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I could throw in some examples from Karnor's Castle. My pet always brings a gaggle with him if I try to pet pull there, especially around VS.<br />
<br />
Not to mention we have a mage who's tried to pet pull before in LDoN's with his normal pet and he gets adds... Maybe your mage is not getting adds because the mobs you are trying to pull out of are all much higher level? I could still see mages with their top pets right now being able to pull the top spots in the game, because all the mobs are high enough level.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Just fucking around bored one night I tried pet pulling freeport gate guards (light blue/green at 65).  I got the light blue guard split from his other lblue buddy, but several green con guards assisted.  It's not a rumor if you've seen it happen.<br />
<br />
It may not be the case globally, but in many cases pet pulling won't work unless the pet is much much below the mobs level.  Maybe it's an old world or at least pre-velious thing?<br />
<br />
And pet pulling doesn't in any way make us unique.  I've watched shaman pet pull.  Most anyone with a pet can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">So Brael, the easiest way to say pull the Rathe Council is to simply have a Mage go up there and solo pull each one with a pet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So A) It's relative to pet lvl or B) SKs have a unique ability to single pull with pets.  Honestly, I never had someone pull out a lower lvl pet to test this with so I don't know.<br />
<br />
In Braels case, it's possible the raid mobs he's pulling are so high lvl that a Mage pet would indeed be green.</div></div><hr />

PoI, Monster Summoning 4 works, Tactics it works (so is the shaman pet btw), Uqua MS4 works, etc... I think PoI and Uqua are a pretty big difference in mob level to prove my point.<br />
<br />
DConquest, I've watched lots of people try to do it, the shaman pet I mentioend above I watched a Shaman try pulling boars from a stack of about 500 one time when Glykus got bugged, he tried 10 times and died every time.  He gets fed up and says he can't do it, I log him on and do it (btw our pet wouldn't con green to those mobs).

1 - As I am leveling up this SK, I help a friend get her Ranger Epic by killing Black Reavers in CoM (pre-Revamp).  I watched a mage sick a pet on a Reaver and Solo Pull him from where he was to the Mage.  Mage was 65.<br />
<br />
2 - I was going to Chardok B and some necro had an Epic Mob at the Herbalist that he wanted pulled.  I summon pet (green to me, unknown to them probably blue), FD, send in the pet, and the entire house aggros on it.<br />
<br />
That was why I asked have you used it on the Rathe Council.  I am wondering if there is a faction difference making this different (mobs on the same faction aggro - those on other factions ignore the pet unless its green).<br />
<br />
We spend a lot of time pulling and snaring the Rathe Council in an elaborate process.  If they can be solo pulled using a mage pet or a necro pet, the encounter got a LOT simpler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I logged on my beastlord and decided to check this out... dont have pet hold yet but if i could pet pull with lvl 64 pet that would be the next aa i get next anyways my findings...<br />
<br />
First attempt: HoH armor lvl 62 (guess) pet pulled with lvl 64 bst pet pet lvl 61 (with DPOC focus)... results failed.<br />
<br />
2nd attempt: &quot;same as first...&quot; results failed.<br />
<br />
3rd attempt: In PoS i attempt to pull one of askarr's people with 64 pet... failed.<br />
<br />
4th attempt: In HoH armor 62 pet pulled with lvl 54 bst pet pet lvl 41... results success.<br />
<br />
5th attempt: In HoH armor 62 pet pulled with lvl 58 bst pet pet lvl 45... results sucess.<br />
<br />
6th attempt: In HoH armor 62 pet pulled with lvl 60 bst pet pet lvl 47... results sucess.<br />
<br />
7th attempt: In HoH armor 62 pet pulled with lvl 62 bst pet pet lvl 61 (dpoc focus)... results failed.<br />
<br />
So anyways at 65 the lvl 60 bst pet cons lightblue and is actually lvl 47... so the question is does the pet need to be lightblue in order to pet pull or something?<br />
<br />
If i try doing hard ldons or something without a good puller and my pet aint cutting it then using the lvl 60 bst pet for pulling might be worth it... <br />
<br />
Level 60(DPoC) 47 3500? 70 Bite / 27 Bash? High Regen <br />
Level 64(DPOC) 61 4600 79 Bite / 29 Bash Enrage, High regen <br />
<br />
DPS loss would probably be worth the ease in pulling...</div></div><hr />

Siilvir, Suspend Minion doesn't help us use two different pets, you can't switch back and forth, it doesn't work that way.  You would have to kill your low level pet every time in order to get the higher level pet out of suspend.  This would be time consuming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I group with a 65 Mage with MS VI, we were discussing this last night. He said that he never is able to just pull one mob out, and he pet pulls alot since he duo's with a shaman lots. He said that he always gets 2 if the mobs are in splittable range.<br />
<br />
Either way we are going to be playing around with this more. It would obviously be great if it worked. I won't have a chance to do anything till Thursday night though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand how it works, and I did not mean that we could switch back and forth.<br />
<br />
The idea is that you can use your high level pet for dps, have your low level pet suspended for that hard pull. Alternately if you are pulling a raid, you can have your higher level pet suspended, and use lower level for pulling, or better yet have two low levels ready during down time for more speed in pet pulling. The fact that one has to die is not an issue as pets die in the zones I pull most of the time anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So why would we want a pet that can't pull any longer? Will he push less so that he can be used more often on raids? Will he do enough DPS to be a valid pet to have out on raids to avoid pet push? My guess is no, so then why would we want to get a pet that also cannot be used to pull. I don't understand why some SK's are wanting to gimp us.</div></div><hr />

Bc...<br />
 (1) the pet will never have a chance of being 'meaningful' on raids ( we are not beastlords ); it mainly adds to group scenarios.<br />
 (2) you have a pet you can pet pull with already...<br />
 (3) if you cannot pull without a pet, you already *are* gimp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">(3) if you cannot pull without a pet, you already *are* gimp<br />
<br />
Let's get this straight.<br />
<br />
So your saying that because you cannot figure out how to pet pull in harder content (see your previous posts), I am gimp? Just because you cannot figure out how to use a tool you have in your arsenal does not mean that anyone that uses that tool is gimp. You said that fd pulling is more efficient, even though you admitted your pet always dies. Mine doesn't. So I'm gimp? Or you just can't time it correctly to use it?<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason why we cannot have a tough pet that can still pet pull in most xp situations for that level range.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why we all can't get what we want. A pet that is useful in pulling, while causing more dps than our current pet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>TwobittRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Sure, as soon as you explain to me what group is going to wait for you to cast the pet and then buff it up in the situations where you need that lower level pet to pull. /shrug.<br />
<br />
No shit you can cast the lower level pet, just like every other pet class can do right now. But why don't they? Because it's inconvenient. <br />
<br />
We should not need to be inconvenienced to maintain our pet pulling advantage, because if there is inconvenience involved. A level 49 mage earth pet with /pet hold nocast, will out pull our pet any day of the week, simply based on hps.<br />
<br />
Ok as soon as you explain to me why you want a new pet at the same level of our existing pet. If you like it so much why not just veto the new pet and not get the spell and keep casting your old spell that way noone will have to wait for you to recast since you will already have your crappy pet up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently I just don't suck, as far as I know I don't pet pull different than anyone else (well except for the fact that I don't FD... not an issue with a mage in my example).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not asked for a pet at the same level as our current pet. What I did say was that level 68 would be entirely too high to continue pet pulling with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Gally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Why would pets being higher level prevent pet pulling...  pets don't get aggro unless they hit that mob.  You on the other hand will get aggro and any assist aggro which may transfer to your pet if your out of melee range.<br />
<br />
Beyond that I have never gotten pet pulling to work unless you<br />
1) FD<br />
2) send pet<br />
3) hold pet/back off<br />
4) stand<br />
<br />
I've been told you don't have to FD first but I've gotten adds every single time I've done it that way.  Now once you hold the pet you can stand up and take the mob from one end of the zone to the other (the things I could do if pets could see invis)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make the pet more powerful without increasing its level.<br />
<br />
We could have a level 1 pet with 8k HP that quads for 150; alternatively, we could have a level 75 pet with 150hp that singles for 19.  Level and &quot;power&quot; aren't dependent.  <br />
<br />
Brael - Go to the PoJ jail and test it out on punishers/enforcers.  It's a nearly perfect example.  <br />
The mobs have a small level range, and can be either blue or light blue to you.  <br />
Blues will not aggro the pet, light blues will.  <br />
They come in pairs, so it's easy to manage.<br />
Light blues can be singled with an arrow or spell.  <br />
You can solo them with ease, there are plenty of pairs, and they respawn relatively quickly (10-15mins? been awhile...).  <br />
Note - there is a wraith trap to the left of the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Even though you can massively undercon a mob, and a pet for that matter.  The fact remains a level 1 pet that hits for 3000 and has 10000 hp, isn't going to hit very often on a level 65 mob.  He's also gonna take MASSIVE damage from the mob.  Con levels do a lot to determine how hard a mob hits you, it works the same for mobs/pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">They can code around that alot easier than they can code a lot of the things people (not just SK's) seem to think the devs should impliment...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Synapticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">such a stupid thing to argue over.  There is one thing we want in common for SK pets - the ability to land its procs on blue+ mobs and more HP to survive things like enrage/AE/traps.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Just make it's procs unresistable then.  <br />
<br />
As for &quot;some stupid coding that will likely crash the server&quot;... NPC HP isn't level based (or stamina based, for that matter, hence ToFatigue not affecting their HP) - it's a fixed value input for that NPC.  The level of our pet has nothing to do with it's HP's.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>StPatrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Totally agree with Window and can once again confirm this.. Pet pulling always worked for me when I assumed (and usually assumed right) that pet is green/lightblue to mobs.. If you roleplay, think about it like conversation between MObs: &quot;Hey, kyv, see someone is coming to us, wanna go check it out? - Nah, its green, go solo it yourself&quot;. And poor monster comes to &quot;solo&quot; the pet. And yes I saw mages/necros/bsts screaming that it is easy and they can do it too... &quot;You have been given permission to drag soandso corpse&quot; is always followed. Cos they never want to sacrifice their pets' dps for pulling. So level does play the most important role in pet pulling.<br />
<br />
Not sure about FD while pet pulling, I rarely do that unless mobs too close to group, and works without FD as well. Just send pet in, spam /back off and that's it. Of course pet is full buffed, maybe only don't have VoQ or KEI  :D</div></div><hr />

What's your point?  I'd say everyone in this thread knows how to pet pull (and knows that having pet discipline makes it easier and less annoying).  <br />

As for the pet's level affecting pet pulling, I won't believe it doesn't until someone explains away my PoJustice example - it's about as clear proof as I can imagine that level does play a role.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>ThornHeart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Well, you guys really should know all about pet pulling by the time your level 50.  And if you do a little research, you'll realize why you cant always get singles.<br />
<br />
First, your pets level needs to be low enough to con green to the mobs your wanting to pull.  Not the spell level, the pet level, theres a big difference.  Your level 58 pet is actually level 37, so it will con green to any mob your fighting for exp.  The reason SK is/was the perfered class to pet pull was because our biggest pet is still green.  A necro, bst, sham, ect.  would have to use a lower level spell to summon a lower level pet, costing them dps.<br />
<br />
The Son of Decay spell is supposed to be a 59-60 level pet, which is why it wont con green to mobs, meaning it wont be able to single pull.  Not that hard of a concept.  Know what level mobs your fighting, and what level pet you are using, and you wont have many problems.  Get your little pets some buffs so they dont crumble on ya while pulling.  <br />
<br />
I've been able to pull the king and queen out of chardok to the enterance using this tech.  Because I am non-kos there, I walk down, have a rogue open the door for me, target the king or queen, head back to the library, send pet in to attack, (fully buffed) call him back,  /pet hold, have rogue open the first door again for me, and walk my happy butt back to the entrance.  Turns an hour or 2 hour raid into a 5 minute quick kill.  <br />
<br />
Not knowing what we are capable of is why most people dont view sk as being a very good class.  Use what tools we have and change some minds.</div></div><hr />

I can't pet pull with my 56 mage or my 58 beastlord but can easily pet pull with my SK.  Every single time I send my beastlord pet after a mob I get adds immediately.  I was pet pulling (with SK) in a LDON group recently and the mage in the group thought he would give it a shot without telling anybody.  I guess he was tired of my pet getting beat down on the pulls.  He brought about 5 mobs down on us with his pull and all he did was send his pet after one mob and then tell it to back off after it attacked.<br />
<br />
If pet lvl had no bearing on pet pulling then why does it always seem that a SK or a druid is doing the pet pulling?  Why send the weakest pet in there to get the mob when a beastlord, necro or mage pet could do a better job?<br />

<br />
Wrong.  Without a doubt, I have seen my pet pull adds on several occaisions.  As I was FD'ed, the mobs killed bonesy, then reset without adding on the group, but I count real good up to three, and there was definitely more than one mob beating on my pet.<br />

My play time has been limited lately, so I still have not hit 68 to mem the new pet, so I've not been able to try to use it to pull. Has anyone tried to use it. If so, what mobs did you use it on and did it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>ZarvexSkulkrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">the Con of the pet has no bearing on pet pulling at all, ANY pet will pull a single provided he is the only one on aggro list... IE you are FD.<br />
<br />
pets do not draw assist aggro from other mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is flat out FALSE from personal knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">the new pet pulls adds on every mob on which I have attempted to pull regardless of whether I was FD or not.<br />
<br />
The old pet oddly enough however pulled adds today in Nobles. Those mobs are dark blue at 69 and i would have though he should not have gotten any adds.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if they are attempting to get rid of pet pulling. <br />
<br />
Hard to say since this is on my server. Server just came down for the second patch today so I will experiment some more with it tonight using the old pets.</div></div><hr />

Does the shaman pet suck, or has boney been hitting the gym lately?</div></div><hr />

Not equipped with stuff though, you'll be suprised how the Shaman pet fares (gap ours beats it by is alot closer now)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that because shaman pets don't dual wield by default like most other pets do?<br />
<br />
Equip both with weapons and watch the difference. Its pretty significant.<br />
<br />
Which is fine and as it should be, its just that shamans dont seem to worry about equipping their pets with toys which seems to help their pets alot.</div></div><hr />
