My pet and I were able to keep the 8 or so mobs in the area down, until one got away, and brought back some friends, so I died, and lost 52.<br />
<br />
Whipped out my trusty 49 pet spell, and got back to work. We couldn't kill the mobs fast enough to keep them all down. We'd kill 6 or 7, and others would start popping.<br />
<br />
49th level pet is ok, but nothing compared to the one at 52.<br />
<br />
Just putting in my 2 cents.<br />

I camped the room at 51 with a druid partner. Due to the bug where touching a wall in there will let spells cast but not stick I had a runner make it all the way out of the water tunnel. I followed him all the way down and killed him, ran back up without invis and never had an aggro. <br />
<br />
Another strange occurance was that I cleared the 2 mobs in the room and the one guard outside, for the next 2 hours only the ishva/ph respawned. Turned out well though, got two copies of the spell and the robe which I got to trade for a SBS and full set of crusty gear.</div></div><hr />

The 52 pet amazed me in damage output.  It was nice to get the 49 pet, as it had enough hit points to tank a higher mob for a sec while I casted, etc., but it still didnt do a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
I think the 52 pet is about 10 lvls higher than the 49 one (29 v 39 lvl spell for necros) so even though its max damage isnt all that different, it hits A LOT more frequently.<br />
<br />
I'm now starting to use strengthen death for the first time since I got it, and its more than just candy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazaak</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 58 pet puts out about 18-20dps against level 46-49 shrooms in FG.  Another 1100-1200 DPM on top of our own, is certainly nothing to scoff at.  That actually closes the difference between what a warrior and and SK will deal on average blue con mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evilangel</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always use me 52nd pet when I can, they can take a fear beating as well. The other night when we were trying to space out the Chief spawns for the Idol, we just let the Pet tank. He needed a few heals but did pretty good against mobs that are full blue to my 44th Druid.<br />
<br />
I recon they have improved pet pathing, they seem to be less inclined to wander off these days.<br />
<br />
I notised today on casters relm that they are doing a review of pets, with adding more resists, reducing riposet and improving performance on hitting 50+ mobs. <br />
<br />
Can't wait to get the 58th one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much of an upgrade as the 52 pet was. The 58 pet flat out rocks. At 58 you can summon a level 35 pet that quads for 47, Kicks/bashes for 22? and lifetaps 1 percent of his health back during fights (and he procs it alot). This pet does a fair amount of damage in combat and i am proud to use him. He cons light blue to level 57 people and I love hearing the phrase &quot;hey how come your pet is blue?? I thought SK pets were weak!! &quot; <br />
<br />
Some times its great to be an sk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have high hopes for rogue pet to be released to us during new EQ:POP expansion if our level cap got upped. Wait and see how it goes. Heck, lvl 49 necro pet flat out rocks over lvl 44 necro pet (equiv to lvl 58 SK pet) and we are almost guaranteed to get lvl 49 in EQ:Pop only if our level got upped. Lvl 49 has almost 2x more hp over lvl 44 pet. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bludge</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the Casters Realm info that Evilangel mentioned<br />
<br />
Last week there were a lot of changes made to pets, especially in relation to casting times and reagents.  The current changes on Test Server have almost all pets with a 1.0 second casting time and only 1 reagent required regardless of pet.  Previously pets could take up to 10 seconds or more to cast, and use up to 3 reagents per summoning.  <br />
<br />
Could you provide a little insight into the current pet revamp on test, what your aim is with it, etc?<br />
<br />
The current Test Server changes to pets are mostly regarding casting time. I wanted to see what the impact would be if pets were all fast casting, pretty much guaranteeing that a character could summon his pet almost anytime. There are concerns about things like chain-casting pets and the effect it could have on soloability for instance. The changes on Test should allow us to see the worst case.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whether this particular change will go live or not. I'll see how it looks, and continue experimenting with other aspects of pets as well. We already put in a feature where pets are almost never riposted to increase their durability, and I'm looking at increasing some resists on pets, as well as their chance to hit against 50+ mobs. We've got some other things we're looking at doing for pets also, but I'm not willing to discuss them until I'm more sure they'll make it onto Test. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocifer Deathblade</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The possible changes to pet to be more useful and survive much longer against riposted mobs like enraged skill. When I was main tank in Umbral Plains, my pet kept getting killed EVERY fight thanks to damn enrage and I eventually gave up and no longer used pet for good. With the possible changes, I would finally get to use my pet once again against those same mobs, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikumu</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking forward to the 52nd level pet....the 49th one was a big improvement over our 39th and from what I have read the 52nd is that much more of an improvement.<br />
<br />
Plus I am looking forward to some of our other 52nd level spells as well :D</div></div><hr />
