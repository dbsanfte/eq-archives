<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just completed Combat Agility 3, I have Combat Stability 1 (needed it for physical enhancement - which I have).<br />
<br />
My Question is: Do I continue the agility line and start working on Lightning Relfexes or start working on Combat Stability 2 &amp; 3?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would go ahead and get combat stability to 3, then do LR5. You're are going to have to do it eventually anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Combat Stability 2 and 3 are more effective for the cost too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speaking from the clerical side (I have a 65 cleric), LR5 is a much greater increase in tanking power for you.   It is so much easier / less mana intensive to keep up a tank with LR5 than one that went for ID5 first.<br />
<br />
You will want both eventually of course,  but I would highly recommend LR5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LR5 is a much greater increase in tanking power for you<br />
Not on a per-point basis.  Max CS first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LR &amp; ID are the same decrease in damage over time regardless...<br />
<br />
LR has the advantage of reducing interrupts slightly, and reducing damage from mobs with innate procs.<br />
<br />
ID has the advantage of making your damage intake less spikey which is arguably the most important thing.<br />
<br />
anyway, regarding the original question, CS is a far better bargain than LR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siilvir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CS first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Araden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LR and ID are the same decrease in damage over time?  Unless they changed ID to mitigate more,  LR used to totally own ID in damage reduction over time.  If that got changed,  that's cool,  for the same point cost they both should have been just as effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've seen parses that suggest they're similar damage reduction.<br />
<br />
Just thinking about how it works, I'd guess that with super high AC, CS/ID is less effective due to the fact you're already getting a lot of min hits and CS won't mitigate it lower.  At lower levels of AC, it should be at least as effective as CA/LR.<br />
<br />
And finishing CS is definitely more damage reduced per point spent than going for LR right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vorrhees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I Went CA, LR, CS, ID, and then PE, I really didnt see a difference in Mitagation untill I got them all. <br />
<br />
 I love all the defense aa's And Will Agi Maxxed it make's BoT feel like ME<br />
