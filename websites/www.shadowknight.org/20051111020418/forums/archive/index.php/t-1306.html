<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyrrax</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having some problems with the Test of Pain quest.  I spent all day yesterday slaughtering greenies in Swamp of No Hope in order to get the pages for the book.  I have a few questions though.  First off how many LORE pages do I need to loot?  And second, what do I do with the NO DROP, LORE page I get when the quest starts?  I got about 7 LORE pages, numerous nonlore pages and a weird bookmark that I don't know what to do with.  Any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanizMortem</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If memory serves, Froglok Raiders also drop a binder thats needed for these pages.  It's 10 slot and there are 9 LORE NO DROP pages in addition to the one the quest giver provides for a total of 10.  Once you have all 10 pages in the binder, combine and hand it and your preceeding Khurki for the next Khurki.<br />
<br />
This quest is called the Test of Pain for a reason.  My painful experience was so long ago on this, I had forgotten how annoying it was, but now it is vivid once again in my head.  Thanks! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexar Venomous</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need <br />
8 Lore pages<br />
1 regular page(not lore or no drop)<br />
1 Lore and No Drop(the one given by the trainer) <br />
Binder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be sure to get rid of all but one Non-Lore page.  If you combine with 2 of these, you will lose everything in the binder and have to go back to the quest-giver to get a new Lore No Drop page.   Bad enough doing this quest once.  I did it twice because I screwed it up this way, then another time when I switched servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I swapped servers long ago, maybe 8 months ago from Terris-Thule to Cazic-Thule and they wiped my equip, so I had to do this quest over.  I had more that one non-lore page when I hit combine and it just said I couldn't combine these items in this container type.  It kept all the pages.<br />
<br />
It truely is one of the most annoying quests in this series, but the Visceral Dagger and LoP come close with their spawns too.  The Visceral Dagger was more annoying than this, but the random number generator wasn't being kind to me that long moment in time.  It did help that I had a 52 druid tracking raiders for me though. :)  <br />

<br />
Dalnir on the other hand, can kiss my scaly arse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lexar Venomous</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did them when they were blue also and it wasnt very enjoyable.Mainly because I couldnt kill as much in the area, thus spawning less of them.Not too mention all the higher frogloks running around trying to kick my ass, and suceeding many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yuggoth</div><div class="date">05-04-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehehehe - I remember those days... not to mention the bright red (to me) skellys that would spawn in the area.<br />
<br />
I consider it a 'character building' experience... i.e. it sucked pretty badly :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyrrax</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally finished this bastard.  Before I went back to the swamp I got a tell from an 11th level SK asking for help.  Of course I assumed it was money or items or something but he asked me to help him with this quest.  I told him he was damn lucky that I was going out there.  We get out there and he ends up giving me the last page I needed to finish it after 3 days of this boring camp.  A first for me...a n00b being useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spynayl</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm a level 14 Iksar Sk on the FV server (server wide trivial loot code). <br />
<br />
I just did this quest, and totally enjoyed it. Ran into another Iksar SK ( I was 12 when I did this. so were they) and we teamed up with a shaman and a necro to do it. We got everything in one evening of killing everything in our general level range around the whole bandit camp.<br />
<br />
However, as of tonights patch (the 8th), the quest just go harder. Now the gnawers, and the man eating plants in the area are all aggro, not non aggro as previously. The leeches and mosquito's are still non aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkWyld</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's bad!!  With trivial loot code, this quest would become a dead end unless you had a number of high level protectors watching your back.  By the time you can protect yourself from the nibblers and the plants, the frogs would be greening out.  I guess you would have to hope the pages are not affected by TLC at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spynayl</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not so sure Lanfyr. I reported it to the Developers corner, and bugged it in game though, just to be sure it was intended. You *can* avoid both those type monsters while in the area.<br />
<br />
I agree, it *would* be impossible to do this if the Mosquito's were now aggro (which they are not). There are ten zillion Mosquito's around that area, and there can be a lot of plants (which makes this a very bad change). <br />
<br />
Anyway, I did report it, cause its not a good change.<br />
