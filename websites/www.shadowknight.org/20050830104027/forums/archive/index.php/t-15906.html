Was way overkill when I did it.<br />
Group ranged from 53 to 62, way overkill</div></div><hr />

A bunch of undead guards come out with him..our cleric pacified and solo pulled. He hit for like 150ish..rampaged A LOT like every other swing was a rampage....im only lvl41 so I let the monk be RT, hehe..<br />
<br />
He's also on VS faction like the rest of the outpost. The kill dropped me from apprehensive to dubious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When he walks out, wait. He will walk forward, leaving his guards behind. Easy to nab him and take solo to your spot.</div></div><hr />

Thanks guys!  I really appreciate the help.  <br />
<br />
By this he means:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Chayde, bring your cleric that you hate playing on. I need to try something&quot;<br />
<br />
And I of course will go &quot;Are you paying for the peridots?&quot; Like any true cleric would =o)<br />
<br />
Maybe by time he logs in from work, I will have successfully two boxed this for him. Because I am a very dutiful wife. (Stop laughing, I really am!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
After I turned in the Deklium to the Alchemist, soon the Golem walked out of the outpost on our right side, near the book. ~4 green-conning (to lev 56) undead guards, and a deep blue-conning watch guard surrounded him. We waited a minute or so, but they didn't leave, so I gave it a shot and successfully single-pulled golem with an arrow from about max range (150).<br />
<br />
We were 4 people ranging from about 51 to 62+, and it was an easy kill. Well, shaman slowed it, so it was just a matter of reducing its hp, but this guy ain't tougher than you'd expect a 53 war mob to be.<br />
