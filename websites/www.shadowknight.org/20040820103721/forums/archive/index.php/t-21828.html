<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question.. For those ogre, SKs that have done this quest.<br />
<br />
Is it true the max faction we can get to is, indiff ? <br />
<br />
If so, I use scalp + indiff, and what else for turn in ??<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As SJ stated, a good race illusion potion with the scalp will be sufficient.<br />
<br />
I was agonizing over this myself when I did this quest with my Cazic-Thule Iksar monk because:<br />
<br />
I did this quest first with my Inny DE SK.  I maxed at Amiable.  With scalp I was Kindly, with scalp plus illusion I was Warmly.  All good, okay.<br />
<br />
When I did this quest with my leezard monk, I was HORRIFIED to find out that I capped at Indifferent.  I thought &quot;how the heck am I supposed to get up to Warmly?&quot; since I was one level of faction BELOW my SK.<br />
<br />
Well, it seems that Indifferent + scalp + illusion is enough, as I got the crown successfully for the monk.  I'm 99.99% certain that the same applies to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shurek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Which scalp are we talking about here? <br />
<br />
Is there a good race potion that works better?  ie wood elf or barbarian or Highelf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Scalp of a ghoul lord or whatever - the one that drops off the shin lord in UGuk.  <br />
<br />
Wood elf illusion (can't confirm that it's better than any others, but I can confirm that it works, and can't say the same for any others).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oombak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">max faction, scalp (off ghoul lord), and wood elf illusion potion will definately work for an Ogre Shadowknight (Cazic Thule)<br />
<br />
I know because that's how I got mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlackMeph</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like the GoD one-shot Woody quest would be a big help in this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you can buy illusion potions in bazaar for about 100ppish or you can win them in casino for 10kish, you can have an enc with bestow illusion or whatever AA cast an illusion on you in upper guk, and i think i read that the druid indoor wolf form LDoN spell actually improves your faction beyond what any normal goody illusion does, but haven't confirmed or tried to confirm it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darknyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, I was told my faction capped at indiff, well I'm now amiably - What does it cap at ? Amiably without the scalp on btw <br />
<br />
<br />
Dark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">capped at indiff for me, illusion wood elf potion and scalp were enough to complete the quest</div></div><hr />

Dark<br />
<br />
It may differ by race/diety/class.  As a DE/Inny/SK I capped at amiable without scalp.<br />
<br />
- my iksar/CT/monk: indifferent<br />
- my halfling/Karana/druid: ally<br />
- my human/MithMarr/Cleric: ally</div></div><hr />
