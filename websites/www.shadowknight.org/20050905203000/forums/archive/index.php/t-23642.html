<br />
Wall of slaughter : Hulcror : RGC isn't good enough for curing 36 disease counter, our clerics don't have the necessary aaxp as well, how could we deal quickly with that debuff on the MT (mainly) ? Spam it with pure blood ?<br />
<br />
The Hivequeen : Any idea if getting her out of her lair, I mean tanking her in the corridor to her lair just far enough so we dont aggro the respawning Guards and eventually the Eggs ? Or will she warp back ?<br />
<br />
If you don't like giving away strats and spoilers NP, I understand. We are a small family guild (that just killed RZ with 50 bazaar geared toons on our 3rd try weeeee!) and we do have very few time for experimentation so I like having a good strat before engaging a new mob. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance !</div></div><hr />

<br />
hivequeen can be pulled out her lair. Will warp if no aggro is on her and is pulled to far.She will spawn eggs where ever she is at.You can figure out how to deal with the eggs.</div></div><hr />

Hivequeen lays her eggs at the fight so there is no way to separate them from her.</div></div><hr />
