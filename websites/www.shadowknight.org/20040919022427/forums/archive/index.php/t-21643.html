<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I also posted this on the official sk forums.. came up with ideas for oow aa what do ya think?<br />
<br />
General AA: (Everyone gets these!)<br />
Bubble (10) - Allows you to breath underwater permanently [Requirement = Lasting Breath 2] Make those lung capacity AA's worthwhile!<br />
 <br />
Improved Convalescence (5/5/5) - Increase your Hit point regeneration by 1 per rank [Requirement = Convalesence 2] More HP regen is never bad!!!<br />
 <br />
Hasten's gift (10) - Increases your run speed by another 10% [Requirements = Swift Journey 2] Hasten the jboots guy<br />
 <br />
Power of Omens (5/5/5/5/5) - Each level increases the maximum you can raise your base statistics by 5<br />
 <br />
Armor Affinity (5/5/5) - Increases the ammount of AC you get from your equipment I'm probably wrong but I think SK's get like 1.9 x the ac on their gear?  (ex. you put on a 10 ac item your ac goes up by 19) So this would raise it by .1 for each rank so instead of 19 ac from that 10ac item you would get 20, 21, and 22 etc....<br />
 <br />
Tanking AA: (WAR PAL SHD)<br />
Enhanced Durability (5/5/5) - Increases your maximum hit points by 2% per rank [Requirement = Natural Durability3] Works just like ND.. based on sta etc..<br />
 <br />
Flowing Agility (5/5/5) - Further Increases your damage avoidance by 2% per rank [Requirement = Lightning Reflexes 5]<br />
 <br />
Fortitude (5/5/5) - Further Increases your damage mitigation by 2% per rank [Requirement = Innate Defense 5]<br />
 <br />
Innate Stun Resistance (3/6/9) - Reduces the chance of being stunned and the duration of stuns by 5%, 12%, and 25%. This ability does not affect stuns that result from spells.<br />
 <br />
Mirror Stance (3/6/9) - Gives you the innate ability to reflect spells cast at you back to the caster by 2%, 5%, and 10%<br />
 <br />
Hybrid AA: (PAL SHD RNG BST)<br />
Battle Channeling (3/6/9/12/15) - Allows to melee while casting a spell. The first level at 5% accuracy and damage, second level 15%, third 30%, fourth 50%, fifth 75%<br />
 <br />
Battle Focus (3/6/8) - This ability Improves your chances of channeling a spell without getting interupted by 5%, 15%, and 30% [Requirement = Channeling Focus] Hybrids only not pure casters.. it makes alot of sense since hybrids spend their whole lives casting spells while in melee combat... naturally they would be the best at it<br />
 <br />
Shield Defense (3/6/9) - Grants an innate shielding bonus when using a shield by 1%, 3%, and 7%<br />
 <br />
ShadowKnight Specific AA:<br />
Fury of Hooves (8) - Improves your unholy steed ability, giving you a different horse that is faster. [Requirements = Unholy Steed] Would be at run speed cap.. Maybe give us skelle horse model or flaming horse. Paladins should get the same thing cept their horse could be maybe a wrulon or the flaming horse model from pofire just change the horse color to white and the flames from red to sky blue.<br />
 <br />
Improved Spell Casting Fury (3/6/9) - Further Increases your chances of Landing a Critical Blast [Requirement = Spell Casting Fury 3]<br />
 <br />
Improved Theft of Life (2/4/6) - Further increases your chances of landing an exceptional heal on lifetaps [Requirement = Theft of Life 3]<br />
 <br />
Stonewall (3/6/9/12/15) - Same as monk aa that lets you stay feigned if casted on<br />
 <br />
Bonewall (5/10/15) - Greatly increases your chance of Channeling Feign Death, Death Peace, and Comatose without getting interupted by 15%, 40%, and 75%. This ability also makes it impossible to fizzle these spells.<br />
 <br />
Dark Power (10/10) - Further enchances the damage done by your lifetap procs by 400% and 500% [Requirements = Soul Abrasion 3] SA was 300% if im not mistaken<br />
 <br />
Dual-Handed Harm Touch (8) - Puts your Improved Harm Touch and Leech touch abilities on separate timers. [Requirements = Improved Harm Touch ,Leech Touch] Also leech touch should auto fire theft of life much like IHT auto fires spell casting fury<br />
 <br />
Dark Shroud of the Living (5) - insta cast invis (this would balance sks that dont have a cos cuz its such an overpowering item)<br />
Dark Shroud of the Dead (5) -  insta cast IVU<br />
 <br />
Dark Familiar (3/6/9) - Greatly improves your pets hit points, armor class, and resists. Level 1 - 500hp 30ac 10all resist, Level 2 - 1000hp 80ac 25 all resist, Level 3 - 1500hp 150ac 50 all resists Or just something to make our pets not die in one hit or one ae<br />
<br />
EDIT: Guess I shoulda put this in the suggestions forum oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not bad at all, most of those I can agree with, though I think that some of them aren't as high priority as others. Except....<br />
<br />
Dark Shroud of the Living (5) - insta cast invis (this would balance sks that dont have a cos cuz its such an overpowering item)<br />
<br />
This would piss off quite a few SKs, SKs that have spent 200-300k on their CoS, only to have it dropped down to 2k overnight, because 5AA is shit all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they all make too much sense. I'd be happy to get one of any of them which i'm not holding my breath on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I can't take the credit for these ideas though I wish I could - be able use AA's to get additional spell gems - OR - have rotating spell sets (like the hotkey banks) where it takes X amount of time to switch between bank to bank. AA's would lower X every level...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah id be mad that my CoS doesnt make me hardcore uber over other sks too.. but in all fairness the CoS is the best sk item in the game period... and it doesnt drop anymore!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i think the paladin horse should be from the 'my little pony' collection</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">give pallies something gay like a unicorn with rainbow sparkles lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Innate Invis would be nice.  yeah it would destroy the CoS value, but it would also serve to benifit Shadow Knights as a whole by adding a little life to our utility as a puller, rather than a select few of us with good finances.<br />
<br />
i'd prefer see our class given a little life and utility, rather than see my investment protected.<br />
<br />
we went from being second behind monks as pullers to an afterthought thanks to Fading Memories.  we were one of three classes intended to have use of FD.  Bards get something more useful than one of our oldest class abilities for the cost of a few AA's, it wouldn't be unbalancing to add something similar to our class AA list.<br />
<br />
on a side note, the Enduring Breath [General AA 's] would be great, and hardly affect game balance in the endgame.  does anyone out there not own some form of EB by this point?  an useful AA every class had access to that removes the need to carry a piece of extraneous gear around would be nice.  plus it would justify spending AA's on Innate Lung Capacity and Lasting Breath as prereq's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not that 8 aa is a lot for leech curse and iht to be on a sperate timer, but it seems a waste since (for usefullness purposes) they should be on a seperate timer anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">give pallies something gay like a unicorn with rainbow sparkles lol <br />
<br />
haha my wife would probably roll up a pally then heh...she loves unicorns was teasing her when GoD or OOW was announced that one of the wiz aa's was a unicorn pet hehe :)...</div></div><hr />
