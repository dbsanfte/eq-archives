I will drive one up to 60 now but which would provide the best $$ power for Twinkage to the other alts for fun?  <br />

Thank you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like them all equally, I would suggest the wizard. They are going to really be in demand after the rebalancing, especially with SOL mobs being so melee resistant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qarya</div><div class="date">03-24-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of farming? If you want to farm lguk, etc or farm for cash, level a magician. If you want to farm seb, level a cleric. And you're going to have to enjoy whatever toon it is you level, or you'll never make it to 60 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baroyonx</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know exactly where you are coming from with this post, I have both a 40th shaman and my 40th sk.  I started the SK after the shaman and now he has passed the shaman (just yesterday) in experience.<br />
    The reason I switched was I didn't like the way things were going for me as the shaman in groups, believe it or not.  As the shaman, my main role was to sit on my bum and make sure every mob was slowed and every melee was buffed.  I know this is an important role but it got real tired really fast.  Soloing was decent but I think that at the level i am, the SK does it better.<br />
   Basically my point is the Shadowknight is continuing to be fun, since i often am puller or main tank while the shaman plays a much more passive role in a group, especially if there is another wis caster in the group.  Hope that helps.  (I know that at high levels there is more demand for shaman though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarxle</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love my SK, I have solo's the majority to 60.  While fun it was not always easy.  My friend had a shaman and he seemded to be able to solo much easier earlier on.  The question is, what class do YOU like playing more?  Both had advantages and disadvantages, but I would never trade my SK for any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emnity</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman comes into his own at 34 with much increased damage output, couldn't solo mine well until then. SK comes into there own at 30 with FD and Invis. I'd suggest playing both until you hit those milestones and then seeing what you prefer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moolentheus</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alts are just time takers when one gets bored in a hell level or something.  I made lots of alts (8 actually)  and then finally came to my senses and deleted all by my mule and sold all the twinking stuff on him  I had a 45 (SK) at that time.  I finally thought that it is more important to have a level 60 character ranther than 8 level 40 characters =)<br />
<br />
Just another pyschological view on EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garila</div><div class="date">03-25-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ironically the most twinked class is the best class for farming twink stuff . . . . monk . . . . but i would go for whatever melee you enjoy because when casters run out of mana in a dungeon things can get hairy fast . .  its especially humiliating to have something be at 20% and haul for the zone because you are out of mana</div></div><hr />
