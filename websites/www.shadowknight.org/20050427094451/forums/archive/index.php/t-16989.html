<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently, I've played around with alot of the races and religions and have narrowed it down to a couple of choices.<br />
<br />
1. Troll Shadowknight of Cazic Thule. Reason: It is the original cazic sk, before Kunark and before they patched Paineel in. Trolls tend to be an easy roleplay and the historical rp aspect of this character is that there are only Thule worshipping Troll SKs in EQOA, thus making it easy to create a plausable history.<br />
<br />
2. Erudite Shadowknight. Reason, same as troll in everything except that they are a more complex roleplay.<br />
<br />
3. Iksar Shadowknight. Reason: Kunark raised the bar of NPC interaction and created a more RP friendly enviroment for the Iksars. While not appearing in EQOA, they have an incredible base of quests to build off of and possibly are the most sound of the Thulian Shadowknight Choices.<br />
<br />
These are the 3 choices I am considering. Just thought I'd get an opinion before I settle in on making one my main.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saelaru Valsharen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hm, looks ok, except that you're bent on Cazic Thule - go for Innoruuk instead ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cazic &gt; Inno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All 3 are good for roleplay.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the bookish, but well built, Erudite who got pissed off by something he learned and had to exact dark vengence on the world.<br />
<br />
But to the matter at hand.  Now that  you know you can RP which will be most fun for you to play (you know the action part of the game where you live up to all the smack you've been talking).  An Erudite will not have the same HP as a Troll nor the AC of an Iksar and are more casting heavy.  Trolls and Iksar are more alike in thier tanks first  advantages.</div></div><hr />

Hm, looks ok, except that you're bent on Cazic Thule - go for Innoruuk instead ;)  <br />
<br />
*Does a /who dark elf shadowknight all*<br />
<br />
List doesn't finish, too many. Innoruuk is so over-played, it's kinda sick at times. Just because Dark Elf women dress skimpy and can wield a whip, everyone has got to have one.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I'm going with Cazic because I already have a Human Shadowknight of Bertoxxulous, he's a blast, but I wanted something more inhuman, which led me to my 3 choices.<br />
<br />
Granted an Erudite is a human, but honestly, they're like High Elves, stuck up noblish types who scowl when dealing with the lesser races. The only problem I have with an erudite is that don't take a punch well and the forehead...it's kinda scary w/ Luclin.<br />
<br />
Trolls are cool, but after seeing a pic of a troll in EQ2, they don't exactly win any contests for looking fearsome, which a troll should look like. If trolls actually had their models redone to something truely frightening, they'd win for sure.<br />
<br />
Iksars are great but the only problem is that they take time to level and faction building can be a horrifying experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arcmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Human SK. It's just so much easiler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Who needs faction POK LOVES YOU~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, but I can't live in the PoK all the time, it'd be cool but I'd never do anything, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shintou Shinai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But how many of those Darkelves are acually Roleplaying?<br />
<br />
RPing a Darkelf following Innoruuk can be fun is you see all the aspects of it. Sure, everyone plays a frikken DE cause they &quot;look cool&quot;, but Me, being an acual roleplayer chose being a DE because thats how I view the perfect evil, Hate.<br />
<br />
And its not all about rising hatred in yourself, I like watching my Character rise the hatred out of others as he tries to bring war back into Norrath, its pretty cool. That, and damn it I just like being somewhat short.<br />
<br />
But probably the best RP openings for the average player would be a Human Knight of Bertox.<br />
<br />
ShadowKnight following a Path of Death. Simple enought, and can be very complex, good roleplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Originally posted by Shintou Shinai <br />
 but Me, being an acual roleplayer chose being a DE because thats how I view the perfect evil, Hate.  <br />
<br />
Lol I find this funny considering your sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok I'll go through this in order:<br />
<br />
1: Troll SK...Do NOT worship Inny here. There are two reasons for this. First is being that there is better armor for CT worshipers and Inny pretty much gets the shaft. Secondly, if you ever plan to fation with other major SK towns you WILL love being a CT worshiper (ie Cabilis and Paineel which are both important). Trust me NPCs look at religion first when they are deciding if you should die or not.<br />
<br />
2:Erudites definately are fun to RP. Being the always smart-arse big head is a good time. Just be sure you know lots and lots of lore so that you can screw it into conversations and sound even cooler. Good choice here too.<br />
<br />
3: I love Iksars. Their history and culture is wonderful and the way they look in armor is boss too. If I could choose again I would choose Iksar instead of my troll. Faction with paineel will start at threatening and just a couple of leveling early on in the Warrens will get you to indiff pretty fast (Much more than that of a troll) Neriak can be blown off I think and Iksars get some cool armor like Fearless Skyrion I think is what its called. True no plate but that tacks on to the challenge...40's level range you will hate because of the idiots you will have to put up with in DL and your xp pen will make you want to cry if you are a pretty casual player like me.<br />
<br />
   Hope that helps. I know there was a guild on some server that was all about iksars and Cabilis but I'm not sure where it is anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As far as role playing goes...Iksars are the easiest to remain in character with.  Everyone hates them and they hate everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azaezel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dunno, it depends if you want to say &quot;Korgak barsh yooz bitz gud&quot; or you just want to type lots of S's. Its all personality, I honestly haven't seen anyone roleplay in about two years since I was in a all evil race guild. I assume since you want to RP maybe you played some old school game like D&amp;D so you might know something about alignments.<br />
<br />
Erudites would probably just go around exacting there own justice because being as smart as they are of course they are always right. Trolls aint to bright but they are beefy and evil, when a iksar might be more of a tribal thing.<br />
<br />
Hell I dunno, I played a DE because they are probably more mysterious, cunning and agile than to be a big beat stick. The quiet guy who is always there saving your ass at the right time. Not that I planned on RPing but your toon is like a avatar of yourself right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhim Dooommaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personaly, I would have to say gnome Bertox Shadow Knight woudl be awsome to roleplay.<br />
<br />
you got the curious, small gnome, who is bent on taking over norrath witht he help of the plague lord.<br />
<br />
Of course the plague lord has some... influense.. you coudl say(planted voices in his head who tell him to do things... like kill random people and just do evil things)<br />
<br />
also, you could have fun playing around that the influence of the plague lord is so strong that wherever he walks plague and disease spreads(run around casting feign death, the spell effect looks all black and evil.)<br />
<br />
but gnomes are good roleplaying characters.... no one suspects the short one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">AHA! I have the perfect comparison for you friend.  It's essentially of these, which you prefer more:<br />
<br />
Iksar: lots of sssssssss optional(I dont use them).  Are similar to the erudites in their monstrously huge egos, but unlike the erudites, they are more centered around a sense of honor than the other races.  Rather than inspiring fear to prove their superiority, like erudites, they are doing so for the purpose of pleasing thule, and because they enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Trolls: Me barsh gud. nuff said.  For those who like ogrespeak, this is a great choice.  Trolls are much more primal, warlike and fanatical than your other two choices, and disorganized as well(probably why the froggies booted em).  Primary concerns are simply smashing as much as possible for no reason at all.<br />
<br />
Erudites:egos as big as their foreheads.  They look down on the other races as &quot;lesser&quot;, but unlike the dark elves, this is a superiority issue, rather than a racial hatred.  They do not &quot;hate&quot; any races due to this, they simply scoff at them and view them as pathetic scum who arent worthy of being stepped on by them.  Erudites are also very bookish, and spend more time concentrating on their sorcery than their swordsmanship.  When all else fails, read a book.  Erudites also talk in a very serious and sophisticated manner.  They do not revel in the pain of their enemies like dark elves, or iksar, but rather fight them in order to prove their self imposed &quot;superiority&quot;.<br />
<br />
IMHO, choose iksar, they are the simplest to roleplay without seeming goofy(like trolls), but still are fun to roleplay and have few if any restrictions on what would make sense for an iksar that are different than what would for a shadowknight.  Plus, they look  great with full plate dyed black, royal frosted velium, or dark green and/or red.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darkdogg Bonegrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wait wait, DE women can dress sexy and weild a whip? DUDE! Where can I sign up? Sorry, I just had to get that out of my system. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I play an Erudite and love every minute of it. Its quite fun being arrogant and condescending, and I just love the sophisticated evil type. Its really great if you have a big vocabulary so you can inject obscure words into your conversations. And Erudites look awesome in plate post-Luclin, and the plate helm goes a long way in covering up the huge forehead.<br />
Trolls are interesting to roleplay, as speaking non coherantly can be quite fun. Plus you can grumble about froglocks and Grobb a lot.<br />
Iksar, I don't have expierence with, but they have an interesting society. Very militeristic, reminds me of Rome. There is a lot of lore available for Iksar too, with Greenmist and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Paynreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IMO, Cazic-Thule Troll would be the most fun to RP.<br />
<br />
1.) Innoruuk is a wuss<br />
<br />
2.) Eating Gnome and generally being big = awesome<br />
<br />
3.) Ebrywun Likez Dummeez!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">umm we did Cazic thule with 2 groups the other day. yet Innoruuk has wiped out our entire raiding force..<br />
<br />
Really &quot;the easiest&quot; to &quot;roleplay&quot; would be either human or darkelf.<br />
<br />
But out of those choices I would go with the iksar. troll's are too big and stupid to be shadowknights. and erudite's ... well do I really need to lay out the reasons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GROKKITT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">uuum, Inny just had revamp last few months. They need to make the gods harder. IMO killing a GOD should be a seriously big deal.<br />
They are just basically another raid mob as is. It just seems fucked up that 2 or 3 groups can kill Cazic in his own realm without breaking a sweat. But, thats the nature of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason i get images of Pinky and the Brain reading this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plague lord:  What are we doing tonight GnomeSK?<br />
<br />
GnomeSK:  the same thing we do every night Plague Lord.  Try to take over Norrath!!<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dredmor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Iksar hands-down. Nowhere did you mention that you're looking to look cool. (Erudites look sweet). For uniqueness in the high-end game, Erudite would be number one. Iksar second. Then troll. Iksar and troll both have xp penalty. Erudite would be your most complex rp, I think. Living through low levels would be your biggest challenge though. They don't start out as good tanks. Balances out in the high end. Iksar and troll are both good tanks to start and end up as good as the next if not better.<br />
Now to RP. Why Iksar? Cazic is the god of fear. What is the most feared city by players. Cabilis. What is the most hated (hatred is caused by fear, usually) by npc's? Iksar. An Iksar is intimidating. The history is rich. Look it up. (Make a newb and buy the books in Monk's guild. That's how I chose Iksar when I went to make an SK.) Greenmist is your birthright. Fun quest, and it belongs to you. SSS's, larf. I play an intelligent, noble, and proud race, that despises the rest of the world. Part of an empire that nearly covered it at one time. I will see every dragon in Kunark dead. I will see the empire of Venril Sathir and his son's reborn, under my rule, and with knowledge of what went before. I will see Ssraa and the vile Shissar burn. (That describes an xp/raid path -well used to be raid path. Ssraa is a guild target. Some do VP for uniqueness.) The rest of the races are obviously inferior. Though they have their uses. Halflings and gnomes being food. I like gnome as much as the next guy.<br />
Number one reason to pick an Iksar. Chicks dig the tail. It's all about the tail.<br />
<br />
