<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sure, we try to write intelligent posts showing SOE our real issues, our lack of GoD tankability, and our lack of raid roles.  Why are they not listening?  Because our pleas are getting diluted by almost every other class posting stupid balancing requests.  I had some time and browsed the EQ class forums.<br />
<br />
Look at:<br />
<br />
THE MONKS<br />
SoE developers and staff. First, let me thank you for taking the time to read this. There are a great deal of thoughts and concepts across the boards and in the past it has been mutually helpful to condense the thoughts into one document. In the light of past success, we again come to the table.<br />
<br />
Quite a few of the players of the Monk class, while dedicated to the character felt that the Monk class has lost its distinction, and further, lost its role in EQ. In the past, monks were able to do a number of pure melee tasks. At present, many of us feel un-needed, looking for a niche to fill.<br />
<br />
A must have, for group desirability for a pure melee is some form of utility. Formerly, monk’s utility manifested in beinga high end dps, a more effective puller than other classes and the ability to serve as a light tank. Neither of the latter situations definitively applies in the current game, bringing the monks only definition to be higher end melee damage. Improvements to all roles are necessary for monks to regain the utility and desirability they once had. In the current game, the monk suffers a doubled penalty of weight restriction and mitigation limit, further set against harder content and itemization.<br />
<br />
1) Avoidance. (ed. blah blah theory to increase avoidance numbers - don't want to post this)<br />
As an additional aid to our avoidance, defensive skill caps should be raised to the maximum, to reflect a monk’s mastery of melee combat.<br />
<br />
2) Run speed.  <br />
 Movement Increase % bonus = 3*(24-weight)<br />
<br />
 3) Rip-Riposte: This is a Dev generated idea that has a lot of merit, allowing a monk to effectively be immune from riposte attacks by automatically riposting the mob when riposted.  <br />
<br />
4) Turning:  This latent skill would give the monk the ability to directly turn a mobs attack onto itself upon a rip-riposte.  <br />
<br />
5) Range attack.  Itemization needs to be looked at, or alternatively, monks need an inherent ability to do decent damage under such conditions with available weapons <br />
<br />
6) AC cap. It has been shown through substantial parsing that monks receive little to no benefit past 1340 ac.   This cap needs to be eliminated.<br />
<br />
7) More melee related endurance based abilities should be developed for the monk  <br />
<br />
8) Again, reflecting a monk’s mastery of melee combat, increasing the monk's special attack skill levels to max would add a small amount of base damage to the class.<br />
<br />
ROGUES:<br />
<br />
1. Endgame Rogues usually (if not always) cap their worn attack. Make more worn attack items droppable or available at the non-raiding level. I'd also propose a 'Vengeance' AA for AA-based ATK (maybe VengXX at max level) <br />
 <br />
2. Increase bonuses to minimum damage.  <br />
 <br />
3. Raise the backstab skill cap.  <br />
 <br />
4. Increase the quality of lower-tiered or droppable daggers.  <br />
 <br />
5. Expand Rogue usefulness in non-damage roles. Shroud of Stealth and Escape were huge steps towards this. Abilities like 'Tendon Slice' (snare) or 'Sap' (lull) or some form of stun would make us all the more useful to groups <br />
<br />
BEASTLORDS<br />
I'm getting sick of sitting around with NO comment on the state of berserkers. We offer nothing to groups or raids.   <br />
I want to go into how we don't have an identity. I want to go in how we have NOTHING to offer groups or raids.   I want to go into how we are the LAST class to be picked being that every other class in eq is a better choice then berserker being we are good at nothing.<br />
 <br />
.....and so on.  They want higher level stuns than pallies, better tankability, and much more dps.<br />
<br />
Alright, I got sick of those boards, and will just summarize the other classes :)<br />
<br />
DRUIDS<br />
think they need better nukes and better heals<br />
<br />
RANGERS<br />
want more dps and to be a better tank<br />
<br />
PALADINS<br />
well, we know that there are much more numerous and vocal then we are.  Similar issues.  Most of them suggest ideas that would only work for them, not for us.<br />
<br />
SHAMANS<br />
Had to leave the board to fast, I was drowning in the tears about their healing skills.<br />
<br />
CHANTERS<br />
Want a higher mes and better debuffs<br />
<br />
BEASTLORDS<br />
want better slows, better hastes, better heals, and better dps.<br />
<br />
WARRIORS<br />
heavy oily smiles here.  A few comments that they are not THAT good now to avoid others to get balanced.  Some want to solo.<br />
<br />
<br />
MAGES AND WIZARDS<br />
know how good their dps is, and are quiet.<br />
<br />
NECROS<br />
know they are God.  All they want is to have more undead than live mobs.<br />
<br />
BARDS<br />
they do not whine at all, they must be on drugs :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there you have it.  The whole game is broken.  Classes with well established and present raid and group roles complain to become more God-like.  They make 10 page threads.  Classes bash any other class perceived as stepping opn their toes.  Classes lie to others, to make them appear less powerful to avoid others to get balanced.<br />
<br />
I do not blame the developers for not reading this shit.  If I were one, I would just try my best and not get influenced by boards.  Of course, that leads to the fact that they do not understand some classes' problems at all.  They cannot separate real issues from phoney or ridiculous ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well look at the classes that got some changes made to them recently<br />
<br />
1. Warriors<br />
2.  Monks<br />
3. Rogues<br />
4. Shamans<br />
5 Mages<br />
<br />
<br />
What did they all have in common?  They were able to agree on a common plan and present it along with evidence of what they need to soe.<br />
<br />
If we want to get some changes first we need to agree on what those need to be and how they should be implemented.<br />
<br />
Then we need to present the solid evidence on why we need them and consolidate it either here or on SoE's board.<br />
<br />
Good luck trying to get us to agree though still have people so split on what to do and where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We don't need to agree if we're going to emulate them... we just need to ask for everything we could possibly want in one big thread.  That's what rogues and monks did in their recent threads - they made a list of everything they couldn't do already, and a list of everything they weren't the best at, eliminated a few things they've never been able to do at all, and posted it as a &quot;we need these:&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aside from the spells, weren't there mitigation and some other combat skill improvements in the Paladins' list?  I seem to recall something along those lines.<br />
<br />
If they end up making the chain hybrids as good at tanking as the knights are currently, they'll need to improve knight tanking to just shy of warriors or things will really be imbalanced.  We don't have a disc equivalent to Weaponshield, nor have they given knights a disc that improves our shield mitigation or something along the lines of the half Defensive many have suggested.  I don't know how many disciplines Berzerkers, Monks, and Rogues have thanks to the addition of the class and the melee upgrades.  They could make things more balanced if they corrected the innate mitigation gap, but I don't know that they would, with the stats on the high end SK gear.  They just seem to forget that not all knights are in uber guilds capable of getting them to that gear so they can close some of the gaps.  Even there, it'll be the fortunate few who have the guild resources to draw upon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think Inferna's right.  If we could find a list of issues that could be agreed upon and presented them in a united front, SoE would be more likely to listen.  It worked for the Warriors.  That planned sit-in really forced the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&gt;&gt;That planned sit-in really forced the issue.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Congratulations!  You are now a warrior.  If you think whiny annoying tactics like that work, go start one.<br />
<br />
I still have my dignity.  I won't join you on any bullshit sit-in.<br />
<br />
*edit*  You're fuggin level 53!   The balance issues that are being discussed don't even come close to affecting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This time last year, I was 15 or so levels lower.  This time next year, I may well be 65, grinding away on AA, trying to get tough enough to get some of that higher end content.  If you think that at 53 I haven't noticed the disparity between myself, warriors, and Paladins, you are sadly mistaken.  I've grouped a lot with both Warriors and Paladins in LDoN.  More often than not, I'm relegated to assisting the MA.  I have been the MA, rarely, but more often than not I'm assisting.  From what I've read, I know that it's a role I'll need to get used to as it'll be what I'll be doing. <br />
<br />
The Warriors had genuine issues, issues that even we agreed were problems.  They got SoE's attention and SoE handed them the prize.<br />
<br />
Call it whining if you want, but you cannot deny, it got them what they were asking for and then some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The truth of it is, balance shifts at different points of the game.  At some points we're stronger relative to other classes, at some points we're weaker.<br />
<br />
And if you're always relegated to assisting equally geared paladins, you need to find more intelligent people to group with.<br />
<br />
In standard exp groups, we're all pretty much interchangable as tanks, perhaps with a slight edge to paladins over the other 2 classes due to stuns, assuming equivalent gear.  Standard exp groups isn't where the problems lie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just thought I'd point a few things out..<br />
<br />
Necros would like to see the same crit dot progression available to DD's. In most xp groups dots are simply out of the picture for DPS as the mobs die too quickly. That is really the biggest beef - though dot stacking issues with 4+ nec on a raid is a problem as well.<br />
<br />
Right now crit dot chance is 9% for an obscene amount of AA(30), with no progression. I believe DD aa puts them close to 20% with a 7% chance for 12aa. Simply put, moronic.<br />
<br />
The resist modifier on the newer spells is pretty brutal too. -30 on horror and -50 on blood of thule sucks, considering a partial resist of a nuke is at least SOME damage whereas there are no partial resists on dots. Horror also has a 30 sec or so recast time. The necro debuff line simply does not land on mobs and doesn't lower MR on mobs, a fix for this I'd like to see would be necro debuff landing and debuffing MR, then we could actually charm mobs again! :P</div></div><hr />

That's because you fucking suck. Face it. I am so sick of seeing SK's like you. Even now at 64 there is not one damn warrior who can hold agro, pull and tank as well as me (ok so they tank better but what chanter would want to get hit half the time over picking an sk as tank). So I am not in the high end game either, I am not even keyed for anything that would put me into the class of high end. In fact, SK's rule. I get so many compliments and &quot;please stay, don't leave even though we've been here 6 hours&quot; from my groups it's embarrassing. I've had enchanters and shamans that were scared to tash and slow mobs before entering camp due to previous encounters with shitty sk's and warriors like you, I have to sit down and explain to them that they won't even get touched if they have a resist.<br />
<br />
Now, I of course cannot speak for SK's at the level Brael and others play at but I can sure as hell say if you can't tank, pull and hold agro better than any other class in this game at your level, you sir, are pathetic.<br />

<br />
Grulknar, considering that for most of the last 4 years, I've spent most of my time soloing, I haven't had a lot of instruction on how to be a proper SK.  I can tank.  I know what I'm doing when there's a tashed and slowed mob.  All I'm saying is this.  In MMC adventures, where I as the SK should be able to deal a fair bit of damage and have a bit of a handle on pulling as well.  It's the paladin who ends up pulling if he has Pacify and if not, the cleric pacifies and lets whoever is pulling pull.  <br />
<br />
Now, when I say proper SK, I have never really used FD.  Soloing it was a do or die kind of thing.  I did, sorta, get a good grasp on fear kiting, but found that add management could be a problem if I picked the wrong spot.  I guess I'll have to trust your ability to click on links and check the magelo profile.  The profile I'm using most these days, though, isn't the Main profile.  You'll want to look at 1h blunt.  Granted, I'm Bazaar equipped, but at least I know where to ask for upgrade advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol. Where does gear come into question. You could be Yantis' butt buddy for all I care but if you don't know how to pull or chain cast CD you're a frickin moron and all the equipment in the world won't save you from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've found that Dooming Darkness gets the mob's attention quite well.  At least, it gets the attention of stuff in Takish'Hiz.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall reading here that the hate on CD was nerfed, which was why you have to chain cast it to get a mob's attention.  I'm sorry, I'd just as soon Dooming and Boil Blood it, after I get in a mob's face and make it respect that I'm ripping it a new orrifice.<br />
<br />
I can pull.  I don't have a lot of experience with pull splitting with FD, though.  I can even use our Undead lull to ghetto pacify the undead mobs in MMC to make single pulls easier.  I know that single pulls under those conditions are best done by proximity aggro or by getting the mob's attention with a tap or 2 that don't do damage.  I just don't do a lot of pulling, since I'm usually MA or doing the DPS thing.  More often than not, I'm doing the DPS thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at your gear and listening to your halfassed theories about aggro, it is my sad duty to inform you that you aren't really &quot;doing the DPS thing&quot;. Using Clinging Darkness is something that shouldn't be dismissed so casually by a SK with a small mana pool like yours...at 1/6 the mana cost of Dooming Darkness that is a big part of why it is so useful.<br />
<br />
Boil Blood can be a huge waste of mana in groups also...the spell lasts over 2 minutes, doing only 240 damage a minute for 150 mana...mobs die alot faster than that.<br />
<br />
You can use your mana more wisely than you are right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol. It wasn't nerfed, that just the Pallies chain stunning the mobs, making you actually do more than cast 1 or 2. I pull with Festering because it is a decent snare with good agro generation. The snare component allows me to hit the mob 1-3 times with a CD before the mob makes it to camp. I watch for the chanter/shammy casting tash/slow on the mob so I can have a CD land right after their tash/slow lands. If I have enough time before engaging I'll smack it with a spear or Zev's bite (casters love that ya know) and then go to town with melee. <br />
<br />
Never hit taunt. Ever. Taunt is for mez breaking and saving the cleric/chanter when the warrior realizes he sucks at keeping agro still. Agro is all about &quot;building&quot; it up. If you hit taunt you simply screw yourself by putting yourself a mere 1 point above the highest person on the hate list. If you don't hit taunt you should be 1000 frickin points above anyone else on the hate list when everyone engages.<br />
<br />
Of course it is a little different say when you are tagging off a monk who is pulling. Same scenario, move out in front of the group a bit to get some range for when the mob comes and smack it with a festering, then add as many CD's as you can before the mob gets near. The group plays a large factor here as well because if they assist before you call it, it just plain screws up the hate list and makes things difficult. The only other person who should be casting on it at this time is the slower. <br />
<br />
Something I have found works just frickin great. I have been doing groups without clerics sometimes and find that Paladins are my new best friends. When I pull I tag with a darkness and bring to camp. The Palading then smashes it with a max stun so the mob stands there in front of the group for a few seconds, giving me the time to cast lots and lots of CD's on it while the chanter tash's and slows. This totally ensures the mob is slowed before it comes into tanking range. Makes it very easy for the shaman/druid healer :D I know they heal very well but sometimes in extended groups, buffs fall and without a symbol or so, I can go down quick on an unslowed mob. Especially the ones who go like &quot;525, 450, 450, 525... haha Grulknar, that's one round, wait till next round in .5 seconds&quot;!!<br />
<br />
I'm serious, so many times I have told the group &quot;Ok, slow this fcker on Incoming&quot; and they scream &quot;omg no way are you trying to get us all killed&quot;? Obviously... they have been grouping with the wrong sk's. Have faith in the skills you're given. At our stage in the game they are King.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ive pretty much given up on festering in most xp situations for two reasons. First off, I hate waiting for the mob to wander over to camp. Typically, I can get one CD off then another as the mob starts to melee me which is enough aggro to keep it on me during debuff/slowing. Secondly, things never run away anymore so snaring is not needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There could be 100 suggestions of improvements.  Then 5 misc classes chime in saying no changes are needed.  Who is gonna get listened to?  What is the path of least resistance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">aye, but they will not read this board here.  You know that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Now ... back on subject<br />
<br />
What we really need to do is decide what we *need* and what we *want*<br />
<br />
Personally, the only real thing I see as the problem is out tankability in GoD, and how close some of the chain classes come to tanking as well as us. Infact, because of things like weaponshield, in some cases they are better. I myself don't overly like the idea of giving defensive disc version for SKs and paladins, just because that would make us a bit more &quot;warrior-like.&quot; u on the other hand the only think I can think of to help would be to give Sks and paladins a version of weaponshield. Maybe something intersting like for SKs each riposte is a lifetap (like the leechcurse disc) and for paladins each riposte procs a stun (or something equally fitting in a roleplaying sense, maybe not these specific ideas per say... I could see how they could get to be overpowering if not done right).<br />
<br />
Here a question though:<br />
I wonder how much our tankability would improve if we had a slow spell that stacked with enchanter and shaman slows, but also gave a group recourse that was haste, which would stack with all other forms of haste (kind of like the berzerker disc that gives group haste and ATK) it wouldn't be anything to large else it would be way too overpowerful, but just enough to be extra midigation and to help other melees in the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm fully willing to admit that these are bad ideas/suggestions but it's a start...<br />
<br />
<br />
However, with most of the things I've read on this board about &quot;knight tanking being where it should be&quot; it seems our only real solutions are 1) they nerf some of the GoD content to make our jobs easier, or B) the high end gear at the end of GoD is so nice that we will be &quot;overgeared&quot; enough to tank like we should. The downside to the second one, is that in single group trails we really shouldn't *have * to be overgeared for them, seeing as you have to do them to get overgear, it would be too circlular IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goinertia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You see Androsulach, what Dkhar is telling you, is that it's the person playing a 65'ish sk who's already WASTED parts of their lives playing a useless class that has the problem. At 53 however, you're okay! happy! I think that however, for a person who hasnt yet already foolishly spent time paying money a month to play a class that's picked easily over it's halves, among other things, well, that their opinion matters a lot. :D <br />

I've read elsewhere, that at 65, the shadowknight has not much else going for him in terms of really useful utility besides zbyte, a level 62 spell. So invariably, at 53, sk's are pretty fuckin useless. :D The problem with sk's extends beyond GoD encounters. gear and AA are not what I want to have to get to tank efficiently. Not that we dont, it's just that the other tanks are so much more efficient, without that gear and said aa. &gt;&lt;<br />
What little utility I have is compensated, and THEN some, by other classes. I still FD pull, only because I'm not yet in the stage of the game where monks and bards have become what that job desires most. But that almost true fact that I WILL be playing then is upsetting, because apparently, the sk is the most useless class in the game. Um, it's not a lot of pretty stuff too look forward too. :D I love the shadowknight class, despite it's apparent uselessness. I wont play any other. and I dont want to pay money a month, to play a class deemed useless. Maybe we all can agree.<br />
<br />
I couldnt ask for more aggro myself. so I'd change nothing in that department. that voice stuff is a complete waste of time. warriors even at my level got aggro down alright, so they dont particularly need it. I suppose having someone to cast it on would be nice. It's certainly not taking up one of my buff slots, sk aggro is fine enough as it is.  It looks nice in the spell book, though. <br />
<br />
For pulling, I'm completely down with making FD hotkeyed. By all means, make it an AA. I'll spend the needed points. it's usefulness would be incredible. It's not a horrible thing to ask for. &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
As far as damage mitigation goes, warrios should certainly be able to take hits better. Pally's stuns, while incredibly useful in almost all encounters, are occasionally still situational. And those encounters that are immune to stun effects, are better tanked by an sk. So I do still have some credit for existing. yay! But those encounters are more rare than I'd like, and some sk ability to subtract that kind of incoming damage, wheather in spell or disc form should be thought about. Warriors get the mitigation bonus, because they do. they should I suppose. Though the disc's alone are incredibly useful, mitigatin bonus or no. The shadowknight Discipline's are definately scheduled for a review. <br />
<br />
Utility? at my level, there are enough buffs slots free in xp groups to constitute what utility I have, as a curtiousy. Those torrent spells are worth casting, at the moment. MC - love it. I definately look forward to the lich spells; if not for utility, for sheer awesomeness. Which is probably, the only real thing sk's have going for them. I'd like to see our pet have some use. Kobantik is hardly worth the bone chip I need to cast him. In fact, a lot of my spell book is collecting dust. Revisions in that area, are also something someone should slap down on a to do list. <br />
<br />
It's sort of exciting really. All this talk about revamping parts of the sk class. Sooner or later, maybe, we might be experiencing a very good time for the shadowknight.<br />
<br />
So, why the sk class will not be balanced... probably, because soe has dug a hole of suck too deep to possibly bring us out of. The amount of revision would almost constitute a new expansion, or, a really big ass patch. It's still fun to talk about it though right? I know I enjoy it.<br />

<br />
If they made it like the Aura line of spells (uses only damage to produce a recourse effect) I can see this working. Other than that, it isn't going to happen. Haste stacking would be cool, or even self haste from it would be nice.</div></div><hr />

What did they all have in common?  They were able to agree on a common plan and present it along with evidence of what they need to soe. <br />
<br />
I agree w/ Inferna but I'd also say that those classes, while perhaps whining, don't go to SOE with an attitude of &quot;you don't understand us, you have no vision for us, your understanding of us is wrong&quot;  Even if that is true, would you listen to us if you were SOE?<br />
<br />
We'll get more accomplished if with our dealings with SOE we drop the chip on our collective shoulder, unite and provide rational ideas that are within our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, the questions then are, &quot;When do things get out of balance?&quot; and &quot;What causes the imbalance?&quot;  Once we have those answers, we can find solutions to present to SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">OK. Here's my list of things I think SK's need. Not a huge increase in one area or all but a small increase in each category would make the SK a more solid class all around.<br />
<br />
1. Voice and Terror Line - Waste of a buff slot, there are so many options for tank classes to increase hate now these spells are useless.<br />
<br />
2. Pet Line - Waste of a bone chip. our pet needs to be of a higher level.<br />
<br />
3. Spear Line - Needs more -resists, there is no mob post 64 that spears will land on. I'm sure there are some but they are few and far between. Our mainstay spell damage is done with these spears, they should have a decent chance to land.<br />
<br />
4. Pulling - Worst of the best, need hotkey FD. <br />
<br />
5. DPS - Higher ATT caps, weapons more suited to our class.<br />
<br />
6. Tanking - Higher AC caps, some form of mitigation or avoidance needed.<br />
<br />
7. Lich Line - I think our recourse effects should scale with levels and be worth the buff slot they take up so groupmates do not get annoyed and click off your pitiful 15str 15sta recourse buff, which by the way at level 65 most people have these 2 stats maxed. All recourse effects should get a sizeable increase as you level or an AA to double their effect.<br />

Im VT keyed Emp keyed however after a guild break up ive gone to a lower end guild. I have sat lfg for hours at a time days on end for just BoT, Tactics or PoV groups.The only offers for pickup groups I really ever get are ldon groups. Im not a fan of doing the same zone over and over to get one peice of armor that you then need to continue ldon to put augs on them. Before the class balance I was spammed with tells for groups. I was very happy playing my Sk until the class balance now mostly I play alts. The things I would like to see, group spells that go into the bard song window due to there short duration. In groups I no longer cast group spells because theres always somone complaining im taking up a buff spot. A pet thats not green to me and useless other than pet pulling. Higher damage on the spear line. A dark that a necro cant override since its my main aggro spell. I really want a defensive disc but I do not see it happening. I have given up on lfg so I use my Sk for farming now and pull him out for guild raids. I pray every patch Soe gives us any type of upgrade but I truely believe we are on the backshelf until people stop logging on there knights.</div></div><hr />

I will definately agree on increasing the damage on our DD's. and giving them more of a chance to land more often.<br />

I've said before that a hotkeyed FD would be incredible. especially at high end points of the game. <br />

making a useful pet would help increase our overdps, a role we're supposed to be playing, and make a use for getting the spell. Otherwise, the line is useless. I had a friend joke around with me, saying, &quot; if I need something to take an HT, I'll just use the sk.&quot;<br />

You obviously do not read. The consensus has been that the effects of high end SK's being dubbed &quot;useless&quot; has trickled down into the 50's group range and affected our ability to get invited to groups. People who do not read further than &quot;Sk's got nerfed, they suck&quot;, quite like you, do not come to the understanding that it is for the most part, affecting only the high end sk's in a few trials. You are being part of the problem, like I said in my last post &quot;There are of course, the idjits who train each thread but this is SK.org afterall.&quot;, which has perfectly described you.<br />
<br />
We need to get the Shadowknight name back back into the spotlight. By giving small upgrades in needed spots we can achieve this. Sure, if we upgrade the high end knights it will affect the lower end knights. But if you have been around some good players (not high end) you will realize that we are not borderline overpowered, just merely better in some instances. And in most cases we are outdone by the class meant specifically for a task. We excel at initial snap agro and that is about it.</div></div><hr />

it's not an odd observation. When more or less the class became imbalanced may be important to note. Or, it may at least be fun.

Obvious, things like &quot;you're an idiot&quot; and omg, &quot;you fucking suck.&quot; have MUCH more weight than, &quot;before GoD we were fine.&quot; The problem with sk's goes further than GoD. But in GoD, the problem is magnified. Warrios can get hate procs, +hp and mitigation long before they step foot in a GoD zone. Pallies BEST level's for stun mitigation are in the mid 50's, and even further on than that! Almost nothing in comparison is immune to stun effects then. I think the voice of the entire sk community will speak louder than the amount of sk's (NOT including yourself, I think.) that are having those problems with tanking and useful utility in GoD. Let's spread da love. dont hate, yo. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>larlagar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">As a level 65 SK what I see up lacking is DEFINITION.  Every other class has a role to file.  Except, and it pains me to say it, Pally's.  You need a Slower?  grab a Chanter or Shammy and in extreme cases a BST.  Need Buffs/Heals grab a Cleric or Druid.  Need DPS grab a Rogue, Ranger, Wizzy, Mage, Zerker, BST or Necro.  Need a mezzer?  grab a Chanter or Necro.  Need Root?  grab a Druid, Ranger, Mage.  Need body buffs?  Grab a Shammy or BST.  EVERY class fills a need except Knights (on raid level mobs)<br />
<br />
What do we offer a group?  A decent tank on XP mobs, an FD puller (if the SK has refined the skill) and a great agro magnet (again skill based here).  Can we buff?  Kinda, torrent line is too weak to take up a buff slot in most cases plus most groups don't understand them.  Not like I am ever asked, &quot;Hey Lar, when ya gonna cast Fatigue/Hate, etc..&quot;.  Our self buffs you ask?  well, weaker then Brells and hard as hell to get.  Few guild's gonna give up a Rune so an SK can get his level 65 spells.  That leaves the BAZ for our spells.  $39k for CoL?  Fuk you!<br />
<br />
I would love to get some sort of Tanking boost, or DPS boost, or Group Buffs.  I am not asking for all, just define a role for me.  If SOE wants me to be DPS, 2nd tank, Puller, or Buffer fine just give me the tools to fill the role.  I would love to be able to Cloak the Group and Lich the Group.  Also if RANGERS can get weaponshield why can't we get some sort or mitigation?  We should be able to tank a Raid mob, albiet harder than a Warrior.  Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Summary<br />
Problems: <br />
1) Tankability: needs boost in GoD post Ikkinz/KT<br />
2) sustained DPS is weak including spell damage<br />
3) Hate needs boost<br />
4) taps/self-procs are out of touch with expansions<br />
5) SK utility needs boost<br />
<br />
Solutions:<br />
1) High-end tankability<br />
- Add a Pal/SK upgrade to Harmshield/Divine Aura at level 65 that reduces incoming damage spikes somehow and lasts a reasonable amount of time, which you can cast through<br />
- Mini-defensive (drops in GoD somewhere post KT/Ikkinz), 30% mitigation, reduces dps, decreases cast-haste. 3mins duration, 15 mins recycle OR no recycle, no duration - always useable as long as endurance<br />
- mini-evasive, same as defensive in regards to duration  and recycle, also reduces dps and cast haste<br />
- Dodge disc, Dodge +10000%, reduces mob resists and AC, Duration 2-3 ticks, 4050 recast time<br />
- up innate mitigation: can be AA or for all knights (akin to 5% warriors got, but not as high)<br />
- mitigation recourse: spell which would allow you to &quot;tap&quot; mitigation from mobs<br />
<br />
2) DPS<br />
- Examine SK/Pal skillcaps to adjust for a minor melee DPS advance...  Yeah, it can be an AA...  allow it up to 235 or 240 for offense and weaponskills (Paladins should stay at 80% of a warrior, Shadowknights should be at 110% of a warrior casting spells and non-tanking)<br />
- A resist modifier is needed on spears, they're low dps and equal to or less (depending on the mob/zone) in mana ratio than the damage only portion of lifetaps.<br />
<br />
3) Hate/Aggro<br />
- Our taunt spells could use a boost, nothing major as this isn't considered a serious balance issue but a slight upgrade is warranted nonetheless so our aggro can at least compare to Warriors again at the high end, maybe an aggro dot component on Terror lines and a much higher initial hate plus faster cast on the 1.5 cast time ones.  Plus an adjustment to the aggro modifiers on Knights to be equal to the one Warriors/Monks (and others?) have of 1.4 instead of .82 when it comes to melee aggro.  Another thing, BoC's shouldn't provide more aggro over time than Knight 1h weapons from Time, thats an itemization issue other than a class one though.<br />
-  Add a fear/53 effect to Terror line. (OR change terror line to become a beneficial spell that creates a fastcast, 18sec RUNE/1-shot high-end damage shield<br />
<br />
4) Taps/Heals<br />
- Self healing upgrades to be where they should be in comparison to other classes heals<br />
-  With GoD every class capable of healing themselves except SK's and Necros recieved a significant upgrade to compensate for the much much much higher DPS the new mobs would deal.  Due to the nature of lifetaps they're at their most balanced on moderate DPS mobs.  On low damage mobs they're too powerful and on high damage mobs they don't do enough.  The only way under the current system to upgrade SK healing is to upgrade our DPS as well which I'm judging from our AA's and spells recieved in GoD is not intended.  In order to bring our healing up to par we would have to gain literally hundreds of DPS in Lifetap upgrades which obviously isn't going to happen, what I propose for SK's/Nec's is to add for lack of a better term &quot;efficency modifiers&quot; to level 61+ lifetaps perhaps 15% to Level 61-63 taps and 30% to Level 64-65 taps.  What this would do is take the damage dealt from the tap and multiply that by the modifier to determine the healing amount.  To take my Level 65 lifetap (Touch of Innoruuk) for example it does 470 damage and I have 35% magic focus for it plus SCF3, lets say I roll 28% for the focus mod and get a critical nuke on this cast as well, it would do 1072 tap, under my suggestion it would do 1072 heal and 1394 heal, if the heal were to crit also (mind you this is rare, only 0.7% of all lifetaps do this with max AA's) on that roll it would have done 2788 heal.  At minimum value with no focus it would be 470 damage 611 heal.  This has the benefit of allowing Lifetaps to remain viable for both tapping classes in GoD and beyond.  Also, seperate from this issue when we offtank or even tank the damage our Lifetaps do is not much of a concern for us and we cast them for heals mainly, when you consider the dps of everyone else hitting the mob this gain of damage suddenly ends up being VERY minor while the heal remains weak because it does some low damage. <br />
- perhaps look at a way of allowing us to get some other self only heals as well on longer recycles (30 sec or something) that do no damage.<br />
- make heal component from taps/self-buffs 1.X times base damage as the base. perhaps via a new spell or AAs<br />
<br />
5) Utility<br />
- Aura of Hate: The recycle/duration on this should be the same, this will help with lower end desireability.  8 tick duration/recycle would work best; AE effect and moving to bard buff box for Aura of Hate; make it stack with FA AND ferocity<br />
-  AE effect and moving to bard buff box for Aura of Darkness<br />
- AE effect and variable mana cost for Zevfeer's Bite.  By variable I mean make Zev's require a minimum of 120 mana or so (it's 200 currently), then make it's recourse AE, then make an additional recourse where an additional amount of mana is taken from the SK for each person the effect hit.  If you're in a group of 6 people it would be 120 base, 100 for 5 people (besides yourself), so 200 total like now.  If you're in a raid of 72 people and it hit everyone it would be 120 base, plus 71 additional people besides yourself or 1540 mana.  Hefty yes but it keeps it from becoming unbalanced from insane mana ratios on the spell and you wouldn't usually be hitting that many people.<br />
 - our pets are too low level to proc lifetaps on mobs meaning damage shields shred them, they lack the hp to survive a single ae or riposte; The ability to trigger /shield from your pet; A level and hp increase for pets, leave overall DPS the same<br />
- More AC debuffs for us to hit mobs with, perhaps add a debuff component to Aura of Pain or upgrade the AC debuff on another AC tap line of spells, these have the potential to add ALOT of indirect DPS from having an SK along.<br />
<br />
Feel free to add to this etc. I think this has it all covered?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>shaneez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I wouldnt like to see a defensive that drops in GoD for Sk. The new 65 Sk spells most of us wont see. A class upgrade isnt really a class upgrade if it drops in places more than half of our class will never see. Everyone needs to remeber we need a balance that will make Sks desirable to high end guilds that are pre elemental. We have a bad reputation of being useless now so most guild going into time or elements will not open apps to Sk. Those already past time and GoD need to remeber this has created a trickle down effect for all Sks. One improvement I would like to see is a 20 second stun for those that have improved HT. Just think 3sks using Ht would give the raid 1 min to attack without taking dmg. Maybe 20 seconds a little high but its just a dream....</div></div><hr />
