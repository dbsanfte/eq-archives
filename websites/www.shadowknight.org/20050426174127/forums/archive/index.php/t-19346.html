I'm pritty well equiped 5-6k hp depending on buffs, 1500 -1600 ac depending on buffage. Blade wise I have the defiler and some 43/40 2hb staff, and over 3.5k in mana. If given the choice I prefer to solo, but getting a grp up isn't a problem. My brethern can you advise me as to the best path I can take to acheave this Green Myst ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look at the stickied walkthrough thread.<br />
<br />
Substitute 1-3 lvl 65's anywhere you find 1 group of 55's...<br />
<br />
Most of it is very soloable, even in mid-50's, so you should be fine.<br />
<br />
Oh, and knock off that King James bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mahb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hahaha so much for incharecter flavor huh ;)  np mi dark brother. Thx alot for the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phester Ingwound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a 55 SK on the Luclin server.  I have, almost entirely, solo'd or dual boxed my way to the point I'm at now.<br />
<br />
That is ... I need the mirror off Drussela.  That, unfortunately, I can't solo or dual box to.<br />
<br />
*Sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Greenish metal shard would also probably be nearly impossible to solo, though I suppose you might be able to two box it with a shaman bot... if you're very very good.<br />
<br />
The Glowing Cliff Golem is an easy duo with a shammy, every thing else was perfectly soloable mid-50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi, i'm a 65 Dark Elf Inny-worshipper, I have done nothing with any of my iksar factions except kill a few iksars (one of them being Alchemist Granika, so i'm pretty sure that getting faction is gonna suck), but I am looking to start my Greenmist quest, and was wondering which factions i'm going to need, and if you could list the easiest ways to get those factions, that would be superb. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wienaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GMS isnt that hard to solo at lvl 65, tho I'm not sure if you meant that or not...I have ally faction, and just pulled him to chardok b zone for kill.  Phester, I have a mirror that ive used once on Luclin, I have been told they can be used twice, send me a tell if you want and we will go try it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jabbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes it can be used twice- might wanna just make sure you both know exactly what needs be done when the time comes to do the hand ins.<br />
<br />
As far as solo'ing GMS, it's pretty easy even if you aren't Ally faction, provided you are lvl 65.  If you have ally faction (or a nice friend who does) you can simply pull the mob to the zone line of your choice and have at it.  Otherwise, it's simply a matter of popping up now and again and killing the PHs.</div></div><hr />
