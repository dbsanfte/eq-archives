<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've filled in CA, CS, ND, PE, PD, LR and am going to finish ID fairly soon. I was just thinking about what AA to buy after then, it gives me something to look forward to. What came to mind for me was either filling out my SA or HT aa. Any opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">scf3, horse, sa3, not necessarily in that order</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krastus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And ToL1<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit* I know you have ToL, but this is for those looking for AA advice from your post title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Halbeos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where do PD and PP fall after defensive aa... and how much of an increase can you expect with max PD.<br />
<br />
<br />
Halbeos 65 shaman<br />
Kannable 65 shadowknight<br />
Halenon 65 Ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moongarm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PD and PP are both pretty crummy IMO.  I wouldn't worry about maxing either of those untill after the majority of defensive and offensive AA's.<br />
<br />
I'd look towards maxing out SCF, ToL, MC 1 is a good buy, CF1 is decent, SA, then then KA and SoTK.  Horse is handy and fun as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest looking at ToL3 and not just ToL1.  While you might think that an exceptional heal isn' t all that great, stack it with SCF 3 and SA 3 with a proccing weapon and see the results :D Nothing like having 400-500 pt life tap proc's off your weapons with Shroud of Chaos going ( crit blast + exceptional heal ) or in my case ... add that proc to a 100 pt Invigorate proc x 2 for ToL 3 = 200 pt proc's as well ... I proc hp so often in some fights ( where I am not tanking but taking reposite damage once in a while or some minor dot damage ) I require little or no healing.  Not to mention the occasional 2000+ hp lifetaps are pretty damn sweet too.<br />
<br />
PD is also a ' MUST HAVE ' ... Hp is Hp and its nothing to sneeze at.  All of your HP aa's should be right up there in order of importance.  Planar Power on the other hand is nice but not all that necessary.  I have PP 2 done and at 290 stats compared to 305 stats ... very little benefit from it.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest these are the primary:<br />
<br />
CA 3 / CS 3 / ID 5 / LR 5 / ND 3 / PE 1 / PD 3 <br />
<br />
Secondary:<br />
<br />
Unholy Steed / IHT / SA 3 / ToL 3 / SCF 3 / UT 3<br />
<br />
These aa's would put you as &quot; Tank first, DPS second &quot; .... knocking out all of your HP / Defensive aa's first then working on your damage enhancement aa's second.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i went scf, ToL and SA...<br />
also got channeling focus.  I dont know the exact numbers on how often it acutally helps (15% by the aa window) but it seems to help a lot.<br />
<br />
oh ya and horse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Horse actually has a couple uses beyond travel so its worthwhile earlier than you would think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khorguul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So here's my question, I bought weapon affinity 1 and Soul abrasion... Yes I know.. I should have bought CA3 or CS3 with it after the next point that I earned but... couldn't resist it.<br />
<br />
My thinking was that soul abrasion does 75pt's extra (per casters realm at lvl 1, then lvl 2 100 then lvl 3 150... NOT true Grrr ) Only have about 38 aa now.<br />
<br />
Sooooo… ummm How much does the 3 lvls of Soul abrasion add? <br />
<br />
Lvl one has added 32 points to Shroud of chaos.<br />
<br />
I know that the crits and crit heals will be really nice in a while but it’s going to be some time before that happens.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">level 1: 1.5xdam (SoC = 97)<br />
level 2: 2.0xdam (SoC = 130)<br />
level 3: 3.0xdam (SoC = 195)<br />
<br />
One of the few that actually scales up with points spent.  Bonus from level 3 is the same per point as levels 1 + 2.  The numbers you list from caster's realm are true of SoDeath (but its not &quot;add&quot;, thats the damage it does with those levels).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Brael is most likely referring to aggro-kiting solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horse to SSra, to VT, to NToV owns<br />
will still use it if I was spending a late night tradeskilling in PoK/SH and haveto get to time fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">level 1: 1.5xdam (SoC = 97) <br />

level 3: 3.0xdam (SoC = 195) <br />
<br />
Level 3 will make Shroud of Chaos proc for 195 pts each time.  <br />
<br />
w/ SCF 3 ... you will score crits on this for 290 pts<br />
w/ ToL 3 ... you will score exceptional heals on this<br />
<br />
on rare occasions you can proc a crit hit and an exceptional heal ... thus increasing your max crit ( 290 ) to a ( 580 ) pt lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Now, according to what the AA description is ... Weapon Affinity does NOT effect Shroud of Chaos .... but hell .. you never know what SoE's done so oh well.<br />
<br />
WA is supposedly only supposed to increase the proc rate on weapons with their own &quot; proc &quot; ...  So,  buyer beware.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok.... so same question for me... here's my current aa's... max'ed out defensive aa's already... and the lifetap aa's...<br />
<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Combat Fury 1<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Soul Abrasion 3<br />
Physical Enhancement<br />
Improved Harm Touch<br />
Planar Power 5<br />
Planar Durability 3<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Innate Defense 5<br />
Theft of Life 3<br />
Unholy Touch 2<br />
<br />
The question is what to get next?  Here's the main options...<br />
<br />
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery 1<br />
Unholy Steed<br />
2h Bash<br />
Unholy Touch 3<br />
Advanced Innate Run Speed 1<br />
Intense Hatred 1<br />

Knight's Advantage 1<br />
Speed of the Knight 1<br />
Pet Hold<br />
Mental Clarity 1<br />
Channeling Focus 1<br />
<br />
I don't list any of the GoD bash aa's since I'd get 2h bash before those.  I don't list any of the GoD pet stuff since I'd get pet hold before those, presumably.  Oh yeah, I play on a pvp server. :)<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My god man you need yourself a horse! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Got a white chain bridle already... is unholy steed really that much better?<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">instant click for those times you need to get away is nice then again the only two horses i have are my unholy stead and my wifes slowest drog and my clerics slowest drog heh so neither of the other two help very much for pvp even if they were instant :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bolas:  Pet hold is REALLY nice, I didn't get it until like 100'ish aa's, but I find it's really nice to have and can be useful at times too.  I find one can never have to much mana, so I like my MC3, even if it wasn't the &quot;best&quot; points I have ever spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Polite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pretty much the inventory instant click is the big difference which I think makes it well worth it for pvp reasons and don't forget you can sell horses back to the horse merchant for about 3 quarters of what it cost you. Besides what self respecting SK rides a white horse! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I had white horse when everyone else had black to stand out in the crowd.  White horse + red armor was nice... but now my armor is grey/black, then a black horse makes more sense.<br />
<br />
Here's the order of aa's that I'm leaning towards:<br />
<br />
New Tanaan Crafting 1<br />
Unholy Steed<br />
2h Bash<br />
Swift Journey 1<br />
Unholy Touch 3<br />
Weapon Affinity 1<br />
Mental Clarity 1<br />
Intense Hatred 1<br />
Swift Journey 2<br />
Pet Hold<br />
New Tanaan Crafting Mastery 2-6<br />
Knight's Advantage 1<br />
Speed of the Knight 1-3<br />
Knight's Advantage 2-3<br />
Combat Fury 2-3<br />
Weapon Affinity 2-5<br />
Critical Affliction 1-3<br />
Double Riposte 1<br />
Fury of the Ages 1-3<br />
Immobilizing Bash 1<br />
Vicious Smash 1<br />
Innate Metabolism 1-3<br />
Intense Hatred 2<br />
Persistent Casting 1<br />
Mental Clarity 2-3<br />
Natural Healing 1-3<br />
Body &amp; Mind Rejuevenation<br />
Channeling Focus 1-3<br />
Intense Hatred 3-5<br />
Immobilizing Bash 2-3<br />
Vicious Smash 2-5<br />
Death's Fury 1<br />
Pet Affinity<br />
Death's Fury 2-5<br />
<br />
Or have I planned this out WAY too far?<br />
<br />
