They pushed the 7/8 patch back a week for more testing and yet, they have to immediately change items in the new VP the day after it goes live?  This does not bode well for OoW if it's tested as thoroughly as the revamped VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know, that reminds me a lot of the old school patch messages.  Is that good or bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmh.. the first thought I had with that patch message was: Might the Guardian Robe still drop? Anyone had any luck at all with that drop since the revamp?<br />
I'm still killing the Gargoyle Guardians in Skyshrine since they drop all other guardian pieces stil.. No drop so far tho. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would I want to change my Shainai's nighty to a tunic graphic?  The only reason I beat up a little girl and stole her nighty so I could look like a necro... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamiken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that is why I went and killed the guy in katta instead.....course I also had to beat up shainai too, but that was more for pleasure then for the robe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oogoog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So does the change in PD mean that SKs will get the full 1.5% hp for this AA now?  I was messing with my magelo to see how many hps I could expect from these AAs.  I have full ND3 and PE, but have been reluctant to consider PD because magelo showed it as about 55 hp per level of PD.  So for 9 AAs, I would get about 165 hp.  Seemed pretty pricey to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Leaf, you can finally ditch that VP Robe for a vest!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yea, like he'll do that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For any RED server players out their, they stealth made PoK and PoT pvp enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skaarx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe yep, was pure carnage when i logged on =) It was almost like in those movies where a virus transforms all people into zombies. I stood there and in front of me a peck and a ogre slaughtered some High elf female. It was beautiful  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You should check out Bazaar then on your local PVP server.. perhaps you can slaughter all these lvl 1 traders for some nice lewtz~ :D</div></div><hr />
