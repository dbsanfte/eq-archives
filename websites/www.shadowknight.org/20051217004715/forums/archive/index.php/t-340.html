<br />
I figured i would post this, not to slander, but to inform those of us with a decent respect for other players in the game as to not become suckered or to not become ripped off.  I am hoping that others will post names and servers of people who have ripped them off... not because they conned you into buying a MOSS for 15k, but for someone you had tried to help and they in turn bent you over like a wood elf... here goes my rant :mad: <br />
<br />
 I was in EC selling when my violator (couldn't think of anything better to call him/her) had talked me into a story of how she (Leoini) wanted my item, but had to log onto her main (Razeal) in order to pay me... since i'm ranting, you can probably guess the rest of the story... me trying and knowing how it is not to have someone most of the time to help with transfers said sure, i can do that... I give her the item she asked for in expectations of her main logging on.... 5 mins.... 10 mins.... 60 mins (still selling btw) before I petition to a GM in hopes that they could help.... wrong... since... quote... the arrangement of payment had been consented to by (me) there was nothing they could do... oh well, out 900pp... <br />
<br />
I still have both of their names on a hotkey listed as thieves in hopes that I can at least give them hell about it, possibly even stalk them to the point where they don't ever try it again.  Since I play a good 6-10 hours a day between work (I love my job) and home, I will soon enough find them to inform the zone they may happen to be in.<br />
<br />
I know this is a long rant, but I felt I needed to vent and help others not to become ripped off... since, not everyone in the EQ realm handles there business deals like some two-bit hustler robbing and stealing every chance they get... I know some people would not agree with me posting names... oh well... maybe if a couple of more people post names of scam artists of the sort then people would think twice... I've heard sseveral horror stories while I was waiting on a GM to answer my petition... people unaware that only certain types of armor could not be dyed (ie Dark Forge)... or those that held an item of supposed equal value for a person trying to see what an Enameled Black chestplate looked like on them... <br />
<br />
I know that not everyone would put that much trust in someone to allow a transfer of items and pay them 50pp for their time, but there are many players like myself that believe &quot;do on to others as you would have them do on to you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hope this rant saves someone from losing a nice piece of equiptment whether they are selling or trying to get a transfer.<br />
<br />
Till then.... every 5-15 mins on the E'CI server you can guarantee that I will be hitting that hotkey on page 4, key #8 marked thieves in hope that I can go and find the zone they are in and just irritate them the way they have me... like the ogre Shadow Knight I am... deep inside:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
or if it is real, is it really them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess you're right, all i can hope ios to catch the person that i was dealing with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frued</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very unfortunate. Amazing that this scam still works but there is one born every minute.<br />
<br />
 I suggest you post this same thread on E'ci server board where it will do more good and possibly even help you retrive your item or plat.<br />
<br />
 As was mentioned the name given to you as their main is probably wrong since they knew all they wanted was to rip you off.</div></div><hr />

Think of it as a (relatively) cheap lesson in scoundrel handling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayelin</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree nephtu. ive heard of peeps losing 40k items to this scam. youre lucky compared to others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zobek</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone tells me they need to log in their main to get the cash, I tell them &quot;Come to me with the character that has the cash, and I'll give the item to that character.  You will need to find your own way of getting the item you want onto your alt.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the 5 times I have said to do this (I don't sell too much), 4 people have had no problem with it as they understand my reasoning behind the request.   The 1 time of the 5, the other person called me something impolite, so I issued a /report and they got a warning.  The GMs said this person had been harassing people previous to me. <br />
<br />
Most people that have the cash on &quot;another character&quot; will be in a guild or have people they trust that can help them get the item they bought to the character they bought it for.<br />
<br />
I may be a bit paranoid in this way, but I know there are a bunch of selfish jerks out there intent on ripping me off if I give them a chance.  I do my best to not get ripped off, yet treat everyone fair.<br />
<br />
I've had total strangers walk up and give me a bag of equipment to give to an alt.  One guy gave me a set of velium bd jewelry and a few armor pieces to trans for him.  I was very tempted to keep it, but this is only a game, right?  He gave me 300 plat for not ripping him off.<br />
<br />
I do my best to help my fellow players, which is also why I post alot here.  I know that if I do what I can to help all of you, then when I need it, you will be more inclined to do the same for me.  And this is what has happened since I've been a member of this forum.  <br />
<br />
If you are on Cazic-Thule and need help, just send me a tell and I'll try to help you if I can.<br />
<br />
Kaishodan, I am sorry this happened to you and I wish you the best of luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaotik Von'Damon</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey man Im sorry to hear that happened to you. Well Kais &amp; I have both been in EC selling for a few days, and since we are shadowknights we talked off &amp; on. Anyway folks... I guess the only way to avoid this scam is to not give the item before payment. What I do is hold their cash until they pop the alt toon, to receive the item, therefore I have both the pp and my item.<br />
But sometimes you forget that some of these &quot;nice&quot; players on EQ are really RL scum and will rip you off quick. So basically trust no one, Ive even heard of this happening (on a thread on the od forums) to someone in his own guild. <br />
<br />
Kaisho.. if I see this person in any zone, Ill let ya know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krazix</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the person is anon, unguilded , low lvl ect.. I don't trust them.<br />
<br />
If the person is high lvl, guilded and not known to be an ass, I'll trust them with something thats no more than 500p.<br />
<br />
If the persons my friend, i trust them (although I did lose 1 friend over a trak tooth :( )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">camal</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a real horror story for yall. Something to be careful about.  I was in the arrangement of making a deal for all my armour.  I had 3 bags and loaded them all up.  I was selling all my armour for 50kpp. Not an unusual amount with prices of horse and all.  After I loaded all my amrour in bags they asked to see 2 items that were in my armour to see if htey needed them or not. I had no problem with this as the price was going to be the same and I keep what they didn't want.  I showed them the peices and they looked at it.  then cancelled.  Then they gave the magic word...&quot;OK let's do the deal.&quot; So me bneing the young unfortunate person I was I put all three bags in trade window with the 2 items.  They immediately cnacelled and because of lack of space in my main inv, two bags dropped which they got immediately because they were waiting for it.  I lost all my armour and weapons and was left with only my jewelry.  Since then I put only 2 itmes at a time in trade window and will only put one bag of itmes in trade window to avoid this. and also They must put the money in trade window first before I even put any items there.  In the end I looked back and thought about hopw this guy looked so innocent and how he was playing off the buy so well. I never ever thought about what he was up to.  Imagine how many people fall victim to this.  Sine then I have gained all that back and even upgraded many itmes : ) but will never forget that moment and how pissed I was.</div></div><hr />
