<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedi2677</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 53 Iksar SK on Vallon Zek, and I have been looking for a place to sneak in kills without having to mess with organizing a bunch of people, and without having to travel to odd and out of the way places.<br />
<br />
So first I tried the Mons Letalis thing, Fear kiting stonegrabbers and the like. That was fine enough if you use the area around the corner from the Grey zoneline, BUT it has serious drawbacks: 1) Those bastards hit hard, and resist frequently 2) Pathing is inconsistent, you can be safe over on the side to the right as you look at the zone cave entrance, but one fasle move, one fear headed the wrong way, and you are toast 3) Mons Letalis plain sucks to get around, and it's a 3 full zone run from the Nexus. It's hard to find the entrances and exits, and the terrain ensures you damage from falling if you don't have levitate, safefall, or a mount <br />
So this is not what I am looking for....<br />
Butcherblock dwarves are getting light blue......Gunthak and Yak zones are okay, but too far away for my taste, I hate havin to run out of there when nobody will port my Scaley ass<br />
<br />
SOOOOOOOooooo.....how about Velk's Lab in the Great Divide? It's only one zone from PoK. Is it possible to FD pull there right next to zone? Is this possible? Has anyone tried it? Is there an XP bonus there?<br />
Any other suggestions???? Please help thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless you can kill them fast, velks spiders are not that good of xp.  I would suggest the Chardok entrance area - you can fearkite well using the short fear, and with KEI you can pretty much go nonstop.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest Cobalt Scar but it is a little out of the way unless you can get a port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Putrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Initiates in Gunthak or back of armory in Dulak are good places to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolff-Kishner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LGuk should still be good xp at that level.  You should be able to lay waste to the undead near the safe hall.  Other place I could think of would be BnB room in SolB.  I prefer going to old world zones to solo because the mobs usually hit for less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your gear is up to speed, try the nobles in Highkeep, Cyndrea in Feerot, Hole Entrance, Rockhoppers in DSP, The Plateau in Scarlet Dessert, or you might try the shrine bruiser camp in Nadox by the TM zone.<br />
<br />
All are easy fear kites.  Nadox, the Hole, and Scarlet Dessert are the worst to reach.<br />
<br />
I agree with Yuggoth, you need to mass kill spiders in Velks for good exp.  So you need a good weapon and armor, and be 56ish+, that would get it done fast enough to make it worthwhile I think.</div></div><hr />
