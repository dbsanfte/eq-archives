<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hya !<br />
I remeber reading an unclear post about a quest in neriak that was supposed to reward u with a nice ring: <br />
5AC 6STR, 6DEX 45HP, 35 Mana, 6SVMagic<br />
<br />
I d like to do the quest but i lack info (allakhazam is not very clear about it)<br />
<br />
its a new quest and i don t know if many have completed it so far. Anyway, i went in recon in gunthak the other day and althouh most of the mobs r green to me ( i am 55) some of the mobs near the fort (i think thats where the items i need drop) r LB to me. I went invis, but i wonder if i d end up training myself if i tried to pull som of the trolls near the fort.<br />
(hell, i can single pull in the hole since lvl 52 and they were DB to me ! but thats LOY so its a new story)<br />
<br />
So here r my Questions :<br />
<br />
What mobs drops the item ?<br />
<br />
What is the item's actuall name (troll head ? pirate head ?)<br />
<br />
Where to find the mobs ?<br />
How / where to fight them with relative safety ?<br />
<br />
The ring is nice and i think its slitly better than a regular 6AC 65HP maybe depending on your gear and way of playing)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ziagwa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you just need 4 troll pirate heads that fall off of Troll Maurders(sp?) in Gunthak then turn those in quiet simple but an ok ring i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Neriak LoY Quest Thread (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11664&amp;perpage=15&amp;highlight=Broken%20Skull%20must&amp;pagenumber=1) <br />
<br />
There is the thread on that particular quest.  Has all the starting quest text and rough locations of where the heads drop (trolls around the fort in Gunthak).  I forget the actual item name.  Azaryl did it.  Says the heads came from Troll marauders and plunderers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did it with minimal problems at 52, should be cake for you at 55. I just killed any troll (that wasn't a pillager, I still hate SK mobs..) until I had 3. Took me 2 days because I was misinformed and only thought that they dropped off of marauders, but I killed a plunderer for the hell of it and hey, I got my second one. It was called a &quot;Troll Pirate Head&quot; if I remember correctly, and the icon is the bloddy troll head. <br />

<br />
I forget exactly where the guy in neriak you turn it into is, I just ran around until I found him. Only took 3 minutes, and I do not know my way around neriak.<br />
<br />
The ring itself is pretty nice; it's not the best but it's on par with the 5/55 I had before it. And for how dang easy the quest is it's a nice reward. I mostly did it because my unbuffed STR was 111 at the time, and I hate being perma-encumbered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The guy in Neriak is &quot;a Tier'dal Correspondant&quot; and he stands right on the path to the Ogre/Troll section of the FQ.  <br />
<br />
The turn in is three &quot;Troll Pirate Head&quot;s, combined first in the bag the quest NPC gives you.  You'll get &quot;A bag of Troll heads&quot; or something like that when you do the combine.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they've upped the drop rate on these heads significantly in the recent past, as the first time I went and tried to do this quest, my Shaman duo partner and I cleared all the huts around the fort and many of the mobs in the fort for hours on end and never saw a head.<br />
<br />
This time, it took us two evenings of easy killing to get 5 heads (he's got two in case there is a different reward based on class).  The plunderers, marauders, pillagers and brokenskull warriors all have the chance to drop a head.  The mobs inside the fort (mostly shamen of some sort) do not seem to drop heads, and they are generally of higher level.  Just stick to killing the mobs outside the fort, in the little huts.  We worked our way around, starting at one side of the entrance tunnel and pulling to that spot until we had a clear path to the next open spot along the wall.  Between the two of us, we could get in three full circle clears before his bags were full of weapons and gems and I'd have to start looting.   In the span of an extended KEI, we cleared the place around 6-8 times at a very casual pace, with no worries.  We also made between 400 and 600 plat each in the period of a KEI off of the weapons and gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks all !<br />
thats quite clear, i ll give it a try as soon as i can.<br />
I was afraid i d train myself if i tried to pull one of the huts 'inhabitants&quot; but it seems not.<br />
The ring is nice, i can use some extra mana, str and dex and SvM is always good to have !<br />
I ll search for the correspondant when i have the heads<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Done the quest. Love the result. It's just the range for getting the heads-I got two the first night,and a week later got the third!<br />
 <br />
Go into the tunnel,from the beach (invis,of course) and take the first left you see. That'll get you to the fort. Soon as it opens up,turn left and park your pet here. Then just start pulling everything as you go-trolls can spawn in any hut,so kill,kill,kill.<br />
 <br />
Lot of quest stuff drops here. Deepwater Emblems are for the cleric Temperance quest. Pirate Seals are for the Freeport quest with the militia for a decent AC 11 neck piece. Dunno what Gunthak Gulf water is for,though. Mystics drop a nice earring for Int casters only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orthogonon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got the heads a while ago.  Correspondent is never up...maybe it is broken.   Annoying, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don t get it !<br />
i ve been to the fort surrondings, i ve killed like a dozen trolls (and a couple others) and yet i havent seen the slightest head drop.<br />
Are they rare drops ? (of the trolls who seem to be almost rare spawns themselves...)<br />
Is the quest broken ?<br />
Damm, i m just disapointed (or very impatient maybe)<br />
and there's never anyone to grp around there witch makes it slow and boring (very poor XP and loot altogether)<br />
Anyway, what da ya think ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Venae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Took me about 4 hours to solo this at level 53.  Everything was green or light blue, so it made for easy pulls, but they still hit hard enough that I was using huge amounts of mana tapping health back and still had to go through a couple stacks of bandages.<br />
<br />
Problem is, I did it the hard way first.  <br />
<br />
Originally, I just camped a half dozen huts or so, pulling anything there and waiting for respawn.  This wastes a lot of time.<br />
<br />
Much easier to just invis and scout out the trolls, as they're the ones dropping what you want.  Target, run back to the wall, and pull with a dark.  When it comes lumbering over, knock it down, invis and go find another one.  <br />
<br />
They're uncommon drops I'd say (I think I killed roughly around 20 trolls for my 3 heads).  It does go much faster if you just concentrate on trolls whenever possible, rather than pulling every damn gnome, inkie and erudite that hangs out there.  <br />
<br />
Just be aware that some of the trolls and basically all the ogres are shadowknights, so expect to eat some HTs on a couple pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madwand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got all three pirate head drops off of Troll Pillagers near the fort.<br />
<br />
Of course, the quest giver is not around.  Supposedly, he has a 5 min repop timer, but I sat and watched tv for more than an hour waiting on him.  No such luck.<br />
<br />
What was Sony thinking anyway when they hired the genius who coded that guy.  Make him a red con mob to the newbies with only 20 hps?  When/if he does pop, it's a race to see who gets to him first.<br />
<br />
Just what I had heard.. pretty frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Venae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had heard he was GM killed on all servers around the beginning of April for that very reason, and restored a few days later (patched somehow, I guess).  I neglected to con him when I did my turnin, but he was up and just standing around waiting as of 'bout 2 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />
