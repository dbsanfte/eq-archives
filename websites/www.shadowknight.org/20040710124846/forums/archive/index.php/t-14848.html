<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grosbras2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya it is also my main weapon and It already kiled me while farming shade  for smithi,ng ... When I discovered it was draining me instead of healing me it was too late.... The proc killed me after FD ... I hope it will be fixed soon , I am lucky a friend of mine lend me its old 2HS. But 1 year to get the epic and to have it bugged 2 weeks after finally gotten it .... I had just enough time to see that I loved it.</div></div><hr />

we should hold a protest or somthing. all pile in some servers nexus and have a sit in=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wonder if they are ever going to get this fixed.  It's nice that it does more damage than it used to, but hurting you sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greenmist is fixed!!!!!  (kinda)<br />
<br />
Well, it doesn't damage you any more, but now it's just a 270 damage DoT and it doesn't do anything else that it used to.<br />
<br />
At least now you can look forward to it proccing instead of dread it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordekhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After reading mixed messages here that is is fixed or that it isn't fixed, I took my Sk back to the bank to grab my Greenmist back out of the bank. At first, this was bugged in that it would work fine during combat, but after the fight was finished and the mob was dead, the lifetap portion  of it was hurting me instead of regenerating my HP's. Now, after the patch (I noticed a couple of changes to the effect at <br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1363&amp;source=Live<br />
) I found the the Greenmist proc does NOTHING AT ALL!.    :mad:    No stat changes, no regen, no effect in the buff box. This is incredibly frustrating after obtaining this weapon not so long ago. I've re-petitioned and /bug reported this many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Atlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the 7/10/03 patch removed the 'healing' effect of Greenmist.  It still has DoT effect on the mobs.   You now wield a 1hs Ethereal Bladed Naginata that snakes don't like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Give them time to get to the next two or three days of emergency patches to fix the things that weren't properly fixed (or worse yet were badly broken) by todays patch.  Chances are this is going to be a two or three part process, as usual.<br />

Information on Lucy leans toward the final product being what we all knew and loved previously, a lifetap (ac/str) dot that takes from the mob and gives to us.<br />

Besides, at the very least, &quot;a 1hs Ethereal Bladed Naginata that snakes don't like&quot; is still better than &quot;a 1hs Ethereal Bladed Naginata that snakes don't like and slowly kills you as you use it&quot;.<br />

LOL.  Very true.  I still used it even though it harms you (I 2-box with a cleric, so it hasn't killed me yet, it's just annoying).  Personally though I am glad that they at least did the fix they did.  Yeah, it doesn't give you any benificial buffs or heal you, but the few points you gained weren't really worth the lost HP, so I think that the &quot;fixed&quot; greenmist as it stands now is better than what it was before the fix.  Maybe with luck it will be really fixed.<br />
<br />
Besides, you can't gripe too much really.  If when all is said and done we have a weapon that lifetaps 270 damage instead of 120, then it's probably worth having it break a little in order to have a much better proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thacker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Many of you may have noticed that greenmist was finally fixed completely.  I didn't really check it extensively, but it appears that it now is a 270 lifetap over time.  Seems that it heals 270 damage now instead of just being a DoT.  Also seems to have some of the usual effects that I never worried about much because they are so trivial in the long run. :)<br />
<br />
Woo hoo!  That's gotta be a record for SoE to fix a SK bug.  :)</div></div><hr />
