<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I played a human SK and got him to 63 before having to quit and move to my new house.  Now that I can play again, I was thinking of trying a different race since my old character is gone.  I was thinking of dark elf since they seem like a good choice and they look pretty decent in armor.  So I guess what I am asking is that are all races that can be SKs good or just certain ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorthek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any and all races are good Sk's. Even Gnomes... for cooking at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer Iksar just for the RP and the fact i never have worry about ruining a faction since everyone hates me  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play what you like, but know this, as a Human SK you were kind of a rare breed, as a DE SK you are a dime a dozen (for SK's anyway).<br />
<br />
Questions to ask when picking your race:<br />
Would it be fun?<br />
What's quests/equip are unique to that race?<br />
Any special racials skills that I might like?<br />
Any cultural trade skills worth trying?<br />
<br />
As for not being able to play the same char...<br />
Did you actively delete your char?<br />
Has it been more than a year since you played?<br />
<br />
If the answer for the above 2 are both no, I believe you should be able to get it back.</div></div><hr />

It takes a unique person to make a Dark Elf SK an orignal piece of work!<br />
<br />
You can be in any group, and all most people will remember is &quot;Oh yeah, some dumbass dark elf&quot;..... But if you are GOOD and Witty, and FUN they say &quot;Oh yeah, CHAYDE Get her in your group! The hours will only seem like minutes!&quot; <br />

<br />
Full of what ... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Races that will become a good SK, hmmz...<br />
<br />
Human<br />
Erudite<br />
Troll<br />
Ogre<br />
Iksar<br />
<br />
In other words, it doesn't matter, it might matter a little in the beginning, but once you get to level 60+ and get some decent gear, your race/stats will all become the same anyway. <br />
So pick one you think looks cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Gnomes aren't SK's, so they aren't included)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>badsmofo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well i started with an iksar, but i hate him without head graphics, so i deleted.  then i started a human but he looked like a wimp.  so i tried a de figuring it would be a bit different but then i ran into like 8 in 3 hours so i deleted.  i hate gnomes, ogres, and trolls in plate so they weren't even an option.  then i realized.  human females are f'n hot.  so i dressed her up in plate and BOOO YOW!!!!!!  all butter baby.<br />
<br />
and hence the name, butta.  oh yeah, this could get ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zephyralien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The best race is Iksar - Here's why<br />
<br />
They regen like trolls, and a medium armor wearing class, CAN wear higher level plates, dont get stuck in many places, look the coolest, have bonus AC, decent all around stats, and you wouldnt be able to point one out in the middle of a crowd like DE.. I would say the only disadvantage is not having 2H bash.. But like all other medium/small races, they can still get it in the end. (For those of you who argue that its not good cus you cant get it till 59, think again because you shouldnt be doin' most AAs till 60)<br />
<br />
Anyway I have never found the lack of bash to be that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
And if you want to be like everyone else, play a DE or a big stupid ogre for no frontal stuns (Which I have never found to be too big of an issue anyway)<br />
<br />
Faction is nice too.. Since everyone hates you, you can kill them all for loot and XP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nysstyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok Im gonna start up again with a human SK and a human Necro.  Yeah I know there are other races that have better starting traits and abilities but I feel I would have more fun playing those combinations and its kinda neat being a rare breed.  Now I wanted to ask what would be a good choice for diety:  Innoruuk or Bertox?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tristandevir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Innoruuk,<br />
this guy is cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the three races that can play SKs that stand above the rest (to me anyway) are Iksar, Troll and Ogre. Why?<br />
<br />
Iksar and Troll have natural regen, which helps when you get your Lich spells.<br />
<br />
Ogre cannot be stunned from the front, which is very handy for a caster.<br />
<br />
The rest of the races make fine SKs for different reasons, but these three races just have a wee bit of an edge.<br />
<br />
Although at the end of the day, an SK plays the same role no matter what race he is, so I'd say pick a look that works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>brianman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, I'm trying to find a place where I can see what Racial Abilities / Benefits the various races get specifically for the races that can become Shadow Knights).<br />
<br />
Things I'm looking for are:<br />
<br />
Abilities like:<br />
Forage, Swimming, Tinkering, Hide, Sneak etc.<br />
<br />
Other abilities like:<br />
Bash, Immune to frontal stuns, regeneration, high AC etc.<br />
<br />
Wich stats are hardest to get high for a Shadow Knight (low, mid, high and raid level.). Str, sta etc.<br />
<br />
I've tried browsing these boards, Allakhazam as well as Caster's Realm, so far I'm leaning toward Iksars due to:<br />
1. Regeneration.<br />
2. High AC.<br />
3. Swimming / Forage.<br />
I just don't know exatly where to put the extra ability points.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any and all tips are welcome, thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Put all your extra points in Stamina - hardest and most expensive to raise via equipment. INT items are pretty common, as are STR and DEX.  You won't need to care about Agility as long as its 75+, and WIS, CHA are worthless to you as a Shadowknight (CHA only good for selling to merchants, but not a consideration for starting points at all).<br />
<br />
Sounds like Iksar is the one you want, if you want foraging.  Swimming starting at 100 isnt' a bit deal on PvE servers, you can build that up easily enough I wouldn't factor it in for my decision.<br />
<br />
Nice thing about Iksar, Troll and Ogre, they have an xp penalty.  Yes, that's right, I like the penalty.  The slower I level the more skillups I can get in combat skills before I ding up a level. IT's easier to max out.<br />
<br />
Considering as an SK you want to keep your 1hS, 1hB, 2hS, 2hB and Piercing all up as high as you can (not to mention Bash/Slam), if you level too quickly, your skills will suffer.<br />
<br />
The xp penalty takes care of it nicely.<br />
<br />
I'm leveling up an Ogre SK now, and I love it, and I do not notice the penalty -- what I do notice is that my weapon skills are much closer to cap than they were with my Human or Gnome SK from times past.  I also notice the lack of stuns makes me deal more damage/spells out over time, and I look ubah sexah too.<br />
<br />
Whatever you choose, enjoy, SKs are a fun class!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Poxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by Nysstyre <br />
Ok Im gonna start up again with a human SK and a human Necro.  Yeah I know there are other races that have better starting traits and abilities but I feel I would have more fun playing those combinations and its kinda neat being a rare breed.  Now I wanted to ask what would be a good choice for diety:  Innoruuk or Bertox?  <br />
<br />
Burtoxx - you get a very cool HQ under Qeynos, with great atmosphere and (yes!) a banker (looks like a beggar).  Burtoxx is the laid back evil, he gets less faction flack than many other evil dieties.  You also don't have to pay lipservice as a second class citizen to the dark elf god, Innoruuk. Bloodsaber faction is hard to raise without making you KOS in the rest of Qeynos, however. <br />
<br />
Innoruuk - you get a hole under a warehouse for a home, not as cool as Bertox. However, you get better faction in Neriak (you can go anywhere but the tiny troll and necro guild in 3rd gate). It's also easy to raise faction with Dismal Rage as long as you don't go into North Freeport (East and West remain safe). You also get access to all those hotty DE babes, though they'll probably just sneer at you and stick up their nose until you prove your hatred.<br />
<br />
I have a necro of Bertoxx and I had a 36 SK of Innoruuk at one point.  That's my perspective.<br />
<br />
(yep, belated reply, but here in case anyone else wants to make the same choice and wants opinion!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mehatesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally, I would have gone with the Ogre.  Being immune to frontal stuns is a very nice plus..If youve never been stunned while trying to cast your spells, then try and get a refund from Ebey.  That however, is only one reason I love the Ogre..He is hard to miss in a group, got some pretty decent starting stats, isnt hated by all starting out, and eats gnomes for breakfast and Dark Elves for lunch and washes it down with the blood of those dirty nasty humans.. Trolls rock, but they got shafted by the frogs, and anyone who loses theyre city to a bunch of mobile snacks needs to be smacked around a few times...lol..Good luck with your human..And yeah, keep lots of torches or light producing items on ya...But then again, its nice having humans stumble into my clutches in the dark..They scream really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Excessium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">DE's get ultravision...<br />
They need to give them a new ability like ball snip or titty twister. Ultravision is lame.</div></div><hr />
