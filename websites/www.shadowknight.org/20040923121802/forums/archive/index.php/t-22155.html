<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">.... no, these have never been posted... ever.. this is the first time we have ever seen these, thank you so much for the newly top secret info.</div></div><hr />

What Keero means by this is that you are stupid, and need to get your head out of your ass. Either that or learn to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow that's totally new information.  Certainly not something I could have found using the &quot;search&quot; feature on the shadowknight boards.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's what he means.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">actually if you just looked in the 'spells and skills' section, which implies reading comprehension.... but whatever...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they haven't made any changes in awhile right, gone through and looked a bunch of times but never saw any. Really wish they would just set in stone or give us an idea of what were getting in OoW already like shroud of discord or how much were gonna be able to lich for etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaledine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah... and what's the big hype about our spells anyway... I mean... when we get them it will be a situation that looks like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! Look at me! I'm running around using spells that I had from Planes of Power that were retuned for the higher content when in actuality these are what our PoP spells should have been originally!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you have PoP.. And you have all your spells... trust me.. you wont be missing much with OoW. <br />
<br />
At this point I would be more interested in seeing what AAs we get rather than what spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you use spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you use spells?<br />
Yes.  If I didn't, I'd be the tanking cornerstone of the holy trinity squealing &quot;your spellbook makes up for it!&quot; like a spoiled brat who doesn't want to share his toys  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi! Look at me! I'm running around using spells that I had from Planes of Power that were retuned for the higher content when in actuality these are what our PoP spells should have been originally<br />
<br />
Yeah, I mean it was never like that before.  We never got a darkness only to replace it with a better darkness a few levels down the road.  The heat blood line, lifetaps, heart flutter, and even fear lines progressed the same way.  Be happy we have been able to get a few &quot;original&quot; spells along the way.<br />
<br />
Thinking that the spells we're getting in OoW should have been given to us in PoP is pretty retarted too.  Why not just ask for Strike of Solusek and Complete Heal while you're at it?<br />
<br />
If you were as happy with your PoP spells as I was, an upgrade to them would be something you would look forward to, as I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Powa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These spells are for sure 100% different than the list from month ago.

<br />

Bond of Inruku<br />
Decrease hitpoints by 135 per tick<br />
Increase Hitpoints by 100 per tick<br />
<br />
Touch of inruku (more HP tap, /whine on)<br />
Decrease HP by 575<br />
<br />
Level 68:<br />
Dark Constriction (Asyotle upgrade i think)<br />
1: Increase Disease Counter by 9<br />
2: Decrease STR by 59 (L68) to 60 (L70)<br />
3: Decrease AC by 26 (L68) to 27 (L70)<br />
4: Decrease Hitpoints by 100 per tick<br />
<br />
Shroud of Discord (well, let's hope they give us an even better hp proc - improve Black Shroud :)  )<br />
Add Proc: Shroud of Chaos Strike<br />
<br />
Terror of Discord (1200 hate, it's 2x better than the 65 one)<br />
1: Increase Hate by 1200<br />
<br />
Level 69:<br />
Scythe of Inruku<br />
1: Decrease Hitpoints by 1145<br />
<br />

1: Increase Modify Hate by 800<br />
<br />
Touch of Muram<br />
lifetap 680<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ajrarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's the point of this thread ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i think most folks' understandable dissapoinment with the new spells is that they show no imagination on the part of the dev team. every one is nothing more than a marginal upgrade to an existing spell line. the last time the lvl cap was raised , sk's saw spells which had no precursors in the existing game - spears , poison dots &amp; zevfeer's . i suspect that's what people were hoping for again.<br />
<br />
the other issue is that the upgrades are not enough that given the possible need to reacquire focus items that they will even be upgrades at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We've known that they're tapped out in the imagination department.  We've known that since PoP came out.<br />
<br />
I just wish the spell line devs would chat with the mob/encounter devs to know what we'll NEED to have a fighting chance of being a part of the group/raid.  I mean, some of these spells could have been much more creative and useful.  Instead, we have pathetic upgrades to look forward to out of OoW.  The only things I would look forward to, would be a balance fix and level 70.  The latter is a given, but I fear it'll be a cold day in Hell before we get fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Culdahl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think these spells are all that great either.  The devs did nothing to improve our ability to MT or off-tank.  Bond or inruku - Unless they drastically improved the casting time over bond of death I don't see this as a big help...What little damage mitigation you could get from this spell is useless if you can't even get the spell off on an incoming SNARED mob (let alone one at full speed).  This spell is usefull only to help counter DoT's and such on raids from what I've found.  The improved LT's  -  Depending on cast/recast times any upgrade to this line has a minimal effect at best IMO..problem as I see it is that they can not raise this ability to where it needs to be due to the PvP implications if they did. The improved terror spell - the others were completely useless, they need to retool the effect the spell has, not just raise the amount of &quot;hate&quot; generated with each new spell (I find that the first and second terror spells work much better then the 65 one, especially when used in tandem (not that I use them much).  I do welcome improvements to our Voice and Cloak lines, if the improvements are significant enough to warrant the level of difficulty that I'm sure these spells will require to obtain.<br />
<br />
  I'm not one to endlessly bitch no matter how much we are given, but I have yet to see one of our spells be a class defining one such as slow, CH, KEI, uber pets, ports, etc.  Our DPS sucks, our pulling is second rate, our ability to tank in high end encounters has greatly diminished and our agro abilities are not nearly as good as they were with the new warrior AA's and endless agro aug's that warriors have access to.  I guess we still have superior snap agro abilities, but what good is that if you can't tank the mob you gained agro on?<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Terror of Discord (1200 hate, it's 2x better than the 65 one)<br />
1: Increase Hate by 1200<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is still sub par of where it needs to be, also needs it recast time lowered.<br />
<br />
Are lifetaps need less recast time lowered.<br />
<br />
Short term AC buff needs damage compent replaced with an AC debuff.<br />
<br />
Are tap buffs need to be scaled against other proc buffs without taking soul abrasion into count. If it's scaled with soul abrasion in mind then SA is mandory not a power increase for the intenstion of the spell.<br />
<br />
smaller of the 2 poison dots need to changed to be made non poison based.<br />
<br />
they need globally lower disease resists and decrease the amount of disease immune mobs.<br />
<br />
We also could use a spell to improve are pulling.<br />
Later<br />
