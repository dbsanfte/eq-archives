<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are several &quot;symbols of ducee ???&quot; that drop off of mobs in PoP.  Obviously for some kind of quest.<br />
<br />
Symbol of Ducee Fideson<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Symbol of Ducee Imperon<br />
<br />
Are the two that I currently have in my possession (linked in my magelo profile in the bank).<br />
<br />
There is also supposed to be one that drops in Plane of Torment.  And rumor has it that there is one that drops off the named in Halls of Honor.<br />
<br />
Anyone made any progress on this quest?  Anyone got any ideas who would be looking for this quest?  Safehouse has a few ideas.. but as far as I know it's still unsolved.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo lists &quot;Symbol of Ducee Cupidon&quot; also.  This is the one from Torment that I don't currently have.<br />
<br />
There are rumors of a fourth Symbol of Ducee, but it's not in magelo.<br />
