<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dokel Sengir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which stat makes your attacks land more? and how high should I raise it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NorrynNoir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ATK. The higher your strength , the higher your atk though i'm not sure the ratio. that said i'd worry about maxing sta before str given the relative importance of hp's to atk.<br />
<br />
there are lots of in game buffs that raise atk as well as worn effects - aura of courage &amp; bravery  , vengeance items , not sure but i know there are others. you can very cheaply raise your own atk by 25 if you pick up the spell from Ruj that costs 36 AP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe Dex raises attack as well.  Avatar and Ranger buffs are gret ways to raise attack.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cyrielle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weapon skill ONLY (+accuracy mods) for attack rate<br />
<br />
ATk for how hard you hit<br />
<br />
So basically if you want to hit more only way is get accuracy mods or + % weapon skill mods like grimling ball etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordraeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I read on the Beastlord forums 1 STR = .9 ATK<br />
<br />
It's an interesting thread:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Str does indeed raise attack, but there are two facets to attack, and raising both will raise attack, but in different methods.  Raising Str allows you to hit harder and/or raises max hit if your str was really low.  Skill mods and +accuracy rais your chance to actually hit the mob.  Raising either of these will show higher attack on your screen, but will have different effects.  Raw attack bonuses from what I've seen and parsed, just seem to raise chance to hit, maybe chance to hit for max.</div></div><hr />
