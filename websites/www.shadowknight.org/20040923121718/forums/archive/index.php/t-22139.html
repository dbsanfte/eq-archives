<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobgob frum Grobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Riposte AA's worth maxing out ?<br />
Any real noticable difference when tanking ?<br />
<br />
Heard someone mentioning drawbacks to maxing riposte ... that true ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the riposte AA made you ripost more often, instead of giving a chance of a riposte attacking twice, maybe it would be something worth getting.  It certainly won't decrease your character's power, but it won't be much of an increase either.  A fraction of a fraction tends to be a smaller fraction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think I had over 400 aa before I bought this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I had just over 300 before starting on this line... 27 points to go all the way I think, if I recall.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is any disadvantage to maxing it out.  Limited advantage perhaps but don't recall any drawbacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daerkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am interested in the answer to this question also. I currently have double riposte at level 2, and have been been holding off on finishing that and getting Flash of Steel as the GoD aa's seem to offer somewhat better upgrades for my current play style. I tank almost 100% of the time for my group save for a boxed warrior we drag around for some named mobs. It seems to me that intense hatred is useful and WA, both of which are next on my list to max. Then I plan on the pet affinity as I always have a bard along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its worth it more if you use a slow damaging 2 handed weapon to tank.<br />
<br />
Its worth more as the game advances and more powerful weapons become available.<br />
<br />
Its worth more if you have a riposite mod item.<br />
<br />
I think it would be worth it more so in pvp then pve.<br />
<br />
400 aa's and i still dont have it.</div></div><hr />
