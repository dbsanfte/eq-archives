<br />
making fun of a gnome is like kicking a puppy.<br />
<br />
-Bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've obviously been a shadowknight for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bick is Good</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What does that have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
You aren't one of those people who brag about how you've spent more time killing mobs in a computer game than I have are you?<br />
<br />
Cause people like that depress me.<br />
<br />
-Bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's my point:<br />
<br />
When gnome first were able to be shadowknights, nobody liked it. Everyone thought it was a bad idea. Why? Because everyone twinked out a gnome sk and PL'd it to 60. I doubt that ANYONE started the game on THAT DAY and said &quot;Hmm.. I'll make a gnome shadowknight!&quot;. Everyone views them as twinks,whether they are or not, it's how they are viewed.<br />
<br />
Then there are those who demand the same respect because they were able to PL themselves to 65 and get better gear than most of us here. And nobody wanted to give it to them. Why? Because who can give someone who leveled a twink to 60 in 3 weeks the same respect as someone who has been playing for 3 years and knows the class well?<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying that all gnomes are PLed twinks, but that is what initially happened. That is why everyone doesn't like Shadow Gnights. But I find it odd that most of the Gnome SK magelo's have VERY nice gear that costs lots of money. And there are lots of very basic questions being asked by some. Questions so basic that even I could answer, and I'm not level 60 like they are.<br />
<br />
The point is everyone saw it coming, and it happened. Which made them dislike gnomes that much more. Now it is nothing more than a joke. A running gag on the boards. &quot;Haha gnomes suck&quot;, nothing more. And, I will be brutally honest for a second, anyone who is offended by that is a God Damn Crybaby. If you can't take being made fun of, WHY THE HELL DID YOU PICK A GNOME? People have always made fun of gnomes, where the hell have you been for the past 3 years? Don't pick DEs either, the whole 'smurf' thing would likely send you into a flamefest.<br />
<br />
The above statement was not directed at any one person. It was just answering the question, and the last part was me letting off steam. I just want people to stop crying when people make jokes about you. Did you come here expecting the world's most friendly board? And wouldn't you notice that after, I dunno, reading some threads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Amphitryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm..i rarely get called a smurf and Ive been a DE SK for almost 3 years now.<br />
<br />
thouh gnomes have been called gnomosexuals since i started playing this game..so no suprise there. (and lets not even discuss assling paladins and rangers)<br />
<br />
oh well least it takes the heat off the Erudite SKs /grin (and yes im well aware of the virtues of erudites, so ;-P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oompah Loompah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People love to hate gnomes.  I know I did and still sorta do, but my twink gnome is a  SK.  But I am a solitary creature with little time to play and little desire to group.<br />
<br />
Wanna know why I find a gnome superior?  One piece of equipment.  Watchman 40% haste.  Add to that a nice 36% haste item and I am self hasted to 76% at all times.  For a person who doesnt group much and lives a solo life thats gives gnomes a big advantage over others for me.<br />

<br />
but seriously ... disliking gnomers because many are twinks is like dislikeing chinese people because many of them are communist.  i'm not saying thats wrong ... just awfully small minded ... which is fine, i guess ... just not my thing.<br />
<br />
being small does have it's disadvantages, tho ... namely that people deem it easier to walk on you if you are closer to the floor.  that's ok tho ... those are usually the same people who don't realize their shoelaces have been tied together until MUCH too late.<br />
<br />
it really boils down to the same answer as always tho ... play what ya wanna play.  if ya don't like gettin picked on, don't play a gnomer.<br />

<br />
<br />
Personally, when entering and walking around the bazaar/nexus, I often wish that EVERYONE else in there played a Gnome.  A gnome sits in the path of my Troll trying to get to the exit hallway, no big deal.  I stomp over his stubby ass and head for the door.  An ogre sits down in the entryway and I'm screwed until the moron who plays him stops diddling himself over the huge breasted dark elf in the low cut robe.<br />
<br />
Besides, Gnomes make the best snacks.  Dorf is just too stringy, and asslings taste funny.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kormus the Dark Angel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good post Keffka, sums it up pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
So I am simple minded to add a probability (that a gnome SK is a twink/alt) and a certainty (that a gnome SK just does not have the /played and did never experience the xp penalty and the crappy Velious era) and conclude that the general Gnome SK can be viewed upon as less experienced and thus treated with less respect?<br />
Fine. I can live with that.<br />
And now please go back playing your carebear halfling pally twink and her Saturday Evening Misty Cuddle Group, Gnax.<br />
<br />
Gnome SKs are a joke, they should not have been put into the game and I despise them. They won't get any of the respect I feel for every 'true' SK from me. Ever.<br />
<br />
And now please post how simple minded and racist and mean and unfair and arrogant I am. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why do gnome SK suck...<br />
<br />
easy<br />
<br />
being an SK isn't about being uber or good solo class or stuff...<br />
It's about LOOKS...an SK has to look like he is the BIGGEST MEANEST BADASS in the whole game. <br />
Gnomes cannot do that...<br />
I will never say about a gnome stuff like whow, he looks cool or he looks mean...i dont care how uber twinked he is (like the most of them)<br />
I cannot imagine seeing a gnome with epic...and i hope i will never do, cause it's gonna SUCK. (most gnome SK probably will never have one too cause they get &quot;beter&quot; stuff while being twinked)<br />
And to top it off...allmost all gnomes are like look how cute i am, how cuddely i am, FUCK THAT.<br />
Even erudites look meaner then a gnome, and i think they look like pansy's too.<br />
<br />
Only races that should be allowed to be SK should be DE, Troll and Ogre. <br />
<br />
With on 3rd spot for looks Ogre.<br />
Second is for Dark Elfs/iksars<br />
And the TRUE SK look should be TROLLS !<br />
<br />
<br />
* added iksars at second place, was thinking too much old world :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dunno, seems when they added the new 'cute' race/class combo's, they didn't try to hard for storyline. Example: the halfling paladin just returned from Qeynos, where she met some Paladins and became one. How epic! and it's pretty much the same with their rangers, Gnome Paladins, and Shadowknights too. <br />
And on a personal note, it seems that the malevolence of a Dark knight is lost in a cutey-wutey lawn figurine. However, it's all a matter of taste. I'm just partial to cold, dark, sinister Iksars and Erudites I s'pose. <br />
&quot;Grrr! In the name my gnomish father, Fuzziwuttle, I'll send your wittle' soul into the void!&quot; yikes!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ooooh kicking comes easy, hooray.<br />
<br />
I boil puppies to make stew.  Remember, like with crustaceans, you need to boil them alive to get the flavor right!<br />
<br />
Although, steaming the puppy makes for a pretty good time too, but a less satisfying meal.<br />
<br />
What I truly enjoy, however, is eating brains.  The numbing effects of the endorphines contained therein are a delight, especially when afterwards I get to beat something until I am sticky from its fluids covering me.  The incredible sense of joy to be had from standing in a pool of your defeated enemy's juices while completely disassociated from reality due to eating the raw stuff of intellect (genius or foolish, tis all equalized in my stomach) cannot be comprehended by those who have not experienced it.<br />

How true. As for DEs, that pretty much sums it up. I dun think I'd be too scared if Dark Elf appeared up to me with his hair and shit all combed nicely. Now, a short gnome with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth would be the shit. I'd prolly die of a stroke if I saw something like that. Course, goes to say if DE's were able to turn into a demon or something, I'd be a &quot;little&quot; nervous. But I think Gnomes would own the fear department if they had sharp teeth and such.</div></div><hr />
