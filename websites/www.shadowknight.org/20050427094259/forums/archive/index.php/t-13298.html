<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing as how there are more and more people coming and playing Everquest for the first time or returning from a long leave of absence. I have decided to write a scope on all the races. I will try and remain neutral through my little critique :). Please if you have any problem with it please feel free to post. As long as it is helpful please post it up, but refrain from mindless babble.<br />
<br />
Human: The final race that the gods created. This race has grabbed a strong foothold in the world of Norrath. But where there is good there is always one willing to do ill. These are the human shadowknights. They have very basic stats 85 str 80 sta 75 agi 75 dex 75 wis 85 int 80 cha and +20 bonus points for you to blow into your character :). As they have very well rounded stats they can never be bad and can only get better. They dont't have any experiance penalties which is really nice to have when making an SK. They do not have nightvision which can be a pain until later when you get Deadeye at level 22 I think it is. All in all they are very formidable especially later on when you get high damage items and bonus equipment (Just like any other race)<br />
<br />
Erudite: These I believe were the last of the human race. Led by Erud they left the humans (Who they had grown discusted with) and sailed for Odus. There is a long story of Maragul and Necromancy and everything. But as a Erudite Shadow Knight you will start in Paineel which is one of the BEST newbie zones in the game (On the map it will say you start in Erudin but it is actually Paineel). Followed by Paineel you get to go to Warrens which is a VERY nice little place to level up. I dont know their stats for a SK at this time feel free to post it though! Like humans Erudites have no Night Vision which again is a pain in the butt to me, however you get Deadeye at 22. Erudites are often times scorned for being a physical and not as much magical by their peers (And in forums like this they get slamed a lot ) They have little strength and little sta from what I remember. But you will really never have to leave Odus until you want to go to Luclin! I have seen very few Erudite SKs around but from the high level ones I have encountered they are a nice race. Oh yes the Intelligence is nice to have to learn stuff quickly.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf: The Dark Elves were created by Innoruuk as a mockery of the Elven race. Dark Elves are very quick witted and have good intelligence. They make fiersome Shadow Knights in battle as they are swift and very dexterious (Which makes your weapon proc). I believe their stats are 70str 75sta 90agi 75dex 83wis 109 int 65cha and +20 bonus points. All in all a nice race to make an SK and very nice to Roleplay (Which I see very little anymore sadly).<br />
<br />
Ogre: Ogres are the children of Rallos Zek the Warlord. At one time they, along with Zek leading them, made war with the gods themselves. They are what fairy tales explain them to be. Big powerful masses of flesh with little intelligence or kindness. The smarter of the race's crop become shamans or Shadow Knights. their stats are 140str 127sta 70agi 70dex 67wis 70int +20 bonus. Ogres can not be stunned from the front and have an experiance panalty but less severe that the trolls or iksars. If strength is what you crave then go ogre.<br />
<br />
Troll: No one truly knows how trolls were created but the most resonable explaination is that they came from Kunark. Trolls are big, green, stinky, and some of the ugliest and stupidest creatures in all of Norrath. (It's a wonder they can be SKs at all) Their stats are 117str 114sta 83agi 75dex 60wis and 62int along with +20 bonus points. Alas the trolls have a 20% xp penalty laid on them due to their regeneration. But trolls can become the fiercest Shadow Knights in all of Norrath. After the frogloks attacked Grobb the trolls moved to Neriak making the newbie zone Nektulos forest. The recent patch up'ed the spawn rate so there is more to kill now )<br />
<br />
Iksar: Iksars were created by Cazic-Thule and were slaves for the longest time. Not a single race accepts Iksars but themselves. This means much faction work on your side (Even more because your an SK) but there will be little need to leave Kunark for a while. The Kunark area around the iksar city can easily take you to 20. I am not sure at their stats but I know that some of the biggest duel nightmares I have are with Iksar Shadow Knights. There is a 20% XP penalty due to their regeneration. Iksars can not where plate armor because if messes with their scales which kind of stinks but you get some nice culteral and the Khurki (I can't remember the name ) quests which eventually lead to the Greenmist quest which is a very nice weapon.<br />
<br />
Gnome: Everyone has problems with gnomes. Gnomes are the short folk who live in the Steamfont mountains. Their urge to touch and experiment gives you the ability to Tinker. You can tinker fun stuff like Fireworks which are fun at guild meetings. They have little str but are swift and very smart as well. I think these guys are fun to Roleplay (I have a gnome as my alt SK) and even though they are weak physically they can really pack a punch with the right equipment. I have outdamaged and ogre warrior with my gnome shadowknight. The newbie area is quite nice as well.<br />
<br />
I leave with that. Shadow Knights are very very powerful and should be roleplayed to KNOW they are powerful and be as evil as you can be regardless of race. Maybe in a group cackle when your friend dies and you live. Or if you are a troll or ogre in the group look at the halfling with a grin and make threats to eat him/her. All in all they races are balanced and should not be taken lightly in any fight. you never know when HT is coming. Play your SK with pride!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cultural comment couldn't be further from the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, I did try this once and it was with my opinions. I decided that you people are barbaric and should be givin a more...simple lay out of the races instead of some opinions WHICH I flatly stated were my opinions and you guys apparently either dont comprehend the words or something because you guys got all pissy. I was told by my Iksarian friend that he got some culteral armor. If thats not true that post so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mutton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iksar's do get cultural armor.  But compared to the cultural of other races, it is pretty shitty....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">request for sticky? DENIED</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">stating your opinion is what got you flamed... you can't state an opinion here without expecting to get layed in to.  its like death and taxes, accept it, or shut the fuck up.  <br />
<br />
other than that, except for saying gnomes are worth being shadow knights, it was pretty close...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, who the hell cares what your opinions are?  The world is better off without them just like terrorists.<br />
<br />
Its too bad that you spent a lot of time writing that when most of the information isn't right and no one will listen to it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vehement</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like how you give a more &quot;newbish&quot; approach to your views.  The backgrounds you gave on all the races was really nice, although some of the information is a little off.<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a nice little guide for someone who is just starting EQ to look at. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of you guys, shut the fuck up. He is simply giving his opinion on the races. If you don't like what he is saying, then go off into a corner, grab your dick, and start to stroke.<br />
<br />
In anycase, nice little overview.  I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rugs Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think its a fun description of the races.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if your craving the hard facts of each race and cant decide...just read a little.  Dont flame some guy because he was willing to have fun giving opinions and EQ lore.  Any dipshit can criticize and make one-liners, but it takes someone brave to make themselves vulnerable in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is mostly a role-play version of the choices we have and im sure adds some insight for people new to the game or curious to the background of the races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually..<br />
<br />
Ogres were very intelligent and after they failed to defeate the Council of Rathe they were punshed by basically Rathe giving the entire race a lobotamy. <br />
<br />
They were at one point the 'super race' but half of their power, their intelligence, was taken away. The other half, the melee strength, was left in tact.<br />
<br />
On a side note.. why would someone put this much effort into a race review when a) no one cares and b) people already know most of this stuff?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got flamed once came back for more ?<br />
Giving opinions on races is useless. If you really want to do that, go play a paladin. <br />
<br />
Everybody will have their own opinion, even your &quot;neutral&quot; view on races has opinions.</div></div><hr />

This is actually a very good reason to hate gnomes.<br />
<br />
And yes, Iksar have cultural armor, but it isn't very good.  I guess it is okay for an Iksar shaman in his 40s, but not good at all for a shadow knight.</div></div><hr />

That was actually the giants who were intelligent and a super power race. After being punished by the gods they were forced to flee, and most of their cities were destroyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You guys don't like to read do you? I said this was a nuetral view of all the races. I tried my best to remain completly unsided. If you incompatent, illiterate, jackasses think you can do better make your own so that people just like yourselves can flame you for trying to do newbies everywhere a favor!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just want to clarify one thing in the name of objectivity - don't simply call the gnomes physically weak when they are, in fact, hardier than the dark elves.  <br />
I just got rid of my gnome SK the other day (after making it all the way to 36 for the first time) because I was sick of a few things.  One, people &quot;roleplaying&quot; and acting like jerks to me - sure, they liked me well enough when they got to know me, but who wants to put on a song and dance to impress someone who was an ass from the get-go?  Two, good races took me lightly - paladins who were /role grouped with me all the time, guess they thought a gnome SK can't be ALL that bad.  Three, you have colleagues with these embarassing names that imply cuteness and smallness.  And four, dark elves always thinking they're tougher, when they're just not.  Cooler looking?  Sure.  I know that's a matter of opinion, but saying a dark elf looks cooler is a well formed opinion.  Tougher, no.  However...<br />
One thing any real newbie should understand is that the difference in stats for gnomes is relatively negligible, and is very much eclipsed by the community dark elves have.  Gnome SK's are pretty much on their own until they make the right friends.  Any time I've ever made a dark elf, I've walked out into Nektulos forest and been greeted by buffs, groups, free gifts, lively conversations over /shout, and that general sense of solidarity when everyone chimes in with well wishes for some high elf who just came in from PoK.  Anyone else ever noticed this?  It might just be how things are on Firiona Vie.<br />
I still enjoyed playing a gnome better than playing a dark elf... everyone's a dark elf, I got bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I completly agree. With my alt gnome SK (Currently level 25) I almost enjoy playing him as much as I do my main Troll SK (Currently level 56). I Love to Roleplay as much as possible (An act that is almost completely abstact in EQ. Ironic how it is an RP game and NO ONE RPs except for the feeble attempts of the stupider races) When people lay down the smack on me I just RP as to let my hatred smolder. Or shrug it off and later laugh as they die either at your feet or a monster's that you could have EASILY taken down. I know people are gonna be all like: &quot;Gnomes suck. They are weak and small etc.&quot; They say this because they have spent way too much of their lives realizing that it is a game they play and not some debate over war. Some people need to realize this like Lizarde and  Drynnious. When people pummel you with words remember that you are one of the very few that can be small but like the old fable when the thorn brought down the lion. (How I love that story)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you consider my post to be a flame, then I would suggest that you are wa-aaay too sensitive.  Relax and tap into your sense of humor, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No No. I didn't say it was a flame it's just that I think people need to get out of this &quot;Gnomes are crappy SKs&quot; thing. It's old and needs to quit. I did see the humor in the first few times I saw it but now it seems like these people who are waaaaaaaay to absorbed in EQ are actually serious. For those of you who see it as a joke then Yes it was funny for awhile but put it to rest. For those who are serious really need to see a therapist about your &quot;Out-of-tune&quot; to life syndrome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GoBuk Agogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Anyone who has two SKs on the same server needs therapy.  Variety is the spice of life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a 10 rogue (Who I made just this Wednesday)<br />
I have a 10 paladin (Who I made last week)<br />
I have a 20 ranger (I made when I came back to EQ)<br />
I have a 10 necromancer (I made not too long ago)<br />
<br />
Unlike most of you I have school. I do not have much time. I am a swimmer so I have unbelieveably LONG and HARD workouts from 7:00 to 9:30. I get home at around 10:00 and by that time I got to sleep. I can only get my homework done from 4:00-5:30. So you see my time is very constricted. Only one the few weekends when I dont have competitions can I actually play EQ. And even then I got my mom on my ass about how much I play this devil game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a 10 rogue (Who I made just this Wednesday)I have a 10 paladin (Who I made last week)<br />

<br />
So, this begs the question:  What the FUCK are you doing on a Shadowknight forum, posting about races, if you don't even play a Shadowknight?  Oh wait, you have a level 25 one.. come back when you can at least Feign Death and start learning the finer arts of pulling and the such..<br />
<br />
Have you not read the previous 5,203,913,128 posts on the boards that have come to the basic conclusion that race choice is largely a matter of personal preference and that in the end, the races are pretty balanced as far as pros and cons?  Did you not read the criticism of your last attempt at this, where people pointed out your silly mistakes about races and armor choices and the such?<br />
<br />
And by the way... if you're going to post long diatribes about races and expect people to take you seriously... for fuck's sake... use a fucking spellchecker...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call bullshit on the 60 Shadowknight thing... no way you had a 60 shadowknight and be so clueless about Shadowknights in general, not to mention that all you had to do was either get your mom's credit card # onto the account where you had your 60 Shadowknight and keep the character, or you could have just taken your lunch money and gotten a pre-paid card and kept the character that way.</div></div><hr />

You don't know what kind of time restrictions I have. If you don't agree with something I say then don't read it. I am sure you have better things to do than get mad at me because you don't agree with me. If you don't like then shove it up your ass and then you lost nothing but gained an ass wiper</div></div><hr />

  It started out well with a taste of lore that flowed smoothly into a oaky attempt at neutrality.  However, the finish marred the experience, degenerating into a bitter name-calling, four-year-old tantrum aftertaste.
