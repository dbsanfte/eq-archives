<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KLeTuS_KaSaDy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">neat idea ide like to see is sacaficical rez type thing, happenns enuff were im the last one alive in the group and could save the day with a rez - if i had one, so instead of giving us convergence which would set the necromancers into whine mode they could perhaps give us a rez that kills ourselves and rezes 1 groupmate ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would prefer to kill the ranger/monk in sacrifice for a rez.<br />
<br />
Either way, we're probably not getting this, and I can't say I'd particularly want to.  The necro AA that raises a fallen PC to serve as your pet for a short time would be cooler, imho, though we don't really need that either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To me it seems it would be very situational.<br />
The only practical thing it seems it would be useful for is rezzing the person that will rez the rest of the fallen group members after-the-fact, or to rez someone that needs to quickly get back to loot something.<br />
<br />
Also, if it indeed would work as a true Sacrifice then we would not be able to be rezzed and I'm not sure I would be willing to give up the xp lost to get someone else back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kanigit007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not a freaking Paladin.<br />
<br />
Why the hell would a knight of the dark arts want to sacrafice himself?  Funk dat.<br />
<br />
Now I can see this...<br />
<br />
Hey you... Ranger boy, come here.   Now, Click Yes. (Ranger dies)<br />
Good...  Ok, Cleric Res, INC. (yay)<br />
<br />
-K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So, following on Kanigit007's idea,  we'd have a spell just like necros, only our version of an EE would be no rent ?<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to have a spell that uses an EE that gives a 90% rez, or a 0% rez that takes a cheaper/easier to get reagent. There have been numorous times that I had wished I could rez other people, if even only at 0% exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Situational ? Yeah, but most of everything we do it situational. This would be helpful in raid situations because we could Fd and rez a cleric like necros are able to do...<br />
<br />
The only down side I could see is our ability to get places. I mean, sure the rez would cost an EE, but we can Ivis, IvU, and FD our way to people's corpses to do rezs, leaving us the most mobile rezing class (though at a cost).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vici</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd rather not get a rez and I don't beleive it's something we will get. Rather get something that helps us tank better or lets us do more damage or better healing, but rez is not high on my wish list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rez would be cool in any form that we could get it...<br />
If we had to sacrifise one for the good of the group to get our dead cleric back to rez the rest. Then hey thats sweet..<br />
<br />
If we could REZ someone and at the risk of us coming close to death then thats cool too..Like set the rez to leach HP and mana from us...Cause us to go into the REZ effects with them. We can MED and get a heal later.<br />
<br />
Hell lets REZ em and make then our servant for 10 min hehehe..That would be cool..If ya die under my comand then to freakin bad.. You should have RUN in the first place ..lol<br />
<br />
Idea is nice but if they dont then fine. the are other things we need  more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">no res.<br />
<br />
'nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Soledragondead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want my res I've got lil trouble with it.  However think of this.  If both sk's and pals both have res then the warriors will either ask for more aa's or more dirrect tanking upgrades.  Our main roles are tanks and ask any paladin when the last time he was asked to group cause he could res.   <br />
<br />
Personaly if you get resses I want warriors to get a aa ability called  &quot;mechancial revival&quot;  It'd bring a person back to life in their full clothing.  Any items gained while &quot;dead&quot; would be lost except soul bound items.  The person would be back from dead but at 100 hit points and unable to move til 500 hit points were returned on top of the first 100.  This would not be a res but would allow one to be done later.  It'd need to be done to a corpse with in 5 minutes of death and take 45 seconds to do.  It'd require specia &quot;clean banadages&quot; and &quot;tiny knife&quot; and a vial of &quot;magical blood&quot;   All trade skillable and averageing 100pp per &quot;set&quot;   Why do I want these added?  Because warriors could feel the sting of buying regents for the group.   I'm still botherd by eq making incite instant and non failable as with AoE taunt too.  but since they are in the game as is I'm willing to work around them now.</div></div><hr />
