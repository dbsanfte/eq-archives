<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sars</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, all new SK here, wonder what the exp penatly is for the iksars, I have heard from 20% to 40%. But I want to know for sure.<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">20%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bunnyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">20% is right. There is a 20% xp penalty for Iksars as a race. A long time ago there was also a class xp penalty. They got rid of those and now there are only racial xp penalties.<br />
<br />
Iksar and Trolls = 20%<br />
Ogre = 15%<br />
Barbarian = 5%<br />
Asslings = +10% (Yay, you get more xp faster for playing an assling lucky you.)<br />
Everyone Else = 0%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sars</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys. This will help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bick is Good</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a quick question:<br />
<br />
Weren't the XP penaltys just verant messing up on coding and not wanting to admit it?<br />
<br />
kinda like the hell levels?<br />
<br />
-bick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, they were put there because Iksars have less downtime than others (same as Trolls) due to regen.  It's their way to &quot;balance&quot; things between the races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well ya gotta pay somehow to get something that other races do not have</div></div><hr />

Still trying to figure out what benefit the low fire resist is paying for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkenesis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Part of checks and balances.<br />

Don't forget, you also get to Slam with 2h weapons from level 1, when all the other non-Ogre/Trolls have to get to level 59 and spend, at minimum, 24aa points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rukog DethBryngr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye...but it's just ignorant and stupid once you reach 60+ and the regen basically means very little and everyone's got fairly easy access 2H Bash/Slam anyway.<br />
<br />
Why continue to penalize for something when the benefit has largely disappeared?<br />
<br />
THEY'RE KEEPING THE MAN DOWN!  RISE UP MY BRETHREN!  RISE UP!<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Never minded the exp penalty for the regen/large race slam. Ogres have unstunnable/slam and Iksar regen/ac for the penalties......always figured it balanced out for the most part.<br />
<br />
Still think the fire resist is over the top though and ridiculous for a race which thrives in a hot swamp. (ancient pet peeve)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In traditional fantasy trolls one weakness/fear was : fire.  That and gnome porn.<br />
<br />
<br />
/em does a full body quiver and gags at the thought of gnome porn.</div></div><hr />

HA! I fear no flame foul elves, come to yer death!<br />
<br />
*Recoils in fear as they open up issues of Play Gnome and flash the centerfold his way*<br />
<br />
AHHHHH! MY EYES!!!!! Even I am not that cruel to you stinkin elves!<br />

Anyways ... yes traditionally Trolls and all regening species in fantasy have feared fire as it negates their regeneration ability. Look at the story of the Hydra and how fire was needed to stop the heads from regenrating.<br />
<br />
The low fire resist is just that a low resitence to fire, the swamps of our birth are just hot and humid. Now if the very air was constantly ablaze I could see the low fire resist not making sence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kebsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I always thought that iksars should have a 15% penalty until about level 46 or 50.  Cause thats when the AC thing starts to become less of a pain in the ass and more of a bonus.</div></div><hr />
