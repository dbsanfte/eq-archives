<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged 19 in Paludal and I'm wondering about playstyle.   I prefer to hang back and Dot, or assess the situation before I attack.  With pick up groups in Paludal it is all helter skelter.  I have not been the main tank yet, but I feel it is &quot;expected&quot; of me to rush in and attack like everyone else instead of assisting the MT, waiting for mezz(which never came from our bards resulting in deaths), or tackling adds myself.  While I am hanging back a second, rangers, bards, shaman and even a druid are just rushing in and attacking bandits even though there were 3-4 mobs and only 3-5 of us!<br />
<br />
This is my first tank so maybe I am playing wrong.  But I think if I'm not the main tank or the puller and we get 3-4 bandits which could lead to death, notably mine, I should assess the situation first before jumping in.  I saved our group because I got tired of this bullrush mentality by hanging back a moment to check for mezz then fear the mob on the bard, dot an add then assist the MT with the add on me instead of the bard.  I then used HT on the next mob to get it down quickly and by then the feared mob came back and we killed it easily.<br />
<br />
Also, to run or not to run.  We just killed about 5 bandits and were low on health when another popped and went after the MT.  The cleric was OOM and we were away from the group.  The MT was lower on health than me and no matter what I did, I could not get the mob off him and he died.  I proceeeded to attack the mob when another add was on me and I was at 30%.  NO ONE was helping since all were either LOM or low on health, I guess.  Someone said run so I ran to zone and made it.  I come back and the Bard that doesn't know how to mezz, play mana, or use instruments says I should not have run.  He was the one who told me to!  Should I have stayed and died or should tanks not run?<br />
<br />
Am I playing too much like a caster?  This is my first tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shadowfox98</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No you did fine, as a hybrid it is always good to asses the situation if you are not the MT.  When playing as a off tank, or just damage, a mob doted at the wrong time can be catastrophic.  Always think of what you are doing.<br />
<br />
As for taking one for the team, IF all the others had begun to run, or if you had the mobs full attention (agro) then you should run when they say and not beat them to zone line.  When you are the MT then it is indeed your job to die if needed to get your group out safe. *shrug* but I wasn't there so can't say for sure if you did anything wrong in running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razs Meows</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry yet.   At level 19 no real strategy is involved with play.  It's 90% zerg, 9% equipment, and 1% intelligence.  You ^ your intelligence and wonderful things can happen, but generally it doesn't matter 1 out of 500 times will it be bad.  You increase your equipment, same effect (except having low skills is more likely then 1 in 500).  You increase your zerg, same effect.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you still have these problems when you're in your 30's and up, it's time to get a new group.  Assessing the situation is a good thing unless you are the main tank, in which case, grab agro on one and let every one else do their job.  If some one is getting beat on, get agro, but try to avoid dots if you have a mezzer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At your level, what you did is fine. As you get higher (into the 30's) and get this nifty little thing called Feign Death, what I always found myself doing when shit hit the fan was get as much agro as I can. Snare shit, cast Terror on shit, nuke shit, whatever you need to do to get agro, and keep agro while your group runs. Once they're all out, you FD. With luck, you've just saved your group a complete wipe, and once you get good at it, at worst you've saved your group by sacraficing yourself. I've done this everywhere from the Dreadlands to BoT to Kod'Taz. Other than that, when shit happens, just do what you feel you should be doing. That's that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, in most areas, I'd rather people just die, and either get their corpse<br />
dragged or wait for it to pop in graveyard.<br />
<br />
For exp groups, you're either over-reaching your abilities, or you have alot of<br />
dumbasses in your group if stuff is giving you trouble.<br />
<br />
Possible Exceptions to the above:<br />
<br />
a.)  Sewers.<br />
b.)  LDoNs.<br />
c.)  Raids.<br />
d.)  Anything I haven't thought of or mentioned.<br />
<br />
Sewers are a major pain in the ass, IMHO, because AFAIK, you're not able to<br />
bind in Barindu.  At least, that is what my cleric buddy told me.<br />
<br />
LDONs, you're on a time limit, so as much time as you can save is valuable.<br />
<br />
Raids, because while as unlikely it is that you're going to save a raid or give<br />
anyone much time if you're doing anything difficult, you still gotta try.<br />
<br />
Also, notable exceptions, if you're in old-world zones with no other groups, or<br />
groups not in somebodies train path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morganti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are already thinking like this at level 19 you have the makings of a good SK.  You probably wont see much in the way of real group tactics until your 50s at this point...everyone under 55 (or even 60) is either a true newbie (with no one teaching them) or a twink (with gear which makes tactics unneccessary).<br />
<br />
You got the right idea...I agree in that if I am not the tank for the group (rare but it happens) I wait a moment or two before assisting the tank on multi-pulls, to see how the CC team handles it.<br />
<br />
At lower levels its a bit more difficult to get aggro without doing damage, to assist the chanters or what not, but once you fight non fearable mobs, firing off a fear spell is great taunt, buying your enchanter a needed moment without interfering with mez.<br />
<br />
Oh, and double points to you for checking here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the replies.  I am now 20!  I went back to Paludal after a solo stint in FoB and Kurns.  Exp is really slower.  I was the MT in a pickup group with a Druid, chanter and mage.  Went fine until chanter had to log.  Druid was puller and pulled two w/o being at full health.  They beat him down before I could get to them.  <br />
<br />
How do I target mobs more quickly?  <br />
<br />
I should have hit the assist key to cast my DoT but instead I tried to target a mob and cast Dot and druid pulled the mobs past me to the group.  I had to turn around and run back. still trying to cast a Dot so I could get aggro on one and then the other.  He died and we killled the mobs.  He later left and I was MT with mage and cleric.  Sweet group!  I pulled and and kept aggro on one/two mobs getting healed by the cleric.<br />
<br />
Why do druids/bards pull when they can't handle adds and don't use lull?  Why not have the SK pull?  We can take the hits.  If bards lull or any class lull, it makes sense for them to pull but to do so and expect me to take aggro off you from 2 mobs when u are low on health is a bit much.<br />
<br />
Btw, my taunt is 102, I have a 19/29 +10 int hammer from the bazaar (nice!).  I always cast Dot to end fights quicker or to keep aggro unless group is really strong.  I cast alot in fights to make up for my low str.<br />
<br />
When I dinged 20 a screen popped up and suggested I go to Mistmoore castle.  How is that for a lvl 20?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mistmore is great for the 20's now.  Usually a pick-up group or two of lowbies on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing to keep in mind about Paludal Caverns.  PC is THE spot to PL your new twink, so most of the people there are twinked out the ass.  At that level, many non-tank classes can tank just fine against bandits because of the quality of gear they've thrown on their twink.<br />
The first, last, and only concern many of them have is getting the most exp/minute.  This frequently leads to overpulling, and some people just decide that their character is invulnerable.<br />
Many people don't see any point in trying to use tactics in PC.  At least, not until they find out that their twink is still capable of dying.<br />
<br />
Once you get past PC, you should start to see people paying more attention to group tactics (although there will almost always be one or two idiots who don't know what they're doing, and don't care).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dinged 21 after exploring a bit.  I went to Mistmore and meleed a blue down.  It took FOREVER to kill the blue.  It only took me down to 83% but I thought I would be able to kill faster.  I'm using a 19/29 hammer so dps should be good.  My only frame of reference is a lvl 19 bst and my 16 mage and my bard.  I know I will never reach the killing pace of my mage but I thought I would be closer to my bst.  My bard can't kill anything with melee!  I bought a bow to take less hits and do more damage but I'm not sure how much it will help solo.  <br />
<br />
Does it get better or worse?<br />
<br />
Also - I went to Neriak and tried to do the reaper of death quest and they would not give it to me.(I'm an erudite SK)  I have all the info from EQilizer and Allah and still it did not get past doing something for the dead.  I thought the reaper could help my dps but after dying in Neriak and still not getting the quest, I gave up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want DPS, get a two handed weapon with a good ratio.  19/29 isn't bad for a one hander, but there are better one handers around, the Ebon Mace (19/24) comes to mind.  If you want a really good twink weapon get a Reaver, I think it's a 40/40 two hander with no recommended level.  You'll hit the damage cap until you get to level 30ish, but after that it'll be one of the best weapons available to you for some time.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and using a bow as an SK isn't really going to help your damage output, our archery skill caps at a mighty 75.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Concerning the question about running: there are situations where running is a good idea. Generally, a few conditions have to be met: you need to be fairly close to a zoneline, you need to be able to do it without training other people, and the group has to actually run when run is called. the reason it can be a good idea to run providing the above conditions are met is that many experience groups break up after a group wipe, or, at the least, it takes quite a while to get everybody back and fighting again. It can be particularly handy to get your cleric out alive (in cases where cleric is in the group). <br />
Once you have FD, often you will not be running in many cases. But it's important to communicate to your group: I'd have the healer be in charge of the decision, but also get everyone to agree that when run is called, everyone run. If you are near the zoneline, zoning and re-zoning takes a lot less time than dying and rezzing etc.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you're using Mace of the Shadowed Soul, which is a good weapon, but do keep your eyes open for a 2-hander.<br />
<br />
I recently started an SK alt and did some fighting in Netherbian Lair. I'm really not sure whether this was blind luck or what, but I met some very good players there. It was particularly striking after PC, lol. and finding some good players to group with is, hands down, the best ZEM going.<br />
<br />
As for why bards do things, hmmm. To know why they do what they do, you might have to think like them. /shudder. All I can tell you is that a good one can do some really nice things for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lvl 22 now, finally!  Took me forever to get to 22.  I think I am a bad group magnet.  I was in Mistmoor with a group last night.  Had a cleric, 2 chanters, druid and mage all red to me at 21.  Druid pulled 3 reds.  Instead of running to me, the druid runs around at SoW speed and I just grab the first mob I can get.  I figure the 2 chanters will mez.  I was wrong!! Someone yells Run and I just see hit bars going down so I pull another mob to me.  Everyone runs but me and the cleric.  I want him to go but he dies and then I die.<br />
<br />
When I get my body back the Druid says we really need a tank. (!!??!!)  True but with ony 3 mobs and 2 chanters with a druid that can root, we should have wiped the floor with them.<br />
<br />
If I stop playing my Sk it will be because I can't trust CC to anyone else and I will pick my Bard or Chanter back up and lvl them.<br />
<br />
I went back to Paludal and made 2 days worth of exp in 30 min.  Sad when Paludal levelers are better groupers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's because in PC, everybody is so twinked out of thier mind it doesn't matter if they can play good or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Once upon a time Mistmoore was a great zone to be in for leveling in the 20's and 30's. Moving from CY, to GY, to Maid/Butler/Kitchen camps was really great as you leveled up and it was a good learning exp on the way up.<br />
<br />
Its too bad that those types of places dont get used that much anymore. Then again there were some HORRENDOUS castle trains back then too. <br />
<br />
In my mind Mistmoore and Unrest (ghost to zone !!) will always be kings of the train because they were the first and worst when we were all new and every day seemed exciting.</div></div><hr />
