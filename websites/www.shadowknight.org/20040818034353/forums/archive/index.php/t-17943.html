<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadow_Lore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
I've been trying to complete the Fell Blade Quest for the armor pieces. The pelts drops are relatively easy to get. Though not easy. Getting the calcified bone drops off of skeletons...lets just say you'd be better off playing the damn lottery!<br />
I killed hundreds of skeletons and got nothing but rusty ass weapons and bone chips. Not that I'm complaining about having bone chips...but jeez!<br />
I made my way to Nektulos Forest. There is a camp that has a ton of Calcified Skeleton pops, greater skeletons, zombies, halfling skeletons and regular Skeletons. It appears that you can only get the Calcified bones from creatures you con light blue or stronger. I am 13 lvl and was lucky enough to get a 8 level beastlord to camp with me. He killed all the green trash and let me loot them for Calcified bones. I got 2 pieces off of Greater Skeletons myself.<br />
I've looted a lot of creatures who have the components for the newbie armor of other classes and getting my own components has been hard as hell. This is the NEWBIE QUEST! Come On!<br />
Anway....<br />
I don't know if it is true that you can only get pieces from creatures you con light blue or greater to but I hope this info helps all my Erudite ShadowKnight brethren get their first quest armor!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scrion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got calcified bone pieces from skeletons when they conned green in Toxxulia Forest, though they did seem to be a lot more common on light blues. <br />
It did take me a while to get all the pieces.<br />
Just a few pointers for anyone who is going to do the quest in Toxx Forest (it might be faster in Nektulos, I dont know since I did it all in Toxx):<br />
<br />
1) Skeletons spawn more often on the Erudin side of the river, so it seemed. Be very careful though, esp. if you've done the Heretic Kobold Molar quest several times. Phaeril Nightshade, a paladin of the Deepwater Knights, hunts this area and was KOS to me. Hes about 25th lvl or so, so he'll drop you pretty fast at low levels.<br />
<br />
2) Buy the Sense the Dead spell (assuming you are lvl 9, of course). This is invalubale in Toxx Forest. Dont wander around aimlessly on the Erudin side. Take careful steps and cast this till you sense a skeleton. This spell makes it a lot easier to find skeletons and, as a bonus, is a nice way to raise your divination skill.<br />
<br />
3) The nice thing about Toxx over Nektulos is there isn't many players searching for the pieces. Usually I was the only one in the zone.  If it turns out to be too difficult, it may wise to heed Shadow Lore's advise. I never tried Nektulos myself, but it quite possibly could be better. <br />
<br />
Good luck to any future Knights of Paineel. It may take a lot of work, but the reward is worth it. It may not be the best armor stat-wise, but it looks damn good and there is, of course, the pride factor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">calcified bones only drop from greater skelles and calcified skelles.  the rules for no drop quest  items not dropping from green mobs only applies to Roleplay servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You may just be having bad luck.<br />
<br />
I did the entire Fell Blade quest series. For the calcified drops I split my time between Neriak and Toxxulia. I pretty much camped the same spot you mentioned in Neriak (little obelisk right by the Eastern Commonlands zoneline) and use the method listed above for hunting in Toxxulia. The only calcified drop that I had any trouble with was the ribcage.<br />
<br />
The advice listed here is dead on. Like I said you may just be experiencing bad luck. If it helps you at all I did a pretty lengthy write up on the entire quest series. It should still be lurking around here somewhere.</div></div><hr />

calcified bones only drop from greater skelles and calcified skelles.  <br />
Or, in Toxx Forest, from normal skeletons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AlucardusDoomblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Originally posted by Vinnayeny Vloshanaal <br />
 the rules for no drop quest  items not dropping from green mobs only applies to Roleplay servers.  <br />
<br />
<br />
but on the roleplay server....the items aren't no drop anyways so no worries there...people shout it out all the time anyone need such and such? and then bring it to you if they have the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PLW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont know what level you are but if you have locate dead, use that and kill anything you track. The normal skeletons drop the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Khayenkil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i got myself a full set of newb armor and no drops for most all the other item slots... i keep it around for the heck of it...<br />
every once in a while i will put it on... /shrug looks kewl... but boy do those stats suxxor</div></div><hr />
