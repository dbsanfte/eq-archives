<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seinharu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to know before its too late... is the Shadow knight Epic really worth getting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yuggoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you enjoy doing quests....<br />
<br />
If you can get guild or friends to help in Kunark era zones...<br />
<br />
If you NEED to have the coolest looking weapon in the game (even if it now sucks)...<br />
<br />
then yes, do it.  Otherwise, don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will say one thing.  If your guild is far beyond old-world planes, you'll be wasting everyone's time.  Its a quest to be done when your guild is at the phase of growth.<br />
<br />
You know the quest.  You know the stats.  You know what else is out there.  Answer the question for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drakang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had to go on a few pickup raids and drag friends back to the planes. However I have no regrets on finishing the epic. I am still wielding it in combat as I haven't had the opportunity to upgrade from it. Adding one of the new DD procs to it makes it a bit nicer. Yes their are nicer weapons but considering the proc (nice aggro and healing) the stats the ratio as a whole package its still a pretty good weapon.<br />
<br />
Also I have seen people walk past the guy with the goldenrod or othe weapon to tell me how cool my sword looks. The sense of pride in accomplishment makes it all worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nycathis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I Wouldnt KNOW!!!<br />
<br />
Im STILL hunting the damn HIDE!</div></div><hr />
