<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satist</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1-5 and make good pp??  Let me think...  Ah, I know, Karnors, would be a good place for you.  Especially if you go there wearing cloth armor.  There's an AC bonus in that zone, people wearing all cloth armor only get hit for 1-2 points per melee round, for only 2 melee rounds before the mob dies.  <br />
<br />
  And, as if that weren't enough, if you go in there with all cloth armor (yes, even cloth sandals, and a cloth mask and neckpiece) and a rusty short sword, and a buckler, (note: rusty sword and buckler have to be equiped), you get the automatic bonus of also getting a 20 point damage shield (part of the zone in bonus, I swear)  so that when the mob hits you, and you hit it, it dies, you get all the xp.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention the 1kpp per hour drop rate.  by time you hit level 5 in there, you will easily make 30kpp.<br />
<br />
You can stay there until level 10-12, since it's a newbie area, and by level 10, you will have made close to 100kpp, and have gotten all the rare drop level 8-12 spells, which each sell for 30kpp, minimum. <br />
