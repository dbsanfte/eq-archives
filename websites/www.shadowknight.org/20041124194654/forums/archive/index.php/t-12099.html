<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayrr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just started playing EQ a few months ago i am a Dark Elf Shadow Knight i am lvl 11 and i need some help. i sure would appricate any suggestions on how to lvl faster how to obtain better weapons and equipment pretty much any information would be helpful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Graveseeker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get to 15 or 16 and go up to the moon and go to Paludal Caverns and stay there till about 24 or 25 head to Highhold pass till 31 or 32 and then go to ot untill 40 then you have a few choices you could LFG in DL or you can go solo in GD either way its up to you should help you for awhile... ABOUT money ect. When you reach 25 or so go down to The warrens and get your faction up as high as you possibly can buy to opal encrusted stiens and kill paineel guards for awhile all will be dark blue and they drop bronze weapons and shields make about 200-300 Plat an hour that will give ya some cash to spend... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Figure out what the high level people don't want to bother harvesting, and get that....bonechips are good, spider silk used to be good before the loy...dunno what it is these days....Learn cities well and guide high level players when they get lost....I've given all sorts of things to a newbs who answered some question I didn't want to bother figuring out in a city I hadn't been in for a few months...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>krikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mace of Shadowed Souls (19/29 10 INT 1hb SHD only) and Clay Guardian Shield (25 AC 50 HP)never cease to amaze me. they're both perfectly good pieces of equipment, and are both less than 100p in the bazaar. Once you're upper 40's Low 50's, you can use Weighty Pole arm, which is like 29/35 10 AC 15 AGI and some other stats maybe? It's 2hs, and like the 2 items listed above, despite it's badassness, it's so common that it's rarley above 200p. As for armor, Crustation Shell is a good source of STA, while Sentient armor is good for INT, both are important stats, and both suits are cheap. Low AC however. If anyone's ever killing Dwarves in Icewell, armor drops there which I still use at 51, and it rots most of the time. So see if you can tag along. Cold Steel, from Velk's, is alos REALLY good AC, and really cheap. this is not because it's so common, but because it's so heavy. But if you don't mind the weight, Cold Steel is inexpensive and good AC (no extra stats tho) if you can find it in the bazaar. <br />
As a SK, I did LoIO (17-27) Then FM (27-32) then random places including the guards in WC, then OT (36-45) which I solo'd alot in the 40's, then DL/KC then on. get Experience wherever you can find it, and don't stay in the same place if it's getting boring. Making the game enjoyable for yourself is better than leveling fast in a boring zone, so do whatever you like best. It IS your $12.50 a month, anyhow. And remember, it's not too late to make a Troll/Ogre/Iksar :) Enjoy your SK, hope that stuff helped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best way to make money period, is with tradeskills. You could buy low, sell high buy why spend so much time in the bazaar?<br />
<br />
Get your tailoring to 115, or even 88 and make 10 slot backpacks. They have a 10% weight reduction and every is always wanting them. You could also sell tailored quivers (gives haste to archery) for a decent price also. <br />
<br />
They sell between 65 to 85pp, you can either hunt the HQ bear skins, or buy them off of newbies for 25pp or so depending on your server.</div></div><hr />
