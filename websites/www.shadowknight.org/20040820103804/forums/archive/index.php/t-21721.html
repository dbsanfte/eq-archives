<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have spent several nights clearing the Vampyre Castle in TM trying unsucessfully to get Valdanov Zefeer to spawn so I can finish up my Loyalist Shield.  I've seen him up before (on a different toon before I had decided to do the quest) so I know where to look for him, I just can't seem to get him to show up when I want him to.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any tips at all on how to make him (or Heratius) show up?  Or is it just completely random?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">... are convinced theres a chance Heratius Grolden can spawn after the final named vamp dies.    The paladin that helped us kill off Valdanov said he seemed to get Heratius on every fifth or 6th clearing or so.  He had been camping there regularly for ages collecting ashes for his guildies and friends.  Another SK I walked through the quest one day took this advice, and got her ashes after the second clearing.  <br />
<br />
I don't know that I believe it particularly. Paladins are usually goofy:P  and people like to spot patterns that aren't really there.  I DO know that both times Heratius Grolden has spawned when I was there, it was about 4 or 5 mins after I had killed off the last named vampire. <br />
It could well be coincidence, as the spawn is too infrequent to easily spot a pattern.<br />
<br />
I'd say camp the castle some more, kill the named off when they pop, and check the balcony for Heratius frequently.  It may just be a function of time spent *shrug*<br />
<br />
Of course, when Heratius pops, kill him, and Valdanov pops.  Btw, the winged fucker instagates when low, so fight him on his spawn point, or have someone there to whack him when he ports.  The first time he spawned for us, there were only two of us on, no healer, so we kited him down to 10 percent, with thoughts of stunning.  No go.  Poofed, regained all his HPs before we could re-engage, and depopped.  He doesn't stay up all that long.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe it is random.  I have had him spawn with all named up and hadn't even killed the entrance vamps yet; I have had him not spawn after hours upon hours of clearing the castle (which I can barely do while 2-boxing [i.e. minutes to spare before respawns]).  I have had him spawn three times within a 2 hour period, and not seen him for a week of vamp killing every night.<br />
<br />
I have done or helped do approximately 7 Loyalist Shields for toons and guildies (one each for my sk and cleric).  I read everything I could on Alla's, pally boards, cleric boards, etc. and although there are many theories as to how to make him spawn, I truly believe it is random -- and not based on PH's or server resets or any sort of scripting or timers.</div></div><hr />
