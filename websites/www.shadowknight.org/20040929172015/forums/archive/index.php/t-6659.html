<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nekrosis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to decide between a human sk and a dark elf sk that I have been playing for awhile.  The human one is lvl 15 and the dark elf is lvl 9.  Anyway I've been trying to ask other shadowknights on my server about which one I should go with and I keep hearing them say play an ogre, troll, or iksar.  I think those 3 races are great but I dont want to play one of those.  They also tell me that if I go with a human or dark elf that I wont be good at tanking or taking damage from mobs in fights.  I know we are tanks but I like the look of humans and dark elves and would like to play them.  Can anyone tell me if they can be good in fights and maybe help me out with which one of those 2 seems more my style.  Thx.</div></div><hr />

Humans are even across the board, but you have the best faction of all races, so you also have the best chance to get into towns that most SKs would not be able to. <br />
<br />
in the end game, most SKs are about even for tanking ability. at 60 its more about your class and gear, then your race. <br />

maybe that helps a little. personally id go with human because there are so few around. Unique is fun.</div></div><hr />

but I must ask.<br />
<br />
Which do you think fits what you see as &quot;your own&quot; shadowknight? As in if you yourself had a chance to jump into the game and be whatever you want which would you think would fit you the best?</div></div><hr />
