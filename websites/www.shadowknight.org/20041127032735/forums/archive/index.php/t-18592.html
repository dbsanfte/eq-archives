<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a good place to solo @ 55, getting bored with HHK nobles and bards, looking for a place like HHK but with more dark blue to 55 and nice xp bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xikuliz Litecleaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure myself.  Just doing gay mistmoore until I get the cheap 40 AC bp...nice upgrade for me.  Gunthak wouldn't be bad in LoY at the luggald castle.  My beastlord friend smoked it and most of the other content.  The docks in Dulak isn't bad either.  Torgorian Mines doesn't look like a good place, but if you zone into Nadox from Torgorian (or get a wizard or druid to evac you there using lesser evacute/evacuate).  There are temple patrollers there I kill with my wizard.  Single pulls, you can't fall into lava no matter how it looks for some reason.   Pull them to near the zoneline, and I would short fear first to get a feel for it.  Like LoY the resists are fucked here, so sometimes you'll burn alot of mana in one fight (wizard's perspective, but was doing this at 52, better at 53).  Invis works for awhile here, you can run about and peak around.  A named spawns here, don't know if he see's invis or not.  They drop swords that sell better than FS, decent plats and more gems than most places I solo.<br />
<br />
Another good place is Chardok.  I do this with my SK due to is good accessability and place on Kunark, which I think still has some of the best content dungeon wise.  Kaesora, Howling Stones and Chardok blow away anything LDoN can generate..<br />
<br />
Use short fears here, use a pet too.  Once you zone in you have to go a short distance to zone out if you're not familiar with it get a map, it's not really far at all, and chances are you'll get out unscathed...just harmshield and run to it =)<br />
<br />
Occasionally, I've seen an even con (scary to me alone at 55 dual wielding a whip and staff.  Last time a named was dual weilding he had an Etched Steel Baton and a decent rogue slasher that procced dooming darkness.  I've gotten Stave of Shielding here off a trash mob, and other decent midlevel nowday loot...just mark it really cheap in the bazaar, it's the best way.  <br />
<br />
Chardok=cool<br />
LoY content=cool in some areas<br />
<br />
Don't go too deep in chardok and you'll be alright.  sucks having to burn harmshield on getting rooted with 10 piss sarnaks running at you.  And screw the sarnaks.  They are just out of line slaves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the information I was looking for, can't find quality stuff like this in the hunting grounds list.<br />
I look forward to checking this stuff out, thanks alot !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>natus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could write way more than I need to but here's some suggestions.  I'd recommend donating for nice buffs before venturing out solo.<br />
<br />
Old World:<br />
Lower Guk.  Lord Hall is nice and blue.  Faction hits given for Crown of Deceit quest.  Decent exp and coin.  Downside, lots of 65s farming faction / Arch Mage and other named.<br />
<br />
Sol B.  Decent exp and usually empty anymore.  Can be dangerous if you get 1 too many LDC adds.  You get to see what Boil Blood does finally.<br />
<br />
Kunark:<br />
Chardok entrance is nice if you're real sharp.  Downside is you can get adds easily there if you don't time repsawns.  Bonus for Chardok is the random drops can get ya some cash.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones isn't a playground.  There is no zone out close so you need evac and getting a rez in there can be big trouble.  If you can get a necro, pally, and cleric with keys to join ya that place will be cake.  This zone was revamped so the mobs hit a little harder than they used to (mid 150s) deeper in the zone.  The pit is good fear kite once it's broke.  Loot usually comes from named mobs only and coin is so so.  Experience is very nice.<br />
<br />
The Hole.  If you're an sk and haven't hunted here you may want to reconsider your class selection.  This zone also revamped and a little more difficult now.  You could prolly handle the zone in elementals though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Velious:<br />
Kael bank area.  Faction and possible armor drops.  Mobs should single easy.  Kill the roamers first in the hallway that comes from EW to bank.  Then start pulling.  Just watch out for Bvellos.  Coin and exp are so so.<br />
<br />
Velks entrance.  Haven't been in here in ages and heard they fixed the fear pathing.  Exp is so so.  Coin comes from silks / velium / rare quest gem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin:<br />
Try the Gray.  Once you figure out what spot to set up in that zone is cake.  Will be decent exp and coin for you til 58.  Can usually hop a ride out to pok with the druids root / dotting mobs near Ssra.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye.  Can be done at your level but will take forever fear kiting.  Experience is ass.  Cash is ass.  Don't bother.<br />
<br />
Paludal Caverns.  If you don't care about Shadowhaven factions, there is a camp of miners deep in the zone.  Nice exp and coin.  Downside is they are on top of each other and very social.  Also hit fairly hard.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert.  Hit the plateau and fear kite for days.  Mobs have a nasty proc but overall it's not that difficult.  Research pages and the occassional VT key shard are it for loot.  There are a couple of named that spawn but might be tough at 55.  Experience not that bad for an outdoor zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Planes of Power:<br />
Justice fear kiting was nerfed.  Get a shammy, chanter, beastlord partner.  Or join a group there.<br />
<br />
Disease - Rats are semi easy fear kite due to streaky resists.<br />
<br />
Innovation - grouping is your best option.<br />
<br />
Nightmare - go back at 61 when you get Ignite Blood and Festering Darkness and agro kite.  Yardtrash won't touch you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ykesha:<br />
Dulak.  Nice coin, easy fear kiting, decent exp.<br />
<br />
Nadox.  Miners might be tough due to social proximity.  Better off zoning in from Gunthak than Dulak.  Head toward the bridge and kill the ogres.  Experience is nice.<br />
<br />
Torgiran.  Go back after 61 solo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Natus<br />
Lanys Gravelord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaklaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fear kiting in dulak suxxorz. Umm lets see  PoD is kinda slow exp but doable try to get haste if you can makes things easier. Honestly just group it is much faster.</div></div><hr />
