<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I suggest that the developers and programmers at SOE actually listen to us! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's the stupiderest idea I have ever heard, don't you think SOE would have already done it if it was really a good idea ? Duh. If SOE listened to us we would all be running around at level 1000 with TimeIV gear and flying around with red capes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I would have requested a dark blue or black cape! :) <br />
<br />
I wish they would listen to us. Many of us have similar wishes regarding AA and spells. Many threads are out there requesting weapon improvements, help with 1 hand/shield to make it a fair alternative to a 2 hand weapon, the wish for a compined hp/mana shroud.<br />
<br />
Some of these SKs play the class much better then I, and yet seem to have a very similar wish list. Of course the developers could eliminate the &quot;stupid&quot; requests, but since we are paying the 12.95 a month, shouldn't they listen to us?<br />
<br />
We don't want to be &quot;over the top, but if we are supposed to be the DPS plate class (I think that is SOE's vision) why shouldn't we get some weapon skill and DPS output improvements? Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
I really do not want more stuff to cast, just improve my spells that I do have and let my sword hit a little better. That is all I want. And maybe a reason to use my shield/ sword combo more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget about the frickin lasers attached to our heads.<br />
<br />
I'm j/k man. Don't mean to knock on a serious thread. Kinda bored at work. I do agree with ya to a certain extent, especially now that you put it that way. The small things that would help our class be more defined are ideas SOE should be listening to. Make the player base happy without going overboard. There are some pretty stupid ideas out there though, like most of mine. Why stop at lasers ? A deathray coming out of my penis would just rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It would be nice if they listened in some cases, but in most cases, it would be the shits.<br />
<br />
Bugs, problems, stacking issues, etc.....yeah, listen, and fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;this AA would be nice&quot;, or &quot;This would rule&quot;, or &quot;Shadowknights need Slay living&quot; , or &quot;Wars need more HPs&quot;, I hope they dont listen at all.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is read a class message board or two to realize that most players have no concept whatsoever of game balance.  This directly translates to &quot;most of your suggestions are stupid and would screw the game for everyone&quot;.<br />
