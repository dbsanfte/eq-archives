<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently started playing in GOD and decided to play with trash mobs at zone line.  For the life of me i cant remeber the dot the mob used (A Noc Cadavor), but it had a poison based icon and did initial dmg of 700+.  I can't wait 6hours till i get off work to find the name in game. Its driving me nuts.  Seach Beasty for more info but nothing, hope someone remebers and i believe other mobs in other zone (riwwi) use a similar dot.<br />
<br />
My next question, lets just say this dot has a resist adj of -300 what would my PR have to be to resist it. (i tried looking for this spell on lucy but i just wasted my time since i did not know the name of the spell).  Did search for minimal resist and did not find anything to answer this question.  Any info is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Profett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">could it have been chaos claws that you are referring to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looking at the data on lucy it looks like thats it, but if it is, i have to ask another question.  Lucy says resist is Chromatic (sorry i dont use lucy much) does that mean i can not resist it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe that Chromatic takes your lowest resist and checks against that...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So is there a rule of thumb out there for resists? besides &quot;get them as high as you can&quot;.<br />
<br />
Resist adj + your resist = X and if X &gt;Y chances are good you will resist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From my limited understanding, to even have a chance to resist, (your resists) + (resist adj) have to be &gt; 0 to have any chance to resist. After that I think it depends a bit on the level of the mob and the spell being cast on how much over 0 you need to be to resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you for the info</div></div><hr />

What role does Caster's level have?<br />
<br />
Always thought casters level, spell level, spell resist check, MoB level all played a role in addtion to resists.  Feel free to correct my thinking, it's all based on impressions, never anything I read or heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From my days in ToV, I've always assumed that Resists, just like melee, take into account the difference in levels between the object casting the spell and the object being cast upon. In ToV, if you had 100 resists at level 50 you would hardly resist anything, if you have 100 resists at 60 you resisted most everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I understand it, resist adjusts work like taking that much off of your resists. So a -100 spell that checks MR would sorta work against you as if you had 100 less MR.<br />
<br />
This means if you had 100 MR, you'd save as if you had 0, and 0 to a resist means you're almost assuredly going to be hit by it, and hit hard.<br />
<br />
I have tested with myself as the caster when I was testing for enchanter BotB, so let me make it clear that this is by no means necessarily accurate being a) long outdated and b) could fall under some different rules due to it being cast by a PC rather than NPC. However, those are just possibilities and not necessarily a real difference. So there's your disclaimer.<br />
<br />
The rule of thumb I've found was 80ish would be about right to resist spells. CONSIDER ALSO that naturally, since I was casting spells on myself, that it was saving vs a white con spell... most ubermobs are considerably higher in level and thus you'd need more of a resist to balance that out. How much is beyond me.<br />
<br />
In practice, you get all the resists you can, and worrying about it only comes into play in the case of a) running out of buff slots - maybe clicking off that talisman of the tribunal for something else is a good idea or b) resist gear, which in all likelyhood won't make a really statistically significant difference anyway unless you have a whole lot of resist gear.<br />
<br />
Regardless, if you can wind up with something like positive 250-300 or so (just a guess from what feels right, don't take it as science) after resist adjust is taken in, you should be safe from the spell all or nearly all the time against standard boss mobs. It's a sliding scale from there on in. If you're fighting blues, maybe even being net 100 is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maujin Buu'jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well then i guess the &quot;magic&quot; number for Chaotic Claws will be somewhere around &quot;230&quot;.  At least now i have something to shoot for.  Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daarksun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">230 will resist maybe 1 in 10 procs of Chaos Claws if you are lucky. Even at 500 all resists, a disturbingly large percentage of them seem to get through.</div></div><hr />
