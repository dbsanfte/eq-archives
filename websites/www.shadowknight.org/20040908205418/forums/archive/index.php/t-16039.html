<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I thought about races the other night before I decided I might quit. I always seem to hear &quot;Well, all characters are good end-game and are all equal...&quot; Thats great and all but...who wants to play with these idiots for THAT long? I don't know about you but it takes a lot longer to get to end-game than you think if your un-twinked and if your troll/iksar then you have a crap's chance of getting respect from those morons in your group.<br />
<br />
   Just a suggestion...unless you want to have morons on your head the ENTIRE time for what seems like an eternity...do NOT pick Iksar and DO NOT pick troll as starters...20% xp pen only makes you stay with these idiots forever. Don't pick gnome because you'll get crap for it and you all know what I mean. Ogre is fine if you want the 15% xp pen but thats only 5% off...no bias here. Human is find I guess...nightblindness sucks honestly and using Deadeye a thousand times sucks balls...erudites always get the crap in my groups and they are always used as more casters and almost always refused as shadow knights...So basically go Dark Elf...that is what I wish now my troll is certainly been fun but this game is NO WHERE near what it was like when Kunark hadnt even come out yet.<br />
<br />
   Didnt come here to start a fight just a suggestion. Go ahead and call me an idiot or a moron because honestly I dont care if you do and maybe I am but I think we are ALL tired of the idiots that we put up with everyday...dont deny it you hate them too and you have thought about quitting..../shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you see the &quot;High Difficulty&quot; at character select? It wasn't a joke. Some class/race combinations are a lot harder than others, how about trying another combo. SKs of all races are very, very hard comparitively. Some people enjoy that sort of thing, others see it as a frustrating waste of time. It seems like you might be in the latter.<br />
<br />
It's just a game so if it's pissing you off, stop. If you think it's specifically the race class combo, try something completely different for a week or so and see if you enjoy it. Pick one of the class/races that have it easy getting groups and see if you can walk that path. Who knows, perhaps halfing druid is more your style ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>saesann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Vaelenu<br />
<br />
i play a iksar sk, read the difficulty part, and press create character. dont regret it one bit. i dont mind not being able to find good or decent equipment. i play a beastlord for god sake. so i know what its like not finding anything good.<br />
did that stop me, hell no. my bst is 62 and still going strong. saesann is 31 and i love every minute i play him. <br />
to tell someone not to choose a particular race just because you didnt succeed is just biased. <br />
maybe you should step back, try a new one and see if thats what you like. i think someone said if you start wondering about a race that race isnt for you.</div></div><hr />

I want to be unique not Dark Elf Shadowknight # 19437854 on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No No No, I mean I actually love my troll. I love to play him and I think it's funny when idiots forget that I can hide and Shadow Step in duels. I love the fact that he regenerates but sometimes when I am stuck on one level for months I wonder if its worth it. I am thinking about quitting because of the idiots that play the game...I know that there are some that like to RP and I am part of an RP guild but...I am so sick of these people that refuse to make the game fun for everyone...I am tired of hearing &quot;What is RP?&quot; or &quot;RP is gay&quot;...just something that bugs me I guess..</div></div><hr />

Well then, good luck in whatever you choose to do next.  The only way to deal with the idiots is to avoid them, which seems easy enough to do if you are able to find good players and make some friends.  And as long as you play your character well, you'll make friends, because the good players are always trying to get away from the idiots.<br />
<br />
So either you didn't manage to make enough friends in the game, which could be due to any number of factors, or the idiots on your server managed to make your life miserable no matter what you tried.  You're probably better off finding another game and hoping that your luck is better . . .<br />
<br />
Then again, if that was your point, this probably should have been posted in the Flame forum, not Race Discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sometimes get sick of all the “Idiots” as well, (trust me...lots on Sullon Zek) but I’ve started playing for my own enjoyment and not for the juvenile satisfaction of the idiots.<br />
If I’ve had enough, I’ll go somewhere and solo or visit zones I’ve never seen, talk to NPC’s I’ve never talked to or search for quests to do. I enjoy the game the most when I look at it as if I’m going on a journey somewhere (pick a zone) and head out and look for adventure.<br />
The added thrill comes from going to zones owned by Neutrals or Goods. Having a hunting party after you can be thrilling and satisfying. On a PvP server, there never really is an end game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Calamity_Daemon, I understand you're Idiot gripe, but they ARE everywhere, even on Shadownight.org (whispers, 'Don't tell, our secret.') and yes, they make enjoying the game difficult. Ask yourself, 'Do you enjoy the game?' If you answer yes, then you are playing for you, noone else. I too started playing the game by myself (no friends/guild/higher character) and in time (took awhile) I made friends in/out of game that add to my in-game experience (some even from here!). Now that I have friends, I find that playing is a lot easier (friends and I compare the idiots we're grouped with) and makes the time go a lot smoother. Nowadays, I hate to log off. Someone from here said it best, 'Its not about the game, Its about the people IN the game.' For every 10 idiots there IS 1 good player (estimate) and that 1 player can make the difference in-game. Once I was a lonely waif, now I'm in a guild, friend list is full and always grouped. To quote Virginia Slims, 'I've come a long way, Baby' and so can you. Hope it works out for you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, well the only reason I am staying right now is for my guild. I love them like family and we are the only people on Inny server making this fun right now. I've been a member of House of Decay since Kuglog was level 12. Now I am Juggernaut of Decay and I love roleplaying...although there is a bard named Stormyfeet who I hate and really makes this game crap. There is a guild called Pretty Pink Prancing Ponies that drives me crazy!! Why did the GM ALLOW THAT!!! I swear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It seems to me Calamity that you are letting the little things get under your skin. Stupid people and stupid guild names will always be around, the only way to deal with them is to get over it and be the best sk you can. You say you love your guild, then only get in guild groups. Hate the prancing pony guild? Get over it. Revel in it being 20% harder for you to lvl than everyone else, it will hopefully make you a better player.<br />
<br />
Ultimately there is nothing in this game that should make you miserable, if you find yourself dreading it then it is time to retire.</div></div><hr />

Who cares really? The charactor is what YOU make it in the end. If you've lost track of that idea perhaps its better that you do quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that name is pretty funny!<br />
<br />
Our server has &quot;Guardians of the litterbox&quot; That would have been a very funny guild, if only Vah shir were the only ones allowed to join. But they of course were recruiting anyone over 30, so it wasn't as funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides, I can't recall a time when ANY class has been turned away simply because of their race. That's just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>hardcoredummy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">20% xp pen only makes you stay with these idiots forever <br />
<br />
20% xp penalty means it'll take you 20% longer to reach 65.  That's not a lot of time... it took me approximately 10 days fully twinked... so with humans it would have taken 8 days, whoopie-do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;-------untwink and I made Kuglog when all these new zones came out and didnt know where it was still good to hunt and all. It was a shock to find LoIO uncamped...like 2 people in the friggin zone when I walked in. But yes perhaps I am letting little things get to me. Kuglog take approx 5-6 hours to level and I figure thats average in a PoJ group at 51 and its only gonna get harder...I just wish people would RP and make things fun like they did before it was all about the weapons...</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I find that it's the opposite for me.  For every idiot that I've run across, I've found 10 pretty good people.  Was in a guild full of them until last week when we disbanded, and I'm applying to another guild that is full of that sort of person.  Mature, friendly, helpful, unselfish, really enjoy playing the game.<br />
<br />
If you are friendly to people, they'll respond in kind.  The jerks get isolated pretty quickly unless they figure out that they're screwing themselves by being jerks.<br />
<br />
And of course, not letting people get to you is important.  I think that is one thing that's causing Calamity grief.  Don't let the little things bug you and you'll relax a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stupid Folks exist at all levels.  The other day in BoT I was there with my chanter and we had a Lower Earth Camp.  ME trained 2 (yes OMG 2) giants on us.  I started mezzing the adds when I looked at the group screen.<br />
<br />
- SK tanking the unmezzed but slowed mob<br />
- Ranger arrowing and starting to cast heals<br />
- Rogue disbanded nowhere to be seen<br />
- Cleric zoned<br />
- Mage zoned<br />
<br />
My god its only 3 giants for cripes sake.  Anyway the 3 of us killed all 3 giants.  I was yelling at the other folks to get their butts back into BoT to help us.  So the point being, morons do not disappear anywhere by level (in fact I call BoT the Plane of Paludal Caverns).<br />
<br />
Stupid guild names.  Many people are not entirely serious.  One of our oldest guilds on the server is the &quot;Munchkins of Mayhem&quot;.  My favorite though is still &quot;Order of Fries&quot;.  I think its a good way to relax at times (My old DAoC guild was the Knights of Ni on the Tristan server - We had Ni Tag and Ni Patrols - We also discussed the taste of dirt from different zones - We quoted Python in guildchat...how much more fun can you get?).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Razoren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Personally, I'm actually enjoying playing an Iksar Shadowknight. The funny thing is, I don't notice the experience penalty because I don't think about it. Maybe that's what you should do. Play to have fun! Don't think about how much experience you are gaining or NOT gaining in this case. In fact, I think alot of the reasons people get burned out is because they get such a high level in such a short amount of time they miss alot of the enjoyable aspects of Everquest. Dungeon crawls, interesting raids, building friendships as you pass through each level. Heck, put 100% experience into AA's. You're 52 according to your magelo, and that's the last level you can fight Vox/Nagafen. Become the ultimate Vox/Nagafen raid leader. I guarantee you have fun, gain valuable play experience, make friends, and gain respect. Get comfortable with the game and it will be comfortable with you.<br />
<br />
Also, avoid the so called &quot;idiots&quot;. Some of the things I do to keep annoyance down. Turn off OOC, and SHOUT. Turn off names. Enjoy the actual content of the game while avoiding things that annoy you.</div></div><hr />
