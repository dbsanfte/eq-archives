<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guyz im having trouble getting my scrolls from these, it seems everytime i loot one it says its lore and i cannot use! <br />
<br />
But i already have the one from the failed crypt raider and 1 scroll from the courier each lore and called the same name. Could it be cause the courier i keep killing only drops one type and there are other couriers somewhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my experience each Courier has a chance to drop all the scrolls. Just keep killing them and make sure you are killing all 3 spawns. You have a 1 and 3 chance with each kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What Kowl said. It's all random as to which scroll they drop. Keep at it and you will get them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morbent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ah tx alot!</div></div><hr />

I have found one spawn point, where is the other 2? /loc of all 3 would really help thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I might be a dummy but when I looked up the Spectral Courier in the City of Mist it says he drops three scrolls.<br />
<br />
I will be attending a City of Mist raid tonight and may have a shot at the Courier. <br />
<br />
Which scrolls do I need? All three? If only one which one? Are they all named the same thing (like the stupid pages off of the froglok raiders) or are they named differently? If they are all named the same thing and I onyl need one how will I know if I have the right one?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The couriers each have a chance to drop a page.  There are 3 different pages, and you need all 3.  ALL the scrolls have the same name, but they are lore, so you will know when you try to loot it if you already have it.<br />
<br />
For more info, look at the sticky at the top of the page.  It has all the answers and more for the quest.</div></div><hr />
