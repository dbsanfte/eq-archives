<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, here's the problem. If you read my last post, you'll see that Gorven responded, which is good. Me and him got together and did the soul leech MQ. He turned in the soul leech invis'd and i turned in the ghoulbane, blade of abrogation, and the decrepit sheath directly after. But when all was said and done, HE ended up with the corrupted ghoulbane. Is this some kind of bug in the way a MQ is supposed to work? Has anyone else experienced a similar problem? If so, did gm's help you at all? And...can I continue with the rest of the quest and bring Gorven back in at the end to mq the corrupted to lhranc if gm's wont help? Please answer if you can. I spent way too much time on this to get fucked this way :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oopsies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This isn't a problem bud, have your friend MQ the Corrupted Ghoulbane, mine was... Have him start hand in, Invis Undead him, hand in, then you start Will, Head, and Heart hand in, have someone Invis Undead you, hand in, and poof, Human Lhranc spawns, and either starts buffing if your not kos, or attacks you, easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rolukk Earbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So if I do all the rest up to the last turn in, then he turns in corrupted, then i turn in the rest, it should all work out? I dont want another fiasco like the one i just had.<br />

Human Lhranc only attacks once hailed.<br />
Which works if you wanna negate the first HT and some melee damage by hailing with Harmshield up.</div></div><hr />
