You'll know you're in the right place when you pass the gallows.  The Mistress PH is a banshee, or at least that's all I saw in the couple hours I needed to camp her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Westa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Named is on the second floor at the top of the staircase.  There are 2 other mobs in the building... one on the first floor and one in the room with the named.  Wondering if the second mob in the room can be pet pulled from outside without aggroing the named one.  Any one know?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why would ya want to? I just took out bottom one then pet pulled her into stairwell then brought her out. Didn't do this camp solo though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just pet pulled PH/Named to the staircase in between the bottom and top floor and never killed anything else but the PH/named...Was about a 2 hour camp for me. Did it solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just temporarily gave up that camp. 15 or so hours so far and no sign of that bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wyrdlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just be glad it's a solo camp.  I've done hours waiting on the Breeder, and I have to drag friends there with me.</div></div><hr />

I must say, the MoM camp blows hardcore. I even got a decrepid hide before i ever got MoM to spawn  :eek:  but first time she spawned she dropped the essence, so i was out of there.<br />
bottomline: around 2 weeks ~4 hours a day camping MoM<br />
have fun!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">10 hours...no mistress....<br />
<br />
but...you can definately sit on the stairs non-aggro between spawns of the PH to regen and med...and i had no trouble soloing the PHs with only self buffs as a 67 sk with no OoW spells...<br />
<br />
suspect ill bring in a bot to duo mistress just in case...but should be a fairly simple duo...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uaell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i really didn't think that MoM was much harder than the regular trash. If you don't have a problem soloing trash, then i don't think you will have a problem with MoM if you are full health full mana. but then again, backup never hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">probably true....esp since im not using HT or leech on PHs...<br />
<br />
but still...since its easy to add a boxed druid...ill probably do that when the bitch finally spawns...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ephyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">went back...planning to spend the day....she popped after first PH....dropped her easy..but did have the druid bot along so used him for insurance...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I killed that named just before the quests came and and it dropped the essence.  It rotted since no one knew what it was for bah!!<br />
<br />
I dont remember exactly though where.  Recently I was hunting at the gallows and pulling from a two floored building near the wall in what I thought was the area.  Seven hours and no luck, so I am not sure I was in the right spot.  A malevolent banshee did spawn there.  It did have some mobs downstairs as described.  It was sort of south and west of the gallows, on the west wall with one building across from it to the north.  That right?<br />
<br />
I could have sworn the other time it was further north that I killed it, but again, not clear.  Was with a crazy necro friend killing every named we could find in the place.  It was a blur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moardok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The building she spawns in has 2 other mobs in it...1 mob down below on first floor and one up on 2nd floor next to her/PH. <br />
<br />
If that helps ..i noticed that most other buidlings have 1 mob bottom and 3 at top 2 normal mobs and 1 PH/or named but it may have been just that part of hate but if i remember correct her spawn was only one that only had 1 other mob on the 2nd floor so makes it some what unuiqe.</div></div><hr />
