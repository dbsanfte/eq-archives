<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is Nolarr of Maelin Starpyre.  I discovered a great spot for exp which SK's in low to mid 60's with 0 or very little AAs can tank and get fantastic exp.  The spot is considerably better than BoT, Wall of Slaughter EW and WW.  I can't tank the Assassin camp or Muramite Proving Grounds, and this is the next best exp spot in line.  <br />
<br />
The spot is the small network of murkglider caves in Wall of Slaughter NORTHEAST of the zone-in from Nobles Causeway, but south of the wall dividing the zone in half.  <br />
Several things to know: <br />
1)  the mobs hit about half as hard as bazu, and somewhat less hard than the ferans and chimeras, but are 1 level higher!  (65, compared to level 64 bazu) With my garbage AAs, I can easily get by with a beastlord slowing and just a druid healing.  A shaman healing would work just fine but they're have to canni pretty hard.  <br />
2) Every mob in the cave sees invis, so you need to port out or fight your way out.  <br />
3) The mobs drop no loot whatsoever, and there are no named murkgliders.  This is a price you pay for great exp.  <br />
4) Every 4 or 5 passes, and aug drops (rare drop).  <br />
5) EVERY mob in the looop is single pull, except for 1 pull in the smaller room where you get 2 mobs.  tanking both at the same time should not be a problem.   That or you can split it.  <br />
6) They are also all level 65, so the continuous pulling makes for fabulous exp.. have your group move and fight.  plus because they don't hit hard you run no risk of dying<br />
7) Mobs run.  Snare them.  Other than that, you will be immune from trains in here except ones you cause (very safe place to level).  <br />
<br />
So, with that, I think I've found a easy, safe, fast and pleasant levelling spot for casual SKs like myself, looking to progress and gain levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vindarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what garbage AAs? what gear? what level is your toon? etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aphyon D'Veldrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Caves are great up to 67-68<br />
<br />
Especially if WOS is packed with clean up crews,i'm guessing garbage AA's he's talking about might be 10-30AA's he has tops,him tanking with no def aa's etc<br />
<br />
If you have gear that ranges from bazaar bought,ldon camps,GoD drops etc, you'll do fine, just take people you usually hunt with and you should do fine take a druid or cleric, only top shamans would heal in caves from my experience,might find a few who would like the challenge but only a few...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>raker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok this sounds interesting but exactly how much the mobs hit for would be real nice to know as a general rule.  I got trounced in Decay from a mob that was hitting pretty fast for 510. <br />
<br />
I am a 64 SK and i am with a 63 druid.  My gear is all bazaar bought but it is the top of the line more or less...including Ferocity 2 and cleave 2 augs.  My hp = 6k and my ac = 1650 with aura of pain.  I can get 7200 but need wunshi and Convict (which is not all that easy to come by yet...on bertoxx anyway)  No Defensive AA's only CF 2 (yeah yeah I know was stupid to get those im working on the others once i hit 66....Anyway will this be good enough to 2 box with just the druid healing?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
