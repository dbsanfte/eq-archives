<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It varies by the server economy, whats good on one server is bad on another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">everything good was nerfed. anything left with a decent ratio will probably be nerfed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kralthan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">By making tribute more expensive the amount of people who are going to use it will drop even more.  People in uberguilds arent going to care about 150hp, and have better effects on thier armor already than tribute offers.  Once they drive away the rest of the casual gamers from the tribute system its gonna be nothing but twinks.  Then again, its mostly just twinks using it now I'll wager.</div></div><hr />

If i had to choose between the old way(easy tribute but no way to turn it back on easily) and the new way(&quot;normalized&quot; tribute, harder to get) i think i'd choose this way.</div></div><hr />

Not balanced at all on localized servers as we still don't have the turn it on/off possibility, but we have the nerf... <br />

And if anyone posts them on a board, you can guarantee that that item will have its Tribute value lowered also. But like I said, I've not found any new ones that are what some of the old ones were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bushido32</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDON drops have uniformly good tribute returns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>appren hightowerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I've changed my use of tribute after this patch, for my main I always had 150hp running, now I have 150hp + various resists + regen X, but only turn it on for stuff like Quarm etc. For my SK I used to have full AC and HP running, + affliction haste 1, but I guess I'll only have it on against tougher mobs now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I knew about some nice stuff too, but I would never post any of it in a public forum like this. It just leads to it being eliminated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well, all the items that are turned in are kept track of i'm sure, so they probably have no trouble running a query seeing what items are turned in, and what items are turned in the most often. then if anything stands out, they will change it. the only bad thing is they haven't increased the prices for other things that are ridiculously low (like GoD drops).<br />
<br />
anyway, i spend most of my time idle with tribute off so even if i only get half as much tribute i'm still doing better than before. and at least they didn't retroactively nerf how much we have gotten.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and to get it out of the way - yeah, im retarded, didn't search, and probably lick goats. /preempt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AoWtho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's basically a system where you donate items/pp for 'stackable' buffs that take up no buff slot.  The effects from tribute all count as worn effects.  You can get attack, FT, focus effects, regen, HP, mana, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i have 200k trib from the foraged hammer thing:)<br />
<br />
sucks got nerfed though, even with 200k banked i never use trib cuz it to much a pain to get those points bank now hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sionya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Those 200k tribute gonna be so usefull banked forever .. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's s00per fun for end-game peeps who do NOT have plat flowing out our asses for tribute.  I missed the few days that the tinkered bait worked, and everyone stayed hush-hush about every other item worth a damn for cost efficiency.  Being 150 hp and some-odd AC behind because I missed a few days and am not rich is a sad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Parasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What do ya expect in a world like EQ where money is flowing from mobs to the paying people? They then trade money among each other in the bazaar for items... with each kill and plat looting and blue diamond selling more money gets created, but rarely gets destroyed or lost or flows back into the NPCs..<br />
Add the facts up that a gazillion of plat was duped.. per server I guess... with exploits. Rogues were able to pickpocket Traders in bazaar when Bazaar came out at first. You were able to make money with tradeskills..<br />
<br />
EQ is basically simply inflation where money loses its value day by day... Heck ive seen a stack of Spider Silk going for 100pp.. and I guess by now thats cheap... I remember when it was like 5 to 10pp....<br />
<br />
Tribute and Casino are just Plat Sinks... obv reasons...~</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tinkered bait was retroactively nerfed so you missed nothing. Any tribute obtained from it was reduced to zero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're really end-game, you should be able to go farm pp and items for tribute fairly easily.<br />
<br />
If you mean that you spend all your time raiding and never do anything else, maybe your game is too one-dimensional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tribute isn't so much a plat sink as an item sink.  The vast majority of tribute that enters the game comes from people turning items in not from plat I would be willing to bet.  Sure you might spend some plat in the Bazaar to get that tribute but the plat never really leaves the economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If their goal is to get rid of platinum, they should make tribute a platinum only service and reduce the costs by 2/3 or more.  I'm growing weary of it constantly being nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have been skilling up smithing to do these...and collecting ingrediants....for the purpose of getting tribute....<br />
<br />
not sure if this is still worthwhile....with changes in tribute values? any idea anyone if the tribute values for these have been changed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Slivers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Agree, Brael, on the intent being item focused.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling it is more IT network/storage related than SOE truely wanting to see items out of the EQ economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Casino = plat sink<br />

<br />
Yah, if they raise pp's value (compare to items), most of us will sell pp for the points.  Demand on pp goes up, then item's value will go down.  That is not something they want.  They are trying to make a stable economy enviroment.  Plus, all item selling and buying means more time sink ! hehehe <br />
and thats ultimate goal of such game.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It's one of the only ways to get items out of the economy, and to some extent, on my server anyway, its been working. <br />
<br />
What they have to carefully watch (and they are very close to that point now, if not over the line) is nerfing tribute points on items so far that the whole system becomes unused. <br />
<br />
There will always be a small percentage of rich min/maxer types who will use it, but in order to attract item donation by the majority of people (the only way it works as an item sink) they have to balance points recieved versus platinum value.  With the EQ economy keeping the majority of players platinum hungry, it reaches a point where you think twice about donating something you could sell.<br />
<br />
I am at that point now, after the current round of point nerfage.  Prior to that, even using legit items of good ratio found in the bazaar, I had no qualms at all.<br />
<br />
Nerf the forged picks and the ones that are obviously way out of whack, but don't drop the ratio TOO far, or the system won't work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">When Sony first &quot;fixed&quot; (AKA fucking nerfed it) tribute, that was the moment GoD was a total ripoff....I couldnt even get enough points to get some resist buffage for a raid that was worth half a shit....and I have to turn in a 6k weapon to do so...what the fuck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I sure am thankful for tribute (item sink) and casino (plat sink) combo in game! We didn't have item decay all. Only thing they can leave the game is from deleted accounts. Now we have &quot;item decay&quot; via Tribute and plat decay via casino. Good job SOE. Those 2 little things sure stablize EQ economy SOME. Better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Tribute is supposed to be for special situation needs. You can't expect it to be up 100% of the time to support you as permanent &quot;secondary gear&quot;. That's why its too expensive to keep it up 100% of the time unless you are devoted to maintain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I for one create items with the singular intent of turning them in for tribute.  I would have never bothered to farm those items for platinum, and they would have never entered the EQ economy through actions of my own.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>vilesoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">true, it is for special situations..but I found more often than not, that at least at my point in the game, i can jsut get better buffage from a shaman if one is with us.  Not being thelevel to get all the buffs and all.<br />
<br />
Does tradskilled items yield better Tribute than their mob drop conterparts?  Just wondering if my blacksmithy will ever have a use beyond making silvered weapons and armor to hand out to newbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sure, vilesoul.  I farm POP tailored items to turn in for tribute.  I don't see why the same couldn't be true for blacksmithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I for one create items with the singular intent of turning them in for tribute.

<br />
But, following the original question: what do you make, more specifically?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Robes of Haunted Dreams, from Plane of Nightmare.  Used to be 19k now they're 9k tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>ghoule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I used to use Blades of Insanity, had a VERY nice return tribute wise on my plat cost...used to that they went for 10k Tribute and change and on Karana they cost roughly 1k plat...now after turning in roughly 10 of them (still have 90k banked, so I am not entirely sure) they just go for 2k and change tribute.<br />
I dont mind a few nerfages and decreases of obvious problems (forged picks, clockwork bait) but thats a pretty serious drop. Glad I found out before I started picking a few up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Okami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I was buying copper hammer of striking at 6k and tribute for 26k.<br />
Now they are 12k, and cant find one cheaper than 7500.<br />
Still trying to find something decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Good luck finding something decent Okami, I went through every item on lucy last night thats 15k and up tribute, couldn't find anything really worthwhile</div></div><hr />
