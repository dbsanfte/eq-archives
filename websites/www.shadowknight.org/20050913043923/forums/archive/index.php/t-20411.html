Go to your server boards.  They're very easy to find via Altavista or Ezboard search, but since you ask, here's the link:<br />

When you stop to think about it, very few of us here know anything about Morell Thule because of course we play on different servers.<br />

The most usual response to your question is to have some annoyed poster point this out - if you get the information you want here it'll be a fluke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashrai</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post on the MT Boards in the &quot;Guilds&quot; section. Indicate you are looking for a guild, post your playtimes and most importantly: what you want out of a guild (raiding, family style, etc)</div></div><hr />
