<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Post them if you've found some (aside from chests which are now fixed, unless it's a multi group mob that you did post patch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Reaper's Sting Recourse is overwritten by Kinsong, the bard epic click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>grinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the click effect is supposed to heal you on every melee hit right? not just a &quot;chance&quot; to heal on every melee hit.<br />
<br />
acuse a couple times i have noticed that it hasn't worked on the 2nd or 3rd hit [in a double and tripple hit] some times, at first i thought i must have just been healed and it thus has not healed anything but i noticed it again the other night in MPG when our cleric died [train from some bard running past].<br />
<br />
just interested if anyone else is noticing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Teleran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grinder, I am betting that you are not seeing the heals from some hits since the amount healed is to low to be displayed.  You will only see the amount healed if it is over a certain amount (I don't recall what this amount is at the moment).  With the epic effect only healing 20% of the damage you deal, it is very likely that the amount healed by your hits is falling under the &quot;displayed&quot; level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Larazel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New epic on Torv thanks for all the help here.  Anyone else seeing inconsistent and odd numbers from taps with the focus effect?  I have seen anywhere between 1062 and 6 from Innys Touch.  I have only seen the really low numbers a few times but the 6 was a crit tap!!   :eek: <br />
<br />
Just wondering if I am losing my mind......again.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sinzarrett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed Olidan twice now on Zeb server and he dropped nothing.  How bogus is that  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Killed Olidan twice now on Zeb server and he dropped nothing.  How bogus is that  :mad:<br />
<br />
As far as I know, that's not a bug. I heard that awhile back, that he doesn't drop the phylactery every time. Not necessarily a bug, just SOE's decision about how the epic drop should work apprently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tyrs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone else seeing inconsistent and odd numbers from taps with the focus effect?

Might be a &quot;partial resist&quot; or you tapping through a rune on a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phaed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was in Chardok B and things got a little hairy, so I clicked Reaper Strike to get a little extra HPs, and then a mob popped on me so I clicked Leechcurse.  Both were active at the same time but the only healing messages I got were from the Leechcurse effect.  Reaper Strike Recourse was still active, and the icon stayed up throughout the time Leechcurse was up.  I think Leechcurse overrides the small lifetap Reaper Strike gives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, they don't stack. However that falls under then &quot;working as intended&quot; category. It's not a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aelali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Both were active at the same time but the only healing messages I got were from the Leechcurse effect.

<br />
I tried that out too just to see if it worked (didn't expect it to, but wanted to check anyways, you never know).<br />
<br />
What I'm curious about, is if the accuracy bonus from Reaper Strike stacks with the bonus in the Leechcurse disc. I imagine it would take quite a bit of parsing though.</div></div><hr />

Afterthought: or do I have some sort of texture/graphics problem?<br />

*Edit (after Valkyrie's response) -- I read up a bit and I have to delete my animations xml file so that it will load the default one.   :o   Bug report retracted!  (and thanks hehe)</div></div><hr />
