<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BohortSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, figured I would throw my 2 cents in.  I read Brael’s post on a protection of Calliav type spell and it made me think.<br />
<br />
If this has been brought up before I apologize, but has a melee reflect spell or disc been discussed? <br />
<br />
We are supposed to the offensive tank, I think.  A short duration /disc or spell that reflected all incoming melee damage might do the trick.  Not long enough in duration to MT a raid mob but long enough to be useful in a raid to get heals on the right war, and long enough to be of some use in one group content.<br />
<br />
This would scale with content, both in groups and in a raid setting.  Provide much need melee short term melee immunity and be very much in the spirit of the shadow knight class.<br />
<br />
Balance would be achieved in the duration and recast/reuse. If reflecting 100% of melee damage is considered too unbalancing, another value (i.e. 80%, 50% etc.) could be used.  A line of aa could be introduced to compliment the system.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I would like to hear your thoughts etc, and as I said above, if this is old territory I apologize.<br />
<br />
For reference I play on Sullon Zek and at the moment my guild is working through Uqua. We lack Paladins, Rangers, and Druids as we are a hard coded teams server.  We suffer from low population. At times we cannot even fill our Uqua instance with the maximum 54 players (bot army included).<br />
<br />
There are many raids where we only have 3 warriors on line for an attempt and trap tanking falls on the senior shadow knights.  I run about 10033 hp fully buffed, 2k ac and I NEED some sort of melee immunity/mitigation ability. Wiped a raid a few weeks ago because I died before heals could land on a 5 mob trap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree that a melee immunity disc would be welcome, but I think that a melee reflection disc would be overpowered.  A disc such as the one you describe would vastly increase our DPS while tanking, especially if tanking more than one mob.  Granted, burst damage, to one extent or another, has been an SK trademark at times, but a reflection disc of any meaningful length would far surpass a maxed out IHT or Manaburn, and I don't think that's a road we want to travel.  A parry or riposte disc I think would be far easier to balance, and probably wouldn't generate anywhere near the resistance amongst the other classes as a melee reflection disc would.</div></div><hr />
