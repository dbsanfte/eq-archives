<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mortre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sense they changed the way disc's worked awhile back I can't /disc unholyaura anymore(kinda obvious) but here is the question.<br />
<br />
How can I set up one hotkey that pop's the disc AND HT like I used to.  I can't stand waisting a hotkey slot for the disc and another for HT when I used to be able to pop both abilities w/ one hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just change that line to simply &quot;/disc unholy&quot;<br />
<br />
then /alt activate 86 as normal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaediil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am guessing it is my UI, which I need to figure out, but I can't seem to click off a discipline. Until I figure out my UI, is there a way to do it in a macro? So, something like the following:<br />
/disc unholy<br />
/alt activate 86<br />
/undisc unholy<br />
<br />
I want to be able to pop my leech discipline right after I popped my HT in case I need it -like I did last night when I found myself tanking TT at 5% unexpectedly, just after HTing.  Somehow the MT and ST dropped in a hurry and I wanted to help stay alive long enough to get the healers on me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The disc command wasnt working for a bit.  I just checked it online and it is now working correctly again.  Use your old hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, your old macro should work, except you might have to change or check the exact wording behind the /disc word.  Looks like that's been covered and I'm guessing it's working for you again since you didn't mention it in your second post.<br />
<br />
To turn the unholy aura disc off, so that it doesn't continue 'running' long after you've done your HT (which prevents you from using any other disc), use CTRL-C to bring up the combat abilities screen and left-click on the icon that appears there.  That will enable you to use leech curse.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it'd be nice to kill unholy aura with a macro and a pain to do it this way but at least if you already have the combat abilities screen up to click off the icon, you can just hit your leech curse disc button right from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Askeer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very nice sig, Shadoh !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks )<br />
<br />
Lol, message too short.  There is a min. of 10 characters now?</div></div><hr />
