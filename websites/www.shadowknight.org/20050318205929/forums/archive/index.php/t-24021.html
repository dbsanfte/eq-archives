<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uaelaelil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought i would put a  post on the Lore what was said  for the final fight  in rcod.<br />
<br />
'Hail, Filligno the Slayer'<br />
<br />
Filligno the Slayer says 'Yes, yes, Gilina said you would be coming.  I can help you in your battle against Lhranc!  I have a personal vendetta against Lhranc.  He killed my twin brother, Gilligno.  This is going to be a tough battle.  Lhranc has been reincarnated as a powerful general of the Mata Muram army.  Are you [ready] for me to attempt the summoning of Lhranc?'<br />
<br />
say, 'i am ready'<br />
<br />
Filligno the Slayer throws Lhranc's earthly anchor and the globe of discordant energy above his head. To your amazement, they begin to hover. 'Oh mighty, Lhranc!  We have slain your minions and have the blade that you seek!  If you want it, come get it!'  Filligno looks your way.  'What?  You wanted a more elaborate incantion?  It really doesn't take much to anger him.  Trust me.'  A moment later the ground begins to shake and a mighty voice booms out, 'Fools, I have followed the steps of this pathetic weakling who believes themselves to be a shadowknight.  Now your lives will end and I will retrieve the blade destined to be mine!  All of Norrath will fall before the might of the Mata Muram!  Attack!  Leave none standing!'  Filligno begins to cower in fear.  'The blade isn't mine!  Don't kill me!  Please!'<br />
<br />
Lhranc says 'You are powerful indeed, but I am the first of the shadowknights!  The first to walk in shadow and command the dead!  Now you shall witness true power!'<br />
<br />
'Hail, Filligno the Slayer'<br />
<br />
Filligno the Slayer says 'You have done it!  That wasn't so bad, eh?  Oh, I wasn't really scared.  He just startled me for a moment.  You now have in your grasp the very essence of the power that shadowknight's possess! Hand it to me along with Innoruuk's Voice and I can reward you!'<br />
<br />
Filligno the Slayer takes the essence and begins to study it most carefully.  After what seems like an eternity, Filligno throws the globe onto the floor.  It cracks open, letting loose a stream of ghastly spirits.  Filligno dives for cover.  As the cackling spirits dissipate, a powerful looking sword floats in mid-air before you.  'Take it!  The blade is yours!  A gift from Innoruuk, for the most powerful of shadowknights!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How tough is Lhranc?  All the classes so far who've won orbs finished their epic in Anguish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordosskul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lore on this whole quest has been kind of disappointing. I am sure it took all of a day and a half to write this quest.<br />
<br />
I was wondering about Lhranc 2.0 myself - When 1.0 went live and I did that quest, he was a true monster. Does 2.0 lifetap or HT proc, or is it a quick easy fight?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tumnayar DiSalvo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lhranc sounded quick and easy from what I was told, you don't even really need a strat for him because he's that gimp. Just kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alehop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stupidly easy. Like the whole quest.<br />
<br />
If you get at this point you won't have any trouble with this fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our quest is so short, I mean that's cool that we can get our epic 1.5/2.0 quicker easier then others, but......I dunno, it's bitter sweet. Yeah, bitter sweet.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to complain, this is what we asked for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>marvi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">after dialog, 1 dragon model pops which follows by 3 more everytime dragon dies, so all togehter 4 dragons, after that Llhranc pops and u kill him. We had a bunch of ppl, but i heard its doable with 2 groups. <br />
<br />
And in that time i need to congratulate to Teuen the Tactican who achieved first SK epic 2.0 on Venril Sathir.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got my 2.0 last night.  The final fight is as easy as people said.  At least it dropped a chest though, nice to have at least one.</div></div><hr />
