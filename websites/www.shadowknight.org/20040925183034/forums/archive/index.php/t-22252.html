<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VykusSoulsdrinker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok my last idea for a viable option the the pally/sk stun mitigation issue was disease strike, a melee ability useable by hotkey, similar to bash, that would reduce all damage dealt by the mob by 50%.Duration 5-7 secs, repop every 60-90 secs. Consensus was this only makes warriors tank better, and would have to be more balanced. Well we dont want stuns to be like pallys, we want our own thing right, SO modify this idea:<br />
DISEASE AURA-Surrounds the SK in an aura of disease, reducing all damage dealt to the SK by 50%. Also weakens the Mob so that all damage dealt to the MOB during this time is increased.(say 10 or 20%) Lasts 7-10 secs. repop every 3-5 mins.<br />
This now retunrs us to a raid role, we not only can survive longer with the reduced damage, and even act as emergency tank(IE MT drops with 3% left to kill target) but we act as an instrment to dole out that extra damage you sometimes need to survive some of the tougher raid MOBS, where its either smack it quick or die. We are offtanks now being able to survive long enuff for the MOB to be slowed, and avoid getting 1 rounded. and its even viable for some small group content although not on every mob if pulling fast.<br />
Sorry again if it sux, maybe my previous idea was better, but jus throwing out suggestions...flame on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aadael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Disease Aura sounds like a great Idea to me! <br />
<br />
Maybe add a damageshield to it for a lil bit extra damage  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nytemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds good to me but i think it should last a litle bit longer. I still like the bashing idea would make bashing more fun to use.We should should get an AA in where are bashes now debuff the mob DR by like 100 and raise its disease counter.That would help with the spears and other spells problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If its a spell rather than a disc then there is the problem of resists. Who you going to pick to tank that last 3% the SK that might be able to reduce the damage they take by 50% for 7 seconds if the spell lands...or the ranger who wont take any damage at all for much longer than that ? <br />
<br />
The other problem is any spell that effects a mob directly could oh so easily be exploited beyond its intended use. How many SKs in your raid ? Screw how it effects the SKs ability to tank , but get multiple Sks to 'chain' it and just watch how quickly that boss goes down with an increase of 10% damage being done by the raid.<br />
<br />
Nice idea...wont work..sorry</div></div><hr />
