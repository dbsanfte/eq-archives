<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was helping a friend with the breeder camp and we were discussing how far along we were on the quest.  Long story short, he already tailored the sheath and now we are sitting here camping the mob that is required to get the tome on how to make the sheath... <br />
<br />
so that's my question:  is that part needed?  He already has the sheath made and didnt have the tome yet.  So is it like epic 1, you don't really need the tome to make the sheath??<br />
<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anyone know the answer to this? the possibility at being able to skip the breeder is really appealing to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it seems plausible since he already made the sheath and that is technically the next step after the breeder.  far as i can tell, there is nothing to do with faction crap like epic 1 for getting IV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so the question is how did he do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">gathered the pieces and tailored it as supposed to.  he just skipped the tome same as you could with epic 1.  but for some reason he thinks he needs to get the egg though which is why we were camping it.<br />
<br />
so i am guessing that it is also skippable in 1.5/2.0  just wondered if anyone has heard anything to the contrary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sheath is just a tailoring combine, i did that before i had my breeder too, though without the breeder the Quest NPCs wont talk with you and probably wont accept the items, as you get invis flaggs for about everything you do in this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shainaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">gotcha.  guess i should ask him if he tried to hand it in or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so the question is how did he do it?<br />
<br />
He took the gloom nightmare hide, eye of the dark god, and blessed unicorn hair things, put them in a sewing kit / loom, and pressed combine; that's how he did it.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt you can skip steps of the 1.5 / 2 quests, because there's an invisible flagging system. I tried to kill the wailing sister for her blood / rune, and even after hailing her, she wouldn't become killable. You've gotta do it all, and you've gotta do the fights in order. The only thing you can do out of order AFAIK, is the sheath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>smoses799</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">okie, i just did the combine  and attempted to hand her the sheath... nothing happened.  She just handed me back the sheath.. Apparently we have to kil the murkglider  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, I'd guess as well that killing the Breeder is a must. God I hated that camp with a passion. Course I had some badluck w/ it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You have to kill the breeder, virtually every step of epic turnins (and some kills) have invisble flags on them that prevent you from skipping anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd be pissed if you didn't have to do the breeder, and not because I already did it, mainly because the quest would be way too easy then and every SK and their mother would have it in a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Terronis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's very doubtful that the Breeder can be skipped, BUT I did the Paladins with a guildy and had them before I finished the pre Epic...Long story short, my Paladin bloods were accepted without me hailing or even going back to Kithicor, so it may be a possibility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Breeder's really the only thing holding me up from getting epic.  Deathsting was up last night, if he's still up I'll try to get a crew to come camp murkgliders today and hope for the best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kelefane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I did this camp and Deathsting was up, Deathsting kept warping into camp whenever we got the Breeder solo. I'd try and kill Deathsting first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Deathsting is an easy single pull, just dont pull him accross the breeder and she wont add.<br />
<br />
Only makes sense to clear all the possible adds you can prior to taking the breeder on there are enough variables without adding in another named add during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Breeder dont assists the other Murkgliders..   atlest  he didnt for me i was able pull the room clear then pull breeder...  Thay may have changed this but i distintly remeber noting that i pulled Death Sting solo w/o having to FD or anything even pathed really close to breeder w/o any Agro</div></div><hr />
