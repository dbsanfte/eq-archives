<br />
I'll play WoW in the interim though.  It will have its share of 8-10 year olds, but then so does EQ - and EQ's number is skyrocketing.  At least it's a constant and won't come as a surprise in a Blizzard game, and the monthly fee might even help to discourage it a little bit as opposed to battle.net.  WoW will also be relatively bug-free (almost supernaturally so in comparison to Sony's stuff - being able to log in without crashing would be a great start) and might have actual content and alternative means of advancement, as opposed to Sony's carrot-on-a-stick raiding model.</div></div><hr />

And Schpleef (spelling? :D), pro-sony? You would have to pull out your magnifying glass to see that imo. But just to set things straight: <br />
EQ is without a doubt the greatest game I have ever played. I have spent more time playing it than I want to realize. I dont play much anymore, but at the peak the &quot;gaming-enjoyment&quot; was enormous. Im not saying its perfect and it certainly has problems now. But Im talking overall; looking back.<br />

Cest I'd have to agree; if I didn't love EQ in years past I wouldn't care when I see it being raped by Sony.  It's not so much the fact that the game has gotten bad as that it's been pretty much intentional on Sony's part.  Downsizing 80% of the GM staff, introducing features to attract little kids (http://users.bestweb.net/~buddha/kids.jpg), not enforcing the EULA, etc. have all been active steps in destroying EQ.  That Sony has intentionally killed what was a unique and wonderful hobby in hopes of higher profits (and continuation of the &quot;old&quot; EQ would likely have been more profitable, imo) is what pisses me off so much.  I can't watch my chat window for 2 minutes without seeing &quot;wut u 2 pst plz 4 ne1&quot;, auction spam (in /shout and /ooc no less), and various other examples of EQ's ever-lowering average player age.<br />
<br />
It's pretty safe to assume that WoW will be relatively bug-free as 1) Blizzard has a good reputation in the area and 2) I could write code substantially less buggy than EQ's while wearing catchers' mitts on both hands.  It's just a logical guess.  I certainly don't think it will be the ideal pastime for me, as Blizzard also has a reputation for attracting kids Keevel's age - but then so does EQ lately, and at least Blizzard is competent and has good artists.  WoW can't help but be better.  Seeing you put it down as a product inferior to sony's (afaik you haven't played it either bud) would be comical, if only you weren't being serious.</div></div><hr />

What does sony have to do with stupid dude speak? Younger players have always been able to get their parents to get them an account....and its not always the younger players doing it. This has been around forever so its stupid to say sony had anything to do with it. Gm's have been downsized....there is no changing that... and its been that way for a while.

Didn't you notice the parts where they said that Microsoft is bankrolling and producing Vanguard?  Read between the lines a bit (because no one is going to come right out and say &quot;Hi, we have a big corporate hand up our butts&quot;) and it's apparent that Sigil has the same arrangement with MS that Verant had with SOE...<br />
<br />
Meaning that we'll probably see parallel problems with vision, marketing (toward the non-RPGer crowd for the sake of profit), etc that we've seen in EQ.<br />
<br />
Vanguard looks nice so far, and Woody's review was stellar, but I'm not convinced it's going to be the holy savior of the genre.  Neither is WoW.<br />

It's just that I can't imagine &quot;And no matter how much you want to think you're having sex with a girl it's still just a pillow with a ketchup face drawn on it.&quot; coming from someone older than 12.  The next and &quot;ultimate&quot; insult in the repetoire of someone of that age/mindset is usually an insult about their opponent's mother.<br />
What does sony have to do with stupid dude speak? Younger players have always been able to get their parents to get them an account....and its not always the younger players doing it. This has been around forever so its stupid to say sony had anything to do with it.<br />
Old EQ was &quot;2 hrd 4&quot; many people.  Additions like graveyards, PoK stones, the new tradeskill UI, etc. made it &quot;ez enuf&quot; for your average 12 year old and/or AOLer - which was no mistake on Sony's part.  Doodspeakers have always been there, but their number has skyrocketed in the past 1.5-2 years.  The kids who might be a bit shy about acting their age see a name like Leetmaster or Nigglicious (two I've actually seen on Quell) and realize there's no authority figure there, and they go ahead and spam /shout, or beg for pp at the pok bank, or whatever other annoying little kid things they can think of to do.  And so the problem is twofold; the new EQ attracts more of them, and their increased presence encourages them to act their age.<br />
<br />
I know micro$oft is funding Vanguard, it's the thorn (lance?) in the game's side.  There isn't much to be done about it though, and if you look back EQ had three superb years despite Sony having bought it before release.  It might not be all it could be without that one little caveat.. but it should bear watching.  I'll certainly at least try it out, at worst I can say it's almost as bad as EQ and move on.  On graphics; old world EQ was conceived and released in the late 90's and it makes up a portion of the best of EQ, imo, which ends in Velious, released in '00 iirc.  Graphics aren't everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a huge difference in realism (as in, &quot;This could really happen in the really real world, IRL, dood&quot;) and photo realism in graphics design.<br />
<br />
No one is asking for a &quot;real&quot; fantasy game.  We just want shit to look like it might if we were the character we're playing.<br />
<br />
That means no &quot;Alfalpha&quot; (sp?) Werewolves, no blocky bodied elves, no ham fisted humans.  It means that Trolls are not blue mohawk wearing bags of polygons, and that undead aren't distinguished solely by their glowing yellow eyes and unconvincing flesh-to-exposed-bone transitions. :(<br />
<br />
Everything I've seen from either of the Blizzard divisions has looked nice, but in a very cartoony, exagerated features sort of way.  It's hard to be immersed in a game when you're constantly looking over your shoulder expecting Baloo to jump out and sing &quot;The Bear Necessities&quot;.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't perfect, EQ2 won't be perfect.  I don't expect perfection, and if someone likes WoW graphics, it doesn't bother me.  It's just not the kind of environment in which I could immerse myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not the realism that bothers me, just doesn't look like anything I'd get attached to.  It's a sad fact that 4 years ago only game play mattered because graphics weren't quite there yet, now I want graphics that are good (if it's a graphic game) and good gameplay.<br />

I happen to prefer the Luclin Troll graphics over the old.  I'd rather be a lean, slightly goofy looking green sex machine than a pixelated blob of greenish good with glowing eyes.  And everyone knows that the Troll models are the only ones that count, every other race looks like shit no matter which model you use.<br />

it looked like somethign big and mean and unstunnable from teh front.  (the rest of them were pretty suck) <br />

Humans in old eq models looked like uptight knightly sort of guys...  Gnomes looked like tinkering wizardy guys...  The graphics were somewhat primitive, but they worked with my sense of RP instead of against it.<br />
<br />
Nothing in WOWO looks tough.  At the very best they loook like a (and I'm sorry I have to say it again) Disney version of a scary monster...  <br />

GM's need a &quot;Illusion: Ass-Monkey&quot; to throw on people being idiots.<br />

Sir, I do believe you have under-estimated the average EQ players desire to walk around as an ass-headed primate.<br />
<br />
Espicially if it were a big red baboon ass-head.</div></div><hr />

So get a whole raid to act up and have Group Illusion: Assmonkey cast on all of them and then continue the raid occassionally oocing &quot;No one can stop the invision of the ass-monkeys&quot; and &quot;Maybe someday the courage of assmonkeys will fail - today is not that day&quot;?  <br />
<br />
And I could un illusion myself and run around like Peter Sellers in the Pink panther and only call them ass-minkeys<br />
<br />
Sorry, but that sound cool, and would actually encourage me to act like an ass in game rather than just here.<br />

Jodgrim is right I guess.</div></div><hr />
