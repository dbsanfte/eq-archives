Here (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-08-17%2018:14:04) is the source of that speculation...<br />
<br />
In other news, This (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2004-08-11%2022:27:19&amp;page=5) seems to indicate that we will be getting new foci instead of the old foci being increased to level 70, but hopefully I'm incorrect in that assumption.  It would be a terrible move for SOE to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not all aa's are on there but it looks like a good amount are, only looks like 3 SK ones are in atm and none of them are really major combat oriented ones.  Since they involve spells shared with Necros and Nec's have theirs listed I would guess the SK only ones aren't done yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackmerlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5918&amp;source=Test<br />
Looks like an Improved FD is otw.<br />
<br />
At least the max level of the new foci ist lvl100, this should give some room for future 'upgrades'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackeagle Dwimmerlaik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">looks like FD with auto-blur like bard fading memories. that's sweet if that's what it is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Imitate Death will be nice.  The Fade Component will interrupt all casting on us, right? (I've never played an escape class).<br />
<br />
The proof of the pudding will be what the recycle time on it is.  My fear is that it will be a 72 minute recycle time, and if we are super lucky, after investing 100 AA's in it, it will recycle at 60 minutes.<br />
<br />
I very much doubt they are going to let it recycle enough to make a pulling tool out of it.<br />
<br />
But still, our FD sucks so bad, that I'll take any scrap they through us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no, neither fade nor escape interrupt spellcasting<br />
<br />
a landed spell will break them, however resisted spells wont</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if they are going to put in new levels of focus for spells up to level 70...<br />
<br />
1) You may want to start stockpiling Tribute Master Points in hopes the tribute masters will have the focus effects up to level 70<br />
<br />
2) Stockpile some LDON points, maybe new level 70 focus augments will be there.<br />
<br />
3) Sell your war crested ring before everyone else knows what is happening since it's value will drop quickly.<br />
<br />
I have this sinking feeling I am going to be a level 70 SK still running around with my spells all still at level 65.  :(</div></div><hr />

I didn't bother looking at the original date of entry, because just by looking at the effects it is quite obvious that we would never get it.<br />
<br />
On another note, the 5k heal with the self-dot is kind of interesting, I'm not sure what to make of it exactly.<br />
<br />
On yet another note, have you seen what it looks like the paladins are getting?</div></div><hr />
