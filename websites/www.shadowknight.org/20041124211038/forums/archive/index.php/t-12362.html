<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about this a bit the last few days and was wondering how many people would be interested in a version of pact of hate which is exactly the same except without skeleton form, truth is the illusion not only gets in the way but skeletons really just look lame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The skeleton illusion of Deathly Temptation/Pact of Hate sure does suck. My biggest problem with it is to have to refresh shrink every 20min if you want to be shrunk. Gets old real fast.<br />
<br />
But then, the necros have it much worst with Spectre illusion since Kunark (really huge model and you cant tell if you're sitting or standing when under spectre illusion), so i dont see this being fixed for us any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually like the skeleton animations (they use Human Male ones).<br />
<br />
I get utterly sick of the annoying Luclin animations for Dark Elf (at least for males).  Same reason I blew a load of cash on a Necro amulet, so i didnt have to look at them.<br />
<br />
I do agree, however, that an option to turn the skeleton form off while keeping the effect would be good.<br />
<br />
Would also be nice to have similar animations to the original EQ models... I prefer the &quot;stances&quot; the characters use in Luclin, and the graphics are undeniably superior, but the animations are for the most part horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally i like the goofiness of being able to turn into a skeleton and do it whenever i can, however the shrink issue is an irritation it is true. But I don't think it's an an issue worth much energy given the variety of other thing the dev's might profitably spend time on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skele form doesnt bother me too much, bit its quite anoying at time when u need to be shrunk like mentioned ealier.  <br />
But if i has a PoH with out the skelly illusion i would explusvley use that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Going from troll to skel form is shrink enough for me, most guildies aren't anal about me shrinking past that, so I don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dzenith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">C5 is far superior so the only time i use pact is if soloing/grouping and my other mana regen runs out.  So the shrink aspect of it really isn't that important to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">it depends dzenith, personalyl i dont use voq all that much, 3 mana per tick more, really i only use it when i have an enchanter with me, its just alot easier to keep pact on myself, probally wouldnt take voq at all if not for skel form on pact, looks so lame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jupke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am still hoping to find SoU or DT somewhere cause the skellie illusion can be usefull for us trolls/ogres. <br />
I should get me a shrinking item but so far i never bothered and just use duck for small corridors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keyan Aubaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, since MC/SoC are both way superior to SoU and since pact of hate and DT are actually limiting us for raids/whenever there's an enchanter nearby, you really should be looking for an AoN, or carrying around a shrink device, otherwise you'll soon end up limiting yourself and will have to look for another solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Paradox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only skeleton form method I currently have is Deathly Temptation.  Skeleton form does have one benefit being a shorter race (DE)... it pops me up to about Human form which helps when I need to jump out of the Halls of Testing in ToV.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the novelty of being a skeleton just isn't there anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spylmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like my lower jaw BEHIND my upper jaw, thank you very much. I'm sure we've all evolved to that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh, it's deniable alright.  several of the the new models are not superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">need a shrink device for the horse to make the gawdamn horses head shrink out of sight.  It uses charges.  Skeli form gets old really fast, and i dislike it alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkmourn D`Estrellas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I personally can't stand skellie form unless it's absolutely necessary.  I paid 20% extra experience in order to have regen and slam.  As a skelly, I don't get slam any more.  Sure I could spend 6 AA's to get 2hand bash, but I just can't see buying something I already have, and paid a premium for no less.  I'd rather put points into metabolism or lung capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>rinnyofinny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Found shroud of undeath on a vendor (lucky me)<br />
<br />
The ONLY  time i use it is when mental corruption wont stick, i.e bastion of thunder. <br />
uggh should have made some cash from some other sucker.<br />
<br />
<br />
The part i hate most is that it  does not even have infra/ultravision(yes yes spoiled dark elf)..so i have to use 2 buff slots to look cool on a horse. Its beginning to be  not worth it. Seeing about as well as a erudite makes me cry inside.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand,  i WOULD use deathly/pact of hate, mana regen would be nice when soloing. Well at least it is one step closer to having a complete spellbook...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daredevin Demiser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Skele form sucks , Lack of Melee animation and I feel DPS is way off with it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turn on Luclin Human Male graphics.<br />
<br />
There ya go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bruiser Bigins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't use it if I can help it.  Anyone noticed that you don't seem to &quot;swing&quot; with 2 handed weapons when fighting in skelly form?  its annoying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>daarth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would rather we got scarecrow illusion than skeleton.  Even a mummy would be better than skeleton.  Being a worshipper of Cazic Thule, I think anything undead from Plane of Fear would be nice.  Amygdellan Knight anyone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bruiser, take a look at the post just above yours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kalendrox Grimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">ive got nothing against skele form, cept for the god damned laugh every time you swing with a 1hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xieroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just a thought. Would casting PoH then getting Project illusion whatever... then clicking that shit off bring you back to normal w/o skele?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I believe you can not be in an illusion does not overwrite another illusion unless it is a superior spell with the same graphic.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I am not a chantah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wickett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the illusion looks pretty cool since they overhauled the skele model, but the functionality of skele illusion sucks overall.  <br />
<br />
First, I *swear* it seems like I do not hit as fast when in Skele mode, especially if being MT and riding steed.  DPS goes to hell.  Don't ask me why, it just seems that way- although I still need to get the numbers out of a parser to be sure.  It also seems like weapon range is decreased.  Again although theres no hard evidence for that, it 'seems' that way.<br />
<br />
Next, the weapon models while riding a horse in skele form is broken, for me at least.  I often see 2 or 3 weapons blur in and out while mounted, and although its not really a functionality problem, its annoying to look at.<br />
<br />
Finally, as everyone else is stating- the lack of combat animation; people think you are a slacker who isnt fighting when in skele mode lol :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keuven Nightstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">This is what i do to get rid of the skelly illusion from PoH. You have to have SoUD tho. Cast PoH then cast SoUD, click off SoUD and bam your normal again without the silly illusion and you still have the effects of PoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vorrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't use it if I can help it. Anyone noticed that you don't seem to &quot;swing&quot; with 2 handed weapons when fighting in skelly form? its annoying... <br />
<br />
Try being a troll with the new models on.  Yeah we're skinnier, don't get in the way as much, and I've noticed I'm a tiny bit shorter (some areas I don't have to duck past with new models that I had to duck with old models on).  HOWEVER, no matter WHAT weapon I use, I swing with only one hand.  I'm CONSTANTLY asked, &quot;What weapon is that?&quot;  &quot;I'm using {insert 2handed weapon here}.&quot;  &quot;How are you swinging it with only one hand?  I didn't think that was possible.  Can you use a shield too?&quot; <br />
<br />
::sigh:: . . .  OLD school models swing with 2 hands, slashing, bashing, AND piercing 2 handers . . . DAMNIT Verant, fix your damn animations.  Hire better artists if you have to, competent ones this time . . . <br />
