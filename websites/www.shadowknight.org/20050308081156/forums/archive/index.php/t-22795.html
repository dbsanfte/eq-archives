Thanks to anyone who gave the original info, as I have epic 1.0 I won t be able to check the part for those who do not have it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Part I: dulak harbor  uneeded if you have epic 1.0 (to be confirmed)<br />
It begins with Ritald in Dulak's Harbor... at the dock<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Ritald'<br />
Ritald says 'Greetings, dark one. Do you feel it? I am sure you do. Innoruuk's voice is so distant now. His voice is merely a whisper. This disturbs me greatly. How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance? I fear the end is almost near for true champions of darkness such as yourself. We cannot let that happen! I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice. There is a sword of great evil. It is however not of this world. I believe I can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several items first. Will you [take on this task]? Your future and the future of all our dark brethren depends on obtaining this sword!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'i will take on this task'<br />
<br />
Ritald says 'Excellent. There is no time to waste. The first item I need is an ancient flamberge of hatred. I believe a trollish pirate named, Captain Varns, here in Dulak's Harbor is in possession of one. Destroy him and return this item to me. The second item is an essence of hate. You should be able to find such an essence in the Plane of Hate. The last item I need is a stormborn phylactery. You should be able to find one in the Plane of Storms. When you have all these items, hand them to me so that I may begin the summoning of the sword.'<br />
<br />
The items he seeks are:<br />
<br />
Ancient Flamberge of Hate - From Captain Varns in Dulak's Harbor (AOE slow, slow casting, 500DD)<br />
Essence of Hate -  Overlord R' Gahbsa  in the Plane of Hate<br />
Stormborn Phylatercy - Olidan in the Plane of Storms (1600 hitting red Ocean giant, rampages but slowable.)<br />
<br />
receive: Innoruuk's Voice <br />
<br />
Turn Innoruuk's Voice to sienn (see part 2) and conntinue as if you had epic 1.0 (to be comfirmed)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 2: Sienn Kastane  in POK (evil part room of the left while you enter the building between neriak and oggok stones) (confirmed it speak to you if you have epic 1.0)<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:21 2004] You say, 'Hail, Sienn Kastane'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:22 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'You. You are the one I have seen in my visions.' Sienn removes a dark blade from a scabbard. I have just obtained this sword from one of my apprentices. This blade may be the key to the very existence of the shadowknight. Are you familiar with what has ?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:37 2004] You say, 'What has been transpiring?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:54:37 2004] Sienn Kastane places her hands upon your forehead. A gravelly voice that is clearly not Sienn's fills your mind. 'Do you feel it? I am sure you do. Innoruuk's voice is so distant now. His voice is merely a whisper. This disturbs me greatly. How will the evil ones do their master's bidding without his dark guidance? I fear the end is almost near for true champions of darkness such as yourself. We cannot let that happen! I believe I know of a way to slow down the diminishing of our master's voice. There is a sword of great evil. It is however not of this world. I believe I can summon it to this plane of existence, but I will need several [items] first. . .' The voice ends. 'That was the voice of [Ritald], a luggald in the service of the dark lord, Innoruuk.<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:07 2004] You say, 'What items?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:07 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'Your first task is to find a tome. The sword has told me of a tome that details its history. I do not know where this tome might be, but I suggest you talk to Grand Librarian Maelin here in the Plane of Knowledge. He may have more information on this tome. When you find it, return it to me.'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:10 2004] You say, 'Who is Ritald?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:55:11 2004] Sienn Kastane says 'Ritald is a luggald in the service of Innoruuk. He is concerned about the future of the shadowknight now that the gods no longer answer our prayers.'<br />
<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:13 2004] You say, 'Hail, Grand Librarian Maelin'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:21 2004] You say, 'What tome'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:22 2004] Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Yes, I seem to recall having such a tome. But evil it is. I don't hand out such dangerous knowledge to just anyone. However. . . I am curious about something and perhaps you can help me. A prominent professor of biology and I have a bet as to how a certain creature from the Realm of Discord, known as a murkglider breeds. He believes they give live birth, and I believe they are egg layers. Unfortunately, I have been so busy here, that I have not been able to make arrangements to travel there and observe the creatures more. If you could travel to the Realm of Discord and [find an egg] for me, I will give you the book you seek.'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:48 2004] You say, 'Where can I find an egg?'<br />
[Wed Sep 15 21:58:48 2004] Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I appreciate your help with this! The creature I was supposed to study are most commonly known as murkgliders. The easiest way to describe them is that they look like large, floating octopuses. See if you can hunt down any breeding murkgliders and return an egg to me that I can study. You might want to bring some companions along, as this might be a dangerous task.'<br />
<br />
[B]So need to find egg from murkgliders in OOW ...<br />
<br />
OPEN point perhaps related:<br />
In COM a human Lhranc looking guy laying on the ground near the Lhranc house/goo house... do not answer to anything yet.<br />
Murkglider Queen raid (?) mob in Wall of Slaughter <br />
Theres also a Murkglider named in a small area in Causeway otw to WoS zoneline<br />
in Ruined City of Dranik there is a &quot;Murkglider Breeder &quot; ...careful red and not alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renaey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In walls of slaughter, Following the wall LEFT from the castle entance the first cave entrance up top  i came to had the murkgliders in them. While pulling i accidently stumbled upon the murkglider hivequeen or something like that. Got my ass owned. Maybe she drops the egg?<br />
<br />
just posting her location.<br />
<br />
Someone take her out, i have to work these next 4 days straight =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kastizi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Found the murkgliders in Ruin City of Dranik (Drano for easy pronunciation).  Found a Murkglider Deathsting that sees invis, but no Murkglider Breeder.  <br />
<br />
From what I understand, 1.5 epic should be 1 groupable thing.  Anyway, I have to go to work, I plan on getting a group to come exp in here tonight and take out the Murkglider Deathsting and see what else pops. <br />
<br />
Will keep ya posted...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zerathule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where are the Mirkgliders in the Ruind City? I cant seem to find any in here.......any one know?<br />
<br />
BTW dont mind the banner.........i havent updated it in a loooooooong time hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ran into a named murk glider tonight, in the ruined city of Dranik.  Very possible that he drops the egg since he's probaby one groupable but VERY difficult.   We had two clerics, rogue, mage, shaman, SK, got him to 40% before one cleric ran oom (was at 50% at start of fight).   <br />
<br />
He seems to have a max hit of 2646.  Didn't seem to hit really super fast, but fast enough to worry me.  Clerics weren't on the ball with him though, kinda were hitting a lot of heals directly next to each other.  Did much better on the next named. <br />
<br />
No listing for him on Allakazams yet.  Probably VERY doable with a warrior defensive tank and two clerics.  I think that I could indeed tank him if the clerics were on the ball and had good dps.  Maybe a 2 group affair also.  At the time we engaged had no clarity so probably hurt the clerics mana there as well. <br />
<br />

Not to sound like a dick or anything, but if you're going to read this board, and presumably use info other people have gathered/guessed at, and then not share new information you obtain, I'd rather you didn't post at all.  It's like saying &quot;Neener neener&quot; in grade school.<br />
<br />
If you came up with everything on your own then I guess it's your right to keep it to yourself, but I'm gonna put money on you got at least some help from here.<br />

Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I knew they were egg-layers! Ha, this is one gnome who hates losing a bet and thanks to you I wont! This is the tome you seek.  Please bring it back to me when you are done.'<br />
<br />
Here is Sienn Kastane text upon turn in of the tome...<br />
<br />
Sienn Kastane says &quot;You have done well in aquiring this tome.' Sienn opens the tome and begins to read. 'It says that a sheath must be created to protect the sword.  Unfortunatly the instructions for making this sheath are a bit unclear.  The only clues given to the items needed are, to gather a dark hide of a creature unmatched in its bleakness, a holy lock of hair from a fair creature unmatched in happiness, and a gem possessing the very essence of fear itself, held by a creature more fearsome. If you find these three items, combine them in a sewing kit and then hand the sheath to me. I await your return.</div></div><hr />

I think maybe... 6?  They made my group wipe.  The named itself wasnt bad.  Low HP.  She didnt start spawning babies until like 70% I think.. not sure though.<br />
<br />
We wiped to her, cause she spawned babies which of course, attacked the cleric.  Group behind us killed it and rezzed me in to loot the egg.<br />
<br />
They said the trick is to attack it, let it spawn babies, evac, then go back and single pull her out into the hall.  Cake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kharan_zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I dont know if it will be skippable. The trend with newer quests is that they use hidden flags (Oracle Robe/Tunic, Breakdown in Communication, Kod'Taz Progression stuff). I'm betting if you dont do the egg your quest pieces will either get eaten or get handed back to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>XVII</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I wouldn't skip parts if I were you. I'm almost positive there's gonna be no such thing as &quot;Skipping&quot; steps in quests anymore, due to that hidden flag setup.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Skipping is, in a sense, most definetly out. Monks recently ran into a bug where they hailed a quest NPC who instructed them to kill three Disciples. The monk I was helping killed one, then rehailed the mob to get the location clues agian. He got flag as completing the three, but without the drops, and he could no longer get them to spawn.<br />
<br />
However, I'd &quot;Assume&quot; you can do some of the drop parts. Just combine NOTHING, and do it in order.</div></div><hr />
