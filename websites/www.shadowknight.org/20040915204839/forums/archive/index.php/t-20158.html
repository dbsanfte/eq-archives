<br />
I am dubious about working on Weapon Affinity if it is losing us about 14% of our SoC / Mental Horror procs, as parsed by the paladins in this thread:<br />
<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm22.showMessage?topicID=1009.topic<br />
<br />
However, the paladin test was *completely* unhasted--no spell or item haste--with a 30 delay weapon.  According to Window's previous reasearch on proc rates, one would expect the &quot;interference&quot; with the self-buff proc to go down as the number of swings per minute goes up.  And the swings per minute should, what, double at max haste?<br />
<br />
Since most of our time is spent hasted, if this drops the &quot;interference&quot; down to a more reasonable level, I might want it.  If not, I don't know if it is worth it.<br />
<br />
Can anyone who took the plunge and bought Weapon Affinity 5 able to test this?  Or is there a test somewhere I missed with haste?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info,</div></div><hr />

Double the swings, double the opportunity to proc... since the number of weapon procs should be held roughly constant... you have a lot more chances for the proc buff to trigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astrakan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maybe I'm confused, don't see how # of weapon procs would be held constant...<br />
<br />
If I understand correctly, if the swing rate is doubled, the proc rate would more or less be doubled.<br />
<br />
Would still be possible interference, which would remain a constant percentage of interference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">some parses show that procs aren't based off weapon delay astrakan they go off a certain amount of times/per minute. Intrested in this too btw if anyone gets around to do some parses with full haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There was a parse that showed WA5 doing a 7 percent decrease in buffprocs, but I'm a lazy bum who refuses to click Search.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">window so a wmbs with 100% haste would work similiar to say a 14 delay weapon proc wise? hope you understand what i mean by that heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that's a safe assumption...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gruulgrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Window!  You are the man.  I had been using your theoretical formula, but I guess I somehow missed the post where you tested it.</div></div><hr />
