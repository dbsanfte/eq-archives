<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>neferaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Read a lot of threads about the fact we can not tank decently in GoD anymore. I haven't had the opportunity to explore it very well yet so I was wondering some things. Is this because the nameds hit too hard or because the trash also hits very hard? If it is only the nameds hitting too hard for us to tank, then (because warriors got good ways to taunt so we have no advantage over them on that), would it not be a bad thing if we (and paladins) got a limited form of defensive (with longer repop than the warrior one)? That seems the easiest solution to me, but do we want this? I suppose they will not fiddle with the mobs endlessly but from what I read something has to be done.</div></div><hr />
