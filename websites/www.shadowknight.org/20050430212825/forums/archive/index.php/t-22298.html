<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>piecesofyou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. I just made a new Ogre Shadowknight and his name is Awandering. When he gets to level 20 his last name will be Greenblood. What I want to do is just level him up on npcs, guards, and such and not really go into dungeons or groups except maybe for LDoN but I'm not sure where to go. I figure I can hang out quite awhile in BBM after I get to 40, but I am not sure where to hunt before then. I know when he gets to be 4 or 5 he can go to the bandit camp in G Fay for a few levels. I know there are DE guards in Nektulous for the late teens. Does anybody have other ideas? I'll make a hunting guide as I go along and post it later. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Oggok bouncers are not doable to you<br />
Gukta frogs are too badly scewed risk/reward wise<br />

I'm not sure I remember any exp good race NPC's in or around a city below 40 except Freeport and I remember argo with reds being an issue (granted this was years ago)</div></div><hr />
