<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wWanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Human shadowknight would like to buy some black ceremonial coffins in neriak (for the lesser summon corpse)  am I kos there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skurrge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go con a dark elf guard and find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wWanda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes I did, Im not Kos to the ones on the bridge, or even the ones at the entrance. <br />
  Was actually asking about the ones inside cause if I remember right they are on a different faction.. BUT Thanks for your reply anyway, even though it was basically useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akeikyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You didnt even state what deity you worship though I don't believe you will have KoS issues with the guards though you may with the warriors guild npc's and the ghouls outside the Necro guild. Now as to Troll npc's that I don't know so get alittle brave and sneak in invised and con them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Septus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wasn't kos to them the first time I went there (dubious I think) as a Bertoxxulous worshipper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azraelwrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Probably not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bordomotto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been there a couple of times and had no problems till like a week ago, when one of the guards in the forgein quarters decided to start wack'n at me. I ran and crossed, noticing  along the way that none of the other guards were even look'n at me... kind'a a weird one that was...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One of the guards in FQ is on Indigo Brotherhood (that's Dorn's faction,warrior guild) faction. The rest aren't. <br />
 <br />
Human SK's can walk in and start dubious or better-do the red wine quest and you'll be fine,period.<br />
 <br />
Of course,ganking halfling guards is the fun way of upping Dreadguard Outer (Nek guards),slaves in Crushbone for Indigo Brotherhood,and lightstones in South Ro for pretty much everything else that matters (the white robed casters around the Nek Pyramid improve Dead faction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Black Ceremonial Coffins are sold in many places besides Neriak. Most Basic container vendors sell em, along with various necro vendors who sell the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the human lady right next to the soulbinder usually has them...  been a few times that i haven't seen her with them...  maybe i'm just lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GenoReaper999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you are kos, you can just do the wine quest or go pawn the orc camps for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raxtull Mortissaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FYI I once took a lvl 3 human necro into Third Gate with no problems until the ghouls outside the necro guild.  So if the necro was fine then your SK should as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The coffins are sold in the Foreign Quarter near the front but there are two guards inside the zone you can safely con from the zone in.  They aren't a big deal as I have seen a bard with DE illusion up have no problem walking around in the foreign quarter.  Only one that might con would be Divn L'Crit and he is in the room straight from the zone in.  He is level 60 too.  <br />
<br />
Guards inside commons and 3rd gate are more picky.  Same bard couldn't get past the first bridge gaurds in commons.  Used the secret passage just fine though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can buy Black Ceremonial Coffins from the Troll/Ogre??? Merchant on the South end of the bridge in Nektulos Forest...not that far from East Commons Zone or take a left if coming from PoK. :)</div></div><hr />
