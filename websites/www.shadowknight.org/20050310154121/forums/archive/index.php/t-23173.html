<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard a rumor that you get 5 aa's for finishing epic 1.5 or something like that.. is this true? or way off base?  I'm guessing it's false.. but if it was true, I'd be WAY more interested in finishing epic hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Helped a Shaman friend with his 1.5 very recently, he mentioned no such thing... nor has anyone I've known with their epic. And somehow, I doubt we'd get handed 5 AA's and no one else would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>VengerMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i got 5AA for finishing mine, no joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got 5 aa as well for finishing 1.5.  Bought Deathpeace hotkey with it.  Chanter friend of mine got 5 as well when she finished hers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Odd.... I'll ask about, if this is so, I'm sure that my Shaman friend will be petitioning like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ahlana DaFosse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He probably didn't even notice is all. I didn't notice I got 5 AAs at first. I must of had them for a few days before I realized it lol. And then I had no idea where they came from</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok that settles it.  Time to do epic 1.5. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Beast, Zerker, SK, and Shaman that I know of have all completed their epics and all gotten 5 AA's upon doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, he did, though it took him till his next log in to notice.=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman friend said the same thing, 5 AA.  Thought he was pulling my leg.  When I did my turn in, was so concentrating on making sure it wasn't bugged and that I actually received IV, I didn't notice until I read my logs this morning.  Mostly it is because you get the quest reward sound, not the AA ding sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shadoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What is this sound thing you speak of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rezrril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everyone gets 5aas for completing epic. Its not specific classes, everyone gets it.</div></div><hr />
