I noticed that at CP2, with a certain group I was in.. I was buffed to 11k on the dot. When I got CP3, in that group, my STA went from 340 to 345. My hp went from 11,000 to 11,022. This sure seems like a crappy result for stamina but whatever. Now this was a grind group so same group, same buffs, 5aa later, I went from 11,022 to 11,036.<br />
<br />
5sta = 22hp then<br />
5sta = 14hp?<br />
<br />
I have 400+ stamina according to Magelo so it's not that I topped off. Is this broken? Hell I remember 1sta = 6hp from before. Now it's random? Seems really damn odd.</div></div><hr />

I'm damn sure the difference between CP2 and CP3 was less than 22. I think it may have been 18hp.<br />
<br />
So 18hp, 22hp, 14hp. All with 5sta jumps. Something is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
looks like 18hp/18hp/18hp with different truncation, and thats what it should be.<br />
<br />
sta only gives half the benefit above 255. at level 70, sks get 6.3 hp/sta below 255 base, which equates to 7.29225 hp/sta with nd3/pe/pd3, which equates to 18.23 hp / 5 sta above 255.</div></div><hr />
