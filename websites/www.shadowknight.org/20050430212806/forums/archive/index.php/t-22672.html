<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darknyz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all -<br />
<br />
Browsed the boards, and checked around.  Havent really found any place that would be good to duo my shaman with my SK<br />
<br />
<br />
My SK is 9k buffed, EP geared.  Shaman has no flags atm.  I tried duoing in PoI, and the exp was horrid. 1% every 5 kills or so for the shaman.  Heard some people talking about PoV inner.  Think that might be kinda mana intentsive on the shaman, untill he gets quin.  <br />
<br />
Any input would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have no exp in two-boxing seriously(only my friends bard when he had to go to guitar lessons or something), but inner is good, and I'm guessing if you have a 9k hp pool, you have a fairly big mana pool, try HoH kiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giants may be tooo much to heal, beeze spend a fair bit of time casting.<br />
<br />
When i duo'd my 62 sk to 65 there (65 sham) it was 6% aa per kill (split).<br />
<br />
They go down pretty fast, faster than pov mobs, and no one hunts them.<br />
<br />
Half of the drama about pl'n somewhere is finding yer spot always occupied.<br />
<br />
And they dont gate if you fight them at thier spawn point.<br />
<br />
And you can clear two bays without ever needing to risk a double pull situation.<br />
<br />
Which you may have trouble FD'n off cause they are casters.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you give weapons to ruppy puppy so he dual wields, and go to town.<br />
<br />
Also the Sewers in GoD are very very good xp, you should be able to xp in them.<br />
<br />
Actualy sewers &gt; bot, and you dont have to listen to the pre-pubescent ooc drivle, or risk being trained as some kiddy ranger desperately tries to pull a named past your group before the other kiddies see it.<br />
<br />
Laters!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pull with timing the sham malxxxxx to land just before snare.<br />
<br />
That way you can cast slow strait afterwards and most of the time the mob will get to you nicely slowed, and you should have just enough agro to make it ignore teh sham without having to bother with taunt.<br />
<br />
Then you can just run it back to where you want to go.<br />
<br />
I put /pet attack in my shams slow macro so that i dont have to press tooo many keys.<br />
<br />
Dont worry bout cripple, waste of time.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you will need more than regen and slow if your resists are high enough to resist the nukes.<br />
<br />
Remember MR tap is your shamans friend, and turn off pet taunt on the sham.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">or go to BoT ?<br />
<br />
edit- ok im stupid, i dindt read the post above me lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have any decent mana regen, PoV inner is completely doable... just help out your shammy if he needs it with lifetaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting there, finding it open, etc etc is a pain.<br />
<br />
Bots good cause the beeeez spend time casting and hit barshin yer, so if you have good resists you dont take much dmg.<br />
<br />
The main drawback with a sham is the long long cast time on heals, if you have somethign that can crank out decent burst dmg you are at risk.<br />
<br />
Defensive aa's will mitigate that a lot, once my sk got some avoidance aa's it really opened out the pair, but before that he could get one rounded in places like solro before the sham could land a heal.<br />
<br />
Most places if you aura of darkness first will allow you to slow pretty reliably. Matter of a fact I rarely bother with malo now, although you would be amazed the number of people who say to me &quot;what does aura of darkness do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Specially in ldons, aura on inc, snare, fear check to see if FA is still on (i dont have gear maxed stats) and only ft4.<br />
<br />
Boney adds great dmg in bot, in fact a trip to your local mage vending machine will add about 20 odd dps to the pair (actually more like 40 when you include the fact sham pets wont dual wield without weapons).<br />
<br />
SK pet does about 30 dps and sham pet does about 45dps against beez.<br />
<br />
My SK only does around 100dps, but my sham can crank out another 50dps without pulling agro (avoid poison dots).<br />
<br />
I tend to be able to keep about 200dps up as a pair sustained (im lazy) I could push it to 230-250 when i really concentrate, but cant really be bothered.<br />
<br />
So the point is im not really very well equiped on either char, so if i can do it a 62 bot should be able to at a good sustained rate.<br />
<br />
Mind you its ferkin booring.<br />
<br />
However, you really should look at pumping him through some ldons. The dots, extended blessing augs, and mirguls armour will make a lot of difference to you sham, and you should get groups easy with you tanking and him slowing.<br />
<br />
At 65 (on easy) 99% of mobs are all slowable once aura of darkness lands. Not sure on 62, but should be ok.<br />
<br />
Will take longer than pl'n in bot, but its more fun, and you can get some gear ups and augs fer the sk.<br />
<br />

Just dont get hit by a freaking train. Lately WoS blows so I go to tables in fire and kite, I know you cant get there with your shammy but OoW exp places suck imo.</div></div><hr />
