My Magelo's up to date, click my sig to see it, I normally solo in Sebs (guard, or juggs usually), or Nurga, or random mobs in SG. The wolves in PoN are nice but they're almost always camped by bards / druids quadding. I'm flagged up to Sol Ro, and have keys to pretty much everywhere, but can't think of any new places.</div></div><hr />

GE is ok - easy soloing through the long halls - easy single pulls from the rooms - just agro kite with fluffy whacking away. You know the drill.</div></div><hr />

Now if I can just get lucky enough to get an expedition without a stonemite right near the front.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone comment on the hp comparison between soloable Vxed mobs and PoF tables?<br />
<br />
9% per kill is less then table mobs and it takes me about 10 minutes and 30% mana (dependent on resists) to kill at the tables. <br />
<br />
It would seem if it took him 80% mana its not worth it when tables is easier.</div></div><hr />

Correct, or the smith Rondo event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talk to the little drowned elf girl over by the entrance to Vxed, and say &quot;Vxed&quot;<br />
<br />
Unless this was just changed, the above poster is incorrect.<br />

This was about 5 months ago though, so unless they changed it, you can do them out of order and trials 1-4 aren't required to get into 5-6.</div></div><hr />

That's with a group, and someone in your group HAD done trials 1-4 (or Rondo), otherwise you could never have gotten in the flagging trial of Tipt/Vxed. As for the XP versions of them, I couldn't tell you. Someone with no flags go try :)</div></div><hr />

sometimes I cyborz my shm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">damn stonemites at the front x roads seems to be a very common occurence. 5 expeditions so far and 5 times mites block the path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syfon</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the advice of this board I did my first exploration of Vxed (lol much to the surprise of my guildmates) and it took 6 attempts to get an instance that was populated with stonemites in the front.<br />
<br />
After about 8 mobs however all the respawns were 'mites at the zone in. I am guessing then that you guys are just soloing the front 5 or so mobs (the 2 at the xroads and the first each down the 3 paths) until you get all 'mites and then just exit and get a new instance?<br />
<br />
Or is there a better spot then near the zone in where 'mites are less common or dont show?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oberyn</div><div class="date">10-12-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats pretty much it.  Solo the front: only place I've seen with the room to kite.<br />
<br />
Mites are annoying, aye.  Sometimes you can go for hours with none, other times the lil bastards are everywhere.  Just the luck of the draw.<br />
<br />
And aye: when you can't pull over or around the lil shits anymore, grab a new instance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Voch</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest GE as well.  The areas around Grieg and Servitor are still dark blue at level 70 and give 2% AA a kill, and the mobs drop like flies.  I pull off almost an AA an hour there which doesnt really seem too bad for solo exp.  To be honest I havent found a more efficient solo spot.  Some places I can get more exp per kill but have too much down time.  In Griegs I can go nonstop with pretty much no down time at all.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaithiss</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The entire zone's DB to me at 65, and I have to agree they're the easiest 2% AA / kill mobs I've found yet. They don't hit as hard as SG mobs, and give more exp than Sebs (except Juggs, but they're slightly tougher, IMO). And as far as I've seen, nothing in GE sees invis except the new necro epic 1.5 mob, and the servitor (I'm sure Grieg does too though, duh). After about an hour I get bored and leave, but GE's definately the place to solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Friend told me WW was good, she could solo there, get some kewl loot, and it wasn't boring; all you have to do she said is kite with fear. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiel_Lostsoul</div><div class="date">10-21-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can leave the stonermites in the X-roads.<br />
<br />
Click rule#1, run past X-road stonermites and snare hallway mobs.  Then click rule#1 and run along the wall of hallway to zone-in area.  Mobs will warp to zone-in w/out stonermite agro 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Whlie your at it, work on weapon skillz as mobs try to run.  Just before he dies to your uber 2h2 dps, FD and he will regen.  Stand at 20%, resnare and get back to work on weapon skillz (this worked better when they still conned yellow).</div></div><hr />
