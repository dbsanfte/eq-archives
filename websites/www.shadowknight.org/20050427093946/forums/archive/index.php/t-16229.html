<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I first started EQ I got in a discussion one night in HHK about what class selection says regarding the personality of the player.  This came to mind again reading these boards, but in a new way.  Within the SK community what does race selection say about the personality of a player?<br />
<br />
Dark Elf - Image is very important to this person.  Stats may or may not even out, but looking good is where it's at.  Generally these people tend to be haughty bandwagonesque posers who try to hard to be macabre and hope all the effort makes them cool.<br />
<br />
Erudite - While looks and style are important, it's also important to have a signature style.  Brains are more important than brawn, but brawn has it's uses.  These people also tend to find foreheads sexually arousing.<br />
<br />
Gnome - High energy, curious and often confuse annoying with entertaining.<br />
<br />
Human - Experiences conflicting urges to be both average and different.  Believes that having no specialized strengths equates with having no specialized weaknesses, and did I mention they are different.  The like to blend in to the crowd, but please notice that by doing so they are then different.  They like to be different.<br />
<br />
Iksar - Attitude, lore, skills and presence are very important to these folks.  Too bad you can't tell what gender they are in RL either.<br />
<br />
Ogre - Thinking never saved someone from a good bashing and that's just the way it should be.  Besides, it's nice for these people to play a race that shares their hygienic sensibilities.<br />
<br />
Troll - Kill and eat and shit and fuck.  Christ, life is good.  A wonderful example of man at the state of nature.  Best in limited doses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiskenbibble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking as a gnome, it's all about the Pestilence.  Hatred is for those who lack control, and the desire to make others fear you smacks of self-doubt.<br />
<br />
Now Bertox on the other hand is the philosopher of the Dark Gods.  Watching the life flow in cycles is what it's all about for me.  There's nothing more grand than the joy of a rotting corpse teeming with life.<br />
<br />
I fear you've mistaken the Bertox worshipping gnomes with our more insipid and narrow minded brell worshiping cousins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stwongbad Soulkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Speaking as an Ogre, I like being large and in charge.  When I FD, I want buildings to topple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thanks. Its all about Hate and Rage :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a Dark Elf (and a DAMN seksay one at that!), bandwagon isn`t in my vocabulary...<br />
<br />
I`m all about the Hate and Destruction but... sometimes, ya just gotta give some lovin` to the ladies ^_~  No other race is capable of even trying to pull that one off fa fa fa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But really, I chose a human because they are different, when I first started, you know, loved roleplaying etc.... I wanted my character to be the &quot;paladin turned evil&quot; etc..... But I found some drawbacks being a human/bertox, like only 1 damn person on the whole server being able to make my cultural, and no clerics to imbue... But other than that, I still love my human.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksars are all about poking clowns.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tumy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That whole DE = Sexah thing I think has lost its luster with da ladies.  DE's are so common that they are lack luster.<br />
<br />
The ladies love a big man.<br />
<br />
The ladies love Ogre's, ask any Ogre....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AislinSteele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a female DE I can tell you this; looks mean a lot, yes. The more they look at me the less they see when I reach behind them and slice them open along their spine, rip it out, and use it to make a Bard musical instrument.<br />
<br />
I am a god, at any level, and the better looking I am, the easier it is to fool those poor fools that say Shadowknights are wannabes...</div></div><hr />

DE = foward leaning tripod<br />
<br />
I picked DE for their roleplaying aspect (even though I now know roleplaying is dead /sob), ultravision, and their flat out sessieness *slurp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I made a DE sk up to 20 as a RP char, but I gave him up, RP is too hard. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Esmy Weatherwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, I chose a human, because I liked the idea of being evil and I liked that I could also cast. Es was my first character, too so I had no idea what I was getting into. I still get asked for Brell's all the time, but don't really mind much, when people see a 65 human female sk they think it's kinda cool :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My SK is a Human of Bertoxx and female on top of it.  This character is named after my wife and I thought it was the most fitting way to describe her in EQ terms.<br />
<br />
I have found an elusive cleric of Bertoxx to make Imbued Black Sapphires.  I was close to making one myself and PL him or her.<br />
<br />
Mariann Basilicato<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Arcmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">wow, guess its not rare to be a Human Bertoxx SK, all my friends (in my town) who play EQ are giving me hell bout worshipping Bertox, let alone being a human. But i like playing a Human... And Yah, i play my SK as the &quot;Paladin who nearly died on the battlefield and was given another chance to live from a wandering Necro, and now i'm a Fallen Paladin.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it fits my personailty quite well. Im not naturally evil, but if you piss me off, i'm giving you the freaking ebola virus. :p :D :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kesran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">as a DE Its all about hate...<br />
<br />
I dont like anyone really....My friends are basically tolerated...If youre a decent enough soul...Ya...Ill go ahead and pee on you if youre on fire...<br />
<br />
But Basically...I hate you...I loathe the air that keeps you alive..If I could cause you ultimate torture and make you regret the day you created your character..Im sated for the time being<br />
<br />
I dont like humans...I dont like gnomes...I dont like Barbarians...I dont like trolls..I dont like ogres...I could go on but I hate lists<br />
<br />
Style? Man You have a weird perception...I hate style, I hate trends I dont follow them...Id rather be hooded and cloaked and shadowed from view...<br />
<br />
as far as the gimp post? Whateva...probably got your lunch money stolen or something at work when they guerilla'ed ya and broke your glasses in the middle where the tape holds em together...right after they wedgied you to the coat hangers...<br />
<br />
then logged on EQ and got whipped by the first person who was most likely a DE and got mad and decided they were gimps after your Long corpse run...<br />
<br />
I really dont give a crap...<br />
<br />
I like my DE for what it represents...Ultimate Loathing, Hate and disdain for all that breathes the same air DE's obviously deserve..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Moghedred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I created my DE because of the lore, in which they are the tortured creation of Innoruuk made from the High Elves to give Tunare the finger (used the king and queen, the firstborns, too! way to go Inny!). I hate Tunare and her Ranger buddies.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk created the first Shadowknight (Lhranc, though I think he's actually Human in lore). DEs are the chosen of Innoruuk and Shadowknights are his creation. Only made sense to me at the time to pick a DE SK. <br />
<br />
Let's not forget that the Dark Elves appear in many, many other RPGs, books etc., so it isn't only an EQ decision. This also clearly played in favour of picking one!<br />
<br />
An SK worshipping anyone else than Inny should be forced to feed from Tunare's breast! <br />
<br />
As for looks, I've yet to dye my armour, so that wasn't really a concern. However, there seemsto be a ton of entirely pink ogres running around!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Apparently, Kesran, in addition to hating everyone and everything, you must really hate punctuation.<br />
<br />
A message board isn't an English essay, but if you're writing like someone who's never even been near a book on English grammar, people will tend to ignore the content of your message too. It's all about perception, you don't want people's first impression of ya to be that of a high school dropout... now do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Arcane_Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">elves dont strike fear in my heart, sorry. i was going to go iksar , since they look really cool in plate, and not too bad in chain, plus they look really buff and at the same time dexterous, but i went human because my friend started a human bard, and it seemed better off to be able to enter the city with him, not worry about FP guards, and so on.<br />
<br />
hmm, i think im going to go level him up some more later tonight, one day i might reroll an iksar, maybe.</div></div><hr />

Chose mine because I figured I'd reach the point where I wouldn't concern myself with NPC faction. The NPC's should  worry about mine. Muahaha.<br />

Being a Troll is still a state of mind.</div></div><hr />

No, No, No you got the order wrong!<br />
Its - Kill then Fuck then Eat then shit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Odiumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Iksar all the way.  <br />
<br />
Would you rather be...<br />
<br />
Iksar--Former slaves that tore their freedom from the bleeding hands of their long-ago masters.<br />
<br />
-or-<br />
<br />
Troll--Onetime badass of the swamp, that got booted out of their own town by frogs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I joke, but one day they are going to sink Kunark all together...then where will I be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Azaezel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Heh, well unfortunately back in the day there was no such thing as iksar, and unless you wanted to play a fat ass there wasn't much of a choice. I started playing with three other friends and we couldn't even find the damn sewers for queynos, it took us like three days and I mean who can go wrong with a skull helmet right?<br />
<br />
DE was my first toon ever and its still my main, I just picked one because I thought it fit me really. No way was I playing a sissy good race. Too bad the damn things grow on trees now.<br />
<br />
 I never thought I would play this long but I wouldn't play any other class if I could, as for race I wish I could've been a leezard :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Nyrvel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">First time I ever saw EverQuest, I watched a friend join a Raid with other Dark Elves. They gathered together in Neriak, swept to East Commonlands Tunnels and picked up more Dark Elves then proceeded to Freeport. They slaughtered all the NPC's and I mean all. Some of the PC's started patrolling the town like the guards did, stood behind the store counters or idled about town. Yet they weren't finished, they moved to the next zone and did the same...until all of Freeport was in Dark Elves hands. It was awesome to see all the corpses laying around and the people Zone/Log'ing in to see nothing but Dark Elves. They held the zone for several hours and then just left the dead to tend themselves. All that started by the innocent comment, 'I'm bored...'. After seeing something like that, how could you not want to play Dark Elf? And playing a Shadow Knight, thats the ultimate Dark Elf. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ronoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">one night I was bored too.  I had left my guild (of which I had lead for three years) and decided to check out some of the old world.  I had died once traveling through Freeport when my invis had failed and it brought back some ugly memories.<br />
<br />
Revenge was mine.<br />
<br />
I had many /tells asking where certain shop keepers where, or &quot;why are you killing my people?&quot;, my only reply &quot;do you wish to join them?  I'll be happy to ablige&quot; (which was hotkeyed)<br />
<br />
Being that I am Iksar, and have been hated by all, enjoyed clearing a town solo that took a whole slew of  Dark Elves to accomplish fills me with a sense of warped pride (cause any race of SK can do the same thing with level and AA).<br />
<br />
Try it, it's fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Taldrac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree with  Azaezel at the time i created my de sk was just before the release of kunark and at the time their wasn't much racial selection for sks. Also i created my sk for role play purposes. My de sk is still my main and i have put way to much time and effort into my char to change now. Although given the oportunity to go back my char would be a iksar because iksars just rock and i love the regen. When i make my alt bl and put time into it he will be an iksar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zulpel Bonstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I chose Dark Elf. Why? I &quot;think&quot; it was because i wanted to be an Elf, but be evil also. Seeing as a DE is the only Evil Elf, ihairantly ( sp ) I chose them. Why Shadowknight? I wanted to be able to Take hits AND cast. Little Did i know when i put those points in, how it would all turn out. i was completely clueless as to the fact that i was a tank. i had no idea what Harm Touch was, or how it was used. I am now level 61. i have more power than i could have possibly imagined and i only have 16 AA's. I have come so far, and have so far to go.<br />
<br />
Personally i say drop the race shit. We're all Shadowknights, and that's what matters.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... I have dreamed a dream; but now that dream is gone from me...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Zulpel I loved the whole Martin Luther king type speech there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Darkdogg Bonegrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My first Shadowknight was an Ogre, back in Pre-Kunark Days. I loved the look and the fact that if I stood still for a while, he would automatically start scratching his ass. (Lord help me why I thought that was funny) I was dissapointed when the Luclin models came out and Ogres looked like Giant Muscular Humans. With my friends Dark Elf, I wandered into Oggok and brutally annihilated every guard I came across. I am now playing a Troll, and am loving every minute of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One person making a stupid remark about Trolls being unstunnable from the front and the whole thread dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>ZarrosLivinglight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">For me I love the iksar mentality in general.  To play an iksar you need to get into a very alien mindset, as the iksar are not about hate, or fear, or love, or lust, or anything of the sort.  The iksar are cold-blooded beings, with little or nothing in the way of an emotional response.  Imagine a race of sentient velociraptors, capable of forging an empire, and wielding the necromantic arts, and you're getting close.<br />
<br />
Iksar think in terms of &quot;prey&quot; and &quot;iksar&quot;, with perhaps the distinction that some prey might make useful slaves before being made food.  Unlike the brutish trolls, or the loutish ogres, they have keen minds capable of effciently wielding the arcane magics they will need, and have a good balance in their melee stats.  They are the ultimate survivors, and their entire culture is devoted around loyalty to the empire and personal honor.  Rogues are expelled and become outcast, and traitors are hunted down ruthlessly.  Nothing screams &quot;dark knight&quot; more than the iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Croaakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I guess it depends on if you want to be a fighter that can cast or a caster that can fight<br />
<br />
Even though I have been away from EQ for a couple month (Tried SWG for a while but getting bored and thinking about returning), I made an Ogre so I could bash stuff, not get stunned, and do some &quot;light&quot; casting.</div></div><hr />
