<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kurth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">let me start by saying, yes i have played many classes, no , i have not played them all. i have not played as long as some, but i have gotten very far in EQ.<br />
<br />
i have a good understanding of almost every class, and those i have not played i can ask several friends, and form my own conclusion.<br />
<br />
Most classes if not ALL need tweeking, some NEED a complete overhaul. and has been stated by some classes since 1999, and quite loudly i must admit.<br />
<br />
i am wondering now, why Ryan, Brenlo and other devs feel it is apropriate to ignore thier paying customers ?<br />
<br />
many classes have said &quot;we NEED X + Y so we can be balanced &quot;<br />
<br />
Why is nothing being done? Do the Developers not get paid enough? Is there some lack of funding? <br />
<br />
here is just a quick glance at what some of the classes need or MUST have to be balanced and playable.<br />
<br />
Mages need love (root, a small way to drop some aggro+ others)<br />
 just like clerics do (invis, some more utility)<br />
 like druids (better aggro management to name just a few)<br />
 and shadowknights (some tanking tweeks, skills fixes, not just to be Voice of thule bots)<br />
 shaman (buffs, heals, lots more )<br />
 enchanters ( some way to do dps besides pets, a better AE stun + others)<br />
 rangers ( a fix to dps besides insane ratio's on 1 handers that out do bow damage, fixes to buffs, + more) <br />
warriors ( aggro problems, disc abilites, disc timers, endurance bar, having to rely entirely on gear) paladins ( a way to do nice dps, thier own type of utility) <br />
monks ( to be unerfed, disc tweeks, why does FD fail so much ? monk dps fixes) <br />
wizards (upgrade to concussion, some utility, better nuke foci) <br />
necromancers ( better nukes (they hate dots), more utility (dmf and twitch does not make a necro happy) AE lifetaps)<br />
<br />
i could go on, but this post would be huge.<br />
<br />
this may get edited, im sure it will, but i am posting this on class boards too. so it will be seen one way or another.<br />
<br />
The players are not satisfied, we are tired of the &quot;wait and see&quot; , you can no longer placate us all.<br />
we are going to take action, you either do as we ask, or lose your customers.<br />
i myself have between me and my brother 5 accounts, that not much, but we have man friends, who all have many accounts, and they have many more friends.<br />
Do not just state &quot;your argument does not satisfy Ryan, so you will not be upgraded&quot;<br />
You will listen, or your player base will shrivel up and move to companies who WILL listen, like blizzard, Sierra and many others.<br />
<br />
(as we speak kyar (or something) deleted all my posts on the Eq live boards, and the people who posted asking where my post has gone have been banned, and had thier threads deleted.)<br />
<br />
i guess it is best we keep this out of EQlive, for fear of retribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Part of the reason is that if you implimented every change that every class wanted, the game might be more screwed up than it is now.<br />
But ya know if soe reps would post and communicate more than they have in the past it might seriously help players feel like they aren't simply being ignored.<br />
Eventually if there is no change they'll only have themselves to blame when and if people move en masse to other games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We as a group can't decide what 1 class needs to be balanced.  Throw 16 classes into the mix and near impossible task becomes impossible.<br />
<br />
Even if 1 person could come up with a non biased balance for all the classes, you would never get everyone else to agree with you.  As long as somebody out there disagrees, there will be a thread like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With most of the chars and playtime spent on chars level 30-50 it's obvious why the issues are ignored.  At those levels there is a better balance.  50's is where you start to see the separation.</div></div><hr />
