<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just saw the Paladin epic. 71 DMG 40 DLY, compare to our 61 DMG 35 DLY.<br />
<br />
You know, I may be a little naive some times, but i'd think that a whole 10 DMG goes ALOT further then 5 measly DLY.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im also retarded at reading spell data, but<br />
<br />
<br />
Their clicky adds a 200 point stun to all members of the group, AND acts as a 120% healing focus for the group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eitsekur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ratio matches up about the same; SK epic should be 62 damage, I think, to be nearly the ratio (or as near as can be while retaining the same delay). Paladin effect is arguably better but, strangely enough, self only...still, one-minute of 200dd + interrupt-70 stun procs, as well as 20% more effective healing (which would give paladins another advantage in tanking for that one minute), do definitely seem better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lets also look at other factors. Basing this off memory, just saw the pally epic tongiht.<br />
<br />
Theres has 10 higher base damage, 4 higher bonus, for a total of 14, at 65. for 5 higher delay. This is an advantage, but lets continue.<br />
<br />
THe next difference was Paladins get 20Char where we get 20 Dex. I have no idea what a paladin uses CHa for, not being one, but I'd rather have the Dex, personally.<br />
<br />
We trade wisdom and int. Breaks even in COMBAT... however, as we all know, tradeskill skill ups are based off Wisdom OR Int, whichever is higher. Now, most paladins I know have less wisdom than I have Int it seems, and many have as high an Int as wisdom. Even IF it breaks even, I don't know any wisdom increasing spells, whereas you can snag Kei/VoQ before skilling. This puts us at a slight advantage.<br />
<br />
Our poison resist is 20, theirs 30, and vice versa on the disease resist. BReaks even<br />
<br />
We have 20 magic resist, they have 20 cold resist... might break even, might be lopsided. Depends on what you're fighitng on what day, really =)<br />
<br />
Now, the effects. They have better healing, and the damge/healing focus. This seems like an advatage, but lets examine ours.<br />
<br />
Starting with: Embalming Embrace - increasing the damage of our lifetaps will also, if IDIV is any example, increase the return rate, or at least on the normal lifetaps. Zeefer's and such may not benefit. It's still nice, especially if it stacks with ID line, and is coupled with the right AA's.<br />
<br />
Reaper Strike:It's a DD, dunno how much yet, but that might equalize it with the paladins to some point. Now, if a paladin uses this, and wants to heal during it, that's time he's not procing. <br />
Now, lets take reaper strike, and apply it to a situation. You're fighitng a nasty mob, maybe with an AE/high DS, maybe as part of a raid. Group make up is... Warrior, cleric, sk, two rogues, melee ranger ((Since epic is melee, this is a push SOE is making)). Health of the group begins dropping, due to AE or DS, cleric smacks their new epic, equalizes damage and heals. SK hits his effect. The rogues, who're either taking a licking from the AE, or absorbing punishment from the DS ((Back in the day, Iw as told of a 50 rogue who died on a greenie mob, becuase it had a nasty DS)) The leechcurse can make up for this, same for the ranger. OR it cna fill up the gaps left after the cleric pulled their effect. This leaves the cleric free to either heal themselves ((Sk may not be able to get it all back from leechcurse, but can then lifetap the rest, maybe)) or to keep thier eyes on the group tank or raid MT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're missing the point though. The reaper sting effect is not what we thought it was, it is not Leech Curse &quot;exactly&quot;, it is not even Diet Leech Curse. It is Backwards Ghetto Mexican Leech Curse. The fact that you cannot even get the full health of the damage you put out for the melee you do is just a cruel joke!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pally 1.5 epic &gt;&gt;&gt; sk 1.5 <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
71 damage vs 61 damage for starters. But you say Kraav we have 5 less delay? Big fucking deal 5 delay is nothing.<br />
<br />
They have BEST base delay for any 2H weapon period: 40 delay = Godly delay. Its fucking magical, the best of speed and gives a sweet damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Damage bonus for sk epic @ 70 = 46 <br />
Damage bouns for pally epic @ 70 = 51<br />
<br />
So they will hit for alot more when u factor in 10 raw base damage and +5 DB swing.<br />
<br />
Moving to focus effects: They have 35% bonus to all instant duration healing spells. Very powerful as that encompasses many of thier spells<br />
<br />
Ours is 35% bonus to Lifetaps only in the end game will mean 2 possibly 3 spells worth casting which are self only.<br />
<br />
Clicky effect: Ours is fucked no doubt about it. With a fucking GIMP ratio of 1:20 you will heal exactly JACK and SQUAT with 18 seconds(listed), more to come on this. So while recourse is active your group mates can heal themsleves via MELEE only 20% of the damage they deal per strike while the recourse is in effect.<br />
<br />
Recourse duration listed as 18 seconds, is IN FACT AT BEST 12 seconds of pure shit. Grats us! If this was to be viable it would ahve to be a full 18 seconds (FOR REAL 18) and a ratio of 1:100 (as per leechcurse disc)<br />
<br />
Paladin Clicky: Increases Healing Effectiveness by 20%. That is an effect while recourse is active. Meaning any healing they RECIEVE or DO THEMSELVES is so modified for 1 minute. Then as a bonus they get a 200DD and 0.0 sec stun(70) proc while recourse is in effect. <br />
<br />
ATM they win in that category as well.<br />
<br />
We sneak out ahead with better +Dex and +MR but thats it.  ALL other categories Pally 1.5 epic &gt;&gt;&gt; Sk 1.5<br />
<br />
I see what the Devs are trying to do is bring Pally Melee DPS up by handing them superiour weapons. Sadly last time I checked they were NOT increasing Sk defensive abilities  on the back end anywhere. <br />
<br />
I am happy for Pallies they have a SOLID weapon. We on the other hand, well ours needs some work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rofl let me get this straight you want to give an entire group (say for example all melee) 12 to 18 seconds worth of our 1hr re-use disc every 10mins?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yslaath-RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gaxx your thinking on the damage bonus is a little off.  What matters is damage bonus / delay .. and on that lower delay weapons are still better.  It doesnt matter that the paladin epic weapon damage bonus is 5 higher because its a slower weapon, so its damage bonus isnt applied as often.<br />
<br />
46/35 &gt; 51 / 40 <br />
<br />
      Faster 2H weapons down to a delay of 28 get a bigger effective kick from damage bonus than slower ones.  You can argue however that a bit slower weapon is less effected by spell-casting.  All told I think our epics are pretty equal, and both are way way better than they should be so no one should be whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the real difference is paladin epic clicky will let them take 20% more DPS while requiring the same healing for a minute... pretty damn nice tanking advantage. ours is okay, but pretty lame in comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'd have to agree that it's usage, this being the case, is extremely limited. I encourage two things. /feedback, and /bug it. I know most of you will say it's useless, but the bard epic is being changed up because bards complained about it, especially given the difficulty of the quest. If enough people /feedback, it will make a difference.<br />
I encourage the /bug in case it was meant to be more, and it was a mistake, and also because it may get the point across more if we say &quot;This is so unbalanced, we think it's bugged.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>The Zenogias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's an easy fix. Either make the recourse a group wide 100% leech curse for 20 - 30 seconds<br />

I am pretty sure Pal epic will be more powerfull then ours again, simply because pal's, only have their sword as dps, we have new pet dots and nukes as options to improve our dps.<br />
But then a again, it's not our fault that pal's are screwed, and only get invited into highend guilds to be assist healers, they really should face that facts that SK and Pal aint tied together as one anymore, we are two very different classes now, therefor i hope that we will see highend weapons with the same dmg dly / use full group proc's like paladins have gotten in GoD, just wielded in SK hands here in OoW, atleast Tacvi gave me a decent 2hander if you compare it with paladins, still you can't argue with the blessing from Pal weapons procs. Guess everything from our spell line in group versions would be overrated, since they keep adding Ssra proc's to the new highend weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fedarov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">While i understand the actual ratios are similer to each other one thing that should be taken into account is that once you add any &quot;extra&quot; attacks frrom kinghts advantage, speed of the knight and double reposte etc etc. the paladin epic beomes more powerfull again. Its not much but it all counts.<br />
<br />
Having read this i cant believe the effect is what it actualy is, I have not completed the epic 1.5 yet (i will probably still do ss) But i am unsure that it might turn into yet another token trophy epic instead of the useable wepon i thought it was going to be. 20% of your damage back as heals is not going to save you against any mob in oow/GoD or PoP they all hit to hard for leachcurse to save you never mind 20% of leachcurse.<br />
<br />
I had originally heard the effect was going to be a 500/Tick group lifetap heal over time for 3 Ticks. This in all honesty would have been a much better effect for us AT LEAST giving us an effect that could be of use to a group.<br />
<br />
what use is leechcurse to casters in our group ?</div></div><hr />

Wrong, that's not how it works. We get more swings innately with our lower delay weapon, this gives us more chances for those AA's to fire(albeit for less damage) than their higher damage/delay weapon.<br />
<br />
But i am unsure that it might turn into yet another token trophy epic instead of the useable wepon i thought it was going to be.<br />
This is only an issue if you're close to getting flagged for time/kt+ Seriously, this thing is the fucking own for casuals, who 1.5 was designed for, even if it didn't have a clicky. The only valid complaints against it are the relative uselessness of the clicky, and its weakness compared to our time weapon setup(it was posted by a dev in another thread that 1.5's were meant to be balanced around *time* weapon setups) that they are so easy to complete is irrelavant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Huh?<br />
<br />
Lifetap focuses do not stack. Highest focus takes priority only. So if you have say Ring of Thunderous Forces (35% Focus:Magic upto 67) it will be overwritten by Epic 1.5 focus which is 35% Focus:Lifetap upto 70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, and if you have Ring of Thunderous Forces, you can probably get the SK &quot;epic&quot; 1.5 in less than 10 hours of playtime. Compare that to the amount of time it took you to get INTO time in the first place. People who have no shot at time or raiding can handily score this with a pickup set of raiders who simply go after epics, not months of concentrated guild effort flagging people, sorting through bids, drama, etc. to do so.<br />
<br />
People are being way too hard on an item that takes fairly little effort to get, when it's obviously baggable to those in high GoD.<br />
<br />
Getting into a class envy pissing match over it is silly. Analyzing it further:<br />
<br />
Sure, the pallies get a heal focus that works with group heals. <br />
The click is iffy, as the stun is a 0 second stun, meaning, aggro. It does add DPS with the procs &quot;if they go off.&quot; It also adds heal increase to those around. IE, it's nice to stick a pally in a MA group on raids.<br />
<br />
Damage bonus means SHIT when you have high ATK, so the ratios are all that matters. Negligable.<br />
<br />
Now, stick the SK into a melee based DPS group and pop that focus off and turn on the parsers. You will see a marked increase while the recourse is there (resists notwithstanding, of course) due to the accuracy increase. The heals might take an edge off. I agree this could use some tuning in the healing section, it'd help for those nasty AEs, etc, keeping it a *tad* more in line with the pally proc which has the potential to increase the health a godly amount.<br />
<br />
As far as the stats, I dunno, with most stats maxed I could use more CHA for DI. Impassive.<br />
<br />
Also - I wasn't aware that &quot;lower delay = more chance for AA abilities to happen because you swing more.&quot; I thought that it worked exactly the same way that everything else in the game related to weapon swinging worked: while attack is on, you have a certain % chance per minute of swings for the ability to go off. Lower delay = more swings = less chance = same chance /min. Higher Delay = less swings = more chance = same chance/min. <br />
That is, if you have two different twohanders with these AAs, you will see them trigger the same amount, irrelevant of delay. <br />
<br />
If the model maicom presented is correct (never checked, I honestly don't know) it still wouldn't possibly scale enough, based on delay, to make up for the difference in damage, as 5 delay would be nearly negligible in the &quot;firing rate&quot; (what, maybe a few extra hits every few mins?) whereas every time it fires the pally one is a sizable chunk of damage more.<br />
<br />
I also think it's fair game to bring our other AAs into the picture if we're gonna be so thoroughly comparative - but that those AAs don't really amount to shit except the Pally epic being far more powerful due to theirs &amp; the nature of the group heals. Ours doesn't scale that way...<br />
<br />
Bottomline is it's only epic if all the shit that's on it isn't &quot;bleh&quot; and what it's looking like is that the real epic for high-enders will be that 2.0 weapon, and this one is the carrot to keep the whining &quot;wah, I am casual I want an epic!&quot; people at bay. Every 10 mins in BoT the click RULEZ. The lifetap focus is great for someone rocking a war crested ring and greatstaff of four winds. OMG TWO PROC SLOTZ!!!! <br />
<br />
Seriously, for this to even register in a pally v sk pissing match, both parties would be far past the utility of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Stats/ratio wise, the SK and pally epics are just fine.  People bitching there need to get over it and learn how to compare weapons' potential DPS, rather than just looking at a couple numbers and making a horribly inaccurate assumption.  <br />
<br />
As for the effects, however, there is a serious problem.  Paladins got a very useful tanking spell which will be a great boon to them in many group and offtanking situations.  No matter what you do with our effect, it's not likely to be on par in that regard.  Our effect has the potential to be a useful group utility/support effect, but we'd benefit much more from an effect that augmented our primary role (like pallys' epic effect does) than added group support/utility.  Because of this, our effect is flawed more deeply than merely a minor twink is liable to rectify.  Certainly a twink to the current effect is better than nothing, and nothing is not an option, but honestly, we need a new effect all together to put ours on par with paladins' in terms of augmenting one's primary role.  <br />
<br />
And frotty, no, a lifetap focus is no where near comperable in terms of being a &quot;defensive effect&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think the effect sucks, but quite frankly, I won't be questing the weapon for the effect. Anyone who truly thinks the Epic 1.5 is a waste because of the effect either has something better, or just want something to complain about (actually, that is alot of the population of this board). It's a really good sword that people who aren't in Time+ can obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Iosif_McCloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Stats/ratio wise, the SK and pally epics are just fine.  People bitching there need to get over it and learn how to compare weapons' potential DPS, rather than just looking at a couple numbers and making a horribly inaccurate assumption.  <br />

I agree, the Stats are fine.. i have my PERSONAL Like's / Dislies on Dmg/delay, Thats becuse i like seeing Massive Hits.. but over all if you got vary good atk a lower Delay wep should outperform a Higher Delay becuse the STR Bonuse to hit is Applie more often... I'll find the Post on Steel Warriors...<br />
<br />
The Effect.. As is, is a joke.. Pretty much your clicking for 3-400hp self healing and 50% hit chance... Thay just need to compleaty rework the Epic Clicky.. this is NO WERE in line with the others.. Not even close... Maybe if it loasted 120sec... But 18sec no way...<br />
<br />
Really disspointed in the Effect..</div></div><hr />

You have to remeber that SKs have way more offensive spells that will make up for the 9 less damage on weapon. I myself would rather have the effect from SK 1.5 than pally. Pally's have the stuns yes, but SK's have the DoTs, Life Taps, Life Tap procs, and 9k HT. About the only thing I could see Pally's out damaging SKs on would be undead if they have all thier slay undead aa ext.</div></div><hr />

And so since we're the somewhat established &quot;more offensive&quot; of the two, it makes sense to you to give pallies a more offensive weapon combat wise, seeing how SKs cast more and so swing less because of it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Speaking of the focus, why the hell isn't it just a generic nuke focus on that weapon?  I like the 35% focus to lifetaps, sure, but why not just 35% to all nukes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">35% focus on all spells would just be way to powerful  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the hell do you figure that, There is 30% focus to all spells now.  I have one and 5% more isnt going to break the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>phaerun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">stat wise our epic is fine.  the paladin epic stats are like that cuz they need all the help they can get. paladins are kidz with special needz :p<br />
<br />
now the devs, in all their infinite wisdom, need to fix our clicky cuz it sux big time and make it as useful for us and our group members as useful is the pally epic clicky for them and their group members :p</div></div><hr />
