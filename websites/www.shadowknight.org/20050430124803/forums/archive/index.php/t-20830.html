<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>borrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is plane of growth actually feasible at 54 or 55? i have ok gear id say. im just wondering if i should try this or not. my magelo is linked to my sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Question is, why do you want to go there?  Better zones, without the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you are referring to soloing in pog, its not possible / worth it for the classes who can anymore.<br />
<br />
they brought back the protectors of growth, which respawn every 20 min and home in with zonewide aggro on the nearest non-invis KoS person.<br />
<br />
they are pretty tuff and come 2 at a time usually, i used to plat farm the hell out of PoG / PoH on the necro..making thousands(2k max) in 3 or 4 hours! quick, nerf the zones so soloists can't take advantage of this dangerous but fun way to make a little plat.<br />
<br />
i can kill them both on the necro but its totally pointless when they just respawn on ya in 20-30 min all night long</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>borrean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">not wanting to go for any reason specific.  Im just looking for a goood solo spot where i can make good xp and maybe some decent loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoG isn't soloable at those levels. However it's great place to take a group of friends around that level to make money, exp isn't that great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What about PoM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nadox is good, by torgrain mines zone in..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A group of 55's would do better in Nadox or Droga.  There is respectable loot available in either from the named that randomly spawn in both from ph's.  Some could even be upgrades for your groupmates and yourself.  You'd be fighting lvl 53-60 mobs that don't hit like PoP mobs (except for the bosses).  Nadox also has undead to help get your evocation up, in case you didn't do so as you leveled.<br />
<br />
Both are fun zones/dungeons, and invis works all through droga, and most of Nadox.<br />
<br />
If you're still wearing less-than Velious era armor, then it could be worthwhile for some of the no-drop pieces (PoG).  However, there is better armor available at reasonable prices in the bazar that's better than PoG stuff now.  A few sessions in Droga, and you could buy a full suit of cultural, which is comparable or better than ToV/Kael armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lazy74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you can get a succor when you zone into nadox, you can easily solo those mobs by the entrance to the temple at 51...get yourself a virtue and you should have no problem at all...there's plenty of room to fear kite them back near the zone area without pulling any adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We need a sticky that says &quot;levels 49-55 GO TO NADOX AND TORGIRAN&quot; that is all.</div></div><hr />
