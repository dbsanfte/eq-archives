<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vadyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, 35 Sk here. My question is this. What good is the pet in a group situation? I got a new pet at 30, and it was already green. It really makes me wonder if it is even worth buying the pet spell to begin with at each level.<br />
<br />
I have a 66 Beast and a 50 Necro. So playing a &quot;pet&quot; class is nothing new. And yes I realize and understand that Sk's are not considered &quot;pet&quot; classes. I would like to know tho, just what exactly the pets use is for. Is it for looks? Or as a guard? *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are a fair number of uses for your pet, aside from what should be the glaringly obvious extra dps for a one-time mana cost.  Not buying it because its green to you is a really bad idea. <br />
<br />
Search through these forums, and you will find a fair number of uses for your pet in the many threads on the subject.  Searching for &quot;pet* pulling&quot; is a good start (use &quot;pet*&quot; instead of &quot;pet* to get around the minimum number of characters requirement in the search engine).</div></div><hr />

Plus it does add some dps in group and solo situations. My favoriite is that on Rallos Zek, this skeleton was my best friend in the old days as I was nearly soloing through to 54 till I left (damn PKs)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Envoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the pets increase in viability as you go up in lvl, particularly once you start getting the pet AAs.  Pet hold makes NOT having a pet up silly.  My current pet (the omens pet) can do about 1/4 of my melee DPS.  I use him to aggro kite all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your pet is your most effecient DoT, one of your unique pulling tools, one more source of potential interrupts for casters, etc. - Boner has numerous uses, varying depending upon what you're doing/what level you are.</div></div><hr />
