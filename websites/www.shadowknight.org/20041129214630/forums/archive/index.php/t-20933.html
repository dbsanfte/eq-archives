<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, looks like I can't ride my UH-steed when invissed anymore?<br />
When I ride along and click my rule#1 I become invis but the horse stops moving :mad:<br />
Also it appears that the &quot;point of view&quot; has somehow been moved backwards with the last patch. This means when I start to ride fast my body blocks the view. Really stupid :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same thing here well at first I could port accross the zone when I used my rule 1 on my horse.<br />
<br />
Then the next day there was a patch and now i just stop and dig into the ground when I cast rule 1 on my horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guess I should try to invis while riding my lizard, just to see if it's just the Unholy Steed that's broken or if it's across the board.  I hadn't noticed a problem with invis when not riding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grabatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have not noticed any problems riding invis (yet), but i am also getting the effect of the viewpoint falling behind rider and horse. For me it seems to depend on the lag situation. In some zones it behaves at it used to, in more laggy zones the viewpoint falls behind - sometimes more, sometimes less. It always returns to normal when i slow down or stop.<br />
When i zone with my mount, i very often enter the destination zone half way sunken into the ground (or sticking on the ceiling in case of BoT).<br />
Ah yes, the horse i use is of course the AA horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lejina Bloodbath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can see invis, you dont have any problem to ride your horse invised.<br />
<br />
However, if you cant see invis, you cant move while on your horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you invis while on your horse and you can't see invis, you do move, you just don't see where you're moving too... the camera gets stuck occasionally. but if you open up map window you can see where you're moving to.<br />
<br />
i imagine this will be fixed when they fix the camera moving out of first person when running on horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol, sounds like that is much more messed up than I imagined :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But thanks for the &quot;see invis&quot; tip I'll try that /cheer</div></div><hr />
