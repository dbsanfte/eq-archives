<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Velnarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just thinking of making a necro to mess around with and gnome seemed like the funniest to RP.  Obviously I can't play a gnome seriously, but it would be fun to mess with tinkering too.  I'd go DE for necro, but my SK is already one and like 90% of necros I see are also DE. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
When a gnome necro or SK casts a spell that gives them skeleton illusion, are they instantly made 6 feet tall?  If so, doesn't that seem a bit... off to anyone else?  Then again I guess same with iksar SK and iksar skeletons (I don't think iksars get to look like iksar skeletons anyway).<br />
<br />

&quot;At last after years of hard work and experimentation, my greatest and most diabolical creation is finally completed!&quot;  *holds up a rebreather*  &quot;Those fools will never expect my undead army to attack from the sea!  Aha ha ha ha ha ha, ha ha h-!  *wheeze*  Gobaner!  *wheeze*  Have you seen my asthma inhaler?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Muffinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes they do become neutrel sized, and gnomes are not to be taken seriously. If you want to be serious make any other class but a gnome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Being a gnome is great...<br />
<br />
I started my 65 Dark elf sk over after I had 200 aa just to be a gnome...Well geared at the time :).<br />
<br />
I have never regretted that decision..</div></div><hr />

You are way off i want to be class gnome, i think though ill be an Ogre gnome, the no stun would just complete it.</div></div><hr />

Touche good sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scabben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iksar &gt; all for necros though if you don't wanna sweat regen later (this is beyond your lifetaps.. you'll be more comfy doing other, more dps-ish spells)<br />
<br />
I curse making mine DE to this day... but iksar was hated in freeport!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gnomes are amazing, there is nothing better than having a 3ft tall football tanking a 100ft giant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh muffinz says gnomes arent to be taken seriously and he has a name like muffinz?<br />
