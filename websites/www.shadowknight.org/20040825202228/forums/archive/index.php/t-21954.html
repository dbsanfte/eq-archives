<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, that's right - guppies.  This world needs alot more guppies; mosquitos must die.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But guppies are harmlessly cute little fish!&quot; you say?  Well, guppies are maniacle mosquito-murdering machines.  I don't like mosquitos.  <br />
<br />
Brian... I hate to break it to you, but guppies &gt; trout - trout don't eat anything useful.  <br />
<br />
What am I suggesting?  Fill every last body of standing water with a fuckton of guppies.  No puddle, ditch, pond, lake, marsh, swamp, bog, or swimming pool is exempt - they all need guppies.  Then all would be well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Saruton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They die way to easy and fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And they breed even easier and faster.  I don't care if there's a high turnover rate, they still do the job just the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Easy solution. Move to Colorado. Don't think I've been bitten by a mosquito since I moved here 6-7 years ago. I come from the swamps called New Jersey and know exactly how you feel. Go outside for a BBQ and roast up some ribs with mosquito seasoning... yea mmmmm. You want some ribs with that or that big pile of mosquitos doin ya fine ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd rather just eradicate mosquitos from the earth with a raving mass of guppies and live wherever the hell I want...</div></div><hr />

As a kid I used to be afraid of spiders, till I found out they eat mosquito's. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oberyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and prolly eat more skeeters, not just the larva.<br />
<br />
We need more dragonflies.  Only trouble is, the big bastards HURT when you nail one riding a motorcycle.  A flying guppie might be softer...<br />
<br />
likely just as messy.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the subject of mosquitos, we sell these very cool things where I currently work.  They break down propane to emit Co2, Co2 attracts mosquitos.  Its how they zero in on dinner.   When they come to find out where the Co2 is coming from....ZAP... they get killed.  We tried it out at a friends cabin, for 2 afternoons, and got a mason Jar FULL of dead mosquitos.  <br />
<br />
Expensive little toys, but they really work well.<br />

30!? you got it easy... live near a swamp in florida and there is hell to pay for going outside. we got trucks that drive around spraying mosquito killing shit in the air while driving down the road. its always awesome to get caught behind one of em too.</div></div><hr />

Next time use a simple avon product, (I know avon is for girls, but hold on...listen) They have a product called &quot;Skin so soft&quot;  Harmless little bath oil, but kills ants in a heart beat, and repells the others for months and months. It keeps flys, nats, mosquitos, and any other bug away, and because it's a body oil, it doesn't come off in the lake, unless you are using some soap.<br />
<br />
I spray my dog with it once in awhile, keeps his fur soft, and fleas, ticks and mosquitos away.<br />
<br />
Also works on keeping spiders away.<br />
<br />
<br />
(OFF used to give kids brain damage, because it would seep inthrough their pores, and get into their blood stream)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what you're referring to is the Deet in some off.  Higher concentrations are known to cause temporary schizophrenia.  No shit, look it up.<br />
<br />
Of course, the 100% DEET stuff isn't supposed to be used on skin.  OFF also makes deet-free bug repellant, and frankly temporary schizophrenia is kind of cool.</div></div><hr />

I learned that the most reliable way to not get bitten is to not give off any carbon dioxide into the environment.  Cover your skin in kerosene and try not to exhale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Skin so Soft also repells the nasty biting black flies</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the advice Chayde, I'll have to try it out. The timing of this post is weird...The Metro-sexual episode of South Park was on tonight...Do I have to walk with a limp wrist when I am wearing Skin so soft?  :p <br />

Fish have external fertilization.  Jack off in a bowl of guppies (or somehoe fuck the bowl) = sex with guppies...  You can figure the rest out, I won't ruin Keevel's fantasy with the other details.</div></div><hr />

The irony is that you shared no info.  you come to this board to share info, but you came specifically to the section where info isn't shared and posted.<br />
<br />
Furthering the irony is that through this thread I learned the effect of spaces followed by a character on the minimum character message limit, what guppies eat, how they bread and that the thought of me breeding with guppies scares no one.</div></div><hr />
