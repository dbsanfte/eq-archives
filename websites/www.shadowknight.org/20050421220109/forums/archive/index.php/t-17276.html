I was in Kurn's looking for the glowing skull.  I was in the tunnels on the way out and &quot;a glowing skull&quot; dropped.  I noticed that it was no rent.  So, I whipped out my Silvery Mask.  Item Lore: skull of an undead cook.<br />
<br />
Ok, I thought.  Maybe there's more than one skull and it has to be from the basement.  Next day, I went back and killed for 4 hours in the basement area.  A greater scalebone dropped the skull.  Also no rent, and also ID'd as the skull of an undead cook.<br />
<br />
Has the skull been changed?  Or am I just unlucky and have gotten the incorrect skull multiple times?  The exact name of the skull is &quot;a glowing skull&quot;  Lucy does not show this item in its database.  It does show the Non-norent &quot;A Glowing Skull&quot; which is the item needed. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  Hopefully the quest isn't broken.</div></div><hr />

I got the &quot;A Glowing Skull&quot; (non no-rent) just last week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at this following map:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/kurnsuppermap.html<br />
<br />
After about 6 hours of non-stop endless killing of every Greater Scalebone in sight, the skull dropped in Location #1.<br />
<br />
I had also already spent 6 hours doing the same, the previous night.<br />
<br />
So after about 12 hours total of killing every Greater Scalebone I could find on all floors and the basement, the non-No Rent skull dropped.  <br />
<br />
In all that time, I have never seen or heard of a No-Rent version of that skull.<br />
<br />
Also, just about every half hour I spent in the zone I /shouted that I was looking for the &quot;A Glowing Skull&quot; and that I was willing to pay to loot it.  Of course it seems it is just so rare that no one in the zone during the times that I was there, had ever heard of that skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Update:  4 more hours, still no skull.  3 more no rent skulls dropped though.  A Guide said he &quot;thought there might be two items with the same name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here is the screenshot of the skull:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>IsawaKumo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The proper 'Glowing Skull' for this quest drops off of skeletons in the basement. It is No-Rent, as opposed to the other Glowing Skull. Did the quest last night with this skull, so I'm sure that the No-Rent one is what is needed :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know I used a Glowing Skull which was NOT no rent at the time. I usually clear kurns now for about an hour when farming bone chips once per month or so and one always drops during a clearing. I have not noticed one to be no rent yet.<br />
<br />
It could very well have changed however since I did this portion of the quest. I just completed the whole thing today, after weeks of waiting for the Acolyte to pop on server ups and finally camping him for 8 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkWyld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed.  When I completed this part of the quest, I got the skull (not No Rent) from Greater Scalebones in the Dining Room, at the TOP of the tower.  Unless something changed since I did this quest, this is where you need to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did the quest last week with the no rent glowing skull and it worked just fine.  Got it in basement area where the fingerbone skeleton spawns for the monk quest.  I was lucky dropped of the first icebone skelly that popped.   I was also lucky with Dalnir's was expecting a long camp so I loaded up on food and drink and headed in.  Did the whole quest in about 4 hours tops.  Funny thing is that there was a level 59 SK in there as well and he had been camping for days.  Too bad that zone isn't used very often because I like the layout.  Mobs must be real tough for those in the level range and it would seem to be quite the challenge for a group.  Next stop Kaesora and MM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Glad to hear that the quest DOES work with the no rent skull.  I was worried that we might need to solve the old Cook's Skull quest in the Tower to recreate the old non-norent drop.  i think that's what they tried to do, but didn't fix the item ID.  (Not sure though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did this Quest just over 1 week ago.<br />
<br />
The correct way to do the Quest, is with a No Drop skull that is not No Rent. <br />
<br />
I did the Quest with the No Drop skull, that is not No Rent...<br />
<br />
Spent 12 hours over 2 days camping it.   Never saw a No Rent version drop.   No one else in the zone, during the times I was there, had ever heard of either version of the Skull.<br />
<br />
If SOE left a No Rent version in the game that works, it was probably a mistake and something we shouldn't make very well known, especially if the No Rent is more common of a drop as some people here have claimed.   SOE will probably go and nerf it, if it was a mistake and we make too big a deal out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not questioning whether or not there is a second skull.  I'm questioning whether or not the original non-norent skull even drops anymore.  If you look at past patch messages, you will see that they &quot;fixed&quot; the skull of torture quest during a patch.<br />
<br />
I think that this drop has changed recently.  Can anyone confirm picking up a NON-Norent skull within the past week?<br />
<br />
In any case, people have said that the no-rent version works for the Khukri quest.  Hopefully all is well, and they just made the thing norent.  I have a bit a factioning before I can get that khukri...  So, I'll find out soon.  :-)<br />
<br />
If anyone else has any thoughts or ideas, feel free to voice em.  Even if out of sheer morbid curiosity...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did the Test of Suffering last night and the only skull I saw drop wasnt no-rent.<br />
<br />
Worked just find for turn in though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Looks like the skull has been officially changed.  The item was updated recently on Allakhazam.  Someone sent in a pic of the new no-rent skull.  So, mystery is solved.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hatre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mirgo Dowers Head (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2177) <br />
<br />
The above quest is for the Skull of Torture (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24609) one of the steps in this quest yeilds a Glowing Skull (no rent) which you then hand to the skeleton cook.  Inside the Hollow Skull, combine: Bone Chips + Zombie Flesh x2 + Salt Minnow. This yields you a Kurn's Jerky Delight (edible, so make sure not to eat it). <br />
<br />
The Hollow Skull is returned to you. Now combine the Kurn's Jerky Delight + Preserved Eyes + Dried Tongue in the same container. This yields you a Glowing Skull (which is NO RENT).  are these glowing skulls one and the same and hence interchangeable in each quest?  enabling you to skip the combines in Mirgo Dowers Head (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2177) if you happened to get the dropped one, or to do the combines to skip the camping for one for the khukri?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tescin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I completed the Skull of Torture Quest the day after it was fixed.  When you do the combine of the Kurn's jerky, left eye, right eye and tongue, the result is a different item, I believe that it is &quot;New Glowing Skull&quot;<br />
<br />
It is also norent, but is a different item.   If you do that quest , make sure you don't do the combine until the cook spawns.  His PH is a 60 minute timer, and he seems to have a 1 in 4 chance of popping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I got the skull it was in the basement.  This was a while back and I got it off of the second or third skeleton I killed.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize that it was such a rare drop, or maybe it wasn't at the time.  Considering how long it took to get the damned pages from the froglok raiders for the pervious khukri, I guess I was due a lucky drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valkyria Grymreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Working on the Greenmist quest and did the glowing skull part.<br />
<br />
I can confirm now that the hand in using the NO RENT glowing skull DOES work. Thats what I used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An Iksar SK guildie of mine just tried this Quest a couple weeks ago... <br />
<br />
I went to help him try to get the skull and he got the No Rent version to drop... I told him it might work and to go try so he did.<br />
<br />
It did not work and the NPC ate the skull and told him it was the wrong item.    I have yet to try and confirm this for myself... but now I have another guildie working on this Quest, an Erudite SK, and will be going to look for this skull soon... So I'll update, if I remember, with her results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did this part of the quest for a second time, did the turn in two days ago (15 March 04).  I used the NO RENT version of the skull, nothing was eaten, and I got the next khukri.<br />
<br />
I camped it for about five minutes at the very very bottom of Kurn's, in the area where lots of lesser icebones and lesser charbones roam around, the area that looks like caverns with some pools of water.  The skull dropped about about 1/3 skeletons there.  I let about four rot just trying to find my way out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Peztilence Forever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yup.<br />
<br />
 Dont people research before they Quest ? Took me about 10mins to get this drop. Its probably the easiest part of the Quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">haha... when I zoned into Kurn's to go hunting for my skull, some group that had gotten a bit overwhelmed had just trained the zone with 4 or 5 mobs. I had two skulls drop in the mobs that attacked me at zone in! :D</div></div><hr />
