<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jagdwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well fellow sk's, like most of you I have soloed most of my &quot;life&quot;.  I even left a guild becuase I was told my approach to the sk was usless and i should just tank it.  Well here is my sk approach.<br />
<br />
First Im a Lizard!  Woot!  and on the Tribunal server. My log in is my &quot;toon&quot; name.<br />
<br />
I am a caster.  Most all of my gear is, well geared to mana production, dexterity and hit points.  I currenly at lvl 54 (with 9 aa) I currenly have 2800 ish mana and 2200 ish hit points.  I can solo PoD flies with fear kitting and with full mana i can take a PoD rat.  <br />
<br />
With this much mana and the variety of spells i can usually do about 30% damage with out swinging my sword. <br />
<br />
With our unique fear kitting abliity and our darness spells we are awesome crowd controlers.<br />
<br />
Like many I pull with darkness.  Hit them with the spear line of spells and dot them with the blood based spells and heart flutter.  I then fear them and switch to our awesome buff set of spells, buff me, debuff them and switch back to my dot set.  All the while Banshee Aura and Mental Corruption are up to hurt them if they hit me and replenish my mana at their expense!<br />
<br />
With the correct timing and carefull pathing (of fear) you are almost unhurtable.<br />
<br />
We lack the ability to do massive amounts of dmg like a warrior or monk so we have to &quot;control&quot; our prey.  With the shield bash and a quick high damage 1hs/b (haste helps) we can do enough dmg that well clerics are not needed!    Let a warrior or monk say that!<br />
<br />
Well thats my 2 cents worth.  you ever want to see it in action and your on tribunal come look me up.  I will show you, but I suspect you can really figure it out!  <br />
<br />
Thats what we really are good at.  We need brains to play.....not muscles or click mez......click charm.<br />
<br />
With the RM life tap quest spell or the higher level tap spells.  Well hows the phrase go.  &quot;thats one less hit point for you and one more hit point for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well good (and I say that with all respect for the good races and classes)  (NOT) hunting<br />
