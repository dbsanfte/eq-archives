<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ShadowRaptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">:D  Guess what i found a couple days back on the same night of the patch?<br />
<br />
Lhranac's Corroded Bracer has the item graphic of Velious plate bracers for the armor quests (obviously) LORE ITEM MAGIC NO DROP<br />
<br />
All All<br />
IDs as: Lhranac's Corroded Bracer (bah)<br />
<br />
Dropped off of a named mob (im pretty sure) in Howling Stones (Charasis) you know ... that zone no one goes to anymore in the Overthere  :p <br />
<br />
anyways ... i went per request of a Task that i started in the Dread Lands just to see what they were like... i ended up spending 3 days or so down there and had tons of nameds pop and lots of loot drop and completed the master key to Charasis ... this bracer dropped among other things ... i just completed my old epic about a week or so ago before this and rememberd the name on the bracer was the same name of the Final SK Epic 1.0 so i grabbed it and its now banked... ive never seen this drop here not even since the revamp and ive spent a decent ammount of time down in Charasis ... <br />
<br />
not only that ... but in one of the wings ... (cant remember which) i killed &quot;an undead oblation&quot; trying to clear the trash to &quot;the Crypt Keeper&quot; for the key to the next wing so i could finish my task ... and right after i killed it a Spectre (like necro pets look) spawned on top of the corpse with the name Ghost of Mera ... Blue con to 65 ... i hailed it and it spoke about realizing it was dead but that it wished it could complete its work ... and that it worked with Jars (not like a person but ... you know ... containers ; P lol ) and after that i couldnt get it to talk to me ... so i did the natural SK thing ... attack it ... wouldnt let me attack it and it was still up 2 days later... probably isnt up anymore because of the patch we had though<br />
<br />
im on the Tholuxe Palles server if you got any questions &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
 Laters<br />
<br />
oh and just thinking ... i went to CoM to see if i could hand the bracer to this supposed lhranac lookalike laying down in CoM near the goo house... no luck of course... wasnt Lhranac... but i did notice lhranac wasnt in CoM at the house anymore... but this was right after the most recent patch so i dunno ... he could have been down ... i dont know anything about his spawn time after patches so /shrug ... if he really is gone permanantly from CoM this could be the new way to finish up epic 1.0 or some crap... and have nothing to do with epic 2.0 but id still keep the pieces anyway just incase<br />
<br />
/shrug just a thought<br />
<br />
Update: Confirmed drop of Lhranac's Ring from &quot;rotting knight&quot; and &quot;rissen commander&quot; in Kithcor forest at night ... Both were zombies... just got mine going to try to get the unconfirmed Lhranac's Amulet or whatever see if it drops off other mobs in CoM incase its not just Reavers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binnib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just killed the Black Reaver on the first floor (the one that leads into Lord Ghiosk), first one dropped &quot;Lhranc's Pendant&quot; (Magic, Lore, No Drop, 0.2 weight).  Second Reaver just had coin, then had Ghiosk spawn.</div></div><hr />
