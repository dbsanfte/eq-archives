When can we expect to see the &quot;class description&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Taken from our list and grouped to start a discussion on the 2 most pressing issues (as I see it of course)<br />
1. Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
2. SK's are supposed to be tied as the 2nd best tank but have the lowest damage avoidence of all melee classes. (currently being evaluated)<br />
8. A method to reduce damage allowing us to compete with Paladin stuns (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
 - Why are Shadowknights the only Tank class without some form of damage mitigation (defensive, stuns)? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. SK spellbook needs to scale to evolving content better. (currently being evaluated)<br />
4. It is currently too tough for us to channel spells. (currently being evaluated)<br />
6. Our spell based aggro needs fixed and designed to scale. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
- Shadowknight spell lines have gone from situational to not being effective.  What changes can we expect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Specnatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly, all the things being currently evaluated will only change if you  buy the next expansion.  That seems what SOE would do just to gouge a few more bucks out of folks.  Because honestly they dont seem to care about anything as long as they are getting there $12.95 a month from all of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Q. Are there encounters in the game that require you to have a shadowknight present due to the shadowknight's unique skills?  Or for which shadowknight is clearly the best choice for the task or encounter?  What are those encounters?<br />
<br />
I can think of several encounters that require warriors.  Same for clerics.  Same for wizards.  Same for rogues.  Same for bards.  Same for necros.  Same for magicians.  But nothing where people say &quot;we need a shadowknight for that&quot;.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is... there are plenty of times when a warrior is a better choice than a shadowknight.  Or when a paladin is a better choice than a shadowknight.  When are the times when a shadowknight is a better choice than a warrior?  Or when a shadowknight is a better choice than a paladin?<br />
<br />
Q. Does Terror of Thule always give you the maximum amount of hate on the hate list?  What are the situations in which it does not give the full amount of hate?  Is this as intended?  Which shadowknight spell has the best hate/mana ratio?  If the spell with the best hate/mana ratio is not in the terror line, why not?<br />

Yes, mainly in raid settings but theres a few group areas.<br />

<br />
Terrors give the amount they say every cast except for on initial aggro where it gets cut off (just like every other spell with the exception of possibly fear).  Best ratio spell for hate/mana is CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Istar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This caught my eye, so they holding off on our lists till this all around class definition is produced ? wonder if this thing will be done by december ~<br />

I don't think folks should expect a response to each point on the class issues list. We are working on class definition documents and would like to make sure that each class has a role in all levels and types of game play. Much of what was on the lists was wish list items and not necessarily items that would help to define a classes role. In fact many of the requested items would infringe upon already defined roles of other classes and that is something we definately do not want to do. Let's wait and see what the class definition documents have to say before we expect any new changes (other than things that are broken or just don't make sense.)  <br />
 <br />
<br />
The Community team has asked for a role description for each class?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You don't ask a question and except a serious reply, Brenlo will turn around dodge it. Better to try and prove with the question. Since he is ging dodge the answer, lets have the wording reflex the anger in the community.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>scaledge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Alrighty then!!!<br />
<br />
Here's an idea:<br />
<br />
How about we relatively politely as in not like&quot;Gimme them you fucking asslicker!!!&quot;(despite brenlo perhaps deserving it in some people's opinions), request an ETA on said class definitions(rough, not necessarily precise), and for said class definitions to be publicly released via the sony forums or website.<br />
<br />
Also, preferably updates on what ideas THEY have so far in terms of class definitions(and none of this RPed crap you find IE kunark guide, I'm talking what THEY THINK THE CLASSES ARE IRL).<br />
<br />
Once we have THOSE then we can start making REAL decisions about where WE want our class to go from here.</div></div><hr />

Q. Why not remove us from the anti-group/raid friendly class? pls thxs</div></div><hr />
