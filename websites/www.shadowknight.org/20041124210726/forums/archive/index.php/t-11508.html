<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">even paladins, just use a random human or hobbit model, make it not a combat pet, more like the wizzie one where it helps something, like reduces your encumbered wt by 25% when he is there or.  Or something fairly silly like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Liabach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sentient axe is nice, and with shrink, i pretend hes my long dead gnome squire.  Mostly i think pali's should get the squire, and us a henchman.  <br />
<br />
I'd just prefer a henchman who doesnt smell quite so dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mazzic D'Vainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would we do with Henchmen?<br />
<br />
Would they go out and collect protection PP from the local merchants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, we have a squire: the SK skelly pet! He may not carry stuff for us, but he calls us &quot;oh great one&quot; and &quot;master&quot; and whatever else, plus he hits stuff. and that's ok by me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meriboh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would prefer a war dog complete with spiked collar, choke chain and drool.<br />
Then, I could most certainly cry havoc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deslegrate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd love to see a graphic for a hell hound as our pets.  Mini-Cerebrus following us around.  Even with same crappy stats as the skel we have. (until the big necro pet is available.) <br />
<br />
The thing I don't understand is why they just recycle so much crap for all classes/races.  Beast lords at least get warders based on race, would be nice if they put a little effort into some of the older classes.  Mages even got nice upgraded graphics on thier pets, actually like the way they look.  SK's and Necs are pretty stuck with crappy old Goner.<br />
<br />
The best idea would be to make a carbon copy of yourself, sort of like what WotD does.  Again carbon copy only for looks, but still same stats as the other pet.  Now that would be neat.  Just fun idea's, never happen.  Still though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it would be cool if you could kill something and then reanimate it and use it as your underling until you zone. Think of the possibilities :) You could have a big fat undead dragon pet or a moss snake pet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Requiam O'Souls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Necro's have that, it's an AA skill called 'Wake the Dead.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greggthegrmreapr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">make a mage, get to 39, get the spell monster summoning... head to newbie zone, let the fun begin</div></div><hr />

- they sing to much<br />
<br />
and i quote the great mullen:<br />
<br />
&quot;*sings*<br />
<br />
First I was afraid....I was petrified!<br />
Thinking &quot;If that mob hits me again, then I might cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then the chanter cast a spell and that mob was mezzed...<br />
And I didnt die....<br />
Oh no, not I......<br />
<br />
And now your back!<br />
From your long raid!<br />
You didn't get any loots and now you feel betrayed!<br />
<br />
I should have left you while you're gone<br />
I should have gone role/anon<br />
But now your back...<br />
And I feel like I've been played!<br />
<br />
No, no, no, I! I will survive!<br />
As long as I keep memming gate, you can kiss my butt good-bye!<br />
I gave all I have to give, I spent all my mana to live...<br />
But I will survive! <br />
<br />
Hey hey!&quot;<br />
- mullen<br />
<br />
yes yes, thats why we dont get small people for pets</div></div><hr />
