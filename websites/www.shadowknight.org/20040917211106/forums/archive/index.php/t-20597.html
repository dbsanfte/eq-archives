<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cooker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I checked around the boards a bit and could not find it so I thought I'd ask.<br />
<br />
With Improved Harm Touch, Spell Casting Fury 3, and Unholy Touch 3, and disc, what is the max damage you can do to PCs in duels or arena. <br />
<br />
First, on a blue server? Is it 66% of normal damage?<br />
<br />
Second, on PvP servers?<br />
<br />
I have also heard rumors that when we use Unholy Aura disc that the spell reflect buffs like Mirror cannot send it back to us. Is this true? <br />
<br />
I have heard many different answers and wanted to hear from the experts. If anyone wants to give me the complete run-down on this or a thread link that I missed I'd be very appreciative, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play on a Blue server and my highest in a deul so far was for over 5k against a time guilded war (he only had 1-2 peices at that time).  Spear, Spear, ToInny, meleed for a few and then dropped the bomb on him.  He had been talking smack so I made it as fast as possible 8D.  Entire fight took maybe 20 seconds tops from start to finish.  We were both self buffed only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All Spells and abilities do only 66% of their Dmg to PC's regardless of the server-ruleset. <br />
All Burst dmg abilities like HarmTouch, Manaburn and LiefBurn do a max of 75% of the Targets Max Hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cooker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Someone had told me that you can no longer manaburn, lifeburn, PCs? Is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That is not true, the other day, my buddy in the baz arena was manaburning people, its just that you can only nuke 75% of a person's life, no matter what spell/lvl/class/ability/server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>signa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i took a manaburn in vex thal the other day just because it was boring as shit ;x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What you probably heard (or should have heard, maybe the person telling you got messed up too) is that you can't Lifeburn in Blue server duels/arena, because it has a Lifetap-DoT component with it, and for anyone that has tried to use bond of death in a duel, you know that those spells simply do not work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Numzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm an almost related question, how much dmg does &quot;classic HT&quot; do to a NPC at lvl65?<br />
I think I never used it at that level. A friend told me it's 2k, is it that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have no HT AAs yet, at 65 (other than SCF1, if that counts, though I haven't critted an HT yet), and with HT + Disc + ID4 (Ring) I have HTs anywhere from 1800 (that one mighta been a resist, not sure) to 2700ish, I just barely hit 3k with the bard ID song going.</div></div><hr />
