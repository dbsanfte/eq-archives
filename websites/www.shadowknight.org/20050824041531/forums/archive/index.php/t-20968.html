<br />
<br />
I was messing around Natimbi lastnight, but did not have much time to test enough mobs.<br />
<br />
So far what I have seen is the mobs have very low hitpoints, which makes dot kiting more effective.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a sweet exp spot which yields results simillar to PoFire picnic tables?</div></div><hr />

Rare drops can be decent for both areas, depending on your gear. Can also solo for some of the quest items. XP wise it's not really worth it, as most are blue or even cons and 10% or so summon.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't too hard but the exp really wasn't worth the risk, not to mention no drops.  Better off kiting in Fire or Water really.</div></div><hr />

GoD stuff has significantly less hp than PoP stuff, so it goes much faster.  Wouldnt do it for exp though, you're much better off grouped anywhere or kiting in fire.</div></div><hr />
