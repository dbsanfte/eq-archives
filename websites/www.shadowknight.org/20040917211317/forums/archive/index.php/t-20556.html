<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, im doing my epic atm, why? ive wanted it since kunark, and everyone said id be stupid for doing it now (Im using Greatstaff of the Four Winds) and I have a reputation to uphold :p <br />
<br />
Few questions. <br />
<br />
1. Im doing the ghoulbane quest atm, dont want to trash frog faction, ive been in unrest killing ghouls for almost 4 hours now, and still no ghoul heart, killed crazed ghouls, regular ghouls, carrion etc.. are they still dropping after the patch? <br />
<br />
2. Im KOS to Bloodsabres / Opal Darkbriar / Dark Reflection... did alot of killing of random mobs in freeport and stuff just for the hell of it... didnt know Teydar was needed for quest. Is there anyway I can turn in sheath / ghoulbane / soul leech / boa to him since im max KOS? <br />
<br />
3. How hard is rharzar? could I take him with just me (65 sk / 66 AA's) and a 65 shaman? <br />
<br />
<br />
Any info is highly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">with a 65 cleric i killed rharzar at level 62 and 6 AA.  he was kind of tough cause he heals himself.  65 sk and 65 shammy should own him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. The ghoul heart is just a pain in the butt and rare.  Its still better than camping uguk.<br />
<br />
2. All the hand-in NPCs are on Truespirit.  If you're KOS to those around them (like Teydar), pull them to a zone, zone out and in, and do the transaction.  On the other hand, I just got my Bloodsabres faction up by 20 minutes of killing kolandil fish near the Qeynos cleric/paladin guild.  No other quest guys are near potentially KOS mobs that I can remember.  Duriek maybe?  Heretics faction is 15 minutes of Erudin guard killing (or 2 hours in the warrens  =P).<br />
<br />
3. Easy.  Yes.  IIRC, he's magic immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got the ghoul heart right as I was about to give up and go to uguk lol. Just need scroll now. <br />
<br />
thanks for the info guys, much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />
