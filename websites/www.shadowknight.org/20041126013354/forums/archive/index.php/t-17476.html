<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think its a rip that palys HP buf stacks with brells and ours doesnt. This gives them 2 or 3 hundred more HPs than us when fully buffed.So get out there and complain till they hook us up. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats why all the pallys seem to have more HP then me with similiar gear.  I doubt we will will get this changed however but would be nice to pick up 300 xtra hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hknightismaname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you ever use Aura of Pain?...<br />
They get HP we get AC not big deal really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They also get more buff slots, and dont have to use a spell slot on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lyrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And ac is by no means an acceptable exchange for pure hp~~ pallies get an extra 350hp + mana regen from Aura of the Crusader. We get cloak of luclin which has less hp than bss and Aura stacks with bss ..... our auras are utter crap, little more than spiffy trinckets to let a rogue, monk, bst see hwo high theyre attack can accually get. Aura of hate/pain is by no means an acceptable replacement for Aura of the Crusader. 1st they screwed our aggro now our hp~ course i have more to say but ... ill let it slide<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pallies have more defense...we have more offense...I agree Aura of the Crusader should NOT stack with brells, but then pallies would say our taps shouldnt stack with say Ferine Avatar...its all in a matter of how fucked up the game is..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dont really care to much , they are the defensive tank hybrid. We are the offensive tank hybrid ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drakonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aura of the Crusader should stack with brells.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't, however, stack with the Focus line, if it is indeed a mini version of the Cleric Blessed Armor line.  (Which the benefits and cast-on messages suggest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO all that needs to be done is, move aura of hate/pain to the song buff window, after all they both last a very short time and take up a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Add a -50 resist adjust to Aura of Pain to make it easier to land.<br />
<br />
Other than that we are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sibrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh.. and u know.. It might be kind of funny if we actually had a useful self buff, I mean, pallies get buffs to buff others with yeah and SK's shouldn't get those..<br />
<br />
But something like AoC would be nice for sks on self only.. or upgrade Cloak of Luclin to give more hps than Brells would suit me even.. how thier group buff has more hps than our single self only lvl 65 one is kind of sad.<br />
<br />
Old stuff but still fun to beat at i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cloak having a mana regen component would be great. Or atk. Especially atk. This would make it even more clear that pally=defensive sk=offensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">man, aura's in the song window would rock=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aura of the crusader is for making pally hp just a few % off warrios and pissing them off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3490&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
it seems theyve been messing with the stackability of CoL not that it'll matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">AotC shouldn't stack with focus, it's highly highly unlikely that it will be changed at this point however.</div></div><hr />

AotC shouldn't stack with focus, it's highly highly unlikely that it will be changed at this point however.  <br />
<br />
Yep, and the thing that sucks most, is when they rework the warrior hp bonus they will base of a paladins using AoC, forgeting that sk cant stack their buffs in the same fasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No they won't</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i would mainly like to see  CoL to be better then brells and SoT, thats all :). it dont have to stack with em but at least if ya give me a self buff, at least make it better then other classes buffs of that line. <br />
<br />
maybe add like 100ac to it and some atk(like 20-50) and up hp some or just add some hp/mana regen to it.</div></div><hr />
