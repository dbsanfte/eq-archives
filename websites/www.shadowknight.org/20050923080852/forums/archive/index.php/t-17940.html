<br />
ok with all of that said here is my question: what is the hide skill for? i know you can use the &quot;hide trick&quot; to trade things in but i doubt that is why we have it. is it useful for fights or just something to use so i can go afk without worrying about invis dropping? any help would be welcome<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Works great especially when your rooted. Hell you could wait until the guy comes closer and his backs turned if hes melee then dark him and multi spear him. then if he gonna come back for you you can just ss hide again if you like. <br />
<br />
Ive been gone for a while so i dont know if pets still poof when you hide though. <br />
<br />
Another good hide tactic very basic is if you are soloing in a dungeon and a train passes by you can just FD a couple times Id say 3 or 4 then hide if you may not have time to zone or go invis. <br />
<br />
There are tons of uses for hide its very undervalued and i think its pretty fun too hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AislinSteele</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about the train issue. Thats pretty much the only time I use it since I'm not PvP. But in train situations, or times when you have a complete moron in the group, Pulling the FD/Hide/Sit to med trick can work wonders</div></div><hr />

If I am already at full mana/health I'll just fd.<br />
Make sure to target something with a con other than indifferent. When the mob goes indifferent you are sucessfully hidden.<br />
Yes, all forms of invisibility will kill your pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvak</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only use this anymore (now that I have a pre-nerf CoS) to meditate/regenerate when I don't have a pet and when in a dangerous area. Since I nearly always have my pet up anymore, I hardly ever use it anymore. It was a nice skill at one point for me, but for the most part it is now neglected, at least by me.<br />

Hide still kills your pet 100% of the time if you hide successfully.  The pet isn't dying (and the DE chanter's charm isnt' breaking) because their Hide skill is low, and it fails more often than it succeeds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Realistically, that will almost never be helpful, but in those rare cases where it is it can be nice to have.</div></div><hr />

I've never seen it fail... also, what's the point of having higher skill in Hide?  Are these old concepts that were never removed?</div></div><hr />

Your reading comprehension sucks.<br />
Hide used to kill pet always, even if the skill check actually failed.<br />
Nowadays pet only goes poof when the skill works.</div></div><hr />

Great site and I look forward to reading up as My Shadow Knight Grows. I'll get a sig and links (need to update) up for him for the time being I put my mains sig here (hope it works).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From a few things I did not see mentioned on Hide: <br />
<br />
Hide works on the living and un-dead (if they can not see inv) so in come cases its much safer to rest with hide then inv.<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are no mobs you can check to see if you are hidden by doing this:<br />
<br />
Make sure you can not see inv----&gt; hide----&gt; /target &quot;your name&quot;<br />
<br />
If you can not target yourself you are hidden. I actually have a hot key made up so this can be done quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeluuan</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok you never get a message if hide fails only rogues get this, so if you f9 around a bit you wont see yourself but that still doesnt mean it worked. to ensure hide worked type /target &lt;name&gt;. If succesful you cant target yourself if failed you will and dont have see invis up either btw. Also undead unless im sorely mistaken see through hide got jumped by skellies before but could have failed and not realized it. The best use i have ever had for hide is no fear of it fading making afk solo regen times bearable. Also when you are gonna die and fd you can hide then once it is a success you stand up and bandage up till you can run away with half a chance. Also whats with flaming someone for asking a question? I thought forums were meant for that. Did he do something or say something that didnt follow some code of forums? /shrug kids<br />
yeah i know grammer punctuation and all that crap sucks lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boodadar</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks alot guys i've played around with it a little and now have a hide/target myself hotkey. i've found that this is very helpful when going into a dungon with an overly anxious MT (if cleric says oom i just hide untill cleric is ok, that way if MT pulls he can deal with it on his own). <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks again,<br />
bood<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
the code for that hot key is:<br />
    /docommand 1 (this veries depending on hide button)<br />
    /target boodadar</div></div><hr />
