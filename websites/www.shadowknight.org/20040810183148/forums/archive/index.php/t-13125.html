<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xanon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I`ve done some serious searching but couldn`t find anything about the Nightmare Hoof that drops off of a gloom nightmare.  I`ve been told by some people that it`s for a quest-horse of some sorts.  I`d like a little light shed on this if anyone knows.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Go to PoN and kill a gloom nightmare and loot the hoof and be as baffled as I am :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iyaoyas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I Seem to recall reading on another board about a Questable horse, that horse is supposedly the fastest in the game, the bridle being no drop of course.  I will search alittle more, and post the results.<br />
<br />
<br />
I Just Did a quick look, and it seems I had confused the Ornate Chain Bridle with what you were asking, my appologies.</div></div><hr />
