<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klotar AngedeMorts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Admittedly, I must not have been paying super close attention to the fine differences between bash interrupts and stun proc interrupts.<br />
<br />
As most of us know, a year or two ago there was a change in in the game when  a spell or weapon proc had a dd component and a stun component.  If the spell/proc went off on an unstunnable mob, the dd portion used to automatically fail also.  Later, this was changed so that the dd had a separate and normal resist check on the unstunnable mobs, and we would get a text message telling us the mob is immune to the stun component of the spell/proc.<br />
<br />
So, naturally on these unstunnable mobs (e.g. most mobs in LDoN, giants in GD, etc.), a stun proc on a weapon wouldn't interrupt any casting or otherwise interrupt much of anything (mob running, swinging, casting).<br />
<br />
However, I've noticed lately (and perhaps here is where I've been unobservant), that unstunnable via spell/proc doesn't always mean unbashable for stun/interrupt.  For example, I might be chasing down a mob where my weapon proc shows the mob as immune to stuns, yet with a bash I can still stop it (this is where I go shooting past it and waste the stun time hehe).  And also sometimes, we are able to interrupt (or maybe it's luck or other party members) casting with a bash on the unstunnables.<br />
<br />
So, you say, this is Bash Basics 101.  TRUE.  But usually I don't always try to bash mobs where I know they are immune to stun.  In my defense, I haven't had a stun proc until somewhat recently (a couple months ago) so I always bashed regardless because I wasn't really aware what mobs were unstunnable or not, other than giants.<br />
<br />
Has it always been this way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, pretty sure its always been like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Awaon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
You really notice it when you're fighting the infinite number of healer mobs in LDoN dungeons.  Everyone in the group is complaining about how their stuns are of no use, so it's usually up to me to whip out my 1h+shield and start bashing to prevent the mob from casting.</div></div><hr />
