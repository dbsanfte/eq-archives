Wars got fixed in LDON with more dps from aug or agro from aug than knight.<br />
Then wars got fixed with agro discipline<br />
Then wars got fixed with dps disciplines<br />
Then wars got fixed with mitigation 5%<br />
<br />
If you look at the improvements since pre luclin war and sk are about equal so balance is about where it was pre luclin which sucks IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wars now have better or equal agro then me unless I use some low level spell for agro with little or no dps component to it.<br />
<br />
They mitigate 5% better, have higher AC and higher hp.  With LDON they average an extra 1 or 2 procs more than me from weapon.<br />
<br />
Their melee dps is higher than  mine and I need to expend mana to keep up.<br />
<br />
If you were a cleric which would you chose to tank?  War is 5+% mana preserve right off the bat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warrior aggro now is perfect in most cases (theres a bigger gap between a good Warrior and a bad one than any other class, and 99% of them are bad ones, so changes have to be geared for them), extremly high end sustained aggro is the only unbalanced part of Warrior aggro.  Instead of bitching about Incite being to much, bitch about those situations where it is to much needing limitations to limit its usefulness.  Every other class has their abilities limited to various extends on each mob (ae's, resists, spell shield, etc... only makes sense to limit this one in some cases).<br />
<br />
They have higher hp, higher unbuffed ac, guess what... buffed we have more ac.  The mitigation change for them was bullshit, no argument here.<br />
<br />
Their damage is SUPPOSED to be higher, we have low offensive melee because of our spells,  It's defensively where we shouldn't be punished for them but are.<br />
<br />
If I were a cleric I would choose myself to tank, I'm as far removed from the average sk as you are from your claims, I can't make any remarks for the non high end other than about Warrior aggro since it scales pretty linear until time</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see how it works out once the opening system goes live, but as it stands now, at least at my level of play, warrior aggro seems fine.  If you've got a non-time geared warrior out-aggroing you, you don't have a clue how to use your SK.</div></div><hr />

Do Warriors proc 195 lifetaps frequently? I bet a SK with SA3 will require less healing in a LDoN than a warrior will. Not like healing the tank is of ANY interest to the cleric when he invites a warrior or a knight. all 3 classes will require minimal healing anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have warriors out agro me all the time.  And I know how to play my character.  Being and sk is not only about casting low level spells to get agro.  Played correctly SK can also provide high dps with wizard like peak dps for crowd control (I play at lvl 55 and can solo undead blues in 20-30 sec in peak dps mode without HT), however to do so requires a nuke line up that requires removing the taunt spells.  <br />
<br />
Without taunt spells even with superior dps sks can be out taunted by war.  A properly geared War can have 4 eb procs for an ave of 8 procs a min (dex=305),  Put a decent DS on that and add instand agro off the pull and you will have problems getting agro even with the taunt spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you require minimum healing you should never group with a cleric.  Paladin will provide much more dps if healing not an issue.<br />
<br />
I often fight in situations where I really don't need a cleric because I have fungi and when fighting lower blues I can survive on the 300 pt heal.  In that case I don't pick a cleric because if you don't need healing clerics are a poor choice for a group.<br />
<br />
However in the typical group the cleric is healing, often the group is limited by the clerics ability to heal.  And with a war the cleirc now has 5% more mana.  That is a pretty major swing in war favor.  If this were offset by War never getting an ac bonus over sk I think it would be fair but I suspect they still gonna have higher ac than us :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a War and an SK in a group, one of them is going to be the MA. If it's the SK, then the War is NOT going to be using his agro discs, or taunting.  <br />
<br />
If he's the MA, and his EB is going off like gangbusters,and he is using his agro disc, WTF are you worried about out taunting him for???  You pull that and you won't need to be worried about whether you want a cleric in your group because they'll disband as soon as humanly possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When a warrior is using 2 EBs with hateaugments ( EB = 700 Augments = 600 Hate ) he will have normally 6 procs per minute.<br />
Mainhand 2 procs weapon and 2 procs augment and offhand 1 proc weapon and 1 proc augment.<br />
<br />
Except he is using the BF then he will have nearly 3 procs weapon in mainhand.<br />
<br />
But when he is using a BF he will normally not use another EB weapon cause the ratios of these are not so good.<br />
<br />
Btw. when I ( whats real rare ) fight with 1hers I am using the following combo.<br />
Mainhand = BBotE<br />
Offhand = Stone Etched Mallet<br />
<br />
And I can hold aggro very well with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's about the stupidest thing I've ever read on this forum.<br />
<br />
If you're an SK, and *ever* removing your taunt spells, you're a dumbass.  And then you come complain about not being able to out-aggro a warrior?  Are you saying you can't freaking chain cast if you lose a spell slot by not unmeming your single most important spell?<br />
<br />
So it takes you 25 seconds to burn down a mob instead of 20.  You keep aggro off the cleric on the rest the mobs, and you actually survive the fight.<br />
<br />
If you're losing aggro consistantly for this reason, your group should disband your ass and get a knight with a clue.  That has nothing to do with knight/warrior balance.<br />
<br />
Zevfeer's bite and lifetap procs make SK's quite a bit more mana efficient than a similar geared warrior in exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krazaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I tanked for a hard LDoN group last night, using either my Timeless Coral Greatsword (unaugmented) or my Cudgel of Venemous Hatred (Vampire Talon augment).  There was a warrior in group with a Vanazir (Anger III augment).  I kept Voice of Thule on myself and loaded no specialty aggro spells.  I led off each pull with a Festering Darkness, and sometimes another Festering mid fight.  Rest of spell lineup was Aura of Hate/Pain, ZB and ToI/ToV.<br />
<br />
Over 90% of the time, mob was on me, if the warrior got off a couple of procs, a taunt or Festering Darkness pulled the mob right back to me.<br />
<br />
Warrior had asked me to tank, since she didn't want to fight over aggro with me snaring.<br />
<br />
Had the warrior been fighting to take aggro, there's nothing that I or any other Shadow Knight could have done to stop her, nor would she have been able to hold aggro if I were trying to take it.<br />
<br />
Taunt, if successful, takes aggro no matter how much aggro is built up, then you fight for aggro again as if you'd just engaged.  No comparison of aggro generation/holding ability that includes using the taunt skill is valid.<br />
<br />
I fail to see the problem with SK aggro vs. WAR aggro if I can hold aggro reliably without using a single &lt;60 spell and without sacrificing DPS by casting pure aggro spells.  I could have easily loaded Blood of Hate as well, since I was never in danger of going OOM.</div></div><hr />

Warriors WERE the least efficient tanks.  Warriros ARE the most efficient tanks.  Wait a while you will understand.</div></div><hr />

When you group with a SK without taunt do you get agro with the eb procs on your main dps weapons or do you have two sets of weapons one for taunt and one for dps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Groff Gorespiller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why would you not inform that warrior that if you don't want aggro, he won't have to worry about fighting you over it?  I've never had a problem with picking up aggro when I didn't want it, or getting rid of it if I decided I'd rather let someone else have it.<br />
<br />
Snaring after 80% is plenty early enough to keep the mob from getting away and yet is late enough that I rarely pull any aggro.  Even if I do, FD was made for getting rid of aggro and dropping it back on the tank, and I never lose much DPS by doing so (quick feign and immediately back up puts aggro solidly back where it is supposed to be).<br />
<br />
I've grouped with a lot of warriors since the aggro disciplines went live and I have no real worries about it.  They generate enough for slow on incoming (usually), and can manage to typically stay ahead of the eager during the first few moments, after which they rarely have a problem.  And that's fine.<br />
<br />
People have just lost the habit of watching their aggro in favor of mindlessly going for that next big crit.  And in those situations, Knights will still shine just as bright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior didn't care who tanked and neither did I.  It's harder for a Warrior to hold aggro off an SK going for high DPS than it is for an SK to hold aggro off a Warrior.<br />
<br />
My point was that given the choice between a Time equiped SK and a Time equiped Warrior, it didn't make any real difference to the Cleric who tanked.  It was easier for everyone involved to go all out with me tanking than it was with the Warrior tanking and that's just how it was before the recent changes.<br />
<br />
Either makes a perfectly viable exp tank.  Frankly, the aggro seemed close enough that I think casting VoT on the Warrior instead of me, would have been enough to keep aggro on her almost exclusively.  Had I really needed to though, I'd have been able to lock aggro entirely upon myself (with the exception of a few swings immediately following a successful taunt by the Warrior), where the Warrior had no such ability.</div></div><hr />

If you are a one dimensional player and agro is all you do then you need your taunt spells up.  If you use your spell &quot;utilty&quot; to get agro 100% of the time then you should chain cast your fear on fear resistant mobs etc.  However if you have to do that to out agro a warrior who melees better than you and takes less damage then explain why a cleric would pick you?<br />
<br />
I on the other hand have my nukes up with no taunt spells and in a normal group I can pull and be the CC thereby allowing one more dps in the group.  This allows the group to kill about 25% faster for 25% more exp per hour (50% if pally healer).  The problem is that because I am a casual player I need to find 5 other people to group with because most of the people I group with level faster than me due to more play time and that I am on 90% AA.  Its not unusual for groupie to get half a level in single ldon so they not long in the level range I can group with.<br />
<br />
Most of those 5 will have never grouped with me before and will be as suspicious of my strategy as you are.  Since I am lvl 55 40AA and like to do ldon I need to find 5 people to group with who think sks are a good idea very often.   Thus I am hurt by the class being weakened more so than normal cause all the now 65 people I once grouped with can't group with me in ldon.<br />
<br />
At lvl 55 I can take a solid blue undead solo in about 20 sec if I am nuking (564+130+260+400+crits if any) and I still don't have the 360ish undead nuke cause it is in sro.  Once I get the 2nd undead nuke I will be able to take 2 undead solid blue in about a min if sufficient mana.  SKs can be much much more than just agro if played correctly.</div></div><hr />

I shudder to think that there are poor unsuspecting bastards down there in LDoN with you in their group, thinking you're a real SK, and you haven't got any taunt spells up.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hmm this is suspicious. And looks like a troll. But I'll bite the bait, let's discuss:<br />
<br />
Your spell setup isn't efficient.<br />
<br />
- Grim aura is 10 ATK. That's not worth a spell slot nor a buff slot.<br />
<br />
- 3 spears + a scythe? I'd like to see your magelo profile if at level 55 you can keep this up and cast everytime the spells refresh. You would go oom within half an hour, if not even earlier. I have a fair amount of FT and 20 percent mana conservation, and I couldn't chaincast it all the time.<br />
<br />
If however you aren't casting them every time they pop, you can as well unmem the lowest level ones (starting with spear 130, then spear 260). Cast higher level ones as soon as they pop, same dps (as casting all of them but not as soon as they pop) and 1-2 spell slots more.<br />
<br />
- DS doesn't add to agro. And in LDoN and PoP all mobs will be slowed (or the healer will go oom soon). Since the mobs will be slowed, DS isn't really important for DPS. 8th ring DS and banshee aura are a waste of buff slots, and banshee aura is a waste of a spell slot. Any normal level mob will go down in seconds anyway.<br />
<br />
And at 55, it is not very likely that your stats are maxed, so stat buffs are more important. Primal Essence would help a lot more than banshee aura or ring 8 DS or grim aura. Shaman stat buffs would help. <br />
<br />
FD is useful in any situation. Even if you are neither MT nor puller, if you get agro and healer lags or is afk, you get low on hp, you can FD, let others in group take the mob till the healer gets around to heal you. Beats dying, getting rez, and complete rebuff, and waiting for mana to regenerate.</div></div><hr />

Even if you are neither MT nor puller, if you get agro and healer lags or is afk, you get low on hp, you can FD, let others in group take the mob till the healer gets around to heal you. Beats dying, getting rez, and complete rebuff, and waiting for mana to regenerate.  <br />
<br />
Hmm wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong.<br />
<br />
1)  +10 atk has some small benifit.  Costs almost no mana per tick as it lasts a long time.  Damage per mana cost is probably worth it.  Although it could be disputed.  FD may provide insurance but I don't really need it.<br />
<br />
2)  I cannot keep it up.  I use it when I pull more than I can handle.  I can usually single pull using the lowest spear.  When I get three I have all of them up cause I can burn one of the mobs in 20 sec or so.  equip of note, fungi, SCHW,eyepatch, corpsefork, 8thring chardokring, 10% mana preserve torque thingie,FT1 earring, FTII from AA, regen 5 from AA(and item), CFII, SCFII,  CSI, CA1,DEX5,AGI2.  50 pts tap aug from ldon.<br />
<br />
3)  Memming all of the spears and sythe gives me PEAK dps, that is key.  My peak dps allows the removal of enchanter and thus more dps.  Dropping spells doesn't affect ave dps but kills peak dps.<br />
<br />
4) DS does add to agro look it up they changed it as part of helping warriors back before ldon.  I seldom go with a slower.  Using chardok ring and 8th ring my ds is 33.  I usually am lazy and go with banshee and 8th for 20 pts though as recharge is a pain.  That is a very large fraction of what the ave lvl 50 dungeon mobs hit a lvl 54/55 sk.<br />
<br />
<br />
5)  The KEY to ldon is turnaround.  Me and a healer with 300 pts heal and kei +4 more =adv.  I can make a group in 5 min with complete strangers because I do not rely on slower, CC etc.  I like to get HOS and KEI but I don't need these as long as the healer has kei.  BTW Primal essence not sk spell.<br />
<br />
6) in LDON you can almost always run.  With regen and run III this is even more possible.  Since I pull I usually only get 1 or 2.  When I get 3 or 4 I have HT for mistakes but I know the BBM dungeons pretty well so that not often a problem.  I like to have a 2nd tank in the group for adds so that we have a large hp reserve for situations where you may want to FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I agree with Aethor on the grim aura thingy. That spell is just a junk buff you use on dispelling mobs or to put your kei far down on the buff list when you get buffed the right way so ench mobs dont dispell your kei if you dont have an ench on the adv persay.<br />
<br />
I also agree with keeping FD up. There are times when I use it alot and times when I never use it in groups.<br />
<br />
But I definately agree with Newtank on the peak DPS and was waiting until after I read all the posts to remind everyone about what they were forgetting. Being able to do alot of damage makes the difference when you really need the mana. In groups I rarely get below 3 and a half bubs and mana and I usually stay in the first bubble. But if I want to give a burst of it when I realize that most of my group is lom then I just burst it all out so the group can be done medding at the same time.<br />
<br />
I personally do not use any damage shields because I never have before so I don't know where I stand on that. I just know that I don't like regeant spells other than my pet (and even that is iffy).<br />
<br />
*edit* o yea, and that atk group debuff thingy is called Torrent of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">All you have up is spears and you call ME the one dimensional SK?<br />
<br />
You can't tank properly due to unreliable aggro.  You can't pull, or survive a wipe due to not having FD.<br />
<br />
All you can do is crank out high dps once every 10 mobs... since running through that lineup once is gonna kill your mana.<br />
<br />
Get 65, then we'll talk balance.  There's life after 55, and I can't see any reason to sit there and just grind grind grind aa's.  At 62 you get Zev Bite, which makes you by far more mana efficient a tank than a warrior.  At 65, you get Aura of Hate.  Increased damage to every melee in the group.  At 63 you get aura of pain... increased AC, which increases your efficiency as a tank.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and you also won't have to have 10 spears memmed just to do damage.  10 second, relatively high damage lifetaps means you pretty much alternate back and forth as soon as they pop.  Not as efficient as spears for damage, but you're also not left in a completely one dimensional mode that leaves you fucked if things get out of hand (oh no, all spells down, and you need to get aggro fast... what then?  you're screwed if taunt fails).  Even replacing one of those spells with an aggro spell would decrease your sustained damge ZERO (since you're limited by mana regen), and decrease your burst damage by not a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Of course, youi'd rather waltz in here with the attitude that 'warrior/SK balance is fucked b/c at level 55 I can't taunt without having an aggro spell up'.  Also give SK's that have been playing much longer than you or I shit about not knowing what they're talking about.  I promise you, they do.  Cut the bullshit attitude, read a few things, shut the hell up, and you might make a decent SK one of these years.</div></div><hr />

You're a fekkin 55 SK coming here to tell us how to play this class.<br />
<br />
I've noticed your posts in the last couple weeks:<br />
<br />
1.  You got pissed because a 65 warrior was picked over you in a raid.  That's the right thing to do whether you believe it or not.<br />
<br />
2.  You think a TTBPF is bitchen.  Good.  Use it, but stop trying to convince the rest of us that know how shitty it is.<br />
<br />
3.  You want to solo your epic.  It's your $13 a month.  Do what you want.  If you really want to solo the epic, you don't have time to post here.<br />
<br />
4.  You think warriors are the shits now with the new upgrades, and we got fucked.  Sorry, but it's still about how you know and play your class.  Go be a warrior or wizard if you think we're so fucked, or you want to do real dps.  You can get to your level in about 5 days play time easy.<br />
<br />
5.  Your fighting mobs that might hit for 150-200 on LDoN Adv's, and then trying to tell those of us that are 65 how to play this class.   Trash mobs hit for 500+ for most of us now.  What's your point of reference?<br />
<br />
6.  Fact:  Brael killed the mobs you're fighting now 3 years ago (assuming your doing AoW, Statue, Vindi, Tormax).  But you continue to argue with him.  Why?  Are you Time geared?  Do you have god knows how many AA's?  Have you even been flagged for a tier 3 zone yet?  Probably not.  But you PERSIST to argue that you're right.  What a fekkin dweeb.<br />
<br />
When Brael tells me I'm wrong, I can usually rest assured I'm wrong.  When others here tell me I'm wrong and explain why (which Brael usually does as well) I'm also probably wrong.  The difference is....I ask a question, instead of coming here trying to tell others the way it is, like you do.<br />
<br />
Come here to learn.  Search the archives before you post.  Ask questions.  Stop ARGUING!  YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT THIS CLASS, YET.  That's why we come here... to learn how to do things better from those that know.  AND YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM!<br />

1) show me that quote...I may have said that if warriors get raid dominance then sk should get group dominance but I have no delusions about tanking any raid type mob....I am wearing a fungi for pete sake....lol<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  Do the math at lvl 54 it is the best droppable sk weapon in the game.  The steel warrior has the equations for dps if you don't have access to it.  It isn't the best weapon at lvl 65 btw but still not trash.<br />
<br />
3)  I am lvl 55, .  Due to AA and mudflation I am probably more powerful than any lvl 55 sk pre luclin.  In 2-3 years I will probably be able to be more powerful than Brael is today if expansions continue as they have.  Brael is currently trying to solo his epic.  I don't think it is an unreasonable goal.<br />
<br />
4) ya wars are overbalanced.  How you play your class arguement is like saying that old school necro wasn't overbalanced.  Sure some of them could manage to get themselves killed but a well played overbalanced toon beats a well played underbalanced toon.<br />
<br />
5)  I am not telling you how to play the game.  But when someone says their is 1 and only 1 way to play a sk I know that to be untrue for all the levels up to and including lvl 55.  If your spell line up and tactics and often equipment don't change when you face different mobs/zones then there is a very good chance you don't know how to play your sk.  <br />
<br />
6)  Go find me one post where I talk about strategy in a tier 3 plane.  I have never argued with brael about lvl 65 stuff.  In fact I don't think I remember arguing with Brael.  Except maybe about warriors stealing our mojo.</div></div><hr />

Go get a friggin shrunken goblin skull earring off of Grachnist and stop memming that useless spell.  If you don't want to mem FD, fine, it's your funeral, and honestly, there have been many times I've taken a death to give the rest of the group enough time to Evac or Feign or get the hell out or whatever.

:rolleyes: <br />
Well, I won't argue with you on that particular weapon's validity for a level 54.  However, in a very short time (for most, or at least those who aren't spending their time grinding AA instead of leveling) the TTCP will become less than ideal.  The price difference on my server between TTCP and WMBS (best parsable damage weapon after 60) is around 6k.  That's about as much plat as I pick up on splits in 25 adventures.  When you get around to hitting 60, it would behoove you to pick one up.  Of course, by then, there will probably be better out, as we'll have a new expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
6) in LDON you can almost always run. With regen and run III this is even more possible. Since I pull I usually only get 1 or 2.

<br />
I've adventured extensively in all of the themes except Rujark, and to my mind, Butcherblock theme is by far the easiest.  Mobs tend to be more widely spread, rooms are less crowded, resists seem to be less and on average, mobs seem not to hit as hard (although that last one might be my imagination).  When you move from that particular theme, you may find that your current preferred tactics do not work... which brings us to:<br />

While you may not be intending it, your posts many times sound like you yourself are doing this.  So you have your preferred method and it doesn't jive with conventional SK wisdom.  Fine.  I've done things my own way before, and things have turned out fine.  However, inevitably, I was looking at the situation from a very narrow point of view.  I was looking at the situation from the blind spot of inexperience and stubborness.  When you move on from where you are right now, you very well may find that your preference is no longer the most efficient and viable way to do things.  It's a part of growing, and we don't expect you to get it right now, as you're still waist deep in your own experiences.  Just don't expect any of us to stop trying to relate our own wisdom.</div></div><hr />

1)  If you at lvl 58 are stealing agro in POV on a regular basis from lvl 65 pally you may want to re-think the implications for your group.<br />
<br />
2)  Warriors new ability to hold agro from the very start of a fight to the very end is similiar to sk or pally.  <br />
<br />
3)  War ave HP and AC is greater than pally or sk<br />
<br />
4)  War mitigation is 5%&gt;SK/pally <br />
<br />
5)  War melee dps &gt;pally/SK<br />
<br />
6)  SK uses mana for agro, dps &amp; mitigation you can only use each mana point once.  Without mana you are at a very large disadvantage compared to war in mitigation, DPS AND agro.  IMO there isn't enough mana regen to overcome the warriors new abilities.  <br />
<br />
7) Pure melee got an effective upgrade of power.  Hybrid did not get half that power.  When pure casters got an upgrade hybrid got 25-50% of that upgrade.  Leaving casters and melee with 100% upgrade and hybrid with 50% ish upgrade 50% ish nerf.</div></div><hr />

That's the whole point.  Warriors are meant to be depicted as the ultimate masters of weaponry, and the best tanks available in the game - tanking is half agro-keeping and half ability to take hits.<br />
<br />
Having said that, knights can still easily out agro the average warrior other than the short time after a successful taunt (I'm repeating what others have already said but still...).  If you burn mana heavily on taunt spells no one will get agro for more than a few seconds from you.<br />
<br />
From a Time perspective, the only warriors that I have trouble keeping agro off (assuming they're not taunting) are ones using Darkblade / EoE setup (aug'd with anger) - a while ago I had one /tell me &quot;TAUNT!&quot; even though I was using Festering / Fear almost chain casting to get agro (this was during a PoTime Trial, Phase 1, when I was MA).  These warriors barely even need to taunt for agro, or use their new discs - the good thing is that I know I can burn mana into damage when they're tanking most boss mobs without fear of agro.<br />
<br />
Incase you didn't get the point here - SKs are good at being versatile, but we're not the master of anything.  If you want to tank, go play a warrior.  If you want to deal heavy damage, play a rogue, monk, wizard, etc.  If you want to do almost everything, but not be great at anything specific, keep playing your SK.<br />
<br />
<br />
6)  SK uses mana for agro, dps &amp; mitigation you can only use each mana point once.  Without mana you are at a very large disadvantage compared to war in mitigation, DPS AND agro.  IMO there isn't enough mana regen to overcome the warriors new abilities.<br />
<br />
First, bingo - SKs do use mana for agro, dps, and mitigation (to an extent although you aren't required to chain lifetap if you don't want to).  What do you mean by &quot;You can only use each mana point once&quot;?  Mana regenerates, and faster than hitpoints.  And on top of that we have Mental Corruption.  In groups, you can get chanter mana-regen buffs to increase that even more - with MC and KEI you shouldn't have much trouble keeping mana near full unless you're burning more than you need to.<br />
<br />
Yes, without mana you are at a disadvantage, but as a SK, once you have Mental Corruption at least, you should virtually never run out of mana unless you've just been rezzed, or taken some kind of manadrain AE or something.<br />
<br />
I would like to see some new SK abilities, but more as a &quot;fun&quot; element, since EQ is currently so dull I can't even bring myself to log on - not for balance purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  I reject your classification of war.  They should not be best dps, mitigation and agro of the tanks they need some area we better.  The fact that you have ever lost agro to a war when you were trying not to is like a monk being out DPS'ed by a war and then saying hey its no big deal we have FD.  Its just a matter of time till Wars are clerics favorite again as they were in Velious and SKs cannot go solo anymore since they nerfed soloing...<br />
<br />
2) Other than tanking why would a group pick you over a bard?  Beastlord?  Ranger?, Monk?  SKs groupability is based almost 100% on their tanking.  Unless we moved to a DPS class we need equal desirability with war for tanking, IE we need to be able to do some of the tanking aspects better than them both peak output and over time.<br />

1)  I reject your classification of war.  They should not be best dps, mitigation and agro of the tanks they need some area we better.  The fact that you have ever lost agro to a war when you were trying not to is like a monk being out DPS'ed by a war and then saying hey its no big deal we have FD.  Its just a matter of time till Wars are clerics favorite again as they were in Velious and SKs cannot go solo anymore since they nerfed soloing...<br />
<br />
So it's your decision what the classes were designed for?  No, it's up to the Devs - yes I know they don't give a crap for anything more than the money they get, but it's still their decision what the classes were designed for - if we beat warriors in a specific area of tanking, we'll become preferred as tanks over them, which isn't how they intended it to be... example:<br />
<br />
If we have higher agro skills, groups prefer us so their damage dealers can kill the mobs quicker without fear of taking agro.  In a round about way, that makes us take less damage (mob dies faster) which saves healers mana just as much as a warrior's extra mitigation.  <br />
<br />
If we tanked better, for one it would make no sense - a warrior is a pure tank class, Knights are not... but also, since our agro skills are good enough already we'd be taken over warriors since we could tank better and still keep easy agro.<br />
<br />
That said, I think warriors have hit a good balance position right now.  What we need next is some boosts for knights... I'm unsure about paladins, but for SKs we could use things like Flurry, Fury of Magic, etc, and a boost to our melee dps wouldn't go amiss - maybe an AA to knock our skillcaps up to 250 instead of 225.<br />
<br />
2) Other than tanking why would a group pick you over a bard?  Beastlord?  Ranger?, Monk?  SKs groupability is based almost 100% on their tanking.  Unless we moved to a DPS class we need equal desirability with war for tanking, IE we need to be able to do some of the tanking aspects better than them both peak output and over time.<br />
<br />
Why would a group take me?  I can pull, I can tank, I can deal decent DPS, I can buff the melee's atk ratings, heal the group in a minor way, give the casters extra mana, heal myself if I take damage by accident without needing a healer to use mana... I can snare, taunt, offtank, kite, etc etc, not many other classes can do as much as a SK can.<br />
<br />
3)  Or don't know how to play...Think about how stupid that would sound if you were a caster saying now that I have kei I will never be out of mana again.  Well guess what you are a caster, you cast spells, if you don't run out of mana from time to time you are missing a very important aspect of your play, kinda like dying with HT still up. <br />

That's to do with efficiency - memming 4 spears isn't efficient for most people.  With FT15 (and 10 before that), and without enc buffs, even without MC sometimes, I can go through a whole LDoN dungeon and come out with around 50% mana left if I was snaring every mob... if not I can come out around 90-100%.  Casters who know their class won't run their mana out either, only newbies will.  It's been estimated that MC gives more mana regen than VoQ over time.  If your mana's dropping too fast for your liking, switch your spell lineup around - use more efficient ones, or stop casting some all together until you find a good efficient balance... there's no need to be trying to do burst dps all the time unless you really want to run out.</div></div><hr />

1)  with full Dex (305)  MC procs 2 times a min.  That gives FT10 at lvl 55 but FT 20 at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
2)  In nuke mode a sk can burn through FT70 (63 with Mana conserve) using 4 spears.  This gives 30.8 (38.6 focus +AA)DPS while mana holds.  With FT 15+20 from MC@65 +KEI you can have about 19+ ave DPS from spells.  The ratio against undead is even better if you have ldon nukes (26).  If you get less than 19% of your dps from spells then you are slowing your group damage down and whatever else you are doing should have a better effect or else you are inefficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  Every snare you cast at 175 mana could be 455 (568)  or undead 637 (796) pts damage.  True their is a DOT component to your snare but it all depends how long the mob gonna be alive.  At lower level the DOT effect negligible relative to kill time of mob.  Personally I find that my 120 mana for the lower snare is better spent on nuking the mob if it runs than on snare.  This may or may not hold at lvl 65.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, it's easy enough to run through a dungeon with FT10 (I did it several times with just FT10 and without MC up).<br />

At your level, this may be better - it's been a long time since I was 55, and that was back in Velious so I wouldn't have had any Luclin+ spells.  Back then I have no idea what my spell DPS would have been.  These days I do mostly melee DPS - I use my spells to taunt if I'm the tank mostly... if there's a warrior in the group (who want's to tank, not all do) then I switch in 1 spear (which is normally 1 shot every 2-3 mobs depending on kill speed) and use Blood on bosses, with the occasional lifetap for extra damage... I've never parsed my full dps including spells, but in my case I deal enough melee dps not to worry about it - this may not apply to you, but the original thread topic was about balance between the classes, and since the &quot;final&quot; balance dosen't come into effect until 65, it's the endgame that sets the balance.  Balance between classes shifts at different levels - heck if I remember right, Mages can out nuke a wizard around level 34.<br />

I'm talking using snare to either stop mobs fleeing or to taunt.  If I'm in a dungeon full of non-fleeing mobs, I'll use Fear to taunt instead.  If your spear kills any given mob in any given situation when they start fleeing at that level, then fine, it's a good tactic.  At 65, a spear won't finish off a fleeing mob unless it dropped drastically low before fleeing - 2 or more spears isn't efficient for the task mostly because of the &quot;Recovery Time not yet met&quot; bug.<br />

Because most mobs at 65 will either resist them outright, or resist enough of them to make it worthless.  It's worth memming spear over a pure taunt spell if you aren't tanking, but not otherwise in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding is that even at lvl 65 SK don't get past 140 DPS and that many are below this number.  I am just pointing out that spell damage is about 10-20%.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks to be 65 though cause I calculate that with max AA,FT,focus,Kei etc.  I can do about 100 DPS sustained at lvl 55 agains my mobs (I am counting 33 pts DS and pet).  At 55 that is soloing dark blues in 20-25 sec sustained ave if I could withstand the damage which I can't but at lvl 55 my 22 pts regen means something.<br />
<br />
Is it really that bad at 65?  If so why level? =)<br />
It seems that you fight much much harder opponents with not much more dps maybe 2X total and things like DS and spears become trivial because they lose effectiveness. <br />

Don't get me wrong I know lvl 65 has more dps.  But it seems its only a factor of 2 while mob dps is maybe a factor of 4 and hp maybe a factor of 6 or 8.  The mobs I fight have 2-3k and hit for 20-120 on ave.  I have about 2.5k and hit for 40-220 with higher frequency (the 220 is crit though).   It seems to me that at lvl 55 with max AA you can probably get exp very fast because the ability to kill white mobs is a premium (I can't do this yet btw).<br />

Plus its more fun to be uber.  Even if its uber light.</div></div><hr />

6)  Go find me one post where I talk about strategy in a tier 3 plane.  I have never argued with brael about lvl 65 stuff.  In fact I don't think I remember arguing with Brael.  Except maybe about warriors stealing our mojo.  <br />
<br />
OK I argued with Brael today =)  But it was about lvl 55 DPS.  He doesn't seem to think a lvl 55 sk can do 100 dps....guess I have a goal now.<br />
<br />
I still think the warriors have stolen our mojo.</div></div><hr />

100DPS at level 55 can not be sustained.  You could do 100DPS in a fast fight if you unload mana and HT.  At the end of the day, my DPS could be 0 and if I can hold aggro the group will do fine thats why we have - Rogues, Rangers, Wizards, Necros, Mages, Beastlords, and Monks.<br />
<br />
However, I have also been in groups with Warriors since the change.  I often have the group ASK me to tank instead of the warrior.  Why?  As nice as the new taunting abilities they have are, CD and Fear hold aggro wonderfully and consistently.  If its a well equipped warrior, they can hold aggro very well.  If its a modestly equipped warrior, I can outaggro a copper hammer of striking and a sword of the bloodsworn any day.  Now give the guy a BoC and similar weapons, then I DPS and probably am pulling.  <br />
<br />
Your mana drain exists in 2 places:<br />
<br />
- How much healing occurs before the slow goes in<br />
- How many times people other than the MA have to be healed (which is the bigger problem anyway)<br />
<br />
If you are in groups not understanding who is MA and how to manage aggro, then your groups have issues.<br />
<br />
Spears are resisted almost 100% in places like BoT.  <br />

As for Grim Aura, hello Aura of Hate.<br />

I wonder if you play on my server.  I remember leveling this character (who started as an alt but is now my main) got invited into a pickup PON group.  I disbanded after he filed the 6th spot in the group and I asked &quot;What about a slower?&quot;  He asnwered, &quot;What classes can slow?&quot;  If you have gotten this far my advice is a 3 step program: 1 - Relax, 2 - Delete your SK, 3 - Make a halfling druid.  It fits you better.<br />

By the way, learn to aggro kite.  It replaces fear kiting.<br />

Warriors have not stolen our &quot;mojo.&quot;  There are some warriors with exceptional weapons (BoC, BoW) that the proc alone will sustain aggro.  However, it is unlikely you're grouping with any of these.<br />
<br />
You seem bent on playing an unorthodox style (your spell line-up), as well as the use of unorthodox equipment (pitchfork and fungi) for your level.  You also seem bent on obtaining an inordinate amount of aa's at your level, which goes beyond most of our comprehension, since you are taking MUCH longer to obtain those aa's than it will take you to get them @ 65.<br />
<br />
I've said this before...it's your $13 bucks.  However, most of your chant of &quot;stealing our mojo&quot; would be baseless, if you would heed the advice of those that have taken the time to reply to your posts, and begin playing your character a little more traditionally, as they suggest.<br />
<br />
You're very unlikely to change the way we play our characters, since most of us don't agree with the way you play yours.</div></div><hr />

2) Near as I can tell the 5% mitigation bonus is, well, crap. We haven't parsed it over at TSW yet (and I will run over there and post a query right after this) but considering that it is supposed to work like defensive, that is a 5% mitigation against DI only (and that is supported by the fact that I did not see a decrease in min damage in LDoN after the patch). Depending on the phase of the moon, reletive AC/ATK, alignment of the planets, and the mood of the cleric, our 5% probably gains less than a 2% damage differental.<br />

I can't find the patch message that changed agro but this one refers to damage shield agro<br />

Not they talk about the agro from DS being incorrectly assigned not that the agro existing in the first place was incorrect.<br />
<br />
DS didn't used to make agro but they changed it in a patch.<br />
I know its not conclusive but can't find the origional which worries me a little I could be wrong someone want to test? =)</div></div><hr />

What was happening was when people were PLing their alts by way of DSing/porcupining, it was not functioning as it should, and the agro was going to the person who cast it.<br />
<br />
It was fixed back to the way it always was: DS carries no agro itself. It was assigned incorrectly because it was actually carrying agro. <br />
<br />
At one time the Druid community was convinced they were getting agro from DS's due to their AA WoTW (Wrath of the Wild). It turned out that since in addition to the DS, it provided a rune type effect, that was what was gaining them agro.  <br />
