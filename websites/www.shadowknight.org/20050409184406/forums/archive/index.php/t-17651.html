<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahel Everhate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm starting up a second account to help two box with my 62 sk, I can easily pl a second charcter but i am wondering what would be best suitible to use with my sk. <br />
<br />
Right know i am considering 4 classes, Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter, or Beastlord.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of crowd control with the ability to haste myself while slowing the mobs. I am wondering how much of an issue heals will be for me. I have no guild so I am lookign to be as self sufficient as i can, i certainly don't plan on doing a 10th rign war by myself, but for farming seb, duoing Gorenaire, Sev, Tal, or Lodi, I would love the back up.<br />
<br />
I would love ideas on what has worked best for people  and what races you may feel would work best. <br />
<br />
At this point i am leaning to an Iksar shaman, easy to aquire and useful epic, higher ac, hp regen, helpful for those canni's and  no need to worry about the inability to wear plate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman, all the way. Boxing a shaman will allow you the highest degree of self sufficiency you can get. I certainly appreciate my shaman friend as a duo partner more than anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lilharm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Went with enchanter.  Both have pro's and con's, if you do enchanter you'll be donating or spamming for shammy buffs, if you do shaman you'll be looking for kei or better.<br />
<br />
With my enchanter I don't really worry to much about pulling singles which is nice, plus I have kei and best haste.  I find now that life is easier if i bring along a cleric friend of mine though, I do miss those heals ;) <br />
<br />
So basically I was no help at all, lol, but gave my story anyway thinking maybe it would steer you one way or the other, good luck and don't forget to have a bottle of advil near your systems, 2 box'n is hell on my back :eek: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dester</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im level 62 and 2 box a 57 cleric.  Most things are good but I do find myself needing Kei in some zones and not being able to do other things because of the lack of slow/ haste.  But Im pretty hard to kill w/ a cleric to constantly CH me, and if things do go wrong I can CR with the SK and rez with the cleric.<br />
<br />
One other thing is with a few hot keys the cleric is very easy to bot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a troll sk, my regen is really nice.  That's why I went with a chanter pet.<br />
<br />
With our ability to tap, proc, drain life, plus regen, I need little healing when I deal with old world mobs, especially once they are slowed.  I can even handle tier 1 mobs on a limited basis.<br />
<br />
Adds?  no problem.  Pacify for pulling, mez any that wander by or aggro on the pull.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Haste rules.<br />
<br />
Mind candy rules.  Yes, you can get kei for 2.5 - 4 hours, but with a chanter you can always have it.<br />
<br />
Shammies have their strengths, regen, haste, healing, and slow, but I find the enchanter lets me go more places more safely, and when the shit hits the fan, CC is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you want to do good at 62, cleric/chanter/shaman, take your pick.  All we be fine.<br />
<br />
If you want to do good when both are 65, then you narrow it down to another question.  Will you hunt in PoP duo?  If the answer is yes, then your only choice is Shaman.  The other two cant cut it, as far as efficiency goes.  Yes, they can get it done, but you can expect alot of downtime.</div></div><hr />

I am currently 2-boxing my SK with a 61 Shaman. Its almost disgusting what I can accomplish exp-wise in a few hours.</div></div><hr />

Den make da frends wid a gud chanter and go keels da mobs and gits da lewts.<br />
<br />
Uze think dat KEI iz gud.  Me iz addictd to da ferine abatar!  Me feelz like a wuzzy wen me in a group and me don hab be brudder fer da avatar.  Dat spel iz da best fer da melee.  Uze is a ebil buzsaw wid dat spel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use a 64 shaman-bot myself.  I love it.<br />
<br />
One comment made about no kei, with Pact of Hate and Canny5 i dont find myself with too much downtime.<br />
<br />
Any of the 3 can be good, a BST may be a bit awkward with 2 melee.<br />
<br />
Shaman have good combo of all the essentials.  Slow, haste, heal, and can have added dps with pet/dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cabot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Its between Shaman and Enchanter, after that its a style preference.<br />
<br />
I have a 57 cleric on 2nd PC and I think I've only gotten him killed once. Personally I'd go for the shaman, good buffs and you can single pull anyways. Trying to maintain mezzes while fighting can't be fun.<br />
<br />
Plus you could ghetto mez if needed in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Another benefit to the Shaman is they can self port to hometown after lvl 50 to sell and such, then gate back to your far away camp spot like The Grey.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you get your chanter to 60 you can KEI whore in PoK.<br />
<br />
While my cleric doesn't have slow or haste having the rezzes in any location has been nice. But if I did it over I'd make a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sir Veya Bigtail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I often duo with my shaman friend and 2 box him when he's not on.  Can take nearly anything from BoT mobs to VP mobs to a few of the smaller dragons.  Can farm practically any zone that you would ever xp in.  I haven't tried to 2 box or duo with him in HoHB yet, but I'm confident with him being a shaman we'll fare very well in any efforts there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Agarwaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Both have a lot of merit.  My current and former main are enc/sk, which I often two boxed, even as mt and puller for small raids, and I commonly 2 box a friends's 62 shaman with one or other of them.  <br />
<br />
Advantages of the enchanter: lulling, fast crowd control, clarity line, superior haste, ghetto heal rune line, tash, gmr, highly desirable in groups for most levels, gear is very cheap<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantages of the shaman: dots, regen, sow, canni, heal over time, heals, pet, ghetto cc, more durable than enchanter, highly desirable in most grp situations for all levels, easier to 'fire and forget' than the enc<br />
<br />
<br />
My view:  to two box, provided a single pull, the shaman is significantly better at all levels from 24 on.<br />
<br />
Best asset if you want to form larger groups: enchanter.  Once you are used to a enc/SK combination for pulling, tanking and cc, you pretty much just need to add a healer and any other 2 classes and you have a 6 person grp capable of anything xp wise in game.<br />
<br />
The power of the enchanter is well known and is highly scalable.  I find myself constantly astonished at how potent a shaman is in small groups though.  Provided there are no CC issues, the shaman sk combo is capable of far more potent kills than enc SK.  I suspect necro-shaman is lethal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>makaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its amazing what a SK/SHammy combo can do.<br />
<br />
When i get home from work and i cant find a decent group, i just duo SK/shammy in Sol ro.  Its amazing XP and i get some Ornates once in a while =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dhantes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i do 65 sk and 2box via eqw my gf's 59 cleric when im bored (she plays a 65 wiz) have a nice spot i duo in where i get about 2/3 the exp of a pov group but its very relaxing walking up to the mob snaring it and beating it to death and alt+tabbinb and casting cheal once a mob or so.<br />
<br />
Tried adding a friend 57 bl on a comp behind me but took the relaxing part of the exp out of it so i stopped doing that. Now if i had a chance to pick the best 2box setup i'd go shaman no question, have a 31 shaman atm who i was lvling just for this reason but i grew bored of him =\ now if for some reason i ever get him to 49 i'd probably move him to another account and use him for 2box...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Quorthon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Currently I am two-boxing a 55 SK with my previous main (65 cleric).  It works pretty well, and it has the security of heals, virtue and rez, but I find myself always needing a slower for the zones that I want to run around in.<br />
<br />
I have a friend on my server who has a 65 SK and a 65 Shaman and they have no problems two-boxing and holding the IC camp in PoV.  I'm thinking I need to make a 3rd character and possibly start three-boxing shammy/cleric/SK, or just retire my cleric all together.<br />
<br />
Seems that everyone else here is in agreement that shammy is about the best choice.  They have too many good buffs that SK's need, and have the best slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Originally posted by Kahel Everhate <br />
I like the idea of crowd control with the ability to haste myself while slowing the mobs. I am wondering how much of an issue heals will be for me. <br />
As long as you can slow the mobs, the shaman heals should be enough, especially once they get their mini-CH.  As an SK, you can control pulls with FD, that would be your crowd control.  It's a very flexible and fun combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Reflan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm enjoying my 65 shaman/SK combo.  They can indeed do the inner cave in POV easily, even though my SK has only a windblade/WMBS/BBS, nothing special as far as weapons go these days, and only 11 AA.  Two pets at once, both hasted 60% by the shaman, adds up over time, too.  As does the haste on the SK himself.  The SK only occasionally needs a real heal; usually quiessence, my heal-over-time, works fine.<br />
<br />
With pact of hate on my SK to regen mana, and mental corruption up, after kills he is usually full mana by the time the shaman stops doing any canni'ing and healing he has to do.  Pretty smooth and easy.  The only time I die is when I invite other people in to make a bigger group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I bot a 65 chanter. I think alot depends on what you like to do. If you plan on soloing a lot, then do the shaman. If you group with friends alot and one of the friends is a healer, do the Shammy.<br />
<br />
Once you get assist mezzing down. It's somewhat amazing how many mobs you can lock down quickly. Basically you just train everyone to give you 10seconds to get everything locked down by 1) Assist on chanter 2) Mezz on chanter 3) Esc on SK 4) Assist on chanter 5) mezz on chanter 6) Esc on chanter. It goes very fast and there is very little chance of things going to badly. Once you get it down, it works great... But you still need a healer.<br />
<br />
Either way it really depends on what you like to do. Don't want to group? Pick a Shammy or Cleric. Like to group? Pick a chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tantrissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When I play, I pretty much exclusively 2-box my 65 sk with my 65 cleric.  And it's great, but forever I've suffered from shaman envy.  Not having haste drives me crazy.  I ended up making a shaman on the same account as the cleric in the hopes that he would ultimately replace the cleric as my full-time 2-box partner.  However, lately I've seen some sk/shammy 2-boxers that couldn't handle certain things as well as my sk/cleric combo.  For example, I was in the habbit of farming howling stones for a while.  With my cleric, he could use his ITU and pacify to enable us to fly through the zone, single pulling only named or their PH, helping me to rake in some bazaar loot.  I saw a sk/shammy combo in there once or twice and they had to do quite a bit more trash clearing because of the high mob density.  So I contend that the shammy is the better partner, in general, but if you are concerned with fighting in a place with high mob density, esp. farming older dungeons for loot, then the cleric's pacify ability can certainly help you a ton.<br />
<br />
Oh.... and a new trick I've been doing.  When I 2-box w/ the cleric, I run the shaman to where we are exping, buff up the SK, then camp him and 2-box with the cleric.  (FYI my shammy is only 49, lol).  Just log him back in when buffs wear out.  It's not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have just been 2 boxing with a friends 65th Shm, and I have to agree they are amazing.<br />
<br />
Trouble is that they take a while to become powerful, so having a 56th Sk and 65th Shm is awesome, while having a 65th Sk and 56th Shm would not work very well, they just can't heal well enough till later levels for PoP.<br />
<br />
With just a few hotkeys, you are playing your Sk most of the time, just switching over on inc to slow, dot and send in puppy, then the odd Canni when needed, thats it. Perfect imo for 2 boxing.<br />
<br />
When all that a Enc brings to the table is a buff which lasts 4 hrs, and proper CC which you really shouldnt need as a Sk, plus the Shaman can root park or pet tank single adds why would you use one when 2 boxing?<br />
<br />
I agree if you want to use the combo as part of a group then a Enc is very very handy.<br />
<br />
I am nearly getting as much xp in PoD on flies as I was quadding them with my Wizard! So so easy with a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Rule Shamans! ;)<br />
<br />
I have a 46th Bst also and while they are probably the best solo class in the game now, they really aren't too good for 2 boxing. Having only a 100 pt heal to 57th (and then only 300) doesn't really cut it...</div></div><hr />
