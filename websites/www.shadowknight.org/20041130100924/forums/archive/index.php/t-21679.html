<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vedark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Frontal stuns have gotten more and more frequent as the expansions have come out and levels have passed.  Being a darkelf, when I was 50 it was not this way.  I'd like to think that is the stick by which to measure how much they intended us to be stunned. <br />
<br />
As it is now, the initial hit by any mob is usually a stun. During combat its not unusual to have between 3 - 4 more stuns over the course of a minute or so.  I think this is getting just plain out of hand.  With the hard hits and number of them in gates, interrupts are already quite numerous.  Being stunned constantly is just getting plain annoying.  I know I don't play a race that is supposed to have the benefit, but I don't believe the hindrince was intended to be this punishing.<br />
<br />
At anyrate, I'd like to compile some information on the topic that we could present to the class balance boards for the retuning that is coming later this decade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kinda hard to look 5 years into the future.  Nobody could have imagined how much we'd have rather been ogres back when I made my DE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kroolhand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree.  I have played a few other melee classes, including Ogres and had an idea of what to expect during melee combat.  No frontal stuns for Ogres versus a little extra regen for Trolls didn't seem like all that big a deal or that much difference between the two. Knowing now what I do 4 years after creating Krool, I would most certainly have rolled an Ogre. The irony of it all is that I pay a much larger price for lower intelligence and poorer innate combat stats than an Ogre all to have a skill that has no value after level 10. While an Ogre levels quicker (a fact that regains relevence as 5 more levels are added), has better stats initially, and is able to cast and melee more while tanking. <br />
<br />
   Just an observation though, as naturally I'd still prefer to be a Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What sucks is rerolling as an Ogre and finding out a lot of mobs just plain spell stun your ass anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trysbrina67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've noticed this too, perhaps they should make an AA that grants 15% stun resistance over 3 levels which all races can buy available only to tanks.  Or perhaps they could tone down on the rate which mobs are stunning in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>draknorx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't warriors get that for a AA ?? just a partial stun immunity from the front ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If they gave us that AA, I wouldn't buy it. I'd do what I always do. Yay for Illusion: Ogre potions in the bazaar. Damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ogre illusions don't give you the frontal stun immunity.  Would be worthwhile just for saving the buffslot/inconvenience anyway.  Not like we ever have enough buffslots as it is.</div></div><hr />
