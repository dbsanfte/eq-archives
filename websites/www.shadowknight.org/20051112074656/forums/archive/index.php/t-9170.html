Who is to say that a human and a dark elf couldnt spend a night in Neriak and a few months later out pop a little baby half elf? I have long wanted for half elves to be able to be evil; would be great for rping and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so that totally ruins your theory.<br />

Plus we Teir'Dal should never be so lonesome as to court with a lowly human.<br />

I vaguely remember talking to various half-elf NPCs who claim Barbarian and Dark elf parents in fact, and Half-Elves can in fact be Bards and Druids and Paladins, classes which are unique to one or the other, leading to me to believe either light elf race can be thier parent if nothin else. Most Half-Elf NPCs in game for some reason strike me as Half-Wood Elf anyway for some reason. My Bard personally was roleplayed as Woodelf-Barbarian for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
Also, Half-Elf Warriors and Rogues can worship Innoruuk or Bertox, so it is possible for there to be evil Half-Elves. They have some of the more screwed up factions in game tho, being KOS to BOTH Firiona Vie and Outpost :p<br />
<br />
As far as Shadowknights, I suppose it could happen, there have been other non-necro and/or non-warrior races that have SK as an option.<br />
<br />
Me, I'd like to see Barbarian as an SK race if they ever add a new SK Race ^_^</div></div><hr />

They can also worship Bertoxx. To be honest, though...the only thing halfbreeds would have going for them would be the females wearing thongs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xvek</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half elven paladins of Tunare start in Felwithe for what its worth.  As far as I know half elves can start in: Felwithe, Kelethin, Freeport, Surefall Glade, and Qeynos depending on class and diety.  The funny thing about half elven paladins is they are treated better in Kelethin than in Felwithe.<br />
<br />
Personally I think shadow knight would be a perfect class for them - not belonging anywhere, cast out, shunned for their mixed parentage, feeling alien to both...In various fantasy novels half-elves are portrayed as very conflicted beings and its easy to see them &quot;succumbing to the dark side.&quot;  They already can be rangers and paladins, so why not shadow knights then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradox</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not?  There's already seven races that can be a Shadow Knight now.  Adding another race is only going to make a basic duplicate of another race.  No more SK races, please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jobrill</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Half-elves are human/woodelf. That is why they start in the wood elf city and are rangers in Qeynos.&quot;<br />
<br />
But they can start in Felwithe as Tunare Paladins and be Karana or Rodcet Nife Paladins in Qeynos and Mith Marr or Erolissi Marr Paladins in Freeport.<br />
<br />
So that line of reasoning makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaoogaa Soulhunter</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure it does. Ya just have to see it from my point of view.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a half elf in Katta (Yalnin K'Vekn) who's the son of a dark elf (Dralin K'Vekn) and a Barbarian. (Aerin K'Vekn, they're all in the same room.)  Also, Half elves are the only race besides DE's who can wear DE cultural armor.  Half elves aren't from any particular elven race.  (In fact, I sometimes wonder just what the other half of a half elven ranger or Druid from Kelethin is... Gnome? Dwarf?  There certainly aren't enough Humans on Faydwer to produce all those kids...)</div></div><hr />
