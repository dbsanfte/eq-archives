<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Byttorr Ebonknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those wanting to know what the difference is between pre-nerf CoS and nerfed CoS, here is the information you seek. The name is subtly different, the cast time of the effect is the big difference. Both can be worn as a head item, or triggered from inventory.<br />
<br />
The pre-nerf version (Circlet of Shadow) no longer drops. The current version (Circlet of Shadows) drops from a Goblin Bodyguard in Temple of Droga.<br />
<br />
Stats are as follows.<br />
<br />
Circlet of Shadows (Current nerfed version)   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC:5 Poison Resist: +10 Disease Resist: +10 Mana: +10  <br />
Weight: 1.0 <br />
Classes: Necromancer Shadowknight  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Head<br />
Effect: Gather Shadows (triggered)<br />
Cast Time: 5.0 seconds<br />
 <br />

Circlet of Shadow (pre-nerf version)  <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC:5 Poison Resist: +10 Disease Resist: +10 Mana: +10  <br />
Weight: 1.0 <br />
Classes: Necromancer Shadowknight  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Head<br />
Effect: Gather Shadows (triggered)<br />
Cast Time: 0.1 seconds<br />
 <br />
Both versions are usable starting at level 20.<br />
<br />
As you can see, by examining them in trade window and carefully checking the name and the casting time you can be sure you're getting the proper item if buying from someone else. Currently on my server pre-nerf runs 8-15kpp, nerfed runs less than 500pp, so you can see the massive rip-off potential for unwary buyers. Know the difference and don't get scammed.</div></div><hr />
