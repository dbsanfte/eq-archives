<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are so many aa I just cant decide which way to go.  I got most of what I wanted...was actually considering getting all the pet aa's hoping that maybe OOW might give us a pet that makes it worth it.<br />
<br />
Would like suggestions.<br />
<br />
Ones I'm thinking about:<br />
<br />
Persistant Casting (though I have heard less then great things about this aa).<br />
Fearless<br />
Double Rip.<br />
Even considered getting those resists up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have 325aa and no pet discipline.  This should be punishable by death (or at least a month or two in the stocks).<br />
Pet affinity is very worthwhile too.  <br />
<br />
Those are the only two you're missing and really shouldn't be.  <br />
<br />
SCE1, Double Ripost 1, &amp; Intense Hatred 1 are all pretty good values.  Touch of the Wicked is worth having.  At this point though, it's kinda a matter of &quot;buy what you feel like&quot; - you've got everything important besides the above mentioned two.  What you tend to do will determine which AA's will be the least useless.  <br />
<br />
Persistent casting couldn't hurt - it's impact isn't particularly large, but when it comes to channeling, we can use all the help we can get.  <br />
<br />
If you use your dots regularly, crit affliction isn't a bad choice - 9% more dot dmg with no downside can't hurt, even if it's not huge.  <br />
<br />
There's a lot of minute increases to your DPS: death's fury (&lt;2DPS w/ pet), intense hatred, etc.  <br />
<br />
Leechtouch is situationally usefull, especially combined with TotW.  <br />
<br />
Feerless doesn't have many applications, but it gives you something your warriors don't have - not many abilitys can make that claim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">saving 20 for pet affinity so hard =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good suggestions...I thought a lot about getting the pet hold ability.  You put me over the edge.<br />
<br />
I got Pet Affinity tonight.  Also got vicious smash 1 and 2.  Going to get the rest of those done...then work on pet crits...should keep me busy for a while.</div></div><hr />
