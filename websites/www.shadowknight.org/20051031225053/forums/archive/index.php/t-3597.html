And your druid friend would have a really hard time doing much of anything against a mid 30s mob.  So unless you have more friends, I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but seriously.....  don't spend the time hunting these...enough people sell them for cheap that you can prolly buy the parts you need.   However if they give you EXP then it might be worth it since ur getting exp the entire time.<br />

At 30 you should be able to single pull there, and the Spiritualist drops decayed and pops 1/3 times in place of the Radiant/Observer.  Since Crusaders can also pop at the other spawns it's the most reliable place to get Decayed.<br />

(No Crusaders or the Radiant,  either.)  Whee...<br />

I camped the spot also for hours (and hours and hours) and I can tell, that the spiritualist spawned at least once per hour. I never got more than 5 placeholders in a row.<br />
<br />
Do not forget to kill that spawn on the other side of the pillar, there is a minor chance, that a crusader spawns there.<br />
<br />
And to the first post, no, a 22/27 team can not hunt crusaders/spiritualist effectively. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groff Gorespiller</div><div class="date">08-05-2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if the Crusaders/Spiritualists have a placeholder, or if they are simply random once you've broken the spawn?  A couple friends and I camped the northern tip of the island for about 3-4 hours this past weekend and only got one pop for the spiritualist.  The crusader didn't pop at all during that time (we were watching the whole island to make sure his geography wasn't different).  Now everything that I've read thus far about the quest suggests that the fanatics are the placeholders for the crusaders/spiritualist, and while wandering around the island looking for solo material (at lvl 29) I did see a lvl 52 SK camping the same portion of the island and killing fanatics with a couple spiritualist corpses laying around.  If there is a better (IE: quicker) method for getting these things to spawn, I'd greatly appreciate someone letting me know (either on this board, by email or PM or just a tell in game).  Thanks much for your help.<br />
