Also, most of us have no clue what pricing is like on your server so without a guide we cannot help you.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the prices have dropped since PoP, which means that most SKs on our servers no longer have to wield shitty weps like Wurmys and MoSS's till 50.<br />
<br />
Here are a few weps to check out.<br />
<br />
Tantor's Tusk: 50/60 50 hp 10 SV cold 2hp. A great jousting wep at 30, but pretty sorry until that level. They used to be about 24k, but now they are more like 8-10k.<br />
<br />
Argent Protector: 42/49 10 ac 10 int 10 wis 10 str 2hs. I currently wield this and I imagine I'll have it for a while longer. the prices vary greatly, but they are about 16-25k<br />
<br />
Black Acrylia Halbred: 40/48 4 magic dmg with an 85 lifetap proc 2hs. Don't bother with this wep till level 46, cause the proc won't work.<br />
<br />
Worn Sha'din naginata: 37/45 awesome graphic 2hs with nice stats. These used to be about 17k, but have amazingly dropped to about the price of the Tantor's. The polished Naggy's are more expensive, but have better stats than the worn.<br />

<br />
reason i like it so much is that saves are critical on a pvp server and with a 40/40 weapon, hard to find one with a  better ratio that is not lvl restriced/required on it..<br />
<br />
one drawback is that it weighs 25 so make sure you have decent stamina before ya wield this weapon<br />

I hit for about 110 at lvl 35 with this, but my skill was at 20 b4 i bought it....only like 140 now, so my ATT is far from maxxed, but still hits solid for me.  Plain graphic.<br />
One question though, could this have some HATE attached?  I was grouped with a warrior 4 lvls higher than me, without casting ANY spells, without a pet, and as soon as I turn on ATT, I pulled agro and tanked.  This went on for hours, I never hit taunt but the warrior was doing his best to get taunt back off me.  I wouldn't let him have it, funny to outdamage a warrior of higher lvls without even trying, but was just very odd that even when it was at 75%, and I hit ATT it would turn to me.  Enough rambling, just asking if HATE can be attached to this=))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Method</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in certain cases, npcs would attack you over that warrior for reasons other than damage, or your &quot;hidden hate&quot; theory.<br />
<br />
Having played a ranger for three years prior to my wizard (and now sk) I can testify that many mobs in kunark (kc and seb i noticed this the most) can inherently evaluate a pc's hp and ac and will autogenerate initial hate accordingly. This is was the main cause for the problems that rangers were experiencing during the kunark expansion.<br />
<br />
Warrior says &quot;Incoming 3&quot;<br />
Ranger hides behind enchanter<br />
Enchanter mezes one mob<br />
A ranger is auto targetted by mob_2 and mob_3 and commences mana sponging<br />
A warrior taunts mob_2 off ranger<br />
Enchanter mezzes mob 3<br />
Cleric says &quot;damnit ranger 50m&quot;<br />
Ranger presses his attack button and starts to generate aggro<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats how it went down for a couple months till jolt came around, and from velious on this innate hp/ac check seems to have been taken out.<br />
<br />
Since the warrior was higher than you I expect he would have more hp and ac, and he would also be having an easier time hitting the mob due to higher skill caps creating a higher hit ratio. <br />
<br />
Then again maybe you just did more damage ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzinator</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, not sure if it's ever been discussed, but a theory that seemed pretty popular when I was playing my 60 SK half a year ago was that the damage bonus on a 2handed weapon is added to the hate, regardless of hit or miss.  For some reason, I would be able to draw aggro off a warrior doing damage with 1handers with a double miss.  Full health, same con as warrior, no proc and no hate increasing spells.  Switched to 1hander to check it, no taunt.  Back to 2hander (Innoruuk's Curse) and miss again, aggro is mine.  Not sure if it's valid or just a fluke, but this happened many, many times.  I could reliably pull aggro whenever I had epic out, but switch to yel sword and even hitting 10x more often and doing 10-15% more dps, couldn't pull aggro.  And this is sans Epic procing.  /shrug<br />
<br />
edit: should mention, similar instance with primal claidhmore as well, even misses would garner me aggro.</div></div><hr />
