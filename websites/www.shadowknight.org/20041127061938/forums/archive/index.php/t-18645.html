<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kuvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hear some people call this zone &quot;Plane of Sky&quot; now, but originally it was called &quot;Plane of Air&quot; and when you do a /who query, it still shows &quot;airplane&quot;, so that's what I'll call it for this post.<br />
<br />
I haven't been up there for over a year now, but the last time I was up there, the keys all poofed as soon as you left the zone. The other day I was talking to a friend who said that the keys no longer poof when you zone out, meaning that once you got keys for all the islands you could just walk around up there and go right to where you want to be.<br />
<br />
My question is, is this true? I searched but couldn't find any posts about that, so either no one has said, or it is not true. I believe my friend, but I'd like to get confirmation too before trying to set up a keying raid. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thakalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't remember exactly when it changed, but wasn't terribly long ago.  Yes, it's true.  The only sad thing is thinking how many of those keys poofed before :p<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
About the name, yeah it says airplane on who all but when you enter it says Plane of Sky.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />
