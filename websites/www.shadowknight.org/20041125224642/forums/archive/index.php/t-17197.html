Maybe somebody should kick him in the fucking balls and the tell the moronic nerd he should try getting laid by some fat chick he probably has to pay to even enter his infested asshole filled room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well its starting to look like the nerf bat is probably going to swing our way.  I would think something along the lines of removing or reducing aggro generation on spells that are resisted like fear and maybe a reduction in our abilitiy to mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
At the same time look for warriors to have increases in gear and taunt.<br />
<br />
Time to start leveling my warrior alt maybe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm. they always seem to miss the fact that no matter who is tanking, if they die the warrior always has the advantage because he doesnt have to regain mana. No matter how they try to slice it, a warrior&gt;a knight with no mana by far. Furor is a moron if he thinks they will nerf knights, umm hello, they just balanced us dipshit. Personally I think he should worry about his own class and leave ours the fuck alone.<br />
<br />
Edited to add: Oh yeah, it's also a big fucking surprise that on one of the top guilds across the whole game that their knights can tank just about anything. I bet your fucking wizards can too, let's nerf them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Manslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If knights are supposed to be balanced against casters/priests now, guess they need nerfing too right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nocifer Deathblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We got really angry when our disease cloud as our main taunts spell that got nerfed cuz we lost our good taunt ability. We fought hard to gain our role as strong taunter and we achieved that. There were many tweaks to our aggro department to where SOE and our satisfaction. Terror and voice spells were very reason why they gave to us in response to disease cloud nerf so we retained our aggro power but in a better form as flexibility of controlling aggro (no dmg but cause aggro compared to disease) than we used to be in disease cloud era.<br />
<br />
Now, they are considering to nerf our aggro department. It will start our outcry all over again and they should know better than that. We finally gained our useful role thanks to tank mitigation increase and aggro management improvement. Most of our guild warriors never had any real problem in aggro department. They knew what to do and they all had aggro weapons which is their &quot;spell&quot; aggro method to control aggro. Best answer is to leave aggro power to knights and  give warriors easier access to aggro weapons and add some emergency aggro skills maybe.<br />
<br />
Heck, we see ALOT more warriors than knights in EQ that showed that warrior class is decent enough to play already.. Their role in raids are already monopoly.. That is good enough! And experienced warriors handle aggro pretty well. Yet, they asked for better aggro to trivialize the game and nerf knights in the progress so they can enjoy their monopoly grip in EQ. <br />
<br />
Same goes to knights. I grouped with inexperience and lousy knights before and, boy, they sure suck at aggroing. Same goes to inexperience warriors. The reason why we notice more inexperienced warriors? It's cuz there is larger % of warriors of total population compared to knights.<br />
<br />
My best advice to SOE is.. LEAVE US ALONE. We are pretty balanced at the moment (except few things like crap bp/leg effect and some crap lvl 65 spells) and we are quite happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>spacely</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">instead of looking to blame others, why don't warriors just ask for a new taunt skill .. maybe an improved taunt <br />
<br />
either something that puts them on top of the hate list right away .. or maybe a taunt over time .. over lets say 18 seconds .. that goes from 33% taunt to 100% chance to be #1 on the hate list over 18 seconds.<br />
<br />
that way they aren't too powerful at aggro keeping .. but once they have it .. they won't lose it.</div></div><hr />

Every time I make the mistake of visiting SW site I get sick to my stomach from the same line of rhetoric they use over and over again...&quot;nerf knights&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am so, so sick of this egomaniac's ranting I could vomit everytime I read his crap. His kind will NEVER be happy unless they are the BEST IN THE GAME and UNCHALLANGED! Give them more agro generation, better taunt, snap agro, and  nerf us and will it be enough? <br />
<br />
Doubtful.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time Furor may have been the wise voice of EQ to get a lot of shit changed, and even somewhat respected. This all changed when we knights FINALLY got the attention and fixes WE deserved. Hey, sorry SOE fixes to us hurt your class, but we didnt ask for that.<br />
<br />
Your bitch is with SOE - not us. <br />
<br />
And stating &quot;They'll just end up nerfing Knights&quot; is real nice way of twisting your words...<br />

&quot;Simplest nerf for hybrid classes:<br />
<br />
Totally remove their channeling ability; viola, no more being a tank AND a caster; pick one or the other during combat.<br />
<br />
Other possible, but more involved fixes:<br />
<br />
-Remove all Hp AND mana armor; one or the other; possibly make existing items select HP if pure melee class (or bard), OR mana if a hybrid class. No item, except perhaps pal/SK only ones, should have both.<br />
<br />
-Remove all aggro from totally resisted/immune spells.<br />
<br />
-Dramatically increase casting time on all aggro generating or heal/cure spells for hybrids only (kinda similar to lifetap procs for sk vs. necro, 25 vs. 75 iirc).<br />

Pretty big nerfs IMHO, but not totally unreasonable...<br />

A warrior should have no problem holding aggro if the guild and the warrior knows what there doing. now for the hp / ac issue i still think warriors got the big bonus there. there are warriors with 10k + hp unbuffed which is more then a knight. now if they do nerf knights, they will have to nerf everyother class in the damn game. next hes gona say lets nerf rangers they have to much dps with a bow, warriors should have equal that for pulling. idiot<br />
<br />
Edit: Next thing you know rangers are gona wana tank like knights and have more DPS with a bow.</div></div><hr />

Warriors does not need a boost. It's Knights that need to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
It is very obvious that whoever designed LDoN made sure mob would just bypass whatever aggro abilities a warrior have. You don't get stuff like that on accident. It's obviously designed from the get go to punish warriors.<br />
<br />
Totally remove their channeling ability; viola, no more being a tank AND a caster<br />

I hope the devs don't listen to these retards or we're in for a nerf !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Puurrdy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They won't change our aggro capabiltities.<br />
<br />
Don't get all excited.<br />
<br />
Warrior taunt just needs to be better but if you really want to look at the big picture, any class with spells and any melee with more DPS can out aggro a warrior if they really really want to, not just paladins and shadow knights.<br />
<br />
Chain a few dozen runes, or slow something about 15 times, or snare it over and over and over or load something up with about 10 different dots and see who it finally decides to go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ciypher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Regaurdless of wether your abilities are changed, if warriors are buffed up, we will be relativly nerfed.<br />
<br />
That being said, hopefuly they can find a way to make a melee worth playing again, hopefuly with out smacking Hybrids back into the Kunark Era. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest things is that most high end items have +HP/MANA. When a warrior or Rogue or monk claims that +100/100 item, that 100 mana goes to waste, it provides nothing to him. But whe other classes do it provides them with Both the HP a warrior gets, and the 100 mana that does nothing to him. It sounds like nothing,  until you get to the higher end of raiding, when you are decked out in 100+/100+ items, many with focus effects, which also do nothing for pure melee. <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly there isn't alot you can do to balance pure melee. There utility is generaly limited, monks now can barely pull, rogues are just needed for a few traps, and warriors have no utility. short of nerfing pacify, or placing traps/locked doors in every dungeon there isn't an effective way to increase the utility of melee. Therefore you are forced to balance them through either increasing thier Tanking Ability or thier DPS. That doesn't leave them a whole lot of options with what can be done. Sure, I don't think rogues/monks would mind a DPS buff,  but warriors would probably be rather disapointed. If you increased thier HP/AC they would simply cry out that the HP/AC doesn't address the issue of thier rather medicore taunting abilites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Remember, the majority of Warriors are button mashers.  They have almost no clue how taunt even works, so who are they to say how it should be improved?<br />
<br />
And Furor .... needs to get laid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Until the warriors explain what role a knight will have in a group after they get what they want I expect the developers will continue to do what they've done for warriors now - jack and shit.<br />
<br />
Knight aggro is no accident. It was deliberately re-introduced after the DC nerf just before PoP.<br />
<br />
Battleblade was actually saying something halfway intellegent - give knights the discs to do raid mobs, and warriors to aggro to tank easily - but the rest of them wave their hands and say defensive doesn't count and they need to do everything a knight does, better.<br />
<br />
The logic being that since a warrior can only tank, they should be the uncontested best tank.  Knights are welcome to take the utility slot in a group that's tank (warrior), healer (cleric), slower and 3 DPS classes.  You may notice there is no utility slot in that group set up.  You'd be right and it reflects warriors views of where knights belong in groups.  Nowhere.<br />
<br />
PS: when they say &quot;knight&quot;, they really mean &quot;paladin&quot;.  Check the examples they always give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lizarde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The sad thing is that nerfing knights will NOT fix the problem they are complaining about having.<br />
<br />
Furor is explaining that his 11k HP and 2300 AC aren't much use to his guild because he can't hold aggro well enough, so they use knights to tank instead.  Okay, I can understand the problem there, that seems like a pretty retarded situation to have to deal with.<br />
<br />
So let's nerf knight HP/AC/mitigation.  Well, now your warrior STILL cannot hold aggro, but your knights can't tank either, so your raid is screwed.<br />
<br />
No, let's nerf knight aggro abilities instead.  Well, now your warrior STILL cannot hold aggro, and neither can your knights, which means that none of your tanks can hold aggro.  So your raid is screwed.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that I'm well short of the end game, but the situation he described and the possible &quot;fixes&quot; via nerfs, don't make any sense to me at all.  Wouldn't improving warrior taunt be the best fix for this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nehvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wouldn't worry too much about Furor.  I'm sure by now the dev's realize he's full of it.  Most EQ players do.  <br />
<br />
The problem with LDoN agro is that the proximity factor is much more significant than in previous expansions.  As long as the rest of your group keeps a decent distance, you should be able to hold agro relatively well.  I know warriors are capable of holding agro in LDoN because I taunt like a warrior in adventure groups.  Melee, bash and taunt are my mainstay.  I only use agro spells...I only NEED to use agro spells...when someone decides to go nuke-happy.   Chain-SoS wizards...bastards.  <br />
<br />
On raids our warriors hold agro just fine.  In xp groups that happen to have me and a warrior, the warrior holds agro fine.  I hold agro like a warrior in LDoN so I know they can't be having any serious problems there either.  So in conclusion;  any warrior that can't hold agro...just plain sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Talura cwn`Zeylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm...nerf to pally agro = stuns have low agro? Woohoo, I'm dropping 3 of the heals on my cleric's spellbar and loadin stuns in place. :)<br />
<br />
The sad part is, even if they did make the changes to warrior agro I'd still choose a (hp/ac) ranger over a warrior to tank. MHO, pallies and sk's will find other ways to hold agro consistently, and in my experience many warriors are very poorly played (ie, button-mashing whatevers) so for the warriors there won't be much change in their status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Swone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Furor has been full of shit for a very long time.  He quits every other day just about.  He has been rambling bullshit out of his ass for years and years.<br />
<br />
My guild, which cleared POTime well before FoH, uses knights to tank ONE boss out of the entire zone.  We can clear potime in 1 day. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree however that warriors taunting ability is pretty weak.  It needs to be looked into.  Their tanking ability/hps/ac is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The whole nerf knight crusade is really a joke, i am sure some of its front liners who are by far not idiots do realize this, however it seems the only way to get SoE to listen to so exagurate the problem.  Warriors are defently not what they use to be, but then again they should NEVER again be what they use to be, IE over powered.<br />
<br />
The problem lies and will ALWAYS lie in /disc defencive, its such a core skill that it is basicly impossible to balance around it.  Untill this disc is no longer useble the scales will never be even, the problems is its very hard to rework the game so defensice is no longer needed.   <br />
<br />
As far as the out cry about itemization, that arguement is truely a joke.  Its true that puting vengece on time gear will help both knights and warrior classes BUT the amount of help it gives to each class is what matters,  increasing a warriors atk by 50 yeilds alot more dps than increasing a sk atk by 50 just because warriors do 99% of their damage via melee where an sk does about 60% of his damage through melee   Any moron knows and understands this, the same is true about mana hp and ac, the game is not balanced through gear but through the class, and how the class uses that gear.<br />
<br />
The thing that pisses me off the most is how sk get lumped into the knight category with the pallies, where i can see how a paly may be a bit too strong for their own good, i really fail to see the logic in nerfing sk, after all the only thing we have over a warrior is taunt, and since warrior taunt is getting boosted warriors should really have no other quarels with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kahntun Derstand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I hope that &quot;remove their channeling&quot; crack was a freaking joke.  That's like saying &quot;remove defensive&quot; or &quot;remove warrior innate HP bonuses&quot;.  Lol, all of these would screw their respective classes 6 ways from Sunday.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to realize that our snap agro is a tradeoff for inferior tanking abilities and lower hitpoint totals.  They take a bit longer to establish agro, but they're still tanking more efficiently... much more.<br />
<br />
Didn't LDoN introduce the opportunity to purchase hate proc augments?  I suggest they look in to them.  Oh, and don't give me the &quot;Warriors are too dependant on gear&quot; bullshit argument either.  We're all dependant on gear.  I'm not doing my job if I have 3250 hitpoints, 1000 ac, and 1000 mana buffed.<br />
<br />
I personally cannot wait until WoW comes out and Furor forever leaves this game.  (Yeah right.  What I'm really looking forward to is reading all of his bitching and whining about all of the flaws with WoW.)<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and quit for the last freaking time, Furor.  Save yourself the torture of class imbalance.  Better yet, roll a knight.  I'm sure you can pimp it out in 3-4 days.   Then you can see for yourself how truly &quot;overpowered&quot; we are.</div></div><hr />

What does Flowing Thought, Focus items, Int/Wis, Mana do for a warrior? A massive 0% damage increase, 0% downtime decrease, 0% taunt increase. Don't argue itemization, you will loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nehvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As it is however, anything a warrior can tank outside a 3-min discipline, a knight can probably tank too given comparable or slightly higher gear. 90% of bosses that require your higher eshelon of MTs, should be completely untankable by even your top knights in slightly superior gear. The gap is there, and reinforced by the /defensive crutch, but multiclass itemisation has reduced that difference exponentially. <br />
<br />
&quot;Comparable or slightly higher gear.&quot;  I guess the warrior class really is the 'the choice' for the 'special' kids.  In order for me to match an elemental warriors HP/AC I'd have to have a far superior level of gear.  I'd have to whore drops like there was no tomorrow.  I wont even go into what it would take to keep up with a warrior in PoTime gear.  Slighty higher gear my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blargon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I wonder if some people decide to play warriors because they don't want to work at this game and they want everything handed to them.

<br />
On the other hand, the disparity in terms of hp/ac between the highest end warriors and the highest end knights does seem small.    Just give em more hp/ac /shrug.  Or more dps.  But warriors aren't that far out of whack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a more serious note: <br />
<br />
I think we are way too unbalanced because of ranger/rogue dps and Pally mitigation and Warrior disc. We should get an AA ability that allows upgrading of our HT to DT (20k damage pre-SCF and focus). Also another AA that allows that damage to be converted to a heal AND a rune for the amount of damage done in excess of our HP.  :D <br />
<br />
Alternatively, they should nerf rangers and rogues so they do the same damage we do with bows. I mean it's just not right to be outdamaged by a ranger is it? Also double, nay, triple refresh on Warriors defensive disc and reduce its effectiveness by 50%.<br />
<br />
I just want all other classes to be inferior to mine!!! Groups should consist of SKs only!!! <br />

<br />
My initial remark was refering to Furor's comment about how adding atk to time items will screw warrios even more.<br />
<br />
And yes i agree that warriors do get shit from mana/ft/focus however these things need to be balanced through CLASS balance not loot.  What i mean by that is, remove the base hp bonus currenly given to warrior and replace it with a scaleble bonus in the form of 5%-10% more hps gained of gear, kinda like an extra lvl of Natural Durability that is innate and does not need to be trained (and obviosly stacks with the AA)<br />
<br />
The answer is NOT to nerf either caster or melee part of hybrids, because that would once again smash all the hybrids back into kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tomic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Itemization is totally funked up from a warriors view, but to change that would just piss off everone since many ofthe people who are complaining atm are mostly time oriented guilds who are already geared fully.  It's gonna take a long time to reitemize anything if they do and i think we will see more changes before that ever happens.  <br />
<br />
I'm not in a time guild but the reason that when raiding hybrids rock the socks of in tanking is because of wizards.  A warrior has no chance to hold of a wizard throwing 3k, 3k, 6k rounds which they usually space out quite a bit if a warrior is tanking. I box a wizard that is pretty decked out with crit aa's ext...  I probably double the wiz dmg when i'm tanking over any warrior.  Any warrior who can't hold off pure melee and any hybrid who pulls agro on accident sucks. <br />
<br />
IMO i think we will be seeing some new aa's pop up for the pure  melee and a review of discs for everyone.  <br />

Perhaps people or rather SOE need to fundamentally address the role of each class, especially in a group.  Then on that basis determine the class advantages and 'cross-over' abilities.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin, class players also need to comprehend their role in a group.<br />
<br />
I have no pride about MT status...who ever best fits the role for the group and the objective.  Am quite happy to SA or OT and save aggro for mezz breakers etc.  Just as long as the group gets the job done.<br />
<br />
On the note of pride...don't appreiciate hybrid advantages getting knocked.  I worked hard for my necro spells.<br />
<br />
If warriors should be the primary game MT, then give them a decent aggro ability..ie locked short/point-blank range.<br />
<br />
Jeez...I can't port like wizzies, should I petition for atleast a gate spell...nar think I will kick a fuss to have the wizzes nerfed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Niladen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">but that was quickly superceded by &quot;nerf knights! the game is too easy with knights!&quot; <br />
<br />
If I could tank as well our our MT right now, I would be hard pressed to find many an encouter where I could not easily replace him simply due to agro lock. Yes, we fought for our agro skills and as long as the same relative snap generation burst ability remains for my class then a nerf really means nothing. <br />
<br />
Of course nerfing our agro generated from necro spells will be a great boon to the necros, as they would benefit from the decreased risk. Nerfing our newer agro line would make them all but useless, with no real addressing of the issue. Warrior taunt boils down to proc rolls, which imho is crappy.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors knight level agro generation will only furtherly trivialize the game. Nerfing knights will allow clerics and necros to use shared spells a bit more liberally. Nerfing knights will hurt OTing, increaseing warriors will trivalize it. <br />
<br />
So basically it boils down to what should count as agro. Warriors have to rely on procs, which is a shot in the dark. If you count pure DPS for agro, casters are screwed. If you count total damage done thus far, casters get to warm the bench for 50% of the fight while the warrior solos.<br />
<br />
Agro is screwed, this is apparent. This is no easy fix for it. Either way you decrease or increase the amount of people required for raids depending on the fix you chose. Either way you change a classes role in groups and raids. <br />
<br />
I welcome the &quot;nerf&quot; to knights, or the &quot;boost&quot; to warriors. Either solution is crappy, and the same people bitching about agro now will be the same ones bitching about it later. EQ is screwed as far as agro is concerned and there will likely never be a fix for it. <br />
<br />
SOE gave us the power to lock agro, warriors never had it in the first place. The only reason they could keep it earlier in EQs life span is because knights had no way of genereating tons of agro in a short time period, and knights dps was poor. Now we can outdamage a warrior, out taunt a warrior, and because of that out tank a warrior. <br />
<br />
I have no fix to propose, because there is none. Whom ever you nerf or boost is going to effect the game negatively anyway. Either making it easier (see less people) or making it more difficult (see zerg raid). Easier means more uber gear everywhere, harder means less gear and probably less people because of it.<br />
<br />
Oh, for those screaming about itemization, its no surprise that itemization has been fooked from the getgo. Re-itemizing the game would take forever, and re-doing existing items will never happen. Items in eq are incredibly unbalancing, this is known, but what is to be done about it?</div></div><hr />

No, the only reason warriors kept aggro is because knights let them (assuming of course the knight got a group in the first place).  Why did knights let them? Because &quot;we need a warrior to tank that.&quot;  Aggro management is a skill.  With knights actually being 'good enough' to tank exp mobs, people don't bother with aggro management (and actually with slow on INC being necessary in PoP managing aggro is 'impossible') - advantage knight and the cause of this whole fracas.  Knight aggro is nothing new.</div></div><hr />

They don't seem to have any trouble holding agro on them.  <br />
<br />
:D roflmao<br />
<br />
I think the solution is quite simple if anything will be changed it should not nerf the SK but improve the warr somewhat.<br />
<br />
Let warriors get an AA 'enraged flamer' (or 'planar taunt') where the following happens if they have it, it's probably not even much more then 1 line of code in EQ's source.<br />
<br />
If (tauntbuttonpressed) {<br />
  If (aggro &lt;= 600) { aggro = 600; }<br />
  donormaltauntstuff(chance+increasedchance);<br />
}<br />
<br />
So taunt would do what it did as usual (a chance to get aggro + 1) but it helps on initial aggro too, and the chance is increased slightly.<br />
<br />
I'm glad no nerfs are considered to SK's, if anything our offensive skills are a bit lacking. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I thought we already came up with a viable solution on this about a month ago (in response to the last huge thread on SW)?<br />
<br />
Snap agro ability of X hate (500ish?) that is level capped to not work on raid encounter bosses.  Also would be good for this ability not not be able to generate anything over x hate on a given MOB; i.e. 1-time use per MOB.<br />
<br />
Hate-generating ability (100-200?) that works on anything, refreshes ala bash (or slower, whatever works out to be bananced).<br />
<br />
Gives warriors help in XP groups with ability 1 and gives poor/non-guild warriors with no taunt weapons a leg up with ability 2.  We had all agreed that no nerfs were needed and thought that something along these lines was a viable solution; plenty of warriors ranted on our thread, did none of them remember what we'd come up with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Rackasaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Man I hate the Steel Winers forum. And Furor for as much as he knows - needs to get his head out of his ass on the subject.<br />

Not to mention who is going to be willing to listen to a guy that fills his every post with insults towards you/your company?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Unsanka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I play a 52 warrior and a 50 sk and I can tell you a few things about aggro.<br />
<br />
First. Furor's problem is that he can't get aggro all the time. His solution? Nerf knight's.<br />
<br />
Now how would that help him gain aggro? It might help us die faster when we get aggro but it sure won't help him get any more aggro.<br />
<br />
If we steal aggro from the MT its because we did something stupid like cast a aggro spell or taunt.  If we mind our own business and let the MT taunt he should be fine.<br />
<br />
So fit hey were to nerf us they would nerf one of two things.<br />
<br />
1. Our aggro spells and taunt.<br />
Well in the event that the Warrior or anyone besides us is the MT why would we even be taunting or casting aggro spells unless we wanted to cause trouble.  Stupid, unless your trying to stir up trouble you would never even cast a aggro spell or taunt.<br />
<br />
2. Nerf our gear or damage migitation, ac/hp<br />
Well what problem would that solve? Probably just help us die faster and wouldnt do anything to help the warrior get aggro.<br />
<br />
Solution - Give the warriors a more effective taunt.<br />
<br />
If Furor is havign trouble keeping aggro then its someone's mstake. Either a wizard nukes too early or someone else is taunting or casting spells that generate excessive amounts of aggro.<br />
<br />
Playing a warrior and shadowknight I know how aggro works.<br />
<br />
Non-tank perstective - When I am playing in a group and I get aggro formt he warrior is beacuse A. The warrior is not taunting or has really sorry aggro weapons and dosent know how to heep aggro. B. I cast a aggro spell or taunt, then I get aggro. Same goes with all other classes. If a wizard nukes too much or too early he gets aggro, its his fault not the warriros.<br />
<br />
Tanking perspective - The only time I loose aggro is when A. I neglect to taunt or cast a taunt spell pending the class I am playing or B. Someone takes my aggro thru casting a spell to early or taunting/aggro spell whatever.<br />
<br />
I admit warriors should have a better taunt as they don't have as much aggro as they should.<br />
<br />
So I don't know where Furor got the idea to nerf knight's because they could only nerf our aggo spells which we shouldnt ever be using or nerf our armor, ac/hp damage migitation which has nothing to do with aggro at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Bunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Just a summary of what I saw as valid points made so far on this topic on several boards.<br />
<br />
1.  Nerfing knight agro won't help warriors.  If the warrior can't keep agro now,  how is making someone else worse gonna help?  This &quot;fix&quot;  would actually screw over guilds, not just knights.<br />
<br />
2.  Giving superior agro abilities to warriors will trivialize most content.  A warrior with the ability to generate fast and solid agro like a knight  and has /disc defensive would take all challenge out of most encounters.  Send in warrior  /disc defencive  /taunt  /taunt  /shout everyone engage.  This would actually make casters even better,  a warrior with defencive engaged and superior agro would allow casters to noticeably increase their damage without risk of getting smacked, clerics chain cast heals with out any regards of getting agro, meanwhile chanters can repeatedly mez/charm the adds knowing that when it breaks the warrior will handle it.<br />
<br />
3.  Finding a balance between improving warrior agro and decreasing spell agro of knights.  Knights should still be able to outagro warriors, as can any caster can already.  It is possible to lower agro from the spells we use to generate agro without gimping us, at the same time giving  warriors a better chance of successfully taunting without overpowering them.<br />
<br />
4.  Make the taunt button for warriors noticably more effective and lengthen its reuse timer.  This would actually really punish the button mashers.<br />
<br />
5.  Improve the voice line of spells so warriors will actually want a buff slot open for it.</div></div><hr />

But you CAN'T tank as well as a warrior. So what exactly do you plan on contributing to a group if warriors have the same aggro we do? <br />
<br />
The only reason I can not is due to a lack of gear and AA. Given that, I most certainly could and that is the issue. As for what I plan on contributing to the group? Without my &quot;agro&quot; I can still out do my warrior in DPS, more to the point I can now do it even better because I am not worried about agro AND I am not tanking. So my DPS is even higher now as a result, thus most encounters are now more trival.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Chania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The whole challenge in this game is that the class that can best take a beating, the warrior, is NOT the class that can best get aggro. When that becomes the case, when warriors can get guaranteed aggro lock, the game is over.<br />
<br />
<br />
What warriors need to understand is that there are 3 tanking classes in this game. My guild does Time, and warriors are the preferred tank in almost every encounter. When Furor says that he feels useless cause he can't tank, is that what he wants knights to feel?<br />
<br />
In any case, I don't envy SOE, its a tough fix. Give warriors better aggro and you ruin the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Manr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">What does Flowing Thought, Focus items, Int/Wis, Mana do for a warrior? A massive 0% damage increase, 0% downtime decrease, 0% taunt increase. Don't argue itemization, you will loose.<br />
<br />
What does existance of statistics have anything to do with Warriors (or other pure melee's) problems?<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
A knight or any hybrid, benefits from HP and MANA because their total comprises of both HP and MANA.  A knight, to be competitive, requires to have both HP and MANA on items, otherwise they will severely decline in one or the other aspects of what comprises a knight.<br />
<br />
Remember HP and MANA do not serve as bigger role on a knight as they do on a warrior or a pure caster.  Pure caster utilizes the extra mana far more efficiently just like a Warrior utilizes that extra HP far more efficiently.<br />
<br />
Once again a knight is part tank and part caster.  A knight is not 100% tank and another 100% caster.  The both parts comprise the total of 100%.  Meaning (some may argue exact percentages) a knight consists of 60% tank and 40% caster.<br />
<br />
If warriors want some extra candy on gear, they need to ask for extra mods on gear that benefit pure melee or specifically warriors only.  Personally I would be against that since warriors outtank knights as is.<br />
<br />
If warriors want extra candy on the items and to be able to taunt as well as knight, they need to lose their edge in tanking.  Because if warriors start taunting as well as knights, then they will once again be exclusive tanks for all encounters with knights stuck doing nothing.<br />
<br />
I sure hope SOE does not do something stupid and penalize hybrids once again.  Just look at the Kunark, Valious and Luclin hell for the knights.  There was very little reason to have a knight on a raid.  Knights were double and triple penalized on their mana usage.  This is exactly what warriors are asking for again and some of the SOE replies worry me especially when it comes to gear.<br />
<br />
Don't screw this one up SOE, after such a nice LDoN expansion.</div></div><hr />

Guys, we got the answer. No need to re-stir fire over and over again.  At least, I'm glad to see this thread started so we can let SOE know way in advance in case if they happened to consider doing this in the near future due to continued bashing from warriors.<br />
<br />
I read paladin site and it seems that majority of them are pretty well satisified with their paladin class balance so are we. It sure took few years to come to this and we thank SOE for their hard work trying to bring knights to the meaningful roles they deserved and actually made those classes decent enough to play to new and old subscribers (twinking or new mains). I do notice some increased numbers of knights (still less than warriors) than pre-POP. That showed that SOE did good job on the delicate balance of the knights and we appreciate that. :)</div></div><hr />

Give warriors better aggro and you ruin the game.  The game is already ruined tanking-wise with the current abilities in the game.  Like any change would make things worse.  Considering the attitudes here, I really wouldn't be sad if SKs did in fact get nerfed, really.  Neither would many others who read this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'm quite disappointed to see so many shadowknights only seemingly interested in insulting warriors.<br />
<br />
That being said. Most warriors don't want hybrids nerfed. However, SoE has let the tank classes get so far out of balance, that some feel nerfing hybrid aggro is the only way to get balance back, as the current lock is so very powerful, many say overpowering and game trivializing.<br />
<br />
What role do warriors want in experience groups? Simple. If you need a tank for your group, the first one of sk/pal/war that comes along, that's what the group goes with. No warrior preference, no hybrid preference. Everyone at equal desirability.<br />
<br />
Warriors also want a permanent aggro solution. As a dev has said, &quot;Enraging Blow was a temporary solution for a systems problem that has unfortunately stuck around too long.&quot; Yeah. Considering this &quot;temporary solution&quot; was implemented in Velious, I'll say it's been around for far too long. Warriors don't want to have to rely on finding a good aggro proc weapon to hold aggro, because without those weapons, they're useless... therefore the value is not in the warrior, it's in the weapons, and that's completely lame. Warriors want to be able to hold aggro like they were wielding good aggro weapons, but to be able to hold that level of aggro ON THIER OWN, without the utter reliance on the procs on the weapon, if they chose to.<br />
<br />
Itemization is another issue, with the current itemization benefitting hybrids more than the pure melee. AS that one's well known, I won't explain it any further, but suggestions have been made to turn the mana into hitpoints for warriors.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is the pure melee actually get something like the casters do each expansion... everyone gets new gear, and casters get new toys in the form of new spells. Yet melee don't get any new toys in the form of skills or disciplines. I don't think that's fair. If pure casters get 8 spells, and hybrids get 5, pure melee should get 3 new skills or disciplines.</div></div><hr />

If ye had half a clue you'd read more of the responses made; and even some of the responses here by the shadowknights make damn good sense. I'd save buff slots for SK spells that help aggro. Every single warrior in EQ has been second-fiddle in an experience group to a SK at some point because; well; we all want the damn experience bar to go up.<br />
<br />
Nerfing anything is wrong. near every class in EQ had been nerfed at some point in their careers. why not work as a team; combine the thoughts; and just make things nice and clear rather than just spewing off random h8 towards one jackass or another who happens to ruffle your feathers wrong and need to have a witch hunt.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't think this is the right solution.  I believe the preferred tank should be based on the make up of the group, and the make up of the encounter.  All things equal, sure, there should be no preference, but all things are never equal.  I group with warriors often as an sk.  Sometimes I'm the tank, other times the warrior is the tank.  It all depends on who else is in the group, and what we're fighting.  Sometimes it just doesn't matter, and then we go with whoever wants to tank at that point.<br />
<br />
Another point I would like to make is that in cooperation with sk's, warriors can attain very nice, quick aggro.  When an sk and a warrior cooperate, the sk builds up quick aggro, and the warrior taunts off of the sk...getting that aggro + 1.  The sk can then either dump aggro with fd, or stay close in aggro as the situation warrents.  This goes without mentioning our aggro buffs, which are another tool we can use to help warriors.  I use them regularly in raids, and sometimes in exp groups.<br />
<br />
I think the game is more interesting when players have to cooperate to achieve thier goals.  Cooperating with our MA to help set aggro is alot of fun, and it preserves a unique roll for both of us.<br />

<br />
A knight or any hybrid, benefits from HP and MANA because their total comprises of both HP and MANA. <br />
<br />
this statement clearly points out just how screwed itemization is at this point. This is perhaps the largest contributing factor to warriors complaining about knights taking over the &quot;tank&quot; position. Yes, our mitigation is not as good, yes we lack the avoidance and similar defensive AA, but in the end its a smaller margin of benefit. But that is years of drops contributing to this issue, something not likely to be fixed at least any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Thuggo: That's a commonly used statement by hybrids, that giving warriors snap aggro will trivialize content. How are hybrids so different that having snap aggro doesn't trivialize content for them, but it somehow does when warriors have the same ability? Or as warriors want it, a slightly lesser version of it?<br />
<br />
I see no difference. ANY tank having snap aggro is trivializing, it's not just limited to the warriors. But given a choice between all 3 having snap aggro, and no one having snap aggro, I'll take all 3 having snap aggro. It avoids the dreaded nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things as they are right now seem, to me, to be the definition of balance.<br />
<br />
Warriors are built to tank.  They top the scales of raid tanking, and with defensive, they always will.  There is only one way to balance the fact that they are decidedly the best tanks - control problems.  This is the exact same issue with wizards - they can unload more DPS than anyone, but there are some control problems.  To have it any other way would not be balanced.  Knights have more control/less tanking power.  I just don't get what the issue is here...<br />
<br />
The way people are playing the game proves there isn't a problem.  Guilds are beating this game, almost entirely, with warriors tanking.  This follows the design, and that's how it's being accomplished.  Knights have their place with offtanking and tanking a very small minority of target mobs.  If these numbers ever start to rise, with knights tanking 25 - 30% of the difficult mobs, then that will show there is a problem.  Right now, I just have nothing more to say than, well... it's all good.<br />
<br />
As far as xp/ldon groups, I enjoy having warriors in my group very much.  I group with some of the most poorly outfitted warriors in my guild and they still pull their weight.  I toss a Voice of Thule on them, and things are even better.  No, they don't tank 100% of the mobs 100% of the time, nor do I.  Nor does the druid or the wizard.  They mitigate better than I, I snap agro better than them.  When you put an intelligent knight and warrior together, neither will complain - they both see their place and, working in tandem, can do a much better job than either alone.</div></div><hr />

What role do warriors want in experience groups? Simple. If you need a tank for your group, the first one of sk/pal/war that comes along, that's what the group goes with. No warrior preference, no hybrid preference. Everyone at equal desirability. <br />
<br />
If that's what you want, great.  That's not what I see on the steel warrior board.  What I see is &quot;since warriors can only tank they should be best at it.&quot;  Over and over and over again.</div></div><hr />

Let's take LDoN for example:<br />

When was the last time a warrior had trouble holding agro?</div></div><hr />

Knights are hybrids- and that is typicly thought of jacks of all trades master of none- the SK fits this greatly-<br />
<br />
If we need to tank we /can/ tho warriors in &quot;TANKING&quot; are the best.<br />
<br />
Knights are usualy the first pick for off tankings- like in Emp and HP type situations.<br />
<br />
Also is a SK also can pull, tho there are better pullers a SK can pull well.<br />
<br />
SK's can also now cause decent dmg, this can be improved but I just like doing DMG ^_^<br />
<br />
The only thing we are the best at is /controlling/ agro- I think thats a great nitch and fits sk's well.<br />
<br />
Help wars get agro - good- nerf knights = not the answer IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats wrong with that? One dimensional classes SHOULD be the best at thier dimension, or they suck.  Lets say they made a 'Damage healing class', class 'A' the whole game they died the instant they took damage, no matter how little.  They used to do more damage then any other class, but now, for reason X, they are outdamage by classes y and z. Who would play class 'A', when they y/z do more damage, and don't insta die?<br />
<br />
No one. While the example is extreme, if a one dimensional class isn't the best at it's single dimension, the class is WORTHLESS. <br />
<br />
Another example: Shadowknights are the best taunters or damn near it. Lets say they gave all your agro spells to Palidans, how good would SKs be now that they have lost thier niche? Not very.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Thuggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Originally posted by Daemonwynd <br />
Yeah, that's a given, nazak.<br />
<br />
like with a shaman main healer, paladins make great MT's, they help very well with healing, all their buffs stack with the shaman's, and the like.<br />
<br />
Thuggo: That's a commonly used statement by hybrids, that giving warriors snap aggro will trivialize content. How are hybrids so different that having snap aggro doesn't trivialize content for them, but it somehow does when warriors have the same ability? Or as warriors want it, a slightly lesser version of it?<br />
<br />
I see no difference. ANY tank having snap aggro is trivializing, it's not just limited to the warriors. But given a choice between all 3 having snap aggro, and no one having snap aggro, I'll take all 3 having snap aggro. It avoids the dreaded nerf bat.  <br />
<br />
Because if as a warrior you can instantly have more hate than everyone else then you can immediately pop defensive.  No need to eat some damage off the bat to build aggro.  If warriors can snap aggro what will knights be doing then?  What is the point of having a knight tank mobs in phase 2 or 3 of time when a warrior can get snap aggro on these same mobs.  Why bother having a knight tank a rathe councilman, just have a warrior do it.  Why bother having a knight around to tank the adds that are so common in pop.  You might as well have 1 paladin along to do bss and have 1 sk along to pick up that sk only loot that drops.<br />
<br />
Just because a solution will make your life easier in exp groups doesn't mean it's a good solution for everything.  I group with warriors all the time, you aren't broken.  Lots of lazy warriors don't want to do what it takes to get the gear they need to do their job correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Vicaire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think a lot of the discussion from warriors right now stems from the frustration involved in not being good at anything and the warrior class just not being fun to play because of it.  Warriors have no utility at all and battle from thier standpoint comes down to hitting auto attack, hitting bash or kicks as it pops, and timing taunt usage. Occasionally during a normal group they get to hit /disc def or during a raid they get to be useful for the full three minutes def lasts.  Where is the fun in this?  <br />
<br />
All other classes have jobs to do other than hit auto attack and disc at the right time even including the tow other melee classes.  Any casting class of course has plenty to do to make thier class fun. Even clerics, long seen as a boring &quot;CH and sit&quot; class have been given fun utility spells and spells designed to give them things to do such as yaulp's mana regen allowing them to melee not to mention having downtime duties such as buffing.  Pure casters have many duties in and out of combat and those duties change constantly such as a wizard focusing on dps one battle and being on root/snare CC the next.  Warriors, in every single battle, hit auto attack and time taunt.  Warriors don't even get the fun of discipline usage since they generally have to save defensive.  During downtime, there is nothing at all for a warrior to do bar possibly clicking one of thier items.  <br />
<br />
This is all made worse now that warriors in a non-raid enviroment are generally useless.  Without aggro control, all the vaunted hp and ac of a warrior is useless.  In normal grouping, such as in LDoN, mobs come fast and die much too quickly to waste time gaining aggro.  Snap aggro is required and knights do this much better.  Except when a warrior is using a disc, knight and warriors also tank much the same with the knights having a noticeable advantage with thier self healing capabilty and powerful group buffing spells and abilities.  Why take a warrior anymore when knights tank the same and you get a rezzer/buffer/healer/situationally outstanding dps class or a strong dps class that can FD pull, give the group FT 10/regen 10/atk 100 and procs lifetaps so much on slowed mobs they don't even need healing a lot of the time. Warriors bring nothing at all to a group anymore.<br />
<br />
Here's a few of my ideas to make warriors more fun as a class to play and hopefully address thier uselessness in groups now.<br />
<br />
1)  Put all discs on separate timers.  This would give warriors something to do during battle and allow them to fully use some of the more fun abilities they already have.  With this, a warrior could take different roles during battle depending on what type of disc they currently have up. <br />
<br />
2) Get rid of defensive and give warriors inherently better mitigation abilities.  Wariors are the arms masters of EQ doing nothing all thier lives but focusing on thier ability with arms and armor.  Why shouldn't they be noticeably better at it than anyone else?  Asmuch as a 20% mitigation advantage over all other classes doesn't seems far out of line and would help minimize the retuning required after the loss of defensive.  This would give warriors a strong advantage in tanking over a knight.  This mitigation advantage could also be pared down depending on any snap taunt abilities given to a warrior. i.e. more aggro control = less inherent mitigation advantage and vice versa.<br />
<br />
3) Give warriors some fun discs that are valuable to a group all on seperate timers so warriors aren't stuck using one all the time.  An abilitie like group shielding where a warrior gives his entire group enhanced mitigation abilities for a limited time would make a warrior very desired in LDoN runs where adds come fast and furious and would balance them with the group abilites of SK and paladins. Another ability that would work well is a gorup atk bonus simulating the tactician role of a warrior directing his group in thier attacks. There are obviouly a lot of idea that could fit here and would make a warrior valuable in any group even when they are not tanking.<br />
<br />
4) Make warrior abilties scale throughout thier lifespan.  Right now, there are very large and obvious parts of a warriors's career where they gain nothing.  Levels 40-50 are just chaff for a warrior since they only gain level inherent bonuses while other classes get new spells etc..  Levels 61-65 are the same way.  Why not during these levels warriors gain some of the discipline abilities previously mentioned?  This doesn't mean that a warrior would get a new abilities every few levels since some of the discs could be simple upgrades of a previous one.  However, to make the class fun the more new and unique abilities added the better.<br />
<br />
5)  Warriors need some utility and fun to do abilities just to make the class more useful when a group isn't immediately available and just plain more fun for the player. Just giving clickies does not cover this area since why should a warrior have to do a long boring camp or pay an exhorbitant amount for an item that any caster could buy at a vendor?  How about enhancing warrior regen out of combat?  Say if a warrior has not engaged in combat for a set period of time, say a minute, they begin to regen very fast.  They could not use this ability if they have attacked or been attacked within the time mandated.  With this, warriors could solo for experiance or gear with some effectiveness.<br />
<br />
6) Along this same line warriors could be given the ability to root or snare on a limited basis.  Obviously these abilites could be overpowered in some ways in the end game if taken as they are now but the root and snare warriors get could be modified just for them.  These abilities could be discs and would follow the same outlines as the abilities previously mentioned.   An ability like AE grapple could represent the warriors tactical control of a combat area and would effectively AE root or snare (with no aggro component on the snare possibly).  These abilities could be balanced with reuse timers or damage components on them such as how shaman dots and pre-61 druid roots are balanced now.  <br />
<br />
Take for example the situation where a group suddenly gets a lot of adds, the warrior could AE root for a few seconds to give the group's CCers time to work.  However the root just damaged all the adds so a resist could very well kill any overeager CCer.  Care would have to be used to balance how fast true CC can be achieved with how much damage the warrior is taking.  The resist rare on  the root could be a further balancing tool of this ability.  AE or single target snare would follow the same lines though removing the aggro component of the snare would be suggested to limit its insane aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
7) Give warriors the real ability to rampage and flurry like warrior mobs do.  The PoP AAs warriors currently have are a waste of time and don't present any AA customization option for warriors.  Right now, warriors above all other classes have a set AA path with little to no deviation possible.  Warriors absolutely have to focus on defensive AAs to be useful  Nothing else mattters with the exception of AE taunt and that only because it is guaranteed taunt.  How about rampage as an active ability on a set timer or maybe just as an ability that could be switched off and on?  On adds this would give the warrior and his group the idea on whether to CC adds or just take them and possibly raise the group's DPS with the warriors possible ramp damage.  With this, warriors could gain some appreciable situational dps.  In particular, this ability would be of value during some LDoN runs and disatrous during others.  Warriors just gained some customization and required intellect to play.<br />
<br />
True flurry as an AA or given ability would not be hideously unbalancing for a warrior since it serves only to increase thier dps with aggro only affected by damage and possibly more swings per round. Having this ability on a timer seems silly since warrior mobs in game alway have it on naturally.  Why shouldn't warriors, being the truly ferocious combat masters they are, be able to flurry inherently or as a passive AA?  The check for rampage could be dex based the same as mobs and could be balance tuned by the proc rate.<br />
<br />
These are just a few ideas on how to make warriors more fun and less useless than they are now.  Just being good at raiding kills the class for all but raiding and doesn't let the general EQ population have much fun with it.  Keep in mind, this isn't an all of nothing list of abilities.  Some could be taken and others scrapped easily enough.</div></div><hr />

Have an SK standing next to him in the pull spot.  As the mob comes in the SK casts snare, then the warrior ae taunts before the sk dies.  Same with a pally, cast stun.<br />

<br />
Tada, instant aggro.<br />
<br />
Actually, you could do that with a ranger too.  Or a cleric.  Or a chanter.  Or a shammy.<br />

Everybody bitching and moaning about tanking this and tanking that... Like I even WANT to tank stuff.  I don't care.<br />
<br />
I always let somebody else in the group tank if they show themselves to be even halfway competent at it.  I'd rather watch for adds, concentrate on dmg, etc.<br />

If they did nerf us to the point that we couldn't get our snap agro like we do now...who would pull the derranged mobs that are quadding for 900+ off the clerics who are healing his gimp ass? Nerfing knights would not only be a dumb thing to do, but it would be detrimental to end game raiding. Unless they increased warriors to the point of being able to agro close to us then split tanking would be next to impossible. That is why we do it, because no other tanks can generate the needed amount of hate, that fast in order to keep the delicate casters alive. The only way around that problem would be going back to single pulling to ensure the survival of the raid. Who here would want to clear a zone like PoFire or PoEarth with nothing but single pulls all the way, or any raid zone for that matter? Imagine VT with all single/double pulls /shudder!<br />

Wrong statement.  We are not the best aggroers, the paladin is.  See, they already have superior spells, which cause huge aggro, and, when not resisted, also decreases the damage taken.  Add to that cures, heal-efficiency, and others, you have the reason why Paladins are preferred over SK tanking some boss mobs, unless pallies are not around.<br />

Exactly my thoughts.  Many posters on SW call for nerfs, decrease SK aggro, reduce their hp/ac, etc.  If that would happen, WELCOME SK to Kunark_02, and welcome warriors to being the Gods again.  There would be NO ROLE for knights in groups or raids, any other class would be preferred for their better utilities or higher dps.  You are effectively calling for the death of the SK class.  See now why we are a bit upset about the sheer audacity to suggest that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This ties directly into casters landing a spell for full effect being less aggro than the same spell getting resisted. <br />
<br />
Yes, and our terror spells do need work, they need to be better and eat up a spell slot for a fucking reason, instead of being complete shit, and we can then get rid of clinging exploit or fear as our &quot;i have to do nothing else to hold aggro&quot; spell. We just gotta do a little more work to draw aggro.<br />
<br />
This goes for paladins, too, obviously, with their stuns. <br />
<br />
If you don't see this coming, you're naive. It's happened to our other insta aggro spells, it'll happen again before we see them give warriors a new special ability that fixes their broken taunt.<br />
<br />
If you say &quot;stfu, don't waste time fixing our aggro spells!&quot; exhibit a: mental corruption. Went from being the shittiest piece of garbage to one of our cornerstone spells.<br />
<br />
Sure, they could be fixing things like ... uh... archery being fucked up &amp; big picture melee balance...<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Yeah, it sucks - we're riding high. Taunt is king in the LDoN world, that's the new high end content, warriors are nearly useless. It has nothing to do with a niche, unless by niche you mean &quot;useful to be in a group in the raid&quot;... pal vs. sknight utility is //situational//, depends on what exactly you need. Saying: they are better this for that reason is ridiculous unless you weigh all of the different situations possible. There are still plenty of reasons to choose sknight over paladin.<br />
<br />
When you bring this stuff up, be sure to mention the level you're speaking of. I'm talking 65 with 50-100 aas, pre or newly elemental with not too much vex thal.<br />
<br />
End game, pallies do get an advantage: the amount of damage mitigated/avoided due to their spells, etc. doesn't scale with the amount of HPs gained by gear: it's a massive savings. <br />
<br />
Further, I see nothing wrong about what Furor said, it's coming.</div></div><hr />

Just because a solution will make your life easier in exp groups doesn't mean it's a good solution for everything.  I group with warriors all the time, you aren't broken.  Lots of lazy warriors don't want to do what it takes to get the gear they need to do their job correctly.  <br />
<br />
None of this addresses the standpoint that I've asked you to respond to, defending the point that hybrids having snap aggro isn't overpowering when it is for warriors. You've stated how warriors shouldn't have it, aye. But you haven't said why hybrids SHOULD. Warriors CAN instantly have more hate than everyone else, it's called AETaunt, with its attendant limitations. Warriors who are building aggro aren't relying on the DPS to build aggro, they're relying on the procs. More likely, they're focused on staying alive for the raid, while the raid allows them several seconds to build that aggro.<br />
<br />
Secondly, tanking isn't the only thing hybrids can do, you know it and I know it. shadowknights can do such useful things as return mana to their group, vastly increase the atk rating of their group, and other useful things that allow the group as a whole to perform better including increasing aggro for themselve as well as other tanks, as well as help pull with FD if they need to. Paladins have the ability to heal PC's that are going to die, and RIGHT FRIGGIN NOW, complement the cleric's divine arbitration with a group heal, reduce damage done by mobs with their stuns, etc etc. They have the ability to get aggro at range while warriors do not, EVEN IF warriors get snap aggro. Hybris can peel off their CC mobs at range with a high aggro spell, making multipulls easier. ON top of which, they can tank any non defensive mob very nearly as well as a warrior. So don't be sittin there with the doom and gloom about hybrids being replaced by warriors with the simple addition of snap aggro, please, you know and I know that's a very extreme picture you've painted which doesn't reflect reality. The fact is hybrids are extremely good CC tanks, as well as MT's on trash mobs. The addition of snap aggro to warriors is not going to suddenly replace hybrids in that role. Hybrids can do all these things and more, and yet what does a warrior do? Tank. What else can he do when he's not tanking? He's certainly not a DPS class, the only class worse than warriors for DPS is a paladin... so what's left? Nothing. WHat does a hybrid do when he's not tanking a mob? See above for the several examples that I've given.<br />
<br />
I really don't see why it's such a big deal. ALL warriors can do is tank. They don't even have the choice to go DPS when not tanking. A warrior who isn't tanking a mob can have his spot taken by at least half of the classes in the game, and the group and/or raid would be better for it. Hybrids can tank, and more. When they're not tanking, they still earn their keep via ability to add to the group and/or the raid with the myriad of other spells and abilities they possess.<br />
<br />
No, all snap aggro is going to do is bring parity to the plate classes, and that's about it. If everyone's got snap aggro, the choice boils down entirely to the slightly better mitigation of a warrior, or the slightly worse mitigation but atk buffing/mana returning/higher DPS of the SK, or the slightly less mitigation, but buffing/healing/rezzing/root CC'ing/reducing mob DPS via stuns and slightly lower DPS of the pally. It really WOULD be a pick the tank class that complements the group the most.<br />
<br />
Chrissy: Sure, that sounds like a good trade. As long as you throw in the spellbook and mana and all your nice spell toys.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts on Fixing Warriors<br />
<br />
1 - Give them a individually timed fast recycle  Disc &quot;Twist the blade&quot; that gives a fixed amount of hate per hit (i.e 200) and reduces damage from hits by %20.<br />
<br />
2 - Give them an new AA - Steel Fortress. This converts any mana on armour/ weapons to HP's at a %50 ratio.<br />

i could come close and even pass 250 dps useing my Greatblade of Chaos. Now im not saying thats &quot;just&quot; my greatblade even though it churns out around 210+ ( i have full 2 hander AA's, but still missing a couple Critical dam ones. ) <br />
<br />
My range slot is a 30% Dot focus item.<br />
1. Blood of hate - Around 200 per tick. ( I cast for dps )<br />
2. Festering Darkness - Around 65 per tick. ( I cast on inc for aggro )<br />
3. Shroud of Choas - 195 per proc DD/lifetap ( Procs more often then any weapon i have used besides GEA )<br />
4. Greatblade of Chaos DD proc - 250 ( procs often )<br />
5. Self DS'd ( this i could buff up very high with a bard like you were useing, and my self buffs and right clickers, but i really dont do this much.So im not going to include it.Also i dont feel that DS really counts as my actual DPS.<br />
<br />
Ok so now:<br />
Casting Blood of hate once, Feastering darkness once, and hitting attack ( includes both procs going off ) my DPS is over 250. Mind you this is without a DS on which i could buff up very high, which is a noticable portion of your dps probably atleast 20%? This is also without 0.5 spears or 1.5 casting lifetaps which i could throw in at any time.Now if you want to really get tricky i can add in my pet hasted by Augmentation of death 65% haste.( Which is around 34 DPS on level 68 mobs in powater, to give you a reference on which mobs i tested it on ) So if i wanted to add all of that in, my DPS would be much higher then the 250+.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the warriors calling for nerfs are the ones that get the most attention.  Not all warriors want nerfs.  I think upgrading taunt vs xp mobs would be satisfactory.  The implication I was responding too was the blanket statement that warriors are a bunch of whiney morons.  I played an SK during Kunark &amp; pre-Kunark.  I leveled an SK to 45 back during the class xp penalty.  A lot of people were making those same kind of statements about SKs during those days, so let's not pretend that warriors corner the market on complaining about their class problems when they exist.  Yes, there were even SKs calling for warrior nerfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Evilangel: Yeah, I could agree with that, as long as you understand that warriors tanking &quot;way better&quot; on non defensive mobs, is a difference of about 10-20%, and no more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who ever said you would be?  By the way, aren't you the best pure melee DPS tanks?  Considering all you have is pure melee, I fail to see where this part of your argument is leading.<br />
<br />
What, did a bunch of people just wake up and forget how this game is balanced?<br />
<br />
You're the best tanks.  When you take everything else away, and it's just the mob hitting you, you are the best tanks.. period.  You are the most efficient choice when someone needs to absorb damage.  I seriously doubt they are going to make you &quot;the best&quot; at a particular thing in every imaginable scenario.  Ask any SK how he likes xp'ing in CoD sometime.<br />
<br />
Warriors getting at will snap agro would imbalance the game.  Knights getting nerfed would imbalance the game.  As it stands right now, &quot;the game&quot; seems to be working pretty good.  Time is beaten regularly, and people are mowing through LDoN quickly.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think upgrading taunt vs xp mobs would be satisfactory.<br />

Would anyone really have a problem with this idea?  I know I certainly wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

Stuf it.<br />
<br />
Nothing in any Ldon dungeon I've done yet has lived long enough for one blood of hate to last its full duration... forget festering darkness.  What are you both smoking.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure the best dps tank for LDON is a wizard then.  They can chain cast draughts and still be easily kept alive on a slowed mob.  All they have to do is snare on inc.<br />
<br />
Nice job comparing a sk with the best weapon he can have, plus using some of the dumbest math I've ever seen, to joe average warrior and saying &quot;Lookie Lookie, they do more dps!! OH NOZ!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm gonna get this whole thread moved to the flames forum if people don't just be quiet and stuf it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Peasley Grunglefunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">dantraeg - sustaining that kind DPS for any amount of time is highly situational and pretty rarely does a SK have all that equipment and focus.  that's far far far from the average SK's DPS potential.<br />
<br />
yes warriors need fixing, but screaming for nerfs is never the answer (not saying all the warriors are)  It's hard to come up with a fix that can make everyone happy... SOE are the ones who have to come up with the fix, not us =P (although i'm sure player opinions are a factor, they're not THE factor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Ghune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">I really liked some of Vicaire's ideas.  I also liked the general theme of that post which was, give warriors something to make them interesting and fun.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those warriors who is not calling for a knight nerf.  I would like to see some kind of upgrades for my class though.  Seriously, we have given up spells and any kind of utility for the ability to be MT at a raid, which I'd like to add, only one of us can do at any given time.  If I'm not MT on a raid, I'm a crappy rogue who can't use his discs because I need to have defensive up, just in case.<br />
<br />
As for xp groups, which is the major complaint of warriors, I am hideously inferior to even lesser geared knights.  Sure I an (and have) worked with a knight to gain better aggro, but what is the point?  Unless the mob needs a warrior disc (and 99.99% of xp mobs do not) it is easier for everyone in the group if I let the knight tank and go around back and act (/gasp) like a crappy rogue.  Why?  Because if the player behind that knight has a clue, they can get total aggro lock, mitigate damage almost as well, plus lifetap or stun/heal to essentially wipe out whatever mitigation bonus I had, and no one else gets hit.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, all 3 pure melee classes need some help, warriors probably more than anyone.  We need fixes with some substance, but Vicaire made some good points, we need some things that make the class fun, give us some options and some utility.</div></div><hr />

How many top end warriors do you know that can break 250 DPS?  The SK DPS advantage scales all the way down to joe lvl50 SK xping in PoN.  Any SK will out DPS any similarly geared warrior using the same spell lines I quoted.  You don't even need the foci &amp; FT, how hard is it to pop into PoK for a KEI?<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how you get your DPS, the mob dies faster whether that DPS comes from melee or spells.  The people picking tanks for their groups know this, too.<br />
You're the best tanks.<br />
I'll ask these questions again.  Since when does a group even notice the tanking difference between a warrior &amp; a knight vs xp mobs?  How often do you think they are noticing the agro differences?<br />
<br />
The answers to those questions will be completely opposite.  That's why warriors get pissed &amp; call for nerfs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Ronak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">&quot; that some feel nerfing hybrid aggro is the only way to get balance back, as the current lock is so very powerful, many say overpowering and game trivializing&quot;<br />
<br />
How is this even remotely accurate? Our aggro spells were NERFED<br />
twice since Kunark. Our best aggro spells are long gone. Yeah,<br />
we have found ways to still get aggro, but it is nowhere near the<br />
aggro it was before the nerfs. Since uh...Beta? Knights with a<br />
brain have been far superior to warriors in aggro control, there is<br />
nothing new here. What the hell do you expect with a casting class?<br />
Name a casting class that CANNOT outaggro a warrior if they want<br />
to. Waiting? I'll save you some time, there isn't one. This is the way<br />
it has always been. Welcome to EQ. <br />
<br />
I've been tanking for exp groups, and totally controlling aggro since<br />
pre-kunark. What's different since PoP? It's quite simple, mobs<br />
DPS has been raised to such stupid levels that aggro control is<br />
no longer an option, but a requirement. Good warriors are still<br />
quite viable tanks in EXP groups, as I see my guilds warriors do<br />
it nightly, without complaints from their groupmates. Bad, or average<br />
warriors aren't nearly as viable, unless their groupmates have<br />
LOTS of AA. I won't be tanking a god damn thing anytime soon<br />
that quads for 130%+ of my HP in a single round, this much is<br />
certain. <br />
<br />
So, the only thing that has changed with PoP? Knights are less <br />
viable as tanks on highend mobs than ever before, and shine in<br />
groups facing overpowered EXP mobs in PoP, where aggrolock<br />
is very often a requirement. Warriors need a bone thrown their<br />
way thanks to how high mob DPS was taken in PoP (in exp groups).<br />
Sure, give warriors some sort of short duration initial aggro thing.<br />
When the 'taunt' button is: 1. Well timed and 2. Passes the roll,<br />
it is a short duration initial aggro thing. Add some sort of a Taunt2<br />
that has a 3 minute refresh or something. Give it a 1 shot 1000<br />
aggro or something similar. Make it unresistable. This should <br />
fix any grouping issues, without trivializing raids. Call it whatever<br />
you want, but that will fix things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has to be a joke.  I seriously question the melee dps even with a GSoC.  The SEWS parses at 120 on average, the GSoC is not THAT much better to yield an 80% superiority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>synnoira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Giving warriors slightly better aggro doesn't really make much difference since people will still percieve knights as superior. I don't think increasing the skill level for Taunt for warriors is a bad idea (just as an example), but i don't honestly think it would make them balanced.<br />
<br />
The real warrior problem it seems to me is that unlike virtually all other classes they have really no useful secondary abilities. If they're not tanking they're pretty much bozo's and that to me is serious imbalance.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately people seem fixated on shoehorning 3 different classes into one job, tanking, that requires only one character to perform. At the moment for groups you have a choice of two classes with another one who can do the job but is clearly second choice. And for raids one class clearly preferred (due to being able to hit one button which is highly unsatisfactory in itself) and two others who can do some stuff in support.<br />
<br />
The way the game is set-up for tanking i think it's very hard to do anything more than play around at the margins with the current balance between the three tank classes. I think the only real area where clear progress can be made is in giving warriors abilities which will make them feel more purposeful and desired when not tanking.<br />
<br />
I can't claim to be terribly imaginative. I know i think the basic idea of shielding seems like a useful thing, in character, and the casters i know love it when a warrior does it. I've read comments about how DAoC has a system whereby melee damage can be shared. Perhaps something like that could be worked into EQ so casters think &quot;get that big strong warrior who can shield me&quot; when forming a group. <br />
<br />
Another recurring idea i've seen is the idea of melee &quot;spells&quot; (call them Feats like in D&amp;D?) which would use the stamina bar like a mana bar. Perhaps that could allow warriors &quot;dot's&quot; or &quot;nukes&quot; to be delivered at melee range. I think there's a lot of room for giving warriors more general convenience skills (forage, sneak, hide, maybe track even) which are already in game on the grounds they're meant to be trained combatants. <br />
<br />
Anyway thanks to Absor for posting as always, and i have to say i'm not going to get to exercised until i see something from the dev's themselves. After all i managed to find groups when the greater populace thought knights sucked anyways...i feel my attempt at a balanced attitude waning so i'll stop there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">1)  You can't balance raids vs. exp groups.  Both classes need an equal role in exp groups and raids.  The reason for this is that not everybody raids, and nobody can get to raid level without exp groups.  Stop saying &quot;warriors get all the glory on raids so it's ok if they suck in exp groups.&quot;  It's not ok.  Warriors, paladins, and shadowknights should all have equally important roles on both raids and exp groups, but for different reasons.  This is easier said than done obviously.<br />
<br />
2)  There IS a problem.  I think anyone can see that knights are superior to warriors as exp group tanks because they can tank effectively as well (if you can tank a mob without taxing your healers mana, you are equal to a warrior as a tank.  If you are getting one CH per fight just like the warrior, than the fact that the warrior is &quot;tanking better&quot; is totally irrelevant), do nearly as much damage (or in some cases more damage), and have much better aggro control and utility.  <br />
<br />
3)  There IS NOT an easy answer.  I get so sick of both warriors and paladins and know-it-alls of all classes saying &quot;If those morons would just do xxxx then everything would be fine&quot;.  That's bullshit.  This is an immensely complicated game and every change they make to it has unexpected repercussions.  This is why the classes aren't balanced.  If there was something simple that could balance everybody it would have been done already.  <br />
<br />
4)  The War Room on the Steel Warrior has a lot of whining in it.  That's what it's for.  It also has a lot of impractical or even stupid ideas in it.  That's what it's for, to throw out ideas and discuss them.  Just because you read a post that said &quot;nerf knights!&quot; doesn't mean the majority of the warrior community feels that way.  A lot of these ideas are hatched out of frustration, because people have been posting ideas for many months now, and have gotten very little response from Sony, either positive or negative.  Some of them are also retaliation against threads like this where people say that warriors are idiots, or to trolls on our boards (mostly paladins) that say there is nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
5) Warriors are not idiot, no-skill players.  To suggest this is just plain ignorant.  Look at our library forum.  How many boards have explained more about game mechanics, from the AC soft cap back on the old boards, to DB/DI, taunt, aggro, clearly some of the most knowledgeable EQ players are warriors.  This is true of every class.  Are there ignorant morons that play warriors?  There certainly are.  This is also true of every class.  I think you can tell just from the posts in this thread that playing a shadowknight isn't a cure for stupidity either.  To even suggest that someone is stupid based on the class they play only shows your own ignorance.  Give it up.<br />
<br />
Some of the flamers in this thread are proving themselves to be just as ignorant as the people they are flaming.  Does that mean all Shadowknights are morons?  Only an moron could come to that conclusion.<br />
<br />
6) Nerfs are not automatically bad, although they are pretty much always strongly opposed by the class they happen to.  No one thinks their class is overpowered, but that doesn't mean that they're not.  Opinions on the best way to fix an imbalance will be as diverse as the people in the discussion.  <br />
<br />
Is a nerf the best way to balance the classes?  Or a buff to the weaker classs?  I don't know.  Neither do you.  Neither does Sony.  It's a complicated game, and a complicated question.  Just among the SKs on this thread, there are those saying that warriors need more taunt, and those saying that giving warriors more taunt would break the game.  Almost everyone agrees that there is an imbalance.  Some people think it's fine, some think it's a disaster.  Everyone has an idea on how to fix it.  Most of those people are wrong.<br />
<br />
What is the point of this post?  I don't know, but I think everyone needs to relax a little.  No problem gets solved by standing around throwing turds at each other like a bunch of monkeys at the zoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Dantraeg, first of all, the SK you're quoting is a crackhead.<br />
<br />
Greatblade of Chaos won't be putting out more than 150 with the proc, maybe 155 if you load up on accuracy.<br />
<br />
1. Blood of hate - 15% increase from focus 184/tick average (30.66 dps)<br />
2. Festering Darkness - Why the hell is he using this?  And its 69/tick average (11.5 dps)<br />
3. Shroud of Choas - 1 proc every 20 sec average 10.4 dps increase<br />
4. Greatblade of Chaos DD proc - included its proc in the melee damage<br />
5. Self DS'd - This is irrelevant, SK's have no dmg shield advantage no other class cant get from the same buffs we use for dmg shields.<br />
<br />
Ok so now:<br />
Throw in all of that 202.5 dps, not quite the 250 you said.  In order for us to do 250 (and exceed it, which we can btw with that gear) we must burn a fuckload of mana.  There arent many SK's out there with more mana than me (and even less with the manapool and my mana pres), we can't keep that type of damage for long.<br />
<br />
Also, he added his pet in at the end, and is forcing me to repeat the crackhead statement, with our haste buff on the pet (inferior to enchanter haste) it clocks in at around 25 dps on exp stuff in elementals, and a bit less than that (21) in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Simple.  Slow wasn't even necessary pre-pop.  Hell, pre-pop, one of the best xp groups was training spiders on your top ledge group in velks.  No one would have even considered wasting mana slowing those gimp mobs.   Same story in FG.  Pull shrooms &amp; let them cast all day while you beat them down.  Slow was completely not needed.<br />
<br />
Now along comes PoP where mobs are actually hitting hard enought that you have to slow in order to keep the cleric from going OOM in a group of average 60-65 players.  With a warrior you just end up with a lot of ping pong as the shamn/chanter slows &amp; the cleric is dealing with heal agro from keeping them alive.  <br />
<br />
LDoN is no better.  You have timed events where the best groups are unloading nukes right off the pull.  Let an SK CD on incoming &amp; you are set.  With a warrior you run around chasing the mob hoping that taunt succeeds.</div></div><hr />

Clearly this means that slow should be nerfed and the encounters adjusted to compensate for there not being a slow better than 40%.  Slow f'd up game balance long ago.  It and the cripple line should have been on par with each other in effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

You may be right about the numbers &amp; the guy I quoted (Torahdane on Morell Thule) may be way off.  I quoted him because he is one of the top SKs in the top guild (Fury's Edge) on that server, so it seemed like he just might know what he is talking about.

My SK isn't quite near that kind of gear/aa, so I'm not going to argue who is a &quot;crackhead&quot; &amp; who is not.  I think the point is still valid, however.  A good SK can easily exceed a warriors DPS.  It's not even all that situational.  Mana is not even an issue considering KEI is easily available to any raid or xp SK out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">You know, this thread is sad on so many levels I don't know where to start.   I know how the people cleaning up after Mardi Gras feel.<br />
<br />
I'll just start wherever:<br />
<br />
When you call people &quot;retards&quot;, it's always in your best interests to be more intelligent than them, or at least to understand that which you are referring to them as 'retarded' over.<br />
<br />
Sadly, from what I'm seeing here, people are seeing &quot;nerf knights&quot; and reacting to their self-illustrated scenarios without understanding the deeper issues involved, never even bothering to ask themselves *why* the &quot;call for nerfs&quot; has been issued, only seeing the word and reacting in a hostile and condescending manner.<br />
<br />
There is a reality in Everquest today, whether you want to admit it or not.   That reality is that the aggro gap between warriors and knights (of both types, not just Shadowknights) has grown in relation to a shrinking defensive gap.    You can deny all you'd like, it doesn't change the fact that it's true.   The defensive gap between knights and warriors has shrunk to such small levels that it's what I'd refer to as &quot;barely noticeable&quot; since the &quot;melee balancing&quot; in early Velious, and through AA's and itemization.   The aggro gap on the other hand has not shrunk, as a matter of fact, it's GROWN, with a single exception, which is the DC &quot;nerf&quot; (side effect of anothe action, but had the result of a 'nerf' nonetheless).   With static mana costs of low mana spells, and an ever expanding mana pool, and ever increasing mana regeneration, and to top it off with the importance of aggro generation in the last two expansions, the aggro gap has grown so much that it has eclipsed the &quot;defensive gap&quot; as the factor of choice when forming experience groups when it comes to tank selection.<br />
<br />
This premise is generally accepted on TSW boards by all parties, that there's a major discrepancy between Knight and Warrior aggro generation and not nearly enough offsetting discrepancies that favor the warrior for 'balance' to exist.   Whether you believe it or not, whether you have an innate desire to calle me a &quot;moron&quot; or not, th truth exists that warriors are consistently passed over for their role as experience group tanks in EQ today and the reason is because of aggro generation.   This does not compute with your views of &quot;the game is finally balanced&quot;, it computes with warriors who say &quot;no it isn't, because I have a GLARING weakness, which isn't compensated with a glaring strength that exists in most situations where I play EQ&quot;.    SK's are in a good position right now, but it's nowhere near 'balanced'.   SK's don't have enough of a raid role in my view, and warriors are too weak in exp groups due to aggro issues.<br />
<br />
There is another &quot;truth&quot; and that is basically that a Shadowknight for the most part is viewed by warriors as a &quot;lesser threat&quot; because SK's tend to become &quot;enablers&quot; rather than pissing contestants.  Sk's for the most part tend to feel pretty comfortable knowing that they can snag aggro at a moment's notice, but dont' feel the need to &quot;prove&quot; it every chance they get.    Because of this, warriors haven't targeted Shadowknights with the same vengeance that they've attacked paladins.    There's other reasons as well.   Because of stun's power in stopping melee combat from occuring, Paladins are actually in experience groups where mobs are stunnable.... the best defensive tank, meaning that they take the least damage from melee and spells out of the 3 tanks.   They also have aggro generation capabilities that rival that of Shadowknights.    Warriors see all this and ask themselves &quot;Where does this leave me?&quot;, and the ugly answer is really.... it leaves me scrappin for groups.<br />
<br />
So, if warriors for the most part agree that there's an imbalance between aggro gap and defensive gap and it's costing many warriors opportunities to tank for exp groups, the next question is &quot;what should be done about it?&quot;    It's truly a fair question.   <br />
<br />
Well, there's two different camps of warriors on this question.   The first is.... &quot;Do we increase the capabilities of warriors to generate enough aggro in relation to any defensive differences?&quot;   Many say 'yes'.   Others (such as a fellow from Drinal named Phantron) on the other hand, believe that the most logical tank aggro generation standard should be that of the warrior, and that anything more than that would remove the skill and risk of EQ.    Currently, there's the mood among many that using knights to tank makes playing EQ 'too easy' for non-tanks, and it leads to &quot;lazy caster syndrome&quot; where there's no aggro consequences for behaviours, and since keeping the 'tank' alive is a non-issue, even with the allegedly 'inferior' knight tanks, then it plays to &quot;lazy caster syndrome&quot;.    Because of THIS, they feel that EQ should not be dumbed down any further and knights should be brought closer to warrior levels of aggro generation (as well as rangers and Beastlords).    <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but this is NOT a 'retarded' position, both positions are valid, and both show a concern for class balance, and the whole of EQ, not just warriors being &quot;top dog&quot; with knights out LFG all day.   <br />
<br />
You just have to understand that the issues go a little... no a LOT deeper than someone one day going &quot;GEE I KNOW, NERF KNIGHTS AND OUR PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

2.  said class is the single most broken class in the game. <br />
<br />
Monks are way more broken now.<br />
<br />
FD pulling, yeah right.<br />
Best damage from any angle? Maybe (actually Broda Thep showed they do warrior damage from the front on the FoH board), even so nobody can eat 2k ripostes, so they sit behind the mob and watch the rogues outdamage the fuck out of them.<br />
<br />
As much as it has been whittled down, warriors still have an AC/HP advantage in equivalent gear and they still have defensive.  Monks now have nothing to appeal to an exp group (except maybe needing to fill a slot and no one else LFG).<br />

Ok, I like this explanation - at least I understand what y'all mean now.  I still don't agree with it.  Fact is, neither knight will be a substitute for a DPS class in the spare slots, no more than a warrior is.  If you take a knight over a warrior for a non-tank slot is the knight better? Yes.  Would you take a knight over a wizard (or ranger or whoever) for an optimal group? No.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat disingenuous to argue that warriors should be unequivocal choice for a required group slot because the other tanking classes are better (than warriors) but still sub-optimal choices for another slot.  It would be like giving warriors a small DPS boost and calling the problem fixed because warriors outdamage knights but still lag way behind the real DPS classes.</div></div><hr />

Let me elaborate on that statement of mine you are quoting.  If taunt were fixed to be guaranteed to succeed vs xp mobs (any non raid target) I would stop complaining.  It may not be good enough for that raid warriors.  All I know is that it is in xp groups where the difference is the biggest, that small fix would put them back on even footing with knights they compete with for the tanking role.  <br />
<br />
I don't know why this would be such a monumental change to the game that they can't implement it.  It sure as hell wouldn't unbalance anything (raids would continue as they are today with DPS classes having to watch their agro or get summoned).  Problem solved at least for xp warriors.  It's not that GD hard.<br />
<br />
For raid warriors, it's a lot harder to fix.  I don't know why VI hasn't put in the small effort of itemizing by class already, but they havent.  The djini is already out of the bottle &amp; knights are soon to be wearing much the same BPs that warriors will be.</div></div><hr />

None of this addresses the standpoint that I've asked you to respond to, defending the point that hybrids having snap aggro isn't overpowering when it is for warriors. You've stated how warriors shouldn't have it, aye. But you haven't said why hybrids SHOULD. Warriors CAN instantly have more hate than everyone else, it's called AETaunt, with its attendant limitations. Warriors who are building aggro aren't relying on the DPS to build aggro, they're relying on the procs. More likely, they're focused on staying alive for the raid, while the raid allows them several seconds to build that aggro.<br />
<br />
Secondly, tanking isn't the only thing hybrids can do, you know it and I know it. shadowknights can do such useful things as return mana to their group, vastly increase the atk rating of their group, and other useful things that allow the group as a whole to perform better including increasing aggro for themselve as well as other tanks, as well as help pull with FD if they need to. Paladins have the ability to heal PC's that are going to die, and RIGHT FRIGGIN NOW, complement the cleric's divine arbitration with a group heal, reduce damage done by mobs with their stuns, etc etc. They have the ability to get aggro at range while warriors do not, EVEN IF warriors get snap aggro. Hybris can peel off their CC mobs at range with a high aggro spell, making multipulls easier. ON top of which, they can tank any non defensive mob very nearly as well as a warrior. So don't be sittin there with the doom and gloom about hybrids being replaced by warriors with the simple addition of snap aggro, please, you know and I know that's a very extreme picture you've painted which doesn't reflect reality. The fact is hybrids are extremely good CC tanks, as well as MT's on trash mobs. The addition of snap aggro to warriors is not going to suddenly replace hybrids in that role. Hybrids can do all these things and more, and yet what does a warrior do? Tank. What else can he do when he's not tanking? He's certainly not a DPS class, the only class worse than warriors for DPS is a paladin... so what's left? Nothing. WHat does a hybrid do when he's not tanking a mob? See above for the several examples that I've given.<br />
<br />
I really don't see why it's such a big deal. ALL warriors can do is tank. They don't even have the choice to go DPS when not tanking. A warrior who isn't tanking a mob can have his spot taken by at least half of the classes in the game, and the group and/or raid would be better for it. Hybrids can tank, and more. When they're not tanking, they still earn their keep via ability to add to the group and/or the raid with the myriad of other spells and abilities they possess.<br />
<br />
No, all snap aggro is going to do is bring parity to the plate classes, and that's about it. If everyone's got snap aggro, the choice boils down entirely to the slightly better mitigation of a warrior, or the slightly worse mitigation but atk buffing/mana returning/higher DPS of the SK, or the slightly less mitigation, but buffing/healing/rezzing/root CC'ing/reducing mob DPS via stuns and slightly lower DPS of the pally. It really WOULD be a pick the tank class that complements the group the most.<br />
<br />
Chrissy: Sure, that sounds like a good trade. As long as you throw in the spellbook and mana and all your nice spell toys.  <br />
<br />
Uhhh yeah.  200hp and 100mana every 30 seconds is pretty good but I have never been put in a group for that reason.  I have also never been put in a group to use aura of hate.  I have never been put in a group for the purpose of using lifetaps, snares, dots, spears, voice, or the other spells I cast on a regular basis.  SK spells are intentionally meant to be self serving, pain or hate inducing, and destructive it's that whole evil knight thing.<br />
<br />
I do crowd control on mobs that spit adds, I tank Cazic Thule in time, I pull phase 2 in time, I do quick aggro on pulls in phase 3, I tank non-boss mobs in phase 1, I pull and tank adds on Xegony, I pull and tank adds on that stupid mutant fish, I tank mez the first Rathe Councilman, I try not to die on Fennin ro, otherwise I try to do as much damage as possible while keeping my aggro below the MT's.  Knights had to fight for a role on raids but it seems that warriors begrudge us even the modest duty of protecting the clerics who are healing you while you get to be the heroes on the big bad guy or the other Not-worth-a-front-page-picture tasks that I mentioned.<br />
<br />
I checked out your magelo and I checked out your guild.  You guys seem to be doing VT, Ssra, and other mobs like that.  So you probably don't know what it's like in the upper tiers of PoP.  Let me assure you, giving snap aggro with a fast reuse to warriors would put knights out of business.  Having some classes be totally useless is not balanced.<br />
<br />
I'm only talking about raids.  I honestly don't care if warriors get a snap aggro ability that can be used on most exp mobs.  Exp groups are trivial.  But if that ability could be used on raids it would really screw raids up and badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors do need something, no intelligent poster here would deny that. You don't need to convince us about that.  You  also don't need to run around screaming nerf either because a nerf doesn't fix you at all. If you hold aggro like shit now you'll still hold aggro like shit after a nerf to SK aggro.  That's like when a child break's his/her sybling's toys because theirs was &quot;better&quot;. It's foolish and both are left without.<br />
<br />
An increase to the % taunt succeeds at and a +amount of hate if it fails.  Also, I think this is brik's idea, was to add a set amount of hate to kick.  Those two additions are simple to add from a programming standpoint and while not be the &quot;end all be all&quot; of class fixes would be a good, easy, base to start some structured rebalancing for warriors around.<br />
<br />
They could also add two levels of PE for warriors only.  Following the archtype % progression. That would further increase a warriors tanking ability over a knight.<br />
<br />
Pure melee DPS needs to go up in general but it should not be increased too significantly(and of course this is relative to your judgement of how much is too much).  <br />
<br />
Offhand damage bonus of 1 should be added each level from 55+ for Warriors, rogues, and monks. Rangers, bards and beastlords at 60. This would help bring DWing back into balance considering the risks of it. IE: DS's, Ripostes etc.  Also add an extra point of DB on the mainhand for Warriors, rogues, and monks from 61-65. <br />
<br />
Seperate timers for discs for all classes. Increased duration on offensive discs around 3 mins, no two discs can be active at once.  <br />
I'd prefer to see a slider bar system that would vary for each class that would be directly tied to your sta bar and you could control how offensive or defensive you wanted to be at that time.  How long you operated on your top settings would scale directly with your gear and sta regen.  <br />
They would probably have to rework the STA bar for that to function properly though. It could be a possibility, more likely that would be something to implement in EQ2 over EQ since the time developing that would be fairly great. But in my opinion a much better system than the current.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">I must be totally out of touch.  Last time I checked, our guild warriors were included when someone says &quot;/gu looking for tank for exp after raids&quot;.  Last I checked they had zero agro problems because they understand how that little button works.  Its very very rare for me to see an /ooc of &quot;group seeking knight&quot;.  Those players are guarenteed to suck anyways.<br />
<br />
Raiding comprises about 90% of my online time, maybe more.  So, I do a little chuckle when people get in a huff about desirability in exp groups.  All that matters to me is raid contribution ... I have 5 roles:  pulling (not even this so much anymore), non-damage offtank, mob positioning, dps, VoT bitch.  Reducing agro effectively eliminates two of those.  Our warriors tank.  There is no other choice.  Its a monopoly.  But it is funny to see an entire raid wiped in 3 seconds when TZ turns due to an overexcited wizard or rogue.  Kinda hammers home the notion that people do need to play with an inkling of skill and that a boost in warrior agro would trivialize that.<br />
<br />
Things are great right now.  There are 3 tank classes.  But warriors are still the be all end all when it comes to raids.  I've seen several raids postponed or called off because of a warrior shortage, never knights.   Its the way it should be ... knights are nice to have around, but not required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes, maybe a the simplest solution is the easiest:<br />
<br />
How about giving warriors an AA of Mega-Taunt that activates agro to the nth degree and put it on a XX timer for refresh.  That forces them to use it sparingly, but have it there when needed.  This shouldn't upset the Knight's apple cart and gives them their answer albeit only once every XX minutes.<br />
<br />
Just a thought ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Frodlin, I disagree with you about the aggro gap between Warriors and Shadowknights having grown, with Paladins however, there is no question that it has grown.  I don't want to argue about Pallys though, SK's have recieved multiple nerfs to our aggro spells.  The first was the DC nerf which you seem to be familiar with but, after this Shadow Vortex was changed to be almost zero aggro, our snare spells aren't as effective as they once were, and to top it all off the spells we were given to replace these are downright horrible past the 2nd one (level 44 spell) due to the way our spells aggro scales to the mobs level giving an exponential aggro increase on non direct hate spells linear increase on our terror spells (Terror of Thule is a maximum of 160 hate/sec btw, at the cost 40% of our melee damage... simply put, thats horrible, even less than Warriors get from hate off melee alone).<br />
<br />
The defensive gap is another point I would argue against atleast somewhat.  There is no doubt that it has shrunk but from my perspective atleast, it should have shrunk.  I'm sure you remember the days where we were a tank class who was completly unable to tank in raids and far from being effective in exp groups (think back to when guild rosters had 1 pal and 1 sk only to loot rot drops).  As it stands right now Knights are capable exp group tanks at all levels and sufficent in raids for most mobs at the time stage of the game although there is a smaller margin of error and since we lack AE taunt we cannot instantlly gain aggro if the previous tank dies, although we can get it fast (fortunatley it takes only slightly longer for heals to switch over as it takes us to climb to the top of the aggro list).<br />
<br />
You're correct in that Warriors get passed over in exp groups in favor of Knights, there is a problem there however, the solution is not to make Warriors get a group over a Knight as it seems so many Warriors want.  If there was true class balance we would both get equal numbers of groups, its unfortunate that there are 3 tanking classes and tanking is completly unable to stack with itself.  Right now the game seems to be resembleing a Pre-Kunark level of balance, I think alot of Knights are worried that melee rebalancing will have the same effect that it did in Kunark and completly swing balance from one side to the other, from the point of view as someone who's been playing an SK since back then history does seem to be repeating that way, so its understandable why people are concerned.<br />
<br />
Your question of what should be done about fixing it is something alot of people have tried to solve, not just on Warrior boards but on other classes boards as well.  My feelings on this are to not touch the sustained aggro generation of Warriors, you have never held aggro that well compared to any other class in the game and probally never will, it is part of the challenge in EQ (one of the only ones left really, damn near everything else was trivialized) but I will mention something that would work for aggro for you later in this post.  I think the defensive gap is where the changes should be made, Knights get to keep their aggroing and tanking abilites but you can then base Warrior off of Knights similar to what has been done when other defensive upgrades have been given to Knights.  For example put Warriors on the same or slightly higher hp table than Knights but add some innate durability type effect to them that gives 10% more hp or so, if that was done Warrior hp gaps would never shrink again unless Knights were getting gear with far more hp than Warriors which wont happen.  As for aggro generation I think you are good there for the most part but alot of complaints come from Knights being able to aggro on inc allowing fast debuffs/slows, so what if Warriors got an ability that gave them say level*10 hate with a 1 second reuse, but heres the catch, it can't raise your aggro over that level on the mob, so at 65 for example if you were &lt;=650 hate on the mob and used the ability you would have 650 hate, but if you were at 651+ hate and used the ability, you would get no benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>StruzorGnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Most of this whiny fuckheads are newbs or time geared where their Knights are gods regardles, it's stupid and a very small % of the population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Nehvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Itemization is another issue, with the current itemization benefitting hybrids more than the pure melee. AS that one's well known, I won't explain it any further, but suggestions have been made to turn the mana into hitpoints for warriors. <br />
<br />
The stats on gear are determined by what a class needs to stay effective.  Casters get HP and mana and focii because that's what they need to remain effective.   Pure melee get HP, AC and various melee mods.  Hybrids, since they are a mix of melee and caster, require more stat areas than a pure melee or pure caster would. <br />
<br />
5) Warriors need some utility and fun to do abilities just to make the class more useful when a group isn't immediately available and just plain more fun for the player. Just giving clickies does not cover this area since why should a warrior have to do a long boring camp or pay an exhorbitant amount for an item that any caster could buy at a vendor? How about enhancing warrior regen out of combat? Say if a warrior has not engaged in combat for a set period of time, say a minute, they begin to regen very fast. They could not use this ability if they have attacked or been attacked within the time mandated. With this, warriors could solo for experiance or gear with some effectiveness.<br />
Bind Wound AA's<br />
<br />
6) Along this same line warriors could be given the ability to root or snare on a limited basis. Obviously these abilites could be overpowered in some ways in the end game if taken as they are now but the root and snare warriors get could be modified just for them. These abilities could be discs and would follow the same outlines as the abilities previously mentioned. An ability like AE grapple could represent the warriors tactical control of a combat area and would effectively AE root or snare (with no aggro component on the snare possibly). These abilities could be balanced with reuse timers or damage components on them such as how shaman dots and pre-61 druid roots are balanced now. <br />
<br />
Not a chance.   That would cause such an uproar among other classes (mages in particular) that it will never happen.<br />
<br />
7) Give warriors the real ability to rampage and flurry like warrior mobs do. The PoP AAs warriors currently have are a waste of time and don't present any AA customization option for warriors. Right now, warriors above all other classes have a set AA path with little to no deviation possible. Warriors absolutely have to focus on defensive AAs to be useful Nothing else mattters with the exception of AE taunt and that only because it is guaranteed taunt. How about rampage as an active ability on a set timer or maybe just as an ability that could be switched off and on? On adds this would give the warrior and his group the idea on whether to CC adds or just take them and possibly raise the group's DPS with the warriors possible ramp damage. With this, warriors could gain some appreciable situational dps. In particular, this ability would be of value during some LDoN runs and disatrous during others. Warriors just gained some customization and required intellect to play. <br />
<br />
Most classes have a set path...if they wish to be as effective as possible.   I for one had to buy my defensive AA's first, then offensive.  Then I could do what I wanted with what was left.  <br />
<br />
Other than the areas I picked you apart on, your suggestions seem decent and well thought out.  Most unlike what is commonly seen on the warrior boards these days.<br />
<br />
Secondly, tanking isn't the only thing hybrids can do, you know it and I know it. shadowknights can do such useful things as return mana to their group, vastly increase the atk rating of their group, and other useful things that allow the group as a whole to perform better including increasing aggro for themselve as well as other tanks, as well as help pull with FD if they need to.

See above for the several examples that I've given. <br />
<br />
That quote reeks of bullshit.  You know damn well that if warriors got snap agro knights would get phased out.  Efficiency is key to raiding.  If a warrior is the more efficient CC tank, seeing as he now has snap agro to go with his superior damage mitigation, why use an SK or Paladin?   If a knight is not CC tanking then what is he doing?  Pulling?  Monks do it better.  Damage?  Most classes are superior there.  Spot healing?  Druids, shamen and clerics do it better.  Agro buffs?  Why keep an SK around for the sole purpose of agro buffing when an enchanter can cover that department?  Less mouths to feed.  I don't know about paladins but that leaves us SK's with Zevfeer's and Aura/Hate/Pain for unique contributions.  Unique in the sense that they do not conflict with other abilities.  I'll be damned before I let my raid role slip to &quot;insignificant buff bitch&quot;.  What guild would want to share loot with a knight for such weak gains anyway?<br />
<br />
On to a few of my ideas.<br />
<br />
Upgrade Warcry.  This AA should be AoE and should last 30 seconds.  <br />
<br />
New shield-like ability.  (I lack creative power when it comes to naming things...so call it what you will).   This would essentially represent the warrior doing his damndest to stand in the path of the target mob.  It would work much like sneak (clicked on and off) and would allow the warrior to always take a portion of the melee damage dealt by the mob no matter who the mob is smacking.  Non-stackable.  EDIT:  On second thought, this would probably be overpowering.   I did not think of the possibility of a warrior using this ability to reduce the damage done to the main tank.  Good start I think, but needs more work.<br />
<br />
Increase the chances of 'Taunt' working on mobs that con yellow or lower.</div></div><hr />

That's bullshit.  This is an immensely complicated game and every change they make to it has unexpected repercussions.  This is why the classes aren't balanced.  If there was something simple that could balance everybody it would have been done already.  <br />
<br />
4)  The War Room on the Steel Warrior has a lot of whining in it.  That's what it's for.  It also has a lot of impractical or even stupid ideas in it.  That's what it's for, to throw out ideas and discuss them.  Just because you read a post that said &quot;nerf knights!&quot; doesn't mean the majority of the warrior community feels that way.  A lot of these ideas are hatched out of frustration, because people have been posting ideas for many months now, and have gotten very little response from Sony, either positive or negative.  Some of them are also retaliation against threads like this where people say that warriors are idiots, or to trolls on our boards (mostly paladins) that say there is nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
5) Warriors are not idiot, no-skill players.  To suggest this is just plain ignorant.  Look at our library forum.  How many boards have explained more about game mechanics, from the AC soft cap back on the old boards, to DB/DI, taunt, aggro, clearly some of the most knowledgeable EQ players are warriors.  This is true of every class.  Are there ignorant morons that play warriors?  There certainly are.  This is also true of every class.  I think you can tell just from the posts in this thread that playing a shadowknight isn't a cure for stupidity either.  To even suggest that someone is stupid based on the class they play only shows your own ignorance.  Give it up.<br />
<br />
Some of the flamers in this thread are proving themselves to be just as ignorant as the people they are flaming.  Does that mean all Shadowknights are morons?  Only an moron could come to that conclusion.<br />
<br />
Is a nerf the best way to balance the classes?  Or a buff to the weaker classs?  I don't know.  Neither do you.  Neither does Sony.  It's a complicated game, and a complicated question.  Just among the SKs on this thread, there are those saying that warriors need more taunt, and those saying that giving warriors more taunt would break the game.  Almost everyone agrees that there is an imbalance.  Some people think it's fine, some think it's a disaster.  Everyone has an idea on how to fix it.  Most of those people are wrong.<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Now that is a well designed post.<br />
<br />
But, why do you not post this in response to that thread on TSW?  Don't see much of this tone there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Winkles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">I think the taunt button works fine.  Here is an example:<br />
<br />
I was in LDoN mm MT and for some reason cleric forgets to heal me and I die.  We are nearly running out of time and after the rez I have 0 mana.  I decided to continue with no mana using just the taunt button and a fast 1h weapon and shield to bash.  Rogue was only other melee and I kept aggro off of him by just hitting the taunt button whenever the mob turned to him.  When the wizard overnuked I could stop the mob mid run with a taunt button push.  I lost aggro only 3 times and got it back fast with a total loss of only 4percent health to both the rogue and wizard.  I also don't have any proc weapons to help out with aggro because I really can't afford them and would prefer to upgrade my armor first anyway.   I think that the problem with warriors is that they don't know how to taunt and other classes don't know when to back off to let them keep aggro.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that everyone and their mother have some type of proccing weapon.  This can be a major problem to warriors who have to wait for the taunt button to repop.  If the warrior is having trouble holding aggro for God's sake put the planar strike, injected poison, frost blasting, fire nuking, dotting weapon in the bag and pull out something else.  <br />
<br />
But what do I know I'm only lvl 51 and just starting to realize the SK class potential<br />

Uhhh yeah.  200hp and 100mana every 30 seconds is pretty good but I have never been put in a group for that reason.  I have also never been put in a group to use aura of hate.  I have never been put in a group for the purpose of using lifetaps, snares, dots, spears, voice, or the other spells I cast on a regular basis.  SK spells are intentionally meant to be self serving, pain or hate inducing, and destructive it's that whole evil knight thing.<br />
<br />
You know what, sure, you haven't been put in the group for that specific reason, but that's really beside the point. MANY classes aren't put in specific groups because of their abilities.  The point is that you're CAPABLE of contributing, and contributing a lot, to your group and to the raid. As I've already said, while you're doing all these things that you mention above, and below this paragraph, you know what the warrior's doing? Standing around feeling useless... because the ONLY other thing the warrior can do when he's not tanking, is add DPS that just about eveyone else can beat. <br />
<br />
I do crowd control on mobs that spit adds, I tank Cazic Thule in time, I pull phase 2 in time, I do quick aggro on pulls in phase 3, I tank non-boss mobs in phase 1, I pull and tank adds on Xegony, I pull and tank adds on that stupid mutant fish, I tank mez the first Rathe Councilman, I try not to die on Fennin ro, otherwise I try to do as much damage as possible while keeping my aggro below the MT's.  Knights had to fight for a role on raids but it seems that warriors begrudge us even the modest duty of protecting the clerics who are healing you while you get to be the heroes on the big bad guy or the other Not-worth-a-front-page-picture tasks that I mentioned.<br />
<br />
You say it &quot;seems&quot; that warriors begrudge that. No. Warriors don't. They DO, however, want to be able to do the only thing that they do well, and that's tank. As it stands, Hybrids are not only MA for many guilds on trash, they do the CC, because they not only have snap aggro, they have snap aggro AT RANGE... leaving warriors feeling useless. What DOES a warrior do when he's not doing the only thing he's good at?<br />
<br />
I checked out your magelo and I checked out your guild.  You guys seem to be doing VT, Ssra, and other mobs like that.  So you probably don't know what it's like in the upper tiers of PoP.  Let me assure you, giving snap aggro with a fast reuse to warriors would put knights out of business.  Having some classes be totally useless is not balanced.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, Sojo is in Sol Ro and is planning on making its first attempt on RZtW very soon, as well as finishing up in VT and Emp. So no, we're not up in Elementals... yet. However, since we've dropped Bert, Angarr, Saryn, and MM on our first or second attempts, I think it's not too unreasonable to say we'll be there very soon =) Anyway, you STILL have yet to address why hybrids should have snap aggro, if warriors do not. Do you plan on answering this question?<br />
<br />
As for warriors being given snap aggro, and that putting hybrids out of business, did you ignore entirely the point I made where hybrids still have ranged aggro, able to split multipulls easily, and because of that would not lose their CC position?<br />
<br />
Like I said, you still have yet to mention anything that explains how for pure melee, snap aggro is overpowering, and for hybrids, somehow, it isn't. Kindly explain that, please.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
That quote reeks of bullshit. You know damn well that if warriors got snap agro knights would get phased out. Efficiency is key to raiding. If a warrior is the more efficient CC tank, seeing as he now has snap agro to go with his superior damage mitigation, why use an SK or Paladin? If a knight is not CC tanking then what is he doing? Pulling? Monks do it better. Damage? Most classes are superior there. Spot healing? Druids, shamen and clerics do it better. Agro buffs? Why keep an SK around for the sole purpose of agro buffing when an enchanter can cover that department? Less mouths to feed. I don't know about paladins but that leaves us SK's with Zevfeer's and Aura/Hate/Pain for unique contributions. Unique in the sense that they do not conflict with other abilities. I'll be damned before I let my raid role slip to &quot;insignificant buff bitch&quot;. What guild would want to share loot with a knight for such weak gains anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, hybrids will not be phased out. I mean, come on, you didn't see clerics phased out when shamans and druids got cheal, did you? Same sort of thing applies here.  Hybrids remain with superior aggro, due to not only having snap aggro, they have snap aggro at RANGE, which as I've stated before, is very helpfull on seperating multiple pulls, and is arguably as much more powerful as a full cheal is over a partial cheal. Paladins have the fastest heals in the game. Shadowknights can help warriors with aggro so that they can maintain that snap aggro, debuff the mob via taps, and buff the entire group's atk signficantly as well as keep their group's mana quite high. Hell, I've heard clerics in groups with an SK say, screw c3, just give me an SK, I just finished the cheal rotation at 90% mana!. Meanwhile, tell me what a warrior adds to the group when he's not tanking? DPS that just about everyone else that does it, can beat. No, to put everyone to thier best use, warriors should be doing the only thing they do well. Failing that, give them other things to do well that contribute significantly to the raid.<br />
<br />
Hybrids will still have their role, and that will include CC, DUE TO ranged aggro, the fact that they can generate aggro on demand when someone pulls it off them while warriors cannot, and for all that, they can still tank 80-90% as well as a similary equipped warrior, as well as all of their other myriad spells and abilities. <br />
<br />
Sounds like you still got quite a good deal to me, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
One final point: You say you'll be damned if you'll see your knight reduced to a buff bot or the like. Then surely you can see how frustrated a warrior gets, when in the same situation, he can't even offer THAT? =)</div></div><hr />

The key is &quot;Give warriors more tools.&quot;<br />
 <br />
By that,I do NOT mean it has to be itemization. We could end up with Kunark all over again, and that's a cycle nobody wants to revisit here.<br />
 <br />
Warriors do not benefit from mana. They benefit from HP,obviously.<br />
 <br />
What's the one finite resource they could therefore use to fuel new abilities and benefit from regen therein?<br />
 <br />
Stamina. Why the heck are there no stamina-eating abilities for warriors? Both knight classes benefit from abilities limited by their mana bars. Warriors don't benefit from mana,obviously-but the yellow bar is essentially -useless- to them assuming STA is high enough to begin with.<br />
 <br />
Give them weapons techniques that are fueled by their stamina bar and based on weapon type,rather than /disc whatever. Let them have slow PBAOE strikes with massive twohander weapons. Innately hasted barrages of strikes with a 1H piercing weapon. A shield technique that actually requires a shield and absorbs serious damage directed at another target. Just for examples. We know that the code can note and allow exceptions based on weapon type and delay-it can therefore be used to expand a warrior's range of expression. Given more options, warriors will develop as a class without needing to go on a rampage across multiple boards asking for revamps.<br />
<br />
Warriors more than any class are their gear. With stamina techniques, their gear will become their equivalent of spells, and still have limiting factors built in.</div></div><hr />

For the sake of argument let's give warriors a snap aggro ability.  Now you have 3 classes who can snap aggro and one of them has an advantage in hp, ac, mitigation, and avoidance.  Who do you think is going to get the job of doing crowd control on waves of unmezzable adds?  If you answered the warrior you would be right.  What does that leave for knights to do?

Dont even try to compare that. Knights aggro is perfectly fine. Warriors need a small boost (alot of people have already went in on that so i wont). Just for the love of god do some research...<br />

Most everyone will agree that warriors aggro needs a small boost. Snap aggro? hell no. What they need is something to help them get aggro in the begining of the fight nothing more nothing less.<br />

Hmm I guess it's this old &quot;stone, paper, scissor&quot; principle. You can't be &quot;the best&quot; in two aspects. We are not &quot;best&quot; in tanking therefore we deserve a &quot;best&quot; in aggro. Simple realy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">Jantizz, that's the very definition of snap aggro that i'm using, the aggro at the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
Numzaz, thats not a problem. warriors understand that and indeed don't want just as powerful aggro as hybrids have. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if hybrids tank 80-90% as well as warriors, which they do, then warriors want 80-90% of the aggro capabilities of hybrids, which we certainly do not have with the lack of snap aggro, the reliance on good aggro weapons, and even with the aggro weapons, the reliance on nothing but luck for them to proc at the right time. We have NO aggro generation capabilities on demand like the knights do. We want the to be just as inferior to knights in aggro, that knights are inferior to warriors in mitigation. No more, and no less. You remain a little superior in aggro, we remain a little superior in mitigation. THAT, is balance.<br />
<br />
Even at that point, the melee side of warriors and hybrids balance out, while hybrids get all their utility and versatility and soloability with all of their spells, while warriors get the disciplines they've had since Kunark, no versatility, and no soloability.<br />
<br />
Hybrids still come out on top, with that, by quite a fair margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors are not that unbalanced than they think, of course they are neither the best class out here. Wich means you really need to know how to play well your class to do your job.<br />
<br />
Just imagine a raid without knights. The raid could go on with no problems at all. Now imagine the same raid with 0 warriors. Im pretty sure it won't succed.<br />
Someone could argue here this is a lot dependant on the gear, and indeed it is, welcome to everquest, your gear has a very high factor on what you are able to do, but of course its all up to you if you know what and how to use your skills. And keep in mind there is usually just one or two knights with superb gear and skill in a &quot;normal&quot; guild that come closer the lowest equipped warrior in the guild, but they still jealous about it, since years ago nobody could imagine this ;)<br />
<br />
Now, focusing on the supposed agro issues that warriors say the have on raids.. /shrug, as many said wars tank 99% of mobs in eq, and they do well. On high end raiding probably the only mob warriors don't tank is CT in time. And its not because they can't agro him, its just cause they don't have fear immunity so CT has fun smacking other players when tank is running around.<br />
Gimme a break , warriors are so unbalanced because this they argue, just cause we tank one fucking mob in eq.<br />
<br />
On exp groups, first I have to say that a good warrior knows how to keep agro. Well I usually just group with people of my guild, rarely with a war, but when I do they don't have problems at all. Of course if I want to steal agro I can do.<br />
<br />
I don't argue that a warrior will have maybe more problems, longer time, on getting/maintaining agro compared with a knight. But a good warrior can do it, and they do it well.<br />
<br />
The real problem I think it comes on Ldon normal adventures. Where mobs don't hit hard and got very low hps, so even a wizard can tank. Why the cleric, hybrid, casters should care about their agro then? I doesn't matter, its piss easy. Wich makes feel maybe a warrior tank ability there a bit underrated.<br />
But listen up on hard adventures, I have been with a war and without, and they don't really have problems there.<br />
<br />
I will say again, a good warrior knows how to get good agro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Ive read the entire post on Steel warriors. there were some some very smart and reasonable posts there and some incredibly idiotic rants as wel...sad thing is the idiotic rants overshouted all the smart posts..<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are not overpowered as it is, i wont talk for pallies since im a SK and i dont like the generalization wich comes with the word KNIGHTS. Im an sk and i know i CANT tank aswell as a warrior and fold like a wet paper towel when i meet some real nasty hitting mobs, our tanking abillity needs no nerfing, we ARE meant to be tanks and not to be some gimpy monk or rogue who cant even dmg like real monks or rogues.<br />
<br />
I do aggree however that our abillity to snap aggro with a spell like CD is somewhat broken and that we should work a lill more for our aggro or to at least sacrifice a spell slot if want to be able to snap aggro/aggro lock.(again im not saying anything bout pallies)<br />
<br />
As far as the healing part of SK and pallies being overpowering during combat: U try keeping yourself healed with that drain spirit or what ever healing spell pallies have with cast times as they are with mobs constantly hitting and bashing you. and besides when im casting drains i lose aggro slightly cause i dont do melee aggro while waiting on my long cast time drain to finish and i cant cast aggro spells, plus i can only keep this kind of heavy draining up for 2-3 mobs cause its very heavy on the mana pool and wont leave mana for nuking etc.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the class that need work. one thing i personally dont like is how warriors have little extra benefit for a group when they are not maintank, they just end up being some poor dps class. <br />
If the warrior is not MT his tanking abillity should still be usefull by for example the shield command. when the warior is in group and not MT he can keep closer guard on his fellow group members and absorb some percent of their dmg or an abillity to defend a group member who is below 15percent health or something and share dmg with that person so they both get half the dmg or something.<br />
<br />
Give the warriors enrage or flurry or other abillities. and for aggro give them something like bleeding wound abillity that DMGes mobs a lill over time to add aggro.<br />
<br />
I hope some of the nerf shouting warriors come take a different attitude cause its their class that needs work, not our class that needs nerfing..and most of the SK on this board support the warriors in their feeling of being treated unfair.<br />

<br />
Same guild as Ronak, and I can vouch, our warriors don't suck @ aggro.  They don't all have BoWs.  They just have this understanding of how Taunt works.<br />
<br />
They should put a little blurb when Taunt is trained that explains what it does so that button mashers get a clue on what's going on...<br />
<br />
Few ideas would be to fix the RNG.  That thing isn't random, it always favors the Eurotrash!  But if Taunt failed less, then bling bling.<br />
<br />
Or add in something (maybe another skill, or a warrior exclusive Taunt revamp) that adds a base amount of aggro... Let's say 50 raw hate.  So if it's coupled with Taunt, a successful taunt establishes aggro, AND gives +50 hate.  If the Taunt fails, they still get +50 hate.  There's not really a lot of middle ground I can think of with warriors... They either succeed, or they fail.<br />
<br />
Maybe Rapid Taunt (much like Monk's Rapid Feign).  Lower the reuse time on Taunt...<br />
<br />
Maybe a little change to their Defensive disc, so it doesn't lower their damage output while it's up.  Damage creates hate too, and to lower their hate when they often need it most...  Miniscule, but still.<br />
<br />
I really don't think that nerfing another class is the solution to warrior taunt, because they gain nothing, but others lose something.  For SK/Paladins, that something is a big part of our class.<br />
<br />
Also, since I'm pretty sure the big A will continue reading this, would like to throw out a shameless plea for reconsideration of the Death Peace button (see: Ranger+Paladin button for further consideration), as well as SK pet focus.  Be it Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia or that augment, SK pet focus doesn't sound too unreasonable to ask.</div></div><hr />

   If you look at my post on the MT boards through the link that was given by  Dantraeg you would see that my parsings were very specific.They werent blown way out either.The topic was on LDoN &quot;normal&quot; settings. Which me on the back of mobs ( dpsing ) with the GBoC hasted with SoV i was doing 200+ sometimes even more then 230.Without any other non melee dam.Not sure where you got the parsing of 150, maybe you were refering to Elemental planes only.I havnt even parsed my GBoC there yet. Also if you continue to read you will see why i use Festering Darkness. Its to hold aggro, i allow a bard to pull to me ( im im the Tank ) on INC i cast the snare to gain instant aggro, then lay a couple hits and cast one BoH.Then just straight melee the rest.Now you can understand my post.But yes i was getting near 250+ with SoC,GBoC,BoH ( one cast  focused with Symbol of the planesmaster ) and one cast of Festering darkness ( focused also ) this is not to mana intensive and i can easily handle it with a C5 and my FT on a adventure through normal.Also about the pet it does do 32+ easy with SoV or our haste. Our haste is not that much less then Chanter SoV like maybe 5%? Again this is parsing in LDoN.My pet was actually parsing into the low 40's in LDoN.Anyway, hope this helps you understand what i was saying.<br />
<br />
Also my focus is 30% more per tick not 15% on Dot's.<br />
<br />
As for DS's if you read again i said that i dont count DS's in my DPS as the monk WAS, and i do have DS is can self buff that others cant my cloak 20 pts DS, CoL DS and BA all 3 stack.<br />
I didnt go back to read maybe i was mis quoted and this is why you replied this way, not sure, anyway.<br />

Now along comes PoP where mobs are actually hitting hard enought that you have to slow in order to keep the cleric from going OOM in a group of average 60-65 players.  With a warrior you just end up with a lot of ping pong as the shamn/chanter slows &amp; the cleric is dealing with heal agro from keeping them alive.   <br />
And nerfing knight aggro will help this problem...how?<br />
<br />
All I can see happening if knight aggro is reduced down to warrior level is that pretty much every single other class in the game would start screaming lloud and long about how aggro is broken and needs to be fixed *right fucking now*<br />
<br />
And I'm sure, after such a hypothetical patch,  we SKs wouldn't do anything like going round to all the class boards and directing them to the Steel Warrior boards and saying that it was entirely their fault. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Vicaire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">The idea behind the AoE root is more of a &quot;Buy a few seconds&quot; type ability not a full fledged long lasting root such as casters get. I would envision a warrior using it to hold the attention of adds long enough to give his/her group's CC team time to work or maybe to lock down a train just long enough for the warriors group to get a head start to zone. <br />
<br />
This could also be the solution to the warrior snap aggro problem. AE root would give warriors a form of snap aggro that would allow the debuffers a chance to get thier spells off and not take aggro. This wouldn't give nukers the safety net to overnuke like they do with knights no and would force the group's other melees to pay special attention to thier aggro radius. Using AE root this way would require a lot of coordination among the warrior's teammembers, something I personally would enjoy. Warriors wouldn't have the knight level of snap aggro but they would have a form of snap aggro that would be more than enough to make them servicable and valuable in groups.<br />
<br />
To prevent abuse and as a factor of realism the ability could even be tied to the warrior's proximity. i.e the warrior obviously use his sheer physical prowesss to command an arena of combat he is nowhere near. This, the resist check, the amount of opponents afffected, PBAE type of four target max quad type, and the duration of the root could all be used as balancing and maybe level based improvement considerations.</div></div><hr />

I'm by no means an expert of how much melee DPS would do on a GSoC.  If you're doing 250 dps + though,  How is it that the mobs are living long enough for you to get a full BoH... and how is it possible to BoH / Festing every mob if you are killing this fast.  I got a decent mana pool buffed, use MC, and have a Bracer that reduces DoT mana by 30 percent and it's not really viable mana wise to BoH each mob... much less Festering and BoH.<br />

Numzaz, thats not a problem. warriors understand that and indeed don't want just as powerful aggro as hybrids have. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, if hybrids tank 80-90% as well as warriors, which they do, then warriors want 80-90% of the aggro capabilities of hybrids, which we certainly do not have with the lack of snap aggro, the reliance on good aggro weapons, and even with the aggro weapons, the reliance on nothing but luck for them to proc at the right time. We have NO aggro generation capabilities on demand like the knights do. We want the to be just as inferior to knights in aggro, that knights are inferior to warriors in mitigation. No more, and no less. You remain a little superior in aggro, we remain a little superior in mitigation. THAT, is balance.<br />
<br />
Hybrids still come out on top, with that, by quite a fair margin.  <br />
<br />
No, it's not about &quot;shades&quot; of aggro or tankability. It's the  qualities of the classes.<br />
Living in front of a god is the trademark of a warrior. Grabbing a mob across the room and keep it interested is the Knight's highlight.<br />
<br />
Both can fill the others role just fine if your party is prepared to sacrifice some exp efficiency (with a warrior) or raid smaller prey (with a Knight), yup.<br />
<br />
Knights DONT tank 90% as well as a Warrior. <br />
If that was the case, a Knight would stand in front of any god for 90% of the god's HP and a second one would just take over for the last half bubble with a quick Terror or Stun spell (&lt;-sarcasm).<br />
Any guild would rather sacrifice one professional Knight per boss than messing around with a Warrior's hobbyist aggro, wouldn't they?<br />
<br />
If you want to fiddle with %ages we can start to argue if you would want to give a 45% defensive disc to Knights while Warriors get a 108sec &quot;notquiteasfestering&quot;-darkness spell?<br />
<br />
This kind of twisted mathematics has nothing to do with class balance at all. Just define the role of a class and use the %ages to tweak it a bit.<br />
<br />
Being the star in a god fight is a warriors role. Optimising exp groups is a Knight's. <br />
If you never want to be the star on a guilds homepage but rather the everyday hero for your 6 man team, warrior is not the class for you :cool:<br />

&quot;There is a reality in Everquest today, whether you want to admit it or not. That reality is that the aggro gap between warriors and knights (of both types, not just Shadowknights) has grown in relation to a shrinking defensive gap. &quot;<br />

1 - Enchanters can aggro buff tanks<br />
2 - Enchanters have aggro removing AAs (re: Spell Casting Subtlety).<br />

My experience with Warrior MA is that aggro buff, and then slow gets no aggro over 90% of the time.  If I have a Pally/SK MA I can Tash on incoming/Slow asap.  The HP difference generally makes this about the same.<br />

The big difference to me is people that don't know what they are doing.  If a Wizard nuke/crits for 6k at 80% mob health, they deserve what they get (and they have concussion to deal with it).<br />

Jolt, Concussion, and Boggle all exist for reasons.  The 1 class that has the hardest time with all of this is the Shaman.  They have no aggro control spells either positively or negatively.  They can do SCS and probably should.<br />

I have more of an understanding of this game and its mechanics than you could ever hope to accumulate in your next four miserable lifetimes. I'm one of the few, FEW, players to actually show the developers how their own game mechanics work time and time again - and I'm telling you now, you Nazi spewing neanderthal, to shut the fuck up. The only thing you've managed to do is compare me, yet again, to Hitler, not once, but 5 times in a thread. Get the fuck out of this forum and grow some balls, or at the very least, some form of understanding of what you're talking about in regards to Knights versus Warriors balance.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights have grown far too big for their britches and it's time for Paul Bunyen to pull out his big ass axe and cut you fuckers down to the saplings you deserve to become. How dare you think you should be able to tank within even the same ballpark as me. I AM your fucking Daddy when it comes to tanking, and as your daddy I'm telling you, you and the rest of the Knights need a good, long, spanking with the nerf bat. The stupidity of people like AbSORE and other derelicts in the SOE lineup should land them a job working at McDonalds in the near future. Other people from other companies DO watch the happenings of Everquest - to learn from the mistakes being made, over and over and over again by the same crowd of plucky developers. It's a good thing, (1) it guarantees they'll never find a job past janitor in a real MMORG company when they are fired from SOE and (2) Guarantees we'll never see such a mudflated, class blurring annhilation that we've seen in comparing Knights in Everquest to their DADDY the Warrior.<br />

Further, I see nothing wrong about what Furor said, it's coming. <br />

<br />
Ok, first off, Chova ... I don't think you've even posted 3 times on the SKnight boards. I though you werea paladin in dyed black armor, m'self... you are a grade-B &quot;fell off the conveyor belt&quot; malfunctioning unit <br />

And you can bet your ass if I'm attack on  a board by the likes of Furor I'll say WHAT THE FUCK i want to his high and mighty ass.  <br />
<br />
It's sad to see classes screaming to nerf others. It wasn't that long ago that knights were one of the classes in the most need of balancing. As it stands now we are more balanced than ever before. Sk's being able to hold agro isn't a new thing. We have been doing this for along time. But, with our previous poor melee dmg and tanking abilities we were not very desirable. Now that we have had our tanking ability tweaked to where it should be things are much better. Do you really think that the entire game should be dependant on one class? Surely you don't think that Warriors should be the only tank class in the whole game. What would the pally/sks roll be then? They can't drop us down so we don't have a viable roll within a group. Your taunt needs to be fixed, but there are better ways than nerfing 2 other classes just to make you happy. Hell the best thing to do is give you all choices of either sk/pally and scrap the whole warrior class. Then they can just improve our tanking abilities to that of what a warrior was and problem solved.  <br />
<br />
My original post over there with alittle rib poking at the end.  When they come on full bore then I give it right back.  And besides that I loved whipping Furor into a frenzy.

Hmm. they always seem to miss the fact that no matter who is tanking, if they die the warrior always has the advantage because he doesnt have to regain mana. No matter how they try to slice it, a warrior&gt;a knight with no mana by far. Furor is a moron if he thinks they will nerf knights, umm hello, they just balanced us dipshit. Personally I think he should worry about his own class and leave ours the fuck alone. <br />

Knights are balanced.  The real reson warriors are pissed is they can't solo.  They never want to admit it, but face it, being a class that basically has to sit there with AFK over their heads for hours sucks hardcore.  Sure he might get a guild group, but sometimes that's not the case.<br />

Deagul, I have to admit, the ideas you mention:<br />
------<br />
Snap agro ability of X hate (500ish?) that is level capped to not work on raid encounter bosses. Also would be good for this ability not not be able to generate anything over x hate on a given MOB; i.e. 1-time use per MOB.<br />
<br />
Hate-generating ability (100-200?) that works on anything, refreshes ala bash (or slower, whatever works out to be bananced).<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Sure sound like they would help warriors without destroying the balance of existing raid level encounters too much.<br />
<br />
It would be a pain for SOE to flag the appropriate mobs as immune, but Im sure each mob will get a careful evaluation, as was done to decide which mobs needed to be immune to fear....  <br />
<br />
Actually, those weren't my ideas; the SK comunity as a whole came up with those, I just reposted them in generic form (but thanks all the same).  Wouldn't require any flagging of specific MOBs tho since it would be level capped; same as all MOBs above 55 are immune to fear.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with Brael that an inate 10% (or whatever %) bonus to HP &amp; STA from items is the best fix for itemization problems.  Asking SoE to fix the problem by adding or editing items just isn't going to happen; that's way too many man hours of work.<br />
<br />
I also agree that the war class specifically needs to be more fun.  Again, adding new abilities or disciplines isn't going to happen anytime soon because of the huge man hour requirement.  I agree with the folks that say put all disciplines on a sepperate timer (no 2 at the same time tho); more fun and is a reasonable thing to ask in the short term.<br />
<br />
And yea, I gotta chime in with Dark; Encyclopedia Necrothurgia affects the level 49 necro pet, which we now get at 64 (post-PoP).  In light of that I don't see it as unreasonable to have SKs added to the usable classes on that item; we should be able to use the same focus for the same spell.</div></div><hr />

As long as Furor is given the bullhorn (and yes, I'm sure that most of the more intelligent members of the war community have the good sense to disagree with his rants) SoE is not going to be very receptive.  Who, in their right mind, is going to listen to a guy who blows things completely out of proportion with wild twists of logic and to top it off is the most insulting guy ever to badmouth SoE (and Absor in specific).   Does he really think that blistering personal attacks are the way to get what he wants from them?  The warrior community needs to publicly ditch that guy so SoE stops associating his rants with their genuine conscerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Nehvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">No, hybrids will not be phased out. I mean, come on, you didn't see clerics phased out when shamans and druids got cheal, did you? Same sort of thing applies here. Hybrids remain with superior aggro, due to not only having snap aggro, they have snap aggro at RANGE, which as I've stated before, is very helpfull on seperating multiple pulls, and is arguably as much more powerful as a full cheal is over a partial cheal. Paladins have the fastest heals in the game. Shadowknights can help warriors with aggro so that they can maintain that snap aggro, debuff the mob via taps, and buff the entire group's atk signficantly as well as keep their group's mana quite high. Hell, I've heard clerics in groups with an SK say, screw c3, just give me an SK, I just finished the cheal rotation at 90% mana!. Meanwhile, tell me what a warrior adds to the group when he's not tanking? DPS that just about everyone else that does it, can beat. No, to put everyone to thier best use, warriors should be doing the only thing they do well. Failing that, give them other things to do well that contribute significantly to the raid. <br />

When a warrior is tanking a mob like Time Vallon, a CH that can only heal 75% simply wont cut it.  I doubt those 2 spells could even heal 75% of one of our warrior's raid-buffed HPs anyway.  Clerics wont be worrying about druids or shamen replacing them in chains any time soon.  <br />
<br />
Secondly;  Ranged agro isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Since the proximity factor seems to be more significant than ever.  Anyone is better off taking the 2 seconds to hop over to the mob to call its mother a whore to its face.  (In potime, it often takes too long to get 'chase-agro' on something at range.  If you were trying to pull a p3 mob off a caster in such a manner, the caster would likely die.)  <br />
<br />
Lastly;  The reason that knights will get shafted if warriors get snap agro is that our raid purpose, generally speaking...some SK's have put a lot of time training their skills up to a point where they are competitive with monks for pulling...our raid purpose is to off-tank or CC tank.  Noone gives two shits about the tap-buffs we can provide and a chanter can easily cover our agro buffing.  If a warrior gets upgraded such that he is now the more efficient CC tank, then a lot of knights would essentially be put to pasture.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights have grown far too big for their britches and it's time for Paul Bunyen to pull out his big ass axe and cut you fuckers down to the saplings you deserve to become. How dare you think you should be able to tank within even the same ballpark as me. I AM your fucking Daddy when it comes to tanking, and as your daddy I'm telling you, you and the rest of the Knights need a good, long, spanking with the nerf bat. The stupidity of people like AbSORE and other derelicts in the SOE lineup should land them a job working at McDonalds in the near future. Other people from other companies DO watch the happenings of Everquest - to learn from the mistakes being made, over and over and over again by the same crowd of plucky developers. It's a good thing, (1) it guarantees they'll never find a job past janitor in a real MMORG company when they are fired from SOE and (2) Guarantees we'll never see such a mudflated, class blurring annhilation that we've seen in comparing Knights in Everquest to their DADDY the Warrior. <br />
<br />
Yes, the SoE dev's may be stupid...stupid for not banning Furor's lame as a long time ago.  It's fully within their power to cancel someones account without notification or reason given.  Isn't repeated insult and childish threats good enough?<br />
<br />
Anyway, we are beyond 'hybrids' now.  We are our own class with spells/abilities that neither 'parent' have and deserve to be balanced as such.  As do all 'hybrids'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lesson #1: Clinging Darkness&gt;Festering Darkness, 1/6 the mana, same aggro, same casting time (unless you have casting haste focus of any level, then Festering is .2 sec faster).  Now a question:  What does that extra mana get you?  Answer, more spears/scythes (suprisingly spears are actually decent in LDoN thanks to the sheer supremecy of dd's over dots) or Touch of Innos.<br />
<br />
Lesson #2:  GBoC is less damage than Vanazir in straight melee, it gains a very slight advantage from the proc, which it then loses from more lost melee during casting, leaving them equal.  If you are pulling 200 with melee alone I would be getting about 198 with melee alone, I can't even get 200 melee with a bard in the group.  If you truly did get a parse with that much melee damage I only have two assumptions, the first is that the parse was not long enough and you got lucky off the RNG, the second is that the parse was tainted by finishing blows.<br />
<br />
Lesson #3:  The real increase given on damage focus is half the focus's value because the increase is a random value of 1%-max% with an equal chance of being any of those random values.  This means Burning Affliction (20%) is a 10% average increase, Vengence of Eternity (30%) is 15% average increase, etc... So the numbers I gave earlier are correct (if you look back, you'll see I said average increase).<br />
<br />
You could be right about the pet, I just noticed my parsings of pets are from hard adventures.  Our haste is the same as SoV though, the difference comes from the stat/atk boosts SoV has over our pet haste, the dex difference doesn't really matter since mob's are to high for our pet to tap but the atk difference does matter.<br />
<br />
As for your cloak, if others looted the cloak they could as well, when high end comparisons are done most of the time they assume everyone has access to all of the various items.  What I was saying was we had no damage shield other classes don't have access to.<br />
<br />
For people who were saying he is contradicting himself, I'm assuming he was dotting everything as it was inc.  A Festering/BoH combo will provide enough aggro to keep stuff off healers, and then once a mob was dead everyone would hit another and the monk or ranger or whoever in the group would eventually end up with aggro while he would hit its back.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, well, my title on TSW is &quot;slayer of whiners&quot; and I have made many posts telling people to relax and stop blowing things out of proportion.

Your question of what should be done about fixing it is something alot of people have tried to solve, not just on Warrior boards but on other classes boards as well.  My feelings on this are to not touch the sustained aggro generation of Warriors, you have never held aggro that well compared to any other class in the game and probally never will, it is part of the challenge in EQ (one of the only ones left really, damn near everything else was trivialized) but I will mention something that would work for aggro for you later in this post.  I think the defensive gap is where the changes should be made, Knights get to keep their aggroing and tanking abilites but you can then base Warrior off of Knights similar to what has been done when other defensive upgrades have been given to Knights.  For example put Warriors on the same or slightly higher hp table than Knights but add some innate durability type effect to them that gives 10% more hp or so, if that was done Warrior hp gaps would never shrink again unless Knights were getting gear with far more hp than Warriors which wont happen. <br />
<br />
I pretty much agree with this.  Personally, I don't want aggro lock.  Holding aggro is one of a warrior's skills.  It's what separates me from the &quot;suck&quot; warriors that you get in PoV pick-up groups that can't hold aggro and bitch at the group about it.  It's what keeps everyone from going AFK on raids.  Warriors have better aggro now than at any time during the history of EQ.  Playing a warrior would be boring and take no skill if we had an aggro button like a pal/sk.  I don't want to push a button to get guaranteed aggro.  Back in Kunark, people that pulled aggro off of me were the ones that sucked, now I'm the one that sucks because I lost aggro.  This is the result of aggro locking hybrids that can tank any exp mob in the game with no real downside.<br />
<br />
I don't like being (effectively) equal to a pal/sk in tanking ability and dps but without the aggro generation or utility spells.  I want to be the difference between a cleric being able to nuke and melee in a group and having to med for heals with a hybrid tanking.  Back when PoP first came out, I got groups over paladins and SKs because PoV golems hit like a truck and clerics had to use all their mana to keep the hybrids alive.  Monks and rangers tanking was totally out of the question.  After a year of PoP this is no longer true.  A half-asleep shaman can keep a paladin or SK with decent gear alive in PoV, and nobody has to worry about aggro management or really have much skill playing their class, so they pick hybrids over warriors.  <br />
<br />
Personally I am perfectly happy with my aggro abilities.  I can tank very well in an exp group.  I am not happy with groups liking the mindless exp with a pal/sk over me tanking though.  I want there to be some reason people would pick me over a hybrid.  Not every time, but there should be some kind of a tradeoff.  Right now there isn't one (talking about exp groups here).  Hybrids should have some significant downside to balance their aggro advantage, and at the exp group level at least, they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Blackstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">Agro management is the core of the game.<br />
<br />
If warrior agro is boosted a significant amount, the game at high levels becomes trivialized.<br />
<br />
Its not a coincidence that the class best suited to absorb damage has to work the hardest to gain the mobs attention.  A knight can approach a Warrior in terms of hps and AC, but caps on dodge (esp.), parry and riposte build in non-trivial advantages for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Every spell casting class can gain agro pretty much at will -- vaunted knight agro is actually much less than ranger agro potential and enchanter agro potential.  The only difference between Knights and Rangers on down is that Knights can absorb this damage better than any other casters.<br />
<br />
Changing itemization of time loot is not going to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
LDON has changed the situation drastically and to the benefit of warriors.  Every warrior that invests some time can buy ANGER III augments for his weapons.  Assuming that you are dualing two EB weapons already (Blade of Carnage/Bloodfrenzy) -- two reasonably obtainable weapons by even mid-level guilds now.  You can still increase your agro potential by about 40%.<br />
<br />
If you have a Blade of War, you can get an ANGER IV mod, and essentially double your agro proccing.  Add a spell buff proc and you are good to go I think.  If you have a Blade of War with Anger IV and can't hold sufficient agro, then you need to start looking at your guildmates and not at SonyEQ.<br />
<br />
Another change that they could make is to make taunt work more like feign death.  Feign Death has a sliding scale of success that is in part dependent on the zone you are in.  Higher level zones mean more failures.<br />
<br />
Similarly, higher level taunt skills (i.e. warrior taunt) can be altered to succeed more often in higher level zones.  That will still give Knights an option in exp situations.  Furthermore, they can change the way that taunt suceess/failure operates.<br />
<br />
Taunt currently (as I understand) works such that a successful roll places you at the top of the hate list+1 hate unit.  Failure does nothing.<br />
<br />
Instead, (and they can play with the numbers on this)<br />
<br />
IF you AREN'T at the top of the hate list:<br />
<br />
Success in taunt puts you at the top of the hate list + your skill in taunt hate units (gives you some buffer).<br />
<br />
Failure <br />
<br />
If you ARE at the top of the hate list:<br />
<br />
Success adds +1 to hate<br />
<br />
Failure   subtracts 1 to hate<br />
<br />
That way, your best gaming strategy is to use some strategy and not simply mash the taunt key every time it refreshes.<br />
<br />
Also, there can be some changes made to INCREASE interdependancy, rather than Furor's suggestion that simply crushes knight classes.<br />
<br />
For example, Voice of Thule could not only add +% to agro, but could add a small value EB proc ~ 200 hate.  Sure, you could use that to buff knights, but why would you want to when you can buff warriors instead.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are lots of creative things that could be done, no need for the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buffing warriors is not something I enjoy to do, but sometimes it helps.  This is a very good idea to add a proc to it, in addition to the hate modifier.  And while they are at it, they should add +65 Cha too.  Might as well make it an overall useful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">Brael sez:<br />
 <br />
&quot;The only problem with giving stamina bar based abilites is buffs like Acumen and Invigor which refill the bar, if Warriors had high damage abilites based off that bar you would need to change stamina replenishing spells or else it would in effect have no limitations&quot;<br />
 <br />
How likely do you think any caster is going to whine about stamina-replacement effects being reduced? How often does it really matter to most melee types once Stamina is high enough to prevent slowing swings at this point, considering that yellow bar to most people really doesn't matter?<br />
 <br />
Give warriors something to do with their stamina bar.  Give them more things to do than /disc defensive in front of ubermob_0290 and whack it in the family jewels with an EB weapon. The simple response to &quot;Waaah, warriors can get snap aggro&quot; is something that gives it to them and starts the whole whine/bitch cycle all over again.<br />
 <br />
The right answer is giving warriors something else they can do besides pointing at the mob and hitting it with sharp pointy things. We do. That's why we feel useful. Our drain-debuffs and taps are part of the class now, part of what we bring to a group or raid.  Pallies get their heals/buffs along the same lines- both of us can do far more than sit there and smack the mobs down the line.<br />
 <br />
Warriors cannot do anything else but.  Aggro isn't the problem. The problem is warriors are the most one-dimensional class in the game at this point, that's what needs changing.<br />
 <br />
If nothing else, going that way would make Furor dirty his boxers at the thought that EQ would solve a problem but without anything he screeched about doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">I don't think they would care about them being reduced at all actually.

The other part of that is if that idea was implemented it should apply to all three melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">&quot;There is a reality in Everquest today, whether you want to admit it or not. That reality is that the aggro gap between warriors and knights (of both types, not just Shadowknights) has grown in relation to a shrinking defensive gap. &quot;<br />
<br />
I call bullshit. Misinformation at it's finest. Three mainstay SK aggro<br />
spells were nerfed since Kunark: disease cloud, shadow vortex,<br />
and shroud of pain. These were 'replaced' with worthless piece of<br />
shit 'terror' line. SK ability to gain and hold aggro is NOTHING like<br />
what it once was. Defensive gap? Interesting wording! Upper PoP<br />
contains the first raid mobs ever I have been unable to fill in for<br />
a warrior against. Mobs that quad for 130 to 150% of my total hp<br />
are simply untankable without defensive, which only warriors have.<br />
Since Kunark, the aggro gap has decreased signifigantly. Since PoP,<br />
the raid mob tanking gap has increased, simply due to the pure<br />
DPS of raid mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your aggro generation in relation to yourselves is not the &quot;gap&quot; I was referring to.   Someone else raised the &quot;DC/Shadow Vortex aggro nerf&quot; issue earlier, with a little cooler head, and I hadn't responded.   The fact is, even with the DC/Shadow Vortex aggro &quot;nerf&quot;, the aggro gap has grown *between knights and warriors*.    Last I checked, clinging darkness cost 20 mana to cast, and fear cost 40.    Neither is a substantive mana drain, and the ever increasing mana pools/mana regeneration of knights ensures that they're not going to be a noticeable draw on your mana pools any time soon.   Just because you use different spells (Clinging Darkness/Fear instead of DC/Shadow Vortex) to acheive a similar result doesn't mean that the gap between warriors and SK's hasn't grown.<br />
<br />
Also, pulling the shell game of &quot;raid tanking&quot; to minimize the real closure of the defensive gap between warriors and knights is disingenuous when it comes to experience group tanking.    I've said this before, and will say it again, and repeat it often, because it's true.<br />
<br />
Both classes of knight and warriors all have and do not compete for raid roles.   I think SK's should have a somewhat expanded raid role than they currently do.    It is only in the realm of experience group tanking where there's any real &quot;competition&quot;, and therefore using a non-competitive environment to justify an unfair advantage where there's actually competition for the role is disingenuous.<br />
<br />
Incidentally I'm not addressing the totally overinflated estimate of the differences that the avoidance skill differences make, but let's put it this way.   It amounts to a grand total of you getting hit less than 2 times per 100 more often than me, which is not only trivial, it's unnoticeable, and is compensated for.</div></div><hr />

There was no real information from Absore, other than &quot;WE cannot discuss these things at this time.&quot; That and some visitors from the cesspool known as Shadowknight.org that brought about the 2 year old LOIO crowd of Dreadlords who thought they would impart their 'knowledge' on the warriors at TSW. <br />
<br />
There is a patch on the 8th. It will more than likely do NOTHING to address any of the problems myself and a myriad other warriors have brought up over the past year in regards to the Warrior class. After that, though, supposedly some type of melee retrofitting is going to take place. As usual, the only thing to do is wait.<br />
<br />
Will we be happy with the results? IMO, no. If it's the Taunt Energy idea that Rich Waters is toying with, it'll be far too little too late. If it's introducing major hybird penalties and about 300 new Warrior only items, there may be hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>DrakainShadescale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Err, I don't want to be a prick, but I think someone needs to make this observation:<br />
<br />
Some of the people who are discussing the relative weaknesses and strengths of knights and warriors need to be a little less extreme in light of that fact that -they- -do- -not- -raid-.  Don't assume what you do in an exp group, or what you see in warriors do in these circumstances are a good indicator of what happens in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
Oh hell, here come my diatribe -<br />
<br />
Furor isn't thinking clearly, or he's being very manipulative.  (surprise!)  I can understand the frustration he experiences but the fact is IF the &quot;nerf&quot; he proposes were to go through it would DRASTICALLY change how raids are accomplished.  If I remember correctly he said knights need to have their damage mitigation, hp, and taunting abilities nerfed while warrior remain unchanged.  What does this accomplish?  I makes it so that all tank classes are incapable of holding aggro.  What effect will this have on raids?<br />
<br />
We'll wipe a hell of a lot more.  The truth is, warriors just suck at holding aggro. The majority of wipes that I have expereince have been because the tank failed to hold aggro.  If you gimptify every tank class then you're just making these encounters that much more difficult.  Maybe it's okay for this to happen for Furor since his guild has achieved time access, but those of us still working there would like it if the raids, which can already be quite hard, not get that much more difficult.<br />
<br />
I really hate it when people think the only solution to a problem is to destroy or cripple another classes.  Warriors need better aggro pulling abilities no matter what.  Maybe create an AA that allows each hit for a specified amount of time to count as a taunt, I dunno.  But please, leave my classes alone.  It seems their biggest problem is with the paladins, but any hit they take to aggro or mitigation, we take too.  And the only things we bring to a raid besides aggro management is good damage output.  Nerf that, then, well Kunark was fun :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frodlin:  I was the other person who brought it up, but yes the gap is less, you cannot argue that Warriors aggro has gone up quite a bit since the time SoD's became aviable until now your aggro has always increased, both from better weapons and from better procs.  SK's on the other hand (Pallys have increased as I said before) have had aggro reduced since Luclin.  I won't repeat the same facts again but if your aggro has gone up and ours has gone down that means the gap is decreasing.<br />

Aye :)  Aura of darkness (debuffs mob's resists by 10 each) - I use it only on MM.  All other spells listed by Kizzestra are not used at level 65 anymore.<br />
<br />
Our 65 spells that provide AC (self), mana (group), ATK (group), health (group) are NOT tapping the mob.  Would be nice if they would.  They do, however, have a small nuke component (100 - 200).<br />
<br />
At 65 the only tap I use are life taps, and I use them mostly for dps, unless an ae is present or I got hit once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Loneshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">wow....12 pages already and still at the top of the forum...<br />
<br />
Everytime i go to Steel Warriors and read their posts about SK im proud that my main is one of those &quot;Uber&quot; knights that totally makes warriors useless....but then a few mins later i log on to the game and im still a little sk that goes down fast when a mob doesnt get slowed or that cheal gets interrupted..<br />
<br />
Sk are fine as it is, we are closer to being balanced then ever, we ARE a tank clas afterall so dont complain when a sk can tank to a degree where they can make tanks in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Warriors have plenty to bring to xp groups as tanking over a knight. Its mostly that a lot of people have the idea that warriors are some clumsy tanks that cant hold aggro at all and SK and pallies can simply hold aggro magically without effort. Ive thought that for a while when i was still clueless myself. since then ive grouped with great warriors who have had no trouble at all keeping aggro or getting it even in the DPS frenzy that is LDoN. So what if with a warrior tank in xp groups a cleric gets a stray hit sometimes. Thats the risk, even with an sk as tank or pally mobs turn around sometimes and it still takes that TAUNT button to get back aggro and last time i checked warriors have that same button..its the use of the button that does wonders..<br />
<br />
Ill bet the warriors shouting nerf the hardest are the button mashers that i kick out of my group cause generally they suck as main tanks because they are clueless.<br />
And yes i do group with warriors even in LDoN and not because of pity,..its because they are a great melee class if played right.<br />
<br />
and yes, i do agree that warriors need a lill edge, something that defines them once again as THE tank class, abillities to shield group members that are below 15percent health by sharing half their dmg for example, stuff like that to make warriors more desireble to xp groups whilst not totally shafting SK and pallies.<br />

<br />
  I'd read about this here and there, and my thoughts (belatedly) came down to this.<br />
<br />
   Bind wound gives you a set number of hps healed per bandaid dependent on the skill, why not make taunt the same way? So your taunt gives you one tenth or so of your taunt skill when used. Maybe it could add the skill-influenced amount of hate for a failure, and behave as it does now with a successful check. That would require making the taunt bonus much smaller, as the last thing I think SOE would want is to make guaranteed taunt a button mash chain. If you just replaced the current system with the amount based by skill, it could be a larger chunk (but not much) for wars, then scale down. AA could increase it, perhaps. So warriors get the most aggro per use of taunt, then knights (who can use spells to aid taunt). So for sake of arguement, a war and sk with 250 taunt are both taunting, on a successful check the war would get 25 taunt, the sk say, 15. How this is used (added if a failure or not) is probably up for debate by folks with better understanding of taunt on raids versus exp groups, but I thought it was a neat twist on the skill.<br />
<br />
  As for the idea of Warriors getting any type of root, well, there's probably an easier answer, and that's by giving them a longer 'stun' with bash. Yup, if a war wants to root, let them throw a shield on and get maybe a chance to 'crit' a 4 second (or longer?) stun. Why not? it's not like swapping out weapons is all that uncommon. I'm not too sure a warrior who can 'stun park' would be all that balancing though.<br />
<br />
  I feel for warriors, but as has been pointed out a lot of the problem isn't that warriors cannot get aggro, it's that they can't get aggro as fast. I also worry about this trend, as the Shaman link points out the basic problem is people don't seem to want to change their style of play per tank class. If a Pally/SK can instantly gain and hold aggro, letting folks nuke/slow/etc without fear, then why can't warriors as well? They don't want to give warriors the time to build aggro, and that indicates that the warrior's taunt isn't broken as badly as people's ability to think and react differently to a different type of tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On non defensive mobs, they sure do. Sorry, I missed the obligatory &quot;on non defensive mobs&quot;, but then, I would have thought you'd caught when I was talking about defensive seperately and linking it to being about the same as your spellbook. <br />
<br />
This kind of twisted mathematics has nothing to do with class balance at all. Just define the role of a class and use the %ages to tweak it a bit.<br />
<br />
That's not twisted at all. You just took it the wrong way, after I forgot the qualifier this time.<br />
<br />
Being the star in a god fight is a warriors role. Optimising exp groups is a Knight's. <br />
<br />
Bullshit. Hybrids are good in a CC and utility role, warriors good in a boss and CC tankin role. That won't change. What WILL change is that warriors aren't left out in the cold for EXP groups.... BOTH classes should have EQUAL desirability for both raids and EXP groups. THAT's balance. <br />
<br />
What SHOULDN'T be happening is the warrior engaging the mob, hoping for a aggro proc, and doesn't get one due to the random number generator, so when the mobs is slowed, the mob goes to eat the caster. Then the warrior must find the proper caster, figure out where he is, slap a /shield on the caster if he can (they're usually out of range, piss me off), mash the hell out of taunt, and hope that he's lucky enough for either a aggro proc to go off or for taunt to succeed. ANd don't give me that crap about &quot;well you gaae AETaunt&quot;, that's bull. First of all, it's limited to once every 15 minutes, second of all, NO TANK should have to grind out AA's over and above his level to do something that he should be able to do for himself to begin with. It's ALL LUCK, and that's bull. There's no skill, there's nothing the warrior can do but mash and pray.</div></div><hr />

[B]I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you're not in the high end game yet...so I wont flame you, yet.  Firstly;  Druids and shamen a ch-chain do not make.  When a warrior is tanking a mob like Time Vallon, a CH that can only heal 75% simply wont cut it.  I doubt those 2 spells could even heal 75% of one of our warrior's raid-buffed HPs anyway.  Clerics wont be worrying about druids or shamen replacing them in chains any time soon.<br />
<br />
Exactly. Giving warriors snap aggro (which is still as inferior to hybrid aggro as hybrid mitigation is to warrior mitigation!) at the beginning of the fight isn't going to replace hybrids, either. Hybrids will still be used in addition to and to help with warriors. If you wanted to be the ones tanking all the time, because that's the only thing you do, I'm sorry, you should have been a warrior. Tanking is ALL we do.<br />
<br />
[quote]Secondly;  Ranged agro isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Since the proximity factor seems to be more significant than ever.  Anyone is better off taking the 2 seconds to hop over to the mob to call its mother a whore to its face.  (In potime, it often takes too long to get 'chase-agro' on something at range.  If you were trying to pull a p3 mob off a caster in such a manner, the caster would likely die.)[quote]<br />
<br />
I never said ranged aggro is a godly ability, I said it is a good ability. It'd be like me saying, yeah, dual wield isn't all that, my superior mitigation and hitpoints aren't all that... Well duh, course it isn't... but it's nice to have.<br />
<br />
[quote]to off-tank or CC tank.  Noone gives two shits about the tap-buffs we can provide and a chanter can easily cover our agro buffing.  If a warrior gets upgraded such that he is now the more efficient CC tank, then a lot of knights would essentially be put to pasture.<br />
<br />
Noone's asking that warriors be upgraded so that they're the MORE efficient CC tank.  Incorrect assumption. We want our aggro brought up so that we acheive parity with the hybrids. While you're filling the purpose you say you SK's are for, what do you think the warrior does, whose entire point of existance IS to tank? He's standing there feeling useless. See, the position that you're afraid of? That's exactly how warriors are feeling now. Except, you see, we don't even have buffs or taps or pulling, or snare, or  the like to add to the raid. Imagine how useless YOU'D feel if you couldn't even do that.</div></div><hr />

I notice that many are also calling for upgrades to warrior taunt as opposed to nerfing knight aggro control.  I get the feeling that this is what you'll see before SOE decides to nerf knight classes.  Remember that if they reduce the effectiveness of knight aggro, they're going to have a lot more angry people than just Sks and paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">I disagree that the aggro gap is widening between SKs and warriors.  <br />
<br />
When I first started playing my SK, Disease Cloud was instant aggro, from range, at almost any time I chose to cast it.  It was the very definition of snap aggro.  I could walk into a battle half over, cast DC, and the mob was on me.  And it cost what, 5 mana?  I didn't need any FT or chanter buffs to have all the aggro I wanted.<br />
<br />
On top of that, the only warrior aggro weapon in the game was the epic.<br />
<br />
Since that time, SK aggro spells have been consistently nerfed.  Yes, CD and Fear are still cheap aggro, but they do not compare to DC in its original form.  Additionally, there are tons of good warrior aggro weapons out there now, easy to camp and cheap to buy.  Far superior to the time when warriors wielded jade maces.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining, just correcting some false statements.  I firmly believe warriors need an aggro boost.  But using misinformation to argue your point only weakens your stance.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the changes you talk about are true with pallies, they are simply not true with SKs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much of your mana bar you reserve for aggro really means jack and shit, man. Seriously. What MATTERS is how quickly you regen mana, which has a direct affect on how often you can cast your aggro spells.<br />
<br />
Let's do the math here. I'm going to go from one extreme to the other to show you the difference.<br />
<br />
Early Velious:<br />
<br />
35mana stun<br />
Raid buffed:<br />
C3: 14mn/tick<br />
Chorus of replenishment: 14mn/tick<br />
28mn/tick, so you can't quite cast STUN once a tick. once ever 1.2 ticks or something.<br />
<br />
<br />

Cease: 15mn (13.5 with mana pres) (New from Luclin)<br />
C5: 18/tick<br />
Mental Clairy/Body and mind rejuvenartion (call it 6/tick, someone will correct me)<br />
Chorus of Marr: 20/tick<br />
AoTC: 3/tick<br />
SD: 9/tick<br />
FT 15/tick<br />
MAna pres 3 or better (10% savings)<br />
<br />
for a total of 71 mana per tick, or nearly THREE TIMES early velious values. with a stun that costs less than half. That paladin, were it possible, could pretty much chain cease every second for the rest of his life and never lose mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since stun and cease are the same aggro, paladins (at the max) are able to generate on the order of SIX TIMES the aggro that they were in early velious, while warriors, at the max, have had their aggro generation doubled. <br />
<br />
Yeah, that's a HUGE increase, and you can't deny it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, Thuggo, it IS a new spell, relatively speaking. It came out in Luclin.<br />

<br />

<br />
Give them all the option to reroll as SK's or Pallys, and then delete the class itself.  That'll stop the bitching.  Since we're evidently even better than them AND have versatility, why would they not want to be sk's or pallys?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't make absurd statments. The fact that a Paladin could conceivably cast the spell 40 times as often as they could ever need to, doesn't mean anything really and shouldn't reasonably be part of this discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know exactly how that feels, try being a knight in kunark.  Rogues, Rangers, Clerics even Druids made better tanks than us because our defensive skills were so pathetic, our armor was worse (Do you realise our Kunark armor used to have less AC than rangers did, while having the same hp of rangers?), I had no casting abilites either because thanks to no innate casting haste every single spell I had (yes even taps) costed me damage to cast even if it could be channeled and not resisted.  I don't have to be afraid of it, I lived it for a year, then another 18 months after that of near uselessness</div></div><hr />

if they did something like that, i'm sure they will still complain because they will have to work to find gear with the effect or earn adventure points to buy the augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">I'm not making absurd statements. I'm showing what is entirely possible in present game mechanics, which is why the aggro difference has grown. It's not absurd, it's absolutely possible. WHat maybe you're missing is the fact that while the hybrid is using that pissant little spell to get allt he aggro he needs, he's able to use the vast majority of his mana for other things, such as heals for pallies, and DoT's/taps for SK's, which generate even more aggro as well as contributing to either keeping the group healthy, or the mob dead. Not that that'sa  bad thing. Previously, the hybrid would most likely have had to conserve the vast majoirty of his mana for aggro, so would not be adding much else to the group. The last  sentence there, I have no experience with, so I'll freely admit I'm just speculating.<br />
<br />
The fact is, because of the far higher increase in mana regen, as well as increase in damage and lowering of mana cost, hybrids, along with all the other casters, are able to generate far, far higher amounts of aggro thasn ever before. <br />
<br />
The tripling of mana regen, lowing of cost and increase in damage means that say, ice comet, can now be casted instead of say once every 3 minutes, once every minute, and 3 comets were as effect as 4 comets before focus effects.<br />
<br />
no, I'm not being ridiculous, the fact remains that due to the increase in mana regen, with the addition of focus effects, itemization, flowing thought, and new spells, hybrids are capable of generating many times the aggro that they used to be.<br />
<br />
Warriors have not shared in that vast increase.</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to troll you.  Your glaring lack of attention to facts screams out for a response.  So a spell that was introduced with Luclin is a new spell?  Are you kidding me?  You realize Luclin was released in the latter part of 2001 don't you.  You might as well call the blade of carnage a new weapon.  <br />
<br />
Look you are flat out wrong about mana regen being important to cast a 15 mana spell or a 35 mana spell.  With 2000 mana (which is very low as far as mana goes)  you could cast a 40 mana spell 50 times and this is with 0 mana regen.  <br />
<br />
I did indeed respond to your arguments about warriors having snap aggro just like other people did.  You seem to have ignored my post though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, the fact that he COULD cast stun 40 times is meaningless, if he only HAS to cast it twice.<br />

And you're right: warriors wouldn't want that, because they want it all for themselves!! Possibly a self-ability virtue too, CH etc... there's no end to their egotisitc bickering. With the exception of Brutul who makes a lot of sense. :p <br />
 <br />
<br />
Well, the thing I've noticed in my trips to TSW's forums, is that the more level-headed posters tend to be drowned out by the rest.  Yes, Brutal's posts are always a good read, as are Tugurok's.  Unfortuneatly, Furor and his wannabes have a great deal of weight there; meaning that, to use examples, Brutal has a hard time due to Furor's hatred of test server folks, and Tugurok<br />
 is by in large ignored by virtue of not being in the very high end game.<br />
<br />
What you have to realize is that, although we have plenty of morons here at SK.org, when the heavyweights step in and say something on a matter folks will tend to listen up and cease spouting useless drivel (or else said drivel will be ignored rather than start the bandwagon effect you see a deal of at TSW).  Our more respected members have earned the right to be listened to by always putting their money where their mouth is, and generally have the good grace to back up a critic when proven wrong.  You don't see Brael (to single 1 out)shouting for devs to do X; you see Brael make a suggestion and back it up with rationale and/or data.</div></div><hr />

The taunt skill has been improved at least two times since Kunark came out and currently works pretty well in my experience.  Warrior weapon agro solutions, while not ideal, have improved significantly.  The taunt gap decreased but not as much as you'd like.</div></div><hr />

After all, they have 5k mana pools, they can cast a 100 mana spell 50 times before going OOM, so mana regen doesn't matter at all, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u213"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p213">Daemonwynd, please... you arent even looking at this right, and the fact that you're using Paladin spells to justify my aggro (if you didn't notice were SK's not Paladins) just makes your posistion worse.<br />
<br />
Let's do the real math.  Just like you im going to go from one extreme to the other.<br />
<br />
Early Velious:<br />
Disease Cloud<br />
10 mana<br />
1.5 cast 6 recast<br />
Raid buffed, C2 only.  No beastlords then and no ae manasong, also no PotG/PotN.  11 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
I could cast Disease Cloud forever and have all other mana in my manapool reserved for damage (not to mention I only had to cast it once a minute at most to hold aggro easily and have to chain current spells).<br />
<br />
Current:<br />
Fear<br />
40 mana (32 with my focus)<br />
1.8 cast 7 recast<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
20 mana (16 with my focus)<br />
1.8 cast 4 recast<br />
<br />
Raid buffed, VoQ, SD, song, PotN, ft15, Body/Mind, for a total of 74/tick.<br />
<br />
Wow, suprisingly I can still cast forever except now out of that 74/tick im spending 48 of it on aggro (2/3) compared to originally only needing to spend 10/minute or 1/11 of my mana on it.  Also keep in mind chaining my aggro spells means I can't do other things, when I use other spells like Aura of Hate, Zev's Bite, etc in groups I need to be sure I have enough aggro so I wont lose it when casting those spells, which believe it or not, can happen espically in raids when lazy casters unload non stop and rogues suddenly decide they shouldnt evade because I'm tanking.<br />
<br />
Also, you're forgetting recast times on Paladin spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u216"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p216">Okay, again I repeat.  Shammy's have a problem with Warrior MAs because they have no aggro control spells.<br />
<br />
Lets compare the tools available to Shammy's and Enchanters as slowers:<br />
<br />
Shammy's:  Best Slow, Low Aggro Resist Debuff (compared to TasH), Disease based Slow, AE slow, root, Spell Casting Subtlety<br />
Chanter's: 2nd Best Slow, High Aggro Resist Debuff, Boggle, Memblur, Word of Morrell, Rune, Horrifying Visage, Spell Casting Subtlety, root, Trickster's<br />
<br />
Now what's happened is that in most zones the reduced need for Crowd Control has made these 2 classes in essence equivalent from a slowing perspective.  Long lasting buffs and AA + item effects give very long times between buff cycles (KEI with SCR3 + SCRM +8th Shawl = about 4 hours of KEI).  So its now mostly about what classes can do what on each pull.  Its pretty easy to see that a chanter has more tools to work with than a shammy does in terms of aggro control.  So after a slow Shammy's get pounded on more and therefore want Pally/SK MAs for their xp groups.<br />
<br />
So, what?  If I were a warrior, I would make friends with an Enchanter and group with him often.<br />
<br />
You know what I prefer Clerics as healers.  Nerf them!  But I have druid healers all the time.  I think that what annoys Warriors is that people will look for SKs and Pallys first.  The Slower has the opportunity to reject the MA and some Shammy's and Enchanter's do reject Warrior MAs.  Its from their own lack of capability, not a lack from the Warrior perspective.<br />
<br />
Now, I can not imagine that the GL of FoH is worried about BoT pickup groupings.  My GL is a Warrior and we guild group all the time with him as an MA.  We are a small guild and have more Warrior MAs than the sum of Pallys and SKs together.  We do fine xp groups with chain pulling.  So, what is the problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>DConquest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">SKs ability to hold aggro with spells have deceased since before Kunark with a few major spell nerfs.  Our ability to get aggro with just DPS has increased.  All our improved mana regen and spells do is help us put out more DPS, Emergency patch heal ourselfs, and add a little hp / mana / dps to our groups.  As noted many times, this is due to the fact that with every expansion we gain relative power due to new spells.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Warrior itemization has become MUCH better as of late.   Though this has only been a &quot; bandage fix &quot;, the Warrior has more aggro specific weaponary at every stage of the game than ever before.  <br />
<br />
Tanks were never meant to have total aggro lock, else Monks wouldn't have FD, Rogues wouldn't have Evade, Rangers jolt, Wizards Concussions,  Clerics DA, etc etc.  I think that's the biggest issue since Knights have been finally balanced to be viable tanks.   <br />
<br />
We've always had the ability to hold almost flawless aggro, but who cared before PoP... We had about equal tanking ability to Rangers and inferior to Monks.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">Brael, I was using Paladin spells as an example for what's symptomatic of the hybrids as a whole, because those are the ones I know more about.<br />
<br />
Am I forgetting about recast times? No. Notice how I said, &quot;were it possible&quot;, and that I specifically stated that I was taking extremes to get my point across. I believe realistic numbers would show closer to pure caster values, at 3-4 times the aggro generation capabilities of early velious, which warriors STILL don't share.<br />
<br />
Remember, hybrids aren't the only ones that have shared in this aggro generation, it's casters as well that are able to generate far higher amounts of hate due to the higher regen, mana pres, horses, focus effects, and new spells. Meanwhile, warriors have not had a matching increase in THEIR abilities to generate aggro, so they are relatively speaking falling behind.<br />
<br />
Unless you can show me how warrior aggro as multipled by a factor of 4? Only the very highest of warriors with either dual EB and/or a BoW come close to that, as far as I'm concerned, and even that's not a 4x improvement, more like 2x to 3x max, even when taking into account the increased DPS aggro, which incidentally, hybrids share.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Ulreik Fellreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">One thing that keeps getting lost is that I, and I am pretty sure 99% of SK's, attempt to regain lost agro with the taunt button.  Sure, we have spells to build agro once we have it, and to cast when taunt fails, however Taunt is my number one tool for gaining agro back from the slower/healer/early nuker.<br />
<br />
The spells are used to aggrivate the mob that I have already gotten agro from, to achieve a &quot;lock&quot;  (bad term, people can and will take agro from me--wizzies going all out force me to cast more to compensate, for instance).  Normally, one taunt and one cast is more than enough for any mob, however--chain nukers aside.<br />
<br />
Warriors only have the taunt skill and their DPS to generate agro with, which is a slower route to the agro &quot;lock&quot;, for sure.  However, for me at least, I find the taunt skill to be much more effective than it is made out for re-gaining agro.<br />
<br />
Warriors just need a specific fix...a way to generate steady agro on a mob that they have already gained agro on.  Right now they are using procing weapons as a substitute for spells, but they need an AA that allows then to use a &quot;Overtaunt&quot; skill, on the same timer as regular taunt, to add &quot;x&quot; amount of hate.  That would solve everything, and should be what warriors are asking for.  There would be risk sure, but that's the cost of using the button...your regular taunt may not available.<br />
<br />
However, Warriors have made out so well for so many expansions in terms of guild status, xp group desireability, monopoly on raid tanking, and have so totally overshadowed the Knights for such an extended period, that I have a very hard time with the Warriors that cry &quot;nerf Knights&quot;, or &quot;we are the only true tanks&quot;.  I'd like to be more supportive of warriors in general, but frankly too many of them want a return to the bad old days of &quot;only one true tank&quot;.   And yeah, I played the game through that sorry period.<br />
<br />
Right now is fine.  This IS how the ShadowKnight class should be atm.  Powerful tanking, moderate damage, and one of the best agro capacity of the tanking classes, decent situational abilities.   I am still number 4 in my guild's MT line up, and will probably never get any higher--and that will remain true as long as we attempt content that is hard for us.<br />

<br />
So now you're fixating on a 100 mana spell which I just grabbed out of the air, and making a big deal about it. After you yourself said that mana regen doesn't matter cause you can cast a 40 mana spell 50 times with no mana regen. <br />
<br />
Riiiiight.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you how I can compare. See, whether the mana cost is 5 or 5000, the amount of times you can cast a spell in a given time period, is directly related to the amount of mana regen. a guy with 5 mana/tick regen will cast the 50 mana spell once per 10 ticks. The guy with 50 mana per tick will cast the 50 mana spell once per tick. Therein is my point. Whether the cost is 5 or 5000, when you triple your mana regen, you triple the amount of times you can cast that spell in the same time period without going oom. This is important when you're talking about sustaining a certain level over a period of time.<br />
<br />
I could very well change the spell in the comparison from say, Cease, to the higher level stuns. However, it really don't matter, because in either case, the paladin can cast several times as many stuns as before. Not only that, with using Cease, the paladin can keep 95% of his mana for healing purposes (which generates even more aggro), whereas previously, he wouldn't. It really doesn't matter, the end result is identical.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u224"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p224">Learn from history.  Furor is the largest prima donna to ever play the game, period.  Put all his comments into that perspective.<br />
<br />
Anyway onto useful matters:<br />
<br />
It is only in the realm of experience group tanking where there's any real &quot;competition&quot;, and therefore using a non-competitive environment to justify an unfair advantage where there's actually competition for the role is disingenuous. <br />
<br />
<br />
I largely (but not totally agree) with that.  The small amount of disagreement comes in the raid roll of MT is almost universal to raid encounters while ATing and the value of knight 'utility' varies greatly from very useful to irrelevent where MTing is almost always a necessity while the content is relevent to your force.  You CAN quite readily XP without an AT or supplemental healer, you can't raid without a MT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That being stated one should confine and value the power and utility of both classes within that role.  Speaking in relation to pal and warriors IS:<br />
<br />
The warriors ability to:<br />
- possess more HP<br />
- possess more AC<br />
- possess higher avoidance<br />
- possess higher melee DPS<br />
- avoid stuns via AA<br />
- AE Taunt<br />
- /shield<br />
- warcry<br />
- better taunt success rate<br />
- Defensive disc<br />
- auto rip<br />
- 100% BW at 300hp per<br />
- rampage<br />
- flurry<br />
- ingenuity<br />
<br />
roughly 'balanced' to:<br />
<br />
The paladins ability to:<br />
- generate fast and more secure aggro<br />
- heal single targets<br />
- heal groups<br />
- buffs<br />
- cures<br />
- rezes<br />
- roots<br />
- stuns to reduce mod dps/interrupts<br />
- fear immunity<br />
- slay undead (which places them near to war DPS)<br />
- sanctification<br />
<br />
The truth is although a fair portion of that warrior list may be seen as 'not terribly useful' for XP groups in the majority of situations the same can be said of the paladin list.  The BALANCE point is largely dependent on the content.  <br />
<br />
Lots of mobs that should be pulled fast, tanked fast, that are easily slowable/die fast and don't hit hard with no/little AE favor the paladin.  Toss stun immune/ barely slowable mobs in there, with some mobs that flurry or ramp, have nasty dd procs, trigger mobs/traps that spawn multiple mobs at once on the group and warriors are better.<br />
<br />
You can NOT claim to &quot;give up everything&quot; to obtain a GUARANTEED role in every single group/raid encounter in the game when the rewards from the alternative 'strength' (solo/duo) is almost completely IRRELEVENT to any measureable game rewards.   That is a FALSE sacrifice.  Any balance argument based on that premis is flawed.<br />
<br />
So the real issue is how to BALANCE the XP 'trash vs. boss' abilities of the tank classes.  At what point is the fast chain-pull tank abilities of knights balanced versus the sheer durability of warriors on the rare 'tough-named'?<br />
<br />
No amount of ill-reasoned whining resolves this question.  My expectation would be for a small improvement in warrior taunt abilities.  Namely a short-range plus hate ability added to their taunt skill so that *some* hate can be had on incoming and to make it somewhat easier to hold aggro.  This could come in form of another named ability with a fairly short range (~30ft) that adds ~300 hate that can not be activated while under a discipline with a modest refresh (10-15s).<br />
<br />
WHAT this does?<br />
<br />
A. increases a warriors aggro on mob incoming making debuffing time closer to that possible with knights.<br />
B. since it does not work under a discipline it would not further the ability of warriors to hold an exclusive edge on the tough group named mobs<br />
C. the timer allows for periodic reapplication to help maintain aggro during a fight<br />
D. the timer is such that the fast lockdown ATing knights perform on raids isn't overly usurped.<br />
<br />
<br />
This preserves some of the knight XP 'security' role while giving warriors the needed aggro while not impacting raids.<br />
<br />
Frankly, with the exception of tuning the precise amount of Hate and possibly small changes to range and resuse I believe this is the &quot;answer&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
But I also feel that from what I have read I have to post.  <br />
<br />
MOST warriors do NOT beleive that Knghts need Nerf'd.  What most warriors think is that BECAUSE OF AGGRO LOCK, and because the damage mitigation/AC/HP gap has been lessened ,  Knights are more desired than Warriors in XP Groups.....this is fact.  I am tired of hearing &quot;well if people just watch what they are doing, warriors can hold aggro jsut fine....etc, etc, etc&quot; becaue teh fact is PEOPLE DON'T WANT to watch what they are doing ...... they wanna be able to slow on inc, and start nuking teh bejeesus outta the mob immediately with no fear of gettign hit....... and  we all know with teh current state of teh warrior, this will NEVER happen.  To put it quite simply, choosing a warrior for the xp group in PoP means slowing down xp....and this is exactly what groups are trying to avoid.  <br />
<br />
Now, as far as Defensive You can talk /disc Defensive gives us an unfair advantage till your blue in the face, but that ability don't mean a thing in teh xp group...it is meant for raid and with the Big mobs hitting like they do SOMEONE has to have an ability like this in order to absorb the damage.<br />
<br />
Now...as far as what to do.  I beleive that warriors need a few things..<br />
<br />
1) Decrease the refresh on taunt.  This only makes sense, taunt fails we shouldn't have to wait 6 seconds to try again.<br />
<br />
2) Increase the effectiveness of taunt (instead of top of hate list +1 ..... top of hate list +100).  Also make it work 80% of the time instead of 60%.<br />
<br />
3) Hate modifier to our damage we do.  Make our blows piss off a mob a little more than other classes.  This still don't give us LOCK, but it greatly increaeses our ongoing aggro generating abilities.<br />
<br />
4) Itemization DOES need looked at.  A BP that is AC 65 STR +20, STA +20, WIS +10 INT +10 HP +100 Mana +100  IS MUCH more beneficial to Hybrids than to Warriors....but is likely just as much of an upgrade to the Pure melee as to teh Hybrid.  This needs fixed somehow, not sure exactly....maybe adjust the mana to HP for a warrior(this can be done with current game code.....the PoK Charm introduced changes for each class).<br />
<br />
Any way...just dropped a line to let you know that most warriors DON'T wan't Knights nerfed.....just a fair shot at the only group slot we can even conceivably fill.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think that the warrior issue would be more or less solved, as long as new toys in the form of new skills and disciplines were added to pure melees with each expansion, just as new spells are given to every caster in each expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">Daemonwynd: Hmm, I don't have any hard numbers on your aggro having gone up by a factor of 4 since I lack data which shows how much aggro 1 dps from a Warrior is worth.  However, I can make a fairly reasonable assumption that it has gone up based on other factors.  From what my guilds more intelligent Warriors are telling me procs make up approximatley 75-80% of your aggro with actual melee only doing the remainder of that.  With an EB proc every 8 seconds which is what they seem get from my observations of them seems to be the case (we only have 1 darkblade of the warlord we got the other day and one boc on a low attendence person so I haven't oberved those much) that would mean 87.5 aggro/sec for 3/4 of a Warriors aggro which would mean a total aggro of 116.5 aggro/sec, and a 3:1 dps:aggro ratio (I wonder if it's a coincidence that that ratio is the same as the original heal:hate ratio).  From that I could take your early Velious dps of 60 and conclude you only had 20 aggro/sec back then, so your aggro would be nearly 6x better now, and with top PoP weapons and a warrior BP, probally be pushing 7x better.  Unfortunatley though as I said I have no hard numbers so the best I can do is provide an educated guess on it which I'm sure you're going to tear apart.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">4) Itemization DOES need looked at. A BP that is AC 65 STR +20, STA +20, WIS +10 INT +10 HP +100 Mana +100 IS MUCH more beneficial to Hybrids than to Warriors....but is likely just as much of an upgrade to the Pure melee as to teh Hybrid. This needs fixed somehow, not sure exactly....maybe adjust the mana to HP for a warrior(this can be done with current game code.....the PoK Charm introduced changes for each class). <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, that is only partly true.<br />
<br />
For example, take pure ATK gear.  A War does X dps, a Pal does 0.75X, if Y ATK increases your dps by 10% a warr has received a 0.1 X increase in DPS, while the paladin received 0.075X dps.  In essence what it does is preserve the RATIO of the classes balance.<br />
<br />
Placing mana or focus on an item does the same thing.  IF to make up for some pure off/def difference a knight has to use spells then IF there is an upgrade that upgrade should upgrade BOTH of those partial elements in order to maintain parity.  It is also important to remember that knights can not use that mana with anywhere near the efficiency of clerics/necros.<br />
<br />
So as tanking, dps, etc increase so must the spell-casting power of the knights.  To do otherwise would result in the following: either A. they select PURE hp items and can tank, B. go towards casting items and suffer losses in tanking BEYOND that which has been established by class skills.<br />
<br />
Note that War get more HP than knights on PoP charm.  That is FINE.  But also note that other pure melee do not get more than knights.  The variable HP was placed on the charms as to not skew class balance hp wise further between all clases and not soley war/knight<br />
<br />
An IMPORANT point of note:<br />
<br />
I think the BASE HP of all classes should be CLOSER than they are, but that ITEM/BUFF hp should scale by class on ALL items.  Just like you see damage (damage) on Rec level items.  Items should have base (your class) hp/mana.  That is the ONLY way to finally resolve the scalability problem that occurs EVERY expansion as people gear up on the uber all/all items.  I find the PE/PD method of adding hp to melee/tanks to be clumsy and patchwork at best.<br />
<br />
That being said I do NOT think war should have massive benefits in HP over knights.  Again, I think you balance utility with utility, not make up for utility via even more power.</div></div><hr />

Yes and yes.  Furor should have used some precious personal conviction and actually quit the game.  He's gotten to the point where nothing comes out of his mouth but childish drivel.<br />

SW seems to forget when the shoe was on the other foot.  At the beginnning of EQ until late luclin SKs were gimps.  The old timers would agree.  The only way we could get a group is if either we had friends there or there was no one else around.  I was in a lot of guilds where I was the &quot;token&quot; SK.  <br />

Besides I do not think that SW represents the opinion of the majority of warriors.  Time to file SW away with the Druid's Grove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Taking your own numbers of a proc every 8 seconds for 3/4 of thee warriors aggro, with the best aggro weapon in the game in Velious, a BoC,  procs would be 87.5 aggro per second. (700hate/8 seconds). In Velious.<br />
<br />
Halving the DPS would allow for a possibly 100 aggro per second using a BoC.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the hate increase using your own numbers, is maybe 20%, while hybrids/casters have had a 300% increase.<br />
<br />
I've heard BoC doesn't proc very often. My own experiences with it are neutral. Don't proc a lot, and doesn't proc rarely either. So even halving that, is 65 or so aggro per second, DPS included, for a total of doubling in aggro for warriors, while hybrid/caster aggro triples or quads.<br />
<br />
That's a significant change in aggro balance.<br />
<br />
By the way, the original heal to hate ratio was 1 to 1. They changed in in velious to 3:2. Dunno if they changed it since.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget all those warriors that aren't lucky enough to be in a high end raiding guild and don't have access to the awesome damage, wicked aggro proc weapons. Hybrids have their aggro generation capabilities innately. Non well equipped warriors have even a worse gap relative to hybrids than the well equipped ones do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u233"><b>Dragantis Xy`Rath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p233">I didn't read all this BS and if some one here mentioned this already, oh well. I read an idea a while back that really sounds good to me. In order to help balance warriors they could put in battle stances for them. Offensive (non tanking situations) and defensive (tanking). When in the offensive stance they could deal a very respectable amount of damage, at the cost of taking more damage when they do get hit. Vice versa for defensive. The have disciplines exactly like this already, however these effects would be diminished compared to thier discipline counterparts, while giving them distinct advantages in both categories. <br />
<br />
Offensive would allow them to reach near monk DPS potential when they are not tanking, forcing them to control thier agro. While when they are deffensive they can really take the hits, but can't focus on the fight well enough to deal as much damage. <br />
<br />
When I think about a warrior and what it would mean to be one, I see focus, discipline, and skill. If you think about it this is great from a role playing point of view as well as balance. A warrior is someone who focuses all of his mind and energy on one thing, fighting. They should be able to deal damage on par with monks and be able to take the hits better than any one else...just not both at the same time.<br />
<br />
If something like this was implemented I think the disciplines should be removed and changed to something that would either enhance the stances, or something to compliment thier agro skills. <br />
<br />
Change offensive discipline to Evade and Counter:<br />
When this discipline is active the warrior can go full out in combat while not having to worry about stealing agro. I won't go into use and re-use times, because I am not a developer and I don't want to try and balance it myself.<br />
<br />
Replace defensive discipline with Dirty Fighthing:<br />
When this discipline is active the warrior uses every trick in the book (short of momma jokes) to gain the attention of the creature he is engaged with, giving him the ability to hold better agro.<br />
<br />
This would allow them to use both stances and disciplines in a manner that would compliment each other, while not making it so powerful that no one else could take thier place.<br />
<br />
These ideas are rough and probably have flaws that I didn't notice, but hey...its just a thought after all.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I am curious who was tanking then. A warrior?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Yes, thank you for re-reading the post, that was on the back and with 2 dots focus'd.Not just the GBoC.<br />
<br />
To answer you question yes, i dps like that with a warrior as the tank, ( he doesnt bitch and whine to much about his aggro ) and he holds it pretty well with my VoT cast on him useing BoW and the range slot from Saryn. ( PoTime ) The imbue proc/stun he also has very high almost max aa's.Thus i believe your point was, that indeed a warrior can hold aggro well.<br />
<br />
  Breal, i see what your saying about being mana effeciant as far as the clinging vs. the festering but you did say the very reason i use festering over clinging: 1.The casting time its not much of a diff but i prefer a quick cast snare over the slightly longer cast of the other because when i want aggro its mainly cause we have adds or something has gone wrong, i have only seconds to rectify it in say a &quot;hard&quot; LDoN adventure.Im not usually worrid about having aggro in a group, so i dont need to cast it to much just once in the begining of the fight.Now the other reason you didnt mention is 2. Duration for any reason i dont want to have to worry about it dropping and the mob running.Such as Ruj the fuckin goblins take off then your just sitting waiting for a train of 500 to return.With these 2 main reasons and the actual dps increase of 10-11 over Clinging which is basically 0. Making it worth  the extra mana to me.I dont hurt on mana to much when im in a group with C5. ( if i have a bard never worrid about it ) Generally my groups do a &quot;normal&quot; adventure in less then 30 mins so we go all out on dps/spears sure im near 20m or less when that 30-35 mins is up if i go crazy with spears and taps, but there is a downtime of 10-15 after finishing a adventure this fast on the refresh to get a new one.By then im FM.But as for just casting one BoH and Festering i can do that almost all day with a C5.As for the fights being quick yes they werent lengthy but last night i even rechecked my parsings and did it again for over 2 hours ( on the back of the mob ) i was averaging 190 - 210+ with just my blade and SoV/self attack buffs, but there was a bard in my group during this set of parsings.These mobs die fairly fast with our dps but not fast enough that it would taint the general dps parsing.Again i checked the pet on &quot;normal&quot; averaging 35+ dps always sometimes a good 40+ if i kept him on the back of the mob with SoV and even NDT ;)  But even with our normal haste only 65% he was doing a solid 35.<br />
<br />
  As for the warriors, there a buncha fuckin cry babies asking us to be nerfed, almost even demanding it. I want them to get upgrades and think they deserve them. But not at our expense and having us nerfed down so they can feel like there a better &quot;tank&quot; in there present state.<br />

<br />
To give you an idea of the numbers involved for SK's, 600 hate for 60 mana now, mana pres makes it 54 mana, terror of thule makes it 672hate. Yeah, I know, you don't use the direct hate spells, I'm using the direct hate ones to give exact numbers to get the point across more clearly. I'm sure the ones you do use would translate to be approximately the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
672hate/54 mana focused<br />
in velious it was 550hate, 51 mana. (no focus back then)<br />
<br />
mana regen now - call it 74.<br />
velious - 28.<br />
<br />
That means SK's are able to sustain aggro of  920/tick now, OR 153aggro per second with spells alone,  IF their only limiting factor was mana. due to refresh, the SK would have to use his other hate spell as well, thankfully, it's the same ratio so it's not going to mess up the numbers much.<br />
<br />
IN velious, with the mana regen limitation, SK's could sustain no more than 300 hate per tick, or 50 aggro per second.<br />
<br />
Thats a increase of approximately THREE TIMES what was sustainable in Velious.</div></div><hr />

So now you're fixating on a 100 mana spell which I just grabbed out of the air, and making a big deal about it. After you yourself said that mana regen doesn't matter cause you can cast a 40 mana spell 50 times with no mana regen. <br />
<br />
Riiiiight.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you how I can compare. See, whether the mana cost is 5 or 5000, the amount of times you can cast a spell in a given time period, is directly related to the amount of mana regen. a guy with 5 mana/tick regen will cast the 50 mana spell once per 10 ticks. The guy with 50 mana per tick will cast the 50 mana spell once per tick. Therein is my point. Whether the cost is 5 or 5000, when you triple your mana regen, you triple the amount of times you can cast that spell in the same time period without going oom. This is important when you're talking about sustaining a certain level over a period of time.<br />
<br />
I could very well change the spell in the comparison from say, Cease, to the higher level stuns. However, it really don't matter, because in either case, the paladin can cast several times as many stuns as before. Not only that, with using Cease, the paladin can keep 95% of his mana for healing purposes (which generates even more aggro), whereas previously, he wouldn't. It really doesn't matter, the end result is identical.<br />
<br />
This really isn't too hard to understand, Thuggo.<br />

<br />
Thuggo, here, is only interested in picking apart tiny details of what I say, instead of responding in substance, or adding anything to the thread. That, is a troll.  <br />
<br />
Oh my god where to begin on this.  If you have no reason to substatiate a 100 mana spell then you shouldn't have said it.  If you are just making up numbers why are you using them as support for your arguments?  I pointed out that casters at your level are not using 100 mana spells.  They are using spells which cost considerably more mana.  If you want to argue about something use real facts not made up numbers.<br />
<br />
What you seem to fail to grasp is there is mana regen and a mana pool.  You also completely fail to take into account recast times.  A person with 5 mana regen a tick casting a 50 mana spell will not cast it every 10 tic's.  Unless he has run oom and is purely depending on his mana regen to cast it.<br />
<br />
On a raid encounter I don't care if I'm oom at the end of the fight.  I don't even care if my mana is decreasing the whole fight.  In fact it should be, then I'm making the best use of my mana pool.  <br />
<br />
If you want to talk about aggro spells then, fine.  Fear is 36 mana (for me), 1.9 sec cast (for me), with a 7 second recast.  This means at best I can cast this every 8.9, secondes more likely I can cast this every 10 seconds if need be.  The important factor about it is the fact that it's 36 mana.  36 mana is nothing.  Mana regen is far more important for spells that have a high mana cost  And need to be cast a lot.  Which you never talked about.  Yes mana regen helps a lot for other spells but it counts for nothing on aggro spells.  All those people here saying that SK aggro is less now than what it used to be are right, you should listen to them.<br />
<br />
BTW stop with Cease already.  Go to the paladin boards if you want to talk about it.  I&quot;m sure they will be happy to talk with you about a spell that is almost 2 years old now.<br />
<br />
*edit subtracted 8 instead of 4 for focus effects.  Woops.  Corrected it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people are saying that the aggro gap between knights and warriors has grown since velious. Besides being totally irrelevant towards balance (A shadowknight can easily hold aggro for an entire fight with ONE cast of an aggro spell. I usually use 3 just to be safe. Any more is just plain excessive.), this is completely, undeniably false. Let's look at some raw numbers to demonstrate this fact. If you dispute my DPS figures, feel free to provide parses and comparisons from that period yourself. First we'll look at warriors:<br />
<br />
Early Velious:<br />
Low end L60 warrior - 30 to 40 DPS<br />
High end L60 warrior - 50 to 60 DPS<br />
No real aggro proc tools to mention. No aggro buffs. No rightclick proc buffs. Snare glands didn't exist yet either. (Yes, I know these were nerfed so that you actually have to farm them if you want to use them, but they're still immensely useful in raid situations.)<br />
<br />
Late PoP:<br />
Low end L60 warrior - 90 to 100 DPS<br />
High end L60 warrior - 150 to 200 DPS<br />
<br />
Instantly you can see just from DPS increasing, the warrior's aggro factor has increased by about 3x on average. This balances out the fact that caster mana regen and DPS potential has also increased by a similar margin. So no, there is no greater gap between warriors and caster aggro in general here.<br />
<br />
However, even more additions were made:<br />
AE Taunt. This doesn't really give &quot;hate&quot; per se, but it's worth a mention.<br />
Aggro procing weapons. Initially they were for &quot;uber&quot; people only, but now, in late PoP, they are extremely common and anyone with 20k can dualwield weapons with decent hate procs. Or get a greatstaff of thunder for even less. On the high end you have a Blade of War which is so undeniably superior in aggro factor to anything before that it's just ridiculous. Easily 6x the aggro of an early Velious warrior.<br />
Aggro buffs. Yes, these do count to some degree. Both shadowknights and enchanters can buff warrior hate significantly. However, I won't include them in my figures since we're relying on solo warrior hate here.<br />
Rightclick proc buffs. Applicable to high end warriors only, of course. These still increase hate a good deal.<br />
PoTime BP. Due to the extreme high end and rare nature of this item, I'm not going to include it in calculations, but it's still 15% extra aggro.<br />
<br />
At this point we're looking at about 4x early velious hate generation for the &quot;low end&quot; warriors, 7x for the &quot;high end&quot;, and about 9x for the &quot;top end&quot;. This is totally unassisted hate generation. Add in aggro buffs and you're going into the 11x+ range.<br />
<br />
Now, let us look at Shadowknights.<br />
For the sake of realism, I'm not going to be including everything an SK can do to maximize hate, because no one in their right mind would bother. I will, however, look at a practical scenario where an SK is just meleeing and casting a hate spell or two once a fight, and then a scenario where an SK is going all-out aggro.<br />
<br />
SK melee DPS improved by a similar ratio as Warrior melee DPS did. Let's say 3x.<br />
<br />
Okay, so, SK's are doing about 3x melee aggro. This figure is basically irrelevant, since SK's can tank with attack off and still out-aggro a chain nuking wizard, be it early velious or late PoP. But, regardless...<br />
<br />
In early velious, we had 2 main taunt spells: Disease Cloud and Shadow Vortex. Shroud of Pain was sometimes pulled out as well in mezzable mob situations. I'm going to ignore it because it's not very efficient. Let's look at mana usage, and recast times for these spells.<br />
<br />
Disease Cloud:<br />
10 mana<br />
1.5 cast time<br />
6 recast time<br />
<br />
Shadow Vortex:<br />
40 mana<br />
1.5 cast time<br />
6 recast time<br />
<br />
Generic spell recovery time is 2.25 seconds. Allowing for lag, it's more like 2.5 seconds. Now, an SK chain casting these 2 spells will be getting off one taunt spell every 4 seconds. Or, 1.5 per tick. The mana use averages out to 37.5 per tick. Okay, now we have an upper end figure for needed mana regen. Realistically, an SK with clarity 2 will have 12 mana/tick (11 + 1 from standing regen). Thus, yes, including Shadow Vortex in the chain would cause the SK to...eventually...run out of mana. However, no class in the game would be able to pull the mob off the SK short of someone using their taunt button, and that would only last until the next aggro spell landed. Yes, SK aggro was THAT strong. If the SK gets any med time between fights, they could very likely hold that until the encounter in question ended, be it an exp group or a raid. Med breaks were somewhat common at this stage of the game, so it's not really an issue.<br />
<br />
More realistic (but still not practical) is looking at just disease cloud chaincasted.<br />
<br />
An sk will be able to cast one disease cloud every 7.5 seconds. This is 8 mana per tick. Clarity 2 more than covers it. No medbreaks required, SK holds aggro that even a chain slowing shaman can't pull off.<br />
<br />
Practically speaking, an SK would only cast one disease cloud every minute or so. Sometimes 2. We'll go with 2. One disease cloud every 30 seconds is a massive 2 mana/tick. Sitting between combat rounds with no mana regen at all was sufficient to hold this kind of casting.<br />
<br />
Thus, assuming your actual argument is a shadowknight's ability to hold aggro, NOT get 50,000 more hate than anyone else has on the mob, an SK of the early velious variety (and before) only needed 2 mana/tick to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
If your argument really is a shadowknight's ability to get excessive amounts of hate, then maximum hate generation WAS achievable at the time, it just took some extra effort on mana regen.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at modern day EQ.<br />
In a typical scenario a non-uber Shadowknight will have Voice of Quellious and Mental Corruption up for mana regen. This comes to something like 30 to 40 mana/tick, depending on how much MC feels like procing at the time. FT and/or focus effects are highly variable. Personally, being a (somewhat recent) elemental SK, I do not have any FT items or relevant focus effects. This is a choice I made myself because I focus on my ability to tank/pull, not regen mana or do damage. An extremely high end SK may not even bother to use Mental Corruption because they have sufficient mana regen without it, and instead use Shroud of Chaos, so their mana regen figure will still be in the 40 mana/tick range. But, maximum mana regen for a shadowknight w/ VoQ is somewhere around 55-60/tick. Now, let's look at the tools a Shadowknight typically uses these days:<br />
<br />
Fear<br />
40 mana<br />
1.8 cast time<br />
7 recast time<br />
<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
20 mana<br />
1.8 cast time<br />
4 recast time<br />
<br />
Both Shadow Vortex and Disease Cloud are totally useless for aggro now, due to the random and unintentional nerfing of them. Terror spells are useless because they give less than half the hate of the normal aggro spells, unless of course a mob is not immune to fear and is mezzable... which, for me, never happens. Virtually every mob I fight is at least level 60. Thus, Fear + Clinging darkness is the perfect aggro combo now. Note that Fear causes slightly less aggro than CD, but not much.<br />
<br />
Note that chaining both spells is pointless, as CD's low recast time lets it be recast basically immediately. I won't bother to include a figure for that.<br />
<br />
Chaining Clinging Darkness gives us 1 CD every 5.8 seconds, or basically 1 per tick. This is 20 mana/tick. Due to the higher mana cost and lower recast time than Disease Cloud, this would very very slowly run an early velious SK with C2 out of mana. This would have been easy to hold with very slight med breaks, however. CD's aggro factor is slightly lower than pre-nerf disease cloud. End result? Well, overall aggro output is about the same as chaining pre-nerf disease cloud. No real change here from early Velious to late PoP.<br />
<br />
Chaining Fear is somewhat pathetic for aggro, comparatively. 1 Fear every 7.8 seconds. This is 30 mana/tick. Fear is also less aggro than CD. Shadowknight loses aggro output significantly here, compared to chaining shadow vortex.<br />
<br />
Casting 2 CD's per minute (fairly average these days) is 4 mana/tick. Still easily held by our early velious SK. This is also slightly less aggro than casting 2 DC's per minute was.<br />
<br />
I think I've made my point by now. If you bother to look over the facts here, SK spell aggro output has not increased at all from early Velious to late PoP, in fact in some cases it has decreased. However, I will admit that paladins have gained slight ground by getting Cease...but we are not paladins.<br />
<br />
So, relative to warriors, SK aggro output has LOST GROUND. At best, it's in roughly the same place as it used to be. Recall my earlier figures for warriors? Warrior total aggro output, ignoring the increase from melee DPS, has at least increased by 1.5x due to aggro procing weapons being extremely commonly available now.<br />
<br />
If you still want to debate this at this point, you are really grasping for straws now. Oh, and to make my position clear, I fully support giving warriors some kind of snap aggro ability and perhaps some moderate utility. NOTHING that affects raiding, however. Raiding balance is fine as it is.<br />

AoW was finally beat legitmatley the last day of Velious) sorry, you're saying early Velious so you get comparisons from early Velious, since then your aggro has grown tons.  Also you are only comparing one weapon, I was comparing to dual EB weapons, in early Luclin since you seem to be so intent on moving the discussion to there now so you can use EB weapons you would have a SoD/BoC combo.  No set value on the amount SoD's add however so that can't be counted, the next step up would be a bloodfrenzy/hategiver combo which is what I was using in the comparison, in Luclin with the high ac of mobs your melee dps was lower but the majority of your aggro was still there, with pop you got lower ac mobs again and more weapons with better damage and aggro providing more increases... already laid out the proof that the gap has decreased, I dont know why you want to deny this.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, the original heal aggro was not 1:1, the 1:1 ratio is what heal aggro was after the first heal aggro change went in with Velious, approx 2.5 weeks into the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Laronx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">A lot of good stuff being said on the threads here, TSW and the Whineable, and a lot of bullshit and mudslinging too. One thing that keeps popping up is itemization. I think it's valid, and I'll do my best to explain why.<br />
<br />
First, lets look at the meaqning of hybrid. That should mean a combination of two classes in some capacity, but not necessarily in equal amounts. This is what knights were supposed to be, but that really didnt turn out to be the case. Instead of using a formula where they should have taken say 50% cleric, 50% warrior, or even 70% warrior 30% cleric, whatever, as long as the end result is 100%, they have something that probably adds up to 120%, let me try to explain.<br />
<br />
Ideally, a hybrid should be able to pick which side of his origins he wants to be strong in, i.e., do I want to a tank that casts a little, or do I want to be a caster that can tank in a crisis, or just a middle of the road both. There should be (and has been to some extent in the past) a marked difference in these choices, however that difference has eroded bit by bit, to the point where most high end sk's can tank almost anything and never go out of mana doing it. But that has been the natural progression of the game. I will give an example:<br />
<br />
The worst thing that contributed to this was making clerics a plate class. What does a cleric need first and foremost? Wisdom. Right off the start the paladin has an advantage, he can get plate armor with the same ac as the warrior, and it has the same wisdom as the cleric, he is getting the same benefit from it as both of his parent classes, IMO this breaks &quot;hybrid&quot; from the start. Take the sk on the other hand. Any sk thats played long enough will tell you how difficult it was to get good plate items that had decent intelligence on them. This is because only one half of our parents were a plate class. If you really wanted to get some decent int items, chances were you suffered in the ac/hp dept. This difference between paladin and sk's doesn't go unnoticed though, unfortunately they addressed it the wrong way, instead of scaling down pallies, they scale sk's up. <br />
<br />
Somewhere along the way, casters get retuned, mana now rules all for everything, melee gets tuned a little, and hybrids are benefitting from it all of it. Casters and hybrids have gotten better, while melee has stayed relatively the same, thats just a fact, and something definately needs to be done about it.<br />
<br />
But what?<br />
<br />
Well, nerfing knights is just retarded on so many levels. Let's start this argument here, the &quot;no one wants a warrior for a group&quot;. Why is that? It's because they don't feel that warriors can do the job they want them to. So who can? Knights can, and pretty well. The warriors see this, and immediately try to dissect why, pointing out where we have it better than them, and even though they won't admit it, they are jealous. So, who can blame them for wanting us gone? If we weren't there, they'd be the ones tankin, right? No, I don't think so, I think even if you took knights completely out of the game, it wouldn't happen. I would bet cold hard cash that more of these suddenly open xp group tank slots would be filled with beastlords and their warders more than with warriors. and it's sad but you know I'm right. This needs fixed.<br />
<br />
Right now balance wise, I think that knights and casters are pretty well balnced to each other. As far as nerfing goes, you would have to nerf at least 2 classes, possibly 3, just to fix one, and I don't think that's gonna happen. It doesn't matter anyway, no one needs nerfed, warriors need fixed. I think you guys would be fools to even settle for a nerf to any other class and then be told &quot;There ya go, you're fixed&quot;. Stick to your guns guys, get your class fixed, you'll find you have more support among classes that really would like to see you get fixed if you stop calling for nerfs. I'm sure most shadowknights agree that it sucks to be a warrior right now.</div></div><hr />

4) Itemization DOES need looked at.  A BP that is AC 65 STR +20, STA +20, WIS +10 INT +10 HP +100 Mana +100  IS MUCH more beneficial to Hybrids than to Warriors...<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
uhmm, no.<br />
<br />
At least not in the higher game.  We have all our stats already maxed (after buffs).  Mana is good as it is.  All that counts is AC,HP, and resists, same for us as for the warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Space</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">All i will say and put it simply.<br />
They gave shms/druid imcomplete ch's so people werent heavily reliant on clerics.<br />
<br />
They gave sk/pal ability to tank in reach of warriors so people weren't dependent on warriors.<br />
<br />
It's as simple as that they are blurring the class lines so its easier to form exp groups and guilds dont have to have an uber warrior to do a mob, war defensive is just a lift them above knights benefit to help them in raids, more of a margin for error on the healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Thuggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Trying to define knights, rangers, or beastlords as %'s of other classes isn't really valid anymore.  I would just rather be labeled as a Shadow Knight instead of a hybrid between warriors and necro's.  That line of thinking gave us incredibly underpowered spells for too long and made us 1 armed warriors with crappy hp and defense.<br />
<br />
Warriors do need something but it's not a snap aggro ability, it's not more aa's, it's not to have knights removed from loot that they want, and it's not a removal of disciplines.  I honestly believe that a lot of warriors are making a mountain out of well not a molehill but more like a small hillock.  They have just complained for so loud and for so long that people are believing them when the say they are weaklings.<br />
<br />
I will agree that certain things need to be changed.  The Darkblade of the warlord is a slap in the face and so is /shield.  I also agree that something is wrong with taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">One more thing....this is a ShadowKnight board. Forget Pally issues...take them to a Paladin forum please. The two classes are not the same. In fact we are entirely different. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is an EQ discussion board.  Warriors have posted here.  Clerics have posted here.  My post was non-inflamatory and a pertinent address of the ISSUES involved on the matter of balacing a warrior and a hybrid tank.  Add the list of SK abilities to that list if you wish.  I am not as familiar with them as I would deem necessary to do so myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, seems for the most part Warriors have gone from &quot; only needing a small aggro boost &quot;, to nerf knights. Is that really the way to class balance? ( This starts as a Fan Faire post, then explodes into a nerf Knights marathon ) <br />
<br />
<br />
The INITIAL post of the thread.   Seems to indicate an issue that extends beyond the SK class in a vacuum or even SKs in relation to merely warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter how they try to slice it, a warrior&gt;a knight with no mana by far.  <br />
<br />
If knights are supposed to be balanced against casters/priests now, guess they need nerfing too right? <br />
<br />
What in the hell?? This guy doesn't want to fix warriors, he wants to retire knights. <br />
<br />
The thing that pisses me off the most is how sk get lumped into the knight category with the pallies, where i can see how a paly may be a bit too strong for their own good, i really fail to see the logic in nerfing sk, after all the only thing we have over a warrior is taunt, and since warrior taunt is getting boosted warriors should really have no other quarels with us. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think for one moment this issue/rebalancing is going to be made based solely upon what SKs think of SKs and warriors alone you are highly delusional. <br />
<br />
Good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Alright, brael, point taken.<br />
<br />
I'll drop the BoC.<br />
<br />
Instead, I'll go with Willsapper/Frostbringer, which, back in its day, was good aggro, when taken as a combo. Or, Gauladrek, Sword of the Sky. Also good aggro.<br />
<br />
No, even without a BoC, there was still some quality aggro weapons to be found in Velious.<br />
<br />
The gap hasn't shrunk, I don't see how you can be blind to the raw numbers that show just how much of a difference there is.</div></div><hr />
