<br />
I've just started a new character, an ogre SK of Rallos Zek, on Firiona Vie.  I'll be role-playing, and I want to spend time hunting up on the moon.  In which cities will I be non-KoS?  Do any offer SK training?<br />
<br />
I'm not interested in improving faction to become non-KoS - I'll just add those folks to my list &quot;to be killed when I'm experienced enough&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skoriksis</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shar Vahl and Shadow Haven for sure. You'll have to do a little faction work (easy quests) in Shadow Haven. The Bazaar is also easy to use.<br />
<br />
You can also do some banking in Fungus Grove, and the SK trainers in Echo Caverns.<br />
<br />
Avoid Katta Castellum and Sanctus Seru, as you will be KoS in those 2 cities. While you might survive zoning into Katta, zoning into Seru is hazardous to your health.</div></div><hr />

Merchants in the bazaar will buy/sell, most merchants in shadowhaven will not.  I haven't done any quests in an attempt to see if I can improve SH faction.  Don't really see the need at present.<br />
<br />
No problems in Shar Vahl, either.  In fact, I killed so many Loda Kai while trying to get a suit of that cool blue chain armor that I'm amiable with SV guards.  Don't know about any other cities on the moon though.<br />
<br />
I figure Iksars have it worse than anyone else faction-wise, so if I can train/bank up there, so can anyone else. :D</div></div><hr />
