<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any way to find out how far you are in GoD progression? I.e like the Seer in PoK for planar flags... Im trying to find out what I have left for my KT flag and haven't found info on it anywhere thus far. <br />
<br />
Any help with this would be appreciated &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best thing you can do is talk to the high priest &amp; scribe in barindu.  If the high priest gives you sewers expeditions, then you haven't done weaponsmith and haven't finished all four sewers yet.  <br />
<br />
If the high priest doesn't give you sewers, and if you say &quot;issues&quot; to scribes until you stop getting flags, then next you talk to the chick that gives out vxed/tipt trials.  Ask her &quot;why can't I remember what the heck I've already done?&quot; and she'll tell you &quot;just friggin do them over ya big wussy, they're not that tough and you can get some exp when ya do 'em&quot;.<br />

Look at his join date and you can fairly safely infer that he didn't ebay.  He does, however, have an arcaic sig that, even when it was still a novel phrase, wasn't as cool as the people who said it thought it was.</div></div><hr />
