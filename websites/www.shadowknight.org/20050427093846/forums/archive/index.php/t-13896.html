<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shredderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i've turned the graphics on once or twice over my time....They are just fugly. How did we turn into these better than perfect posture, crappy animation(if any) bashers? and that's not even what i'm gettin at just yet, i'm sure some of you like em...but now that i got my horse it says i gotta turn the graphics on to summon em, Friggin gay, i want my 5 aa back. Oh not to mention they are clumsy as well....i got nothing, just very clumsy...<br />
Ok this was more a rant than a race discussion, but are yall feelin me here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pheargore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pheargore was devised to resemble Fear, Gore and Egor. I made him way before Luclin. <br />
<br />
LOL prophecy? He sure looks like Egor now with those crappy animations.<br />
<br />
- Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It took me a long time to finally enable Luclin troll/ogre graphics. As long as you have a helm that covers your head it's not too bad, but man, their luclin model is beyond horrible.<br />
<br />
I think the skelly animation is terrible too. SoE's art department should shoot themselves. Hell, the only luclin graphics worth a damn are female elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Benmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, I think the Luclin models of the Trolls rock.  They are precisely as ugly as they should be ;) <br />
<br />
For all those kiddies out there drooling over &quot;EQ Luclin babes&quot;... go buy a magazine :p :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want to use your horse without having luclin trolls on then use Shroud of Undeath/Deathly Temptation or well...anything that turns you into a skeleton...<br />
Once you click it your horse poofs along with your illusion tho.<br />
<br />
And yes, luclin troll models suck, I'm never going to switch em on~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkbeat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Strange, I actually find every Luclin model a vast improvment,<br />
<br />
Ogres= No longer look like huge dumb blobs......... always good.....<br />
Dwarfs &amp; barbarians = Just look more kick ass<br />
Trolls = Evil &amp; Ugly as hell.......... Why not there trolls right? <br />
<br />
Basically all models now show much more detail and actually look like they have ..... Dare i say it ? Muscles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vuloshek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't understand how anyone could prefer the old models for anything but lack of lag.  This goes for all models.<br />
<br />
Square limbs.  Square fists.  Square heads.<br />
<br />
A handful of face choices, most of which are really ugly, so everyone looks the same (not that there's much change here for hairless races like Trolls, but at least new trolls can get those evil, expressionless black eyes)<br />
<br />
Parkinson's Disease.  You think SoL has bad animations??? Why did they insist that all old models constantly twitch and sway like they've got some terrible degenerative disease?  And say what you will about how models run now, the old ones ran like retarded robots on ski machines.<br />
<br />
In any case, they said they're looking to fix the SoL animations... someone at Sony is actually hearing our complaints, on several issues.  Look up the patch message, it's in there somewhere.  It appears they're focusing on small races first (said something about you might see small races with weird animations).  Ever notice small races run like they've really, really gotta crap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hecatonchires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At first I hated the new look too. But as I play him more, the more and more bad ass he looks to me! I do wish he was more hulkng though. It's kinda like the different versions of Godzilla over the years. Sure the one form the 99 American version is sleek as hell and cool, but in a lot of ways the old lumbering beast is what you miss. Maybe Sony will make a hybrid, ala the cool as sh*t Godzilla 2000 the Japanese made...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jobrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I love most of the new models and wish I could turn em on full time. The Trolls and Ogres on Old Models looked like begnign, slightly confused Beanie Babies. With the new Models, Trolls now look like something you'd be AFRAID to see under a bridge, and Ogres now look like they might actually once have been the master race of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They look like a fat kid in a bad Halloween costume.<br />
<br />
Couldn't agree more, with the exception of the female Iksar 2hs swings and how we are hunched over (I am constantly ducking and standing as to not see it :D ).<br />
<br />
The new Troll models look great (as do most characters) and at least I dont get the urge to scream 'SHRINK THE DAMN FATTIES' everytime I see one on a raid.<br />
<br />
Just one scaley lizard's opinion</div></div><hr />

Haven't seen the Peasley/Synd picture yet, eh? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LoganHex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am only going to comment on the races that I have characters for.<br />
<br />
Ogres: Look much better in my opinion. Beforehand they looked like gelatinous blobs of ulcer ridden fat. Now they look like lumbering muscleheads which just seems to fit more.<br />
<br />
Trolls: I prefer the older models. I just cannot seem to get a decent facial expression on my troll warrior now whereas with the older models he looks like a psychotic lunatic. Now I would actually go so far as to say he looks sad. I do not think the world is ready for a sad troll warrior.<br />
<br />
Erudite: Much better as far as which class I play (shadow knight). I actually have muscles now and the large forehead seems to fit better whereas before it just looked obnoxious. As a caster I might prefer the older models.<br />
<br />
Iksar: I go back and forth on this one. This was the only race I played before I got Luclin so when I finally purchased the expansion and turned on the new graphics I was shocked. The upgraded Iksar look like freaking killing machines. At first I was really digging it but now I think I prefer the old model for males. They look so much sleeker and lizard like. Perfect for a monk. Now they look too bulky and the flying kick and swimming animations just flat out reek. The new Iksar females look nice though. Kind of have a stealthy ninja look about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>burzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/agree Logan, i do prefer iksar male old skins.<br />
Now we just seem to be fat and no more lizard like: not slim enough and the new helmets suck badly (darn they keep saying i stole napoleon s hat...).<br />
Previous iksar s animations were kinda neat and i liked the way they moved while doing nothing, grunting like a wild beast hehe <br />
;) <br />
<br />
PS: Wism sale copiteur t as les même AA que moi :D :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Niremue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I myself like all the new models.  I don't understand how anyone can see the old troll models as something to be feared.  Other than the weird get-a-long they have and the pot-belly they are fine.  By the way can any of you role players explain why the troll race would evolve with a pot-belly and being muscled up everywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Now I dont really care about the models on or off but I DO like to ride my horse SO I keep it on. But I was on the road the other day driving by my old neighborhood and saw my old norwegian neighbor.../gasp he had no shirt on and look JUST LIKE A TROLL MODEL. No joking here because I dont joke around here but he look just like it I started laughing pretty hard. Who cares...the only problem i have is that most swords and axes and such look like toys...cant you just like make em bigger? Just out of curiousity since I'm almost done with Greenmist what does it look like on a troll? If it looks like a Dagger or something I will be furious...to be honest weapons look best on iksars and dark elves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jodgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just out of curiousity since I'm almost done with Greenmist what does it look like on a troll?  <br />
<br />
It looks like a katana, the same as it does for every race.<br />
<br />
As for new models, I must say that, with the exception of the noams and halflings, they all look pretty good. The only thing I miss from the old models is DE chicks in leather pants...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>legoluss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well to me the new luclin models look awsome i like the new troll model with skull shaped barbute and some good armor they look kick ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So it doesnt look like a little play toy katana? And you can see that it is definately different from other swords right? Im glad. My axe looks like a child's play thing and its really gettin on my nerves. Anyway i figure if trolls were humans they would be norwegian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vorrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like the new troll models, but why is it, with the old-school models, now matter what type of 2 handed weapon I used I ALWAYS swung it with TWO HANDS!!!  Bashing, slashing, even 2 handed piercing I reached over and around and grabbed the damn weapon with both my hands.  <br />
<br />
WHY is it, now that I've lost weight, even gotten a little smaller (I've noticed that in some areas I have to duck with old models on, I don't have to duck with the new models on) I don't swing ANY  2 handed weapon with TWO HANDS!!!  If they're gonna leave it that way then let me use a damn shield.  Hey, I'm a big race, I SHOULD be able to swing a sword with one hand that freakin' GNOMES need to use 2 hands for . . . <br />
<br />
I just don't get Sony sometimes . . . Okay all the time.<br />
<br />
- Vorrek, The Large Handed . . . (and you know what they say about guys with large hands!)<br />
<br />
<br />
. . . that's right!!  Large gauntlets!  ;)</div></div><hr />

This is going way way back for me, but I seem to remember trolls were always tall wirey with pot bellies. <br />
<br />
Said bellies were full of super strong stomach acid which allowed them to eat almost anything.<br />
<br />
I also remember if you ever managed to kill a troll you had to make a roll to avoid being sprayed with stomach acid.<br />
<br />
So basically the big acid filled belly aids digestion... BURP!!!  :D <br />
<br />
Back on topic: - <br />
I also prefer the new troll models, they are more in keeping with how I always remembered them. The old model looked like a walking box of kleenex. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Wow that was explained very well.  I love the lore to the game.  Speaking of lore and the roleplaying has anyone else checked out the link on Jobril's signature about his story.  If you like lore and the roleplay of the game it is great.  I must commend you on that work.  It has been a great read.  I'm hoping there will be more to read in later days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I got to thinking last night about this and I dont know why. Alright Trolls have to be tall. Their fatness must be even with their hight so they cant be enormous. This theory is proved why you look at a really tall yet fat man. Their fat hangs down in a little pot belly normally and if you think about it Trolls and Ogres get large amounts of excersize during battle and chasing and running and things. Trolls suffer from bloodlust soo bad that they would stop in battle to feast which means they eat a lot so thats why they cant get rid of it all...<br />
<br />
  Although i DO want to swing my axe with TWO friggen hands</div></div><hr />
