In this quest you speak to Lord Qyzar and then to an iksar crusader in the lower tower. I say hail goxnok and he says &quot;hail follower of pain&quot;.  He dosent say anything after this about anything. I then say &quot;i am ready to depart&quot; and he gives me the coin. I run to FV and i camped the loc i was told neg 2550 neg 1550 for 13 straight hours and nothing poped, i have camped it a few hours over the last 3 weeks totaling about 46 hours on this quest, i have restarted in 7 times and i get the same result. The only tracker azeal i see in FV is near the bridge in FV, he is dark blue to me at lvl 58 and has a guard on either side of him who are also blue. He does not move or despawn and is always KOS. My question is this. Is this quest broken or am i doing something wrong?<br />

Tracker Azeal was not by his rock.  Not sure if they have fixed it or not yet.  Only reason I know is a few friends of mine were working on it.  They petitioned but didn't get any help other than...  I'll forward it to the server GM.  (aka NO HELP)<br />

Send an e-mail to eqbugs@soe.sony.com and they said that it doesn't seem like a bug and to contact a GM ingame.   On the Dirty Deeds forum is also a thread about this and one poster claimed that they admitted that it's broken but don't know when it'll be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Players say it's broken, guides and GMs say they'll look into it or pass it on higher up (ie I don't know what's going on so leave me alone).</div></div><hr />

I have yet to have any of my Petitions/Bug Reports/Feedbacks responded to, so it seems to me to be a very low priority problem that Verant seems to have no real interest in fixing.  /shrug  Go figure, all that time spent up to this point pretty much wasted, unless some miracle happens and they fix it.  If this particular NPC is down on all servers, seems to me like somebody removed him, intentionally or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kashya Killgrave</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest seems to have been broken for a few months on the Saryrn server.  I've done several bug reports and have talked with GM's, but the quest hasn't been fixed as of yet.  I've been collecting the items for the last 2 Khukris while I wait for the test of betrayal to be fixed.  By the time they fix it (if they even do) I'll have all the items for the other khukris.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trantarus Thule</div><div class="date">07-13-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The GMs are getting confused because there are 2 Tracker Azeals-- one that is not for the quest and one that is for the Khukri quest.  I have seen both up at the same time and it can be a bit confusing.  The one for the quest does walk a certain path though, so if you don't see him walking around, then the one that the GMs are seeing is not the right one.</div></div><hr />

Ill soon be to that part of the quest and want to know if i should waste the time trying to do this part yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saiyen</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like its still broken at least on trib</div></div><hr />
