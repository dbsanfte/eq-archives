<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phester Ingwound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I am a casual player.  I am an officer in a guild, but we are not a raiding guild per say.<br />
<br />
I can, and have, played every role from DPS, to DPS/Snarer, to Puller, to main tank, to ALL of the above at once.<br />
<br />
Not being in a raiding guld, I'm considering spreading the points out to start.  I currently have Run 3, Regen 2, Metab 1.<br />
<br />
My current plan has me putting 10% into AA as I progress though from 61 to 65, then all AA.  <br />
<br />
AAs I intend to purchase in the order I have in mind are:<br />
<br />
CA 1, CS 1, ND 1, CF 1, SCF 1, MC 1, Horse, PE, finish off CA/CS/ND line, IHT, PP 5, PD 3<br />
<br />
Any suggested changes?  And reasoning.  My thought is, since I'm a utility person in guild and on LDoNs for the most part, I want to have a broad base of AAs to start with.<br />
<br />
Magelo is below, and yes I know some of my gear sucks :rolleyes: , but its the best I can get on limited play time and little cash as I refuse to pay RL money for equipment or PP.  If you want to make suggestions on equipment things to note:  I'm low on cash (about 15K), already plan on getting some Bloodmetal Earrings, and am working on LDoNs in NRo and Everfrost to up the equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Drop combat fury and spell casting fury and go ahead and get nd2 I'd say.  Your hp are simply low, even lower than Namb's and he sucks.  Get your horse just because it's useful, but then go back and do ca3/cs3/nd3 before messing with PE, and I would toss Theft of Life in there as you can, since you can max it out for a TOTAL of 6 aa, and if nothing else it provides nice eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your suggested order is quite good at the beginning.  IHT is useless, however, unless you max SCF and UT as well.<br />
<br />
After CA/CS/ND, I'd do SCF3, IHT, UT3, LR5, ID5, PD3, then PP5.<br />
<br />
Also level to 65 before AAs.  The 10% thing will just slow down your power gain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhumba_Kween</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with the above. Forget about any offensive, and horse AA's until at least all of the defensive Arch abilities are completed.<br />
<br />
You may not tank all the time, but the offense AA's are just not as much bang for the buck. When you are tanking, taking 5-10 percent less damage is huge. When in a dps role, how much more damage is 3 percent of your melee dps? Maybe 3-5dps at your level, 3-5dps will not be noticable, the tanking AA's will.<br />
<br />
SK's are not primarily an offensive class, we are defensive, despite what the Warriors think. :) And as a result, our defensive AA's tend to give us more ROI.<br />
<br />
Anyway, best of luck to you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The defensive AA's make a huge difference.  So even if you tank occationally, it's well worth it.  CA1, CS1, ND1, PE.  Then fill out CA and CS, then ND.<br />
<br />
And levels &gt; AA's except run3 IMO.  I slid around my AA exp amout while leveling and wish I'd never had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phester Ingwound</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info so far.<br />
<br />
I probably will turn off AA exp until I hit 65.<br />
<br />
I'm considering a few changes to the original list, except that I will be getting my horse 5AAs after finishing Archetype simply because I want it.  It may not be the best way to spend those 5AA at that point, but I don't care.   :D <br />
<br />
CA 1, CS 1, ND 1, CA 2, MC 1, Horse, PE, finish off CA/CS/ND lines, SCF 1, CF 1, PD 1-3, IHT, UT, PP 1-5<br />
<br />
Throwing PE in where I did, cause it will make the other adds to CA/CS/ND be more of an instant bang for the buck.  Anything after Maxing the standard defensives is up for grabs.  ToL is another possibility to be thrown into the mix anywhere in there, as are LR and ID.  I may just do (starting at SCF):<br />
<br />
SCF 1, CF 1, PD 1, PP 1, ToL 1, ID 1, LR 1, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nambkab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my horse asap as well, and never regretted it.  And I always mention ToL as you can, simply because it is useful and cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would agree that PD, PP, CA, CS, PE, LR, ID are the core AAs you want to get done. <br />
<br />
Then SCF and ToL are nice to get. After that I think I went with HT AA's, CF AA's and then horse. <br />
<br />
/ugh there are so many more to get..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks like a good plan, though I would take a break from defensive Arch AA's and buy PE as soon as possible as it is a great buy.  I think the horse is expensive, and doesn't really add to your power, but I made the mistake of focusing entirely on defensive AA's to the exclusion of all else, and just got bored at around 50 AA's.  After a 6 months break playing my mage, I am back with my SK, but find it helps if I mix the fun AA's in with the defensive AA's even if it does not result in the absolutely most powerful combination possible.<br />
<br />
The short version ... Get your horse and enjoy it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ogrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The short version ... Get your horse and enjoy it!<br />
<br />
I agree - have fun with your aa's... Defensives (while not &quot;fun&quot; at first gloss) are certainly very useful, but would get boring after 29 or so AA's (at least it is proving thus to me) so mix it up a little bit - treat yourself to something fun too. Fun factor is the return on investment I care most about - not what a calculator tells me. For the record though, do CA1, CS1, ND1 and PE first - my cleric said it caused a noticable decrease in the damage I was taking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Something I'd like to point out... CF1 is pretty darn good, but CF2 and CF3 are not near as good per aa... meaning get CF1, wait a while on CF2 and CF3.<br />
<br />
SCF1 on the other hand is dogmeat compared to SCF3 which really rocks.  Meaning don't bother getting SCF1 unless you're at the point where you're ready to go straight to SCF3 as your next aa's.<br />
<br />
I agree that the defensive aa's are the most important to get for someone in your position, if you are gonna get an occasional &quot;fun&quot; one, go with CF1, but don't do SCF1 until you're ready to take it all the way to SCF3.<br />
<br />
Probably best for your needs would be something like:<br />
<br />
ND1<br />
CA1<br />
CS1<br />
ND2<br />
Unholy Steed (you said you want this ASAP.. it's good &amp; fun might as well)<br />
Physical Enhancement<br />
CF1 (that one's fun too -- nice eye candy)<br />
ND3<br />
CA2<br />
CA3<br />
CS2<br />
CS3<br />
SCF 1-3 (fun ones)<br />
ToL 1 (cheap, fun)<br />
LR 1-5<br />
ID 1-5<br />
PD 1-3<br />
SA 1-3<br />
ToL 2-3<br />
IHT<br />
UT 1-3 (fun stuff)<br />
PP 1-5<br />
<br />
Kinda set up your plan to get the important defensive aa's while sprinkling in some of the fun ones for crits, lifetaps, and so on. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaeluur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i totally agree with:<br />
but I made the mistake of focusing entirely on defensive AA's to the exclusion of all else, and just got bored at around 50 AA's <br />
I myself have worked mainly on defensive aa, but I also take a few here and there for the HT aa, because I wanted the eye candy.  Now I have a friend that uses me to duo with his shaman when I am not around (more often than not these days) he has picked up a few really wacko aa that would have been much better suited being spent in LR or such, but he earned them so I dont really care if I have touch of the wicked 2, but not LR2 yet.<br />
<br />
Just have fun.  I have seen far too many parse happy &quot;i need to maximize my skills to be the best XXX around&quot; people burn out.  A fun but not as well geared tank will always win a place in my groups over the overbearing know it all with 15,000 hitpoints.</div></div><hr />
