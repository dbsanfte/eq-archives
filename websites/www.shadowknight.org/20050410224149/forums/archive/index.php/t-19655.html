<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please explain the Vallon Zek encounter to me? Last time we tried, we beat his ass, 4 clones spawned, we beat their asses, and that was it. No planar projection or anything. Where did we go wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ashrai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try beating their asses again. But pay particular attention to who's ass you beat in what order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This encounter is horrifically bugged.  Just try it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Something to do with eye color and pre-targetting...also I remember people worrying that if he himself died in the wall the PP would get fucked up. Also, clicking the door afterwards was part of the flag...but this is all a pretty fuzzy recollection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are 4 waves of VZ and his clones.  Just fight them away from the middle of the room, so it doesn't matter what order you kill them in.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you just hit a bug, if you killed two waves and the encounter ended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cames</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As I recall the waves are timed as well.  You may have not finished one fast enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its bugged we have killed them very fast and had that happen before.   That said there is a time limit to complete it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Camby_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Step One:<br />
<br />
Get to the Room VZ sits in and get to the nearest corner (left corner from the stage) that he sits on and prep for pull .. Have MT ( warrior is good ) arrow pull him and beat him down til he poofs ( Stay in corner ).<br />
<br />
Step Two:<br />
<br />
After First VZ poofs .. 5 of him will spawn in the middle of the room.  Get 5 decently geared tanks in a group with their own slower and own healer and have a SoS rogue go out and individually select a target for each said tank.  One VZ will be higher than the rest ( this is the REAL VZ ) kill all the other VZ's BEFORE you initiate the attack on the REAL VZ.  Have the tank with the real VZ call out that he has the REAL VZ ( to avoid killing him too soon and getting even more VZ's )  Have 1 MA ( main assist ) target and call out which Vallon Zek to attack and everyone but the 5 initial MT's will attack and kill the fake VZ's in order before engaging the REAL VZ.  Once fakes are down .. attack REAL VZ until he poofs and spawns back in the middle with his 4 fakes<br />
<br />
Step Three:<br />
<br />
Rinse and Repeat 3 more waves<br />
<br />
Step Four:<br />
<br />
Last wave kill them all in order like mentioned above with the only exception being that the last VZ you kill ( the REAL VZ ) will die and not split .... Hail the projection and split up the PHAT LEWTS.  You are done<br />
<br />
Have a nice day :D</div></div><hr />
