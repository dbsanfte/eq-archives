<br />
Ok, All of this info is MOSTLY Opinion, and not 100% Fact. But it is helpful, (in my opinion) for people who havent acquired level 65.<br />
I will try to lend out as much EXP knowledge i have. But most of the info is &quot;Pre-planes of power&quot; so there will probably be little info on planes. <br />
<br />
First off, the key to leveling is too survive, obviously. IF you are in a fight and things begin to look grim, prepare to plan your escape and my plan was once my hp entered the last bub of health, i run. Unless its a 1 on 1 fight with a mob thats grey or lower with less hp than me. Also tanks i suggest the first hotkey you make is one along the lines of, &quot;HEALER, HEAL ME ASAP!!!!!&quot; nice and big so your healer can easily read it. I dont know how many times as a young eq player in highpass, a group member would say sumthing and i'd have to scroll up forever to read it, and when i finally read it, im probably already too late. So make your plea for help nice and big and easy to read, or another good idea is sending a direct tell to the healer, its easier to notice, but let them be aware of that, b/c they might have replys and send tells into another chatbox and might not get that.  Casters, i only have one tip, make sure group is aware of mana at all times.<br />
<br />
Now that we got simple basic tihngs taken care of, now locations on exp.  Well im sure there are people who ahve known these places forever or have better locations, thats fine add posts of  suggestions of better places, b/c i'd like to know myself. <br />
<br />
For shadowknights lvl 1-5 simply just kill outside your starting city, unless your getting pl'd then scroll down sum and read on. For new characters, i dont suggest doing quests at all, they pretty much jsut waste time. The only good newbie quest i know of for good exp is Crushbone belts, and kelethin is such a long run from most sk starting cities that by the time you get there you could already be level 5. (**Anyone who wants to do the cb belt quest anyway, all you need is 4 cb belts and turn it into the warrior guild leader in kaladim, but most sks are KOS to anyone sk that not human. But im not 100% and human im not sure about. if you complete the newb quest you get a piece of rawhide armor and sum silver and gold.**) <br />
<br />
Once you acquire lvl 5, its time to leave the safety of home, and begin your adventures through Norrath.<br />
<br />
*I have serval suggestion to go about leveling form 6-10, <br />
<br />
*1st- Depending on your starting city, the time it takes to get to the next area may vary, so i suggest killing things along the way, but only blues b/c if you die, you go back to your starting city. So this way you get exp on your journey for more exp. =) For Iksar Sk's they dont have far to travel. But before you leave yuor City make sure you buy your level 9 spells (and 15 if u got the cash) but the only ones i suggest are...  You pet(s) (if u get lvl15 spells)<br />
 your dots, (Disease cloud, and possibly posion bolt) i cant remember exactly wat dot spells exactly we get at 9 (and 15), i jsut know its along those lines, also get any dd spells for 9 (and 15) Fear is also helpful, but not necessary. Buy Ward Undead now if possible it will save time later! so yuo dont have to come back at 22.<br />
<br />
 <br />
*Then after you get your spells make yuor way to Field of Bone. Field of Bone is good exp until lvl 9 maybe 10. The reason this is best for lvl 6-10 is the Kunark Exp bonus, (i dont remember full details but was told the gms put a exp bonus on mobs you kill in kunark) as you kill in FoB, collect as much bone chips as possible dont sell em, obviosuly you need em for yuor pets!<br />
<br />
Then head to Kurns Tower, This place is realy good exp until about 16ish, it used to be alot better until gms dumbed it down. It has a Kunark Bonus that stacks with Dungeon Bonus, (or so im told numerous times) stay there until 16. <br />
 <br />
<br />
*But I'm sure many people out there dont have much patience for travel, I totally agree, the above guide is good for iksar, but Dark elves get it jsut as good! Dark elves can go to Befallen which has a 13% exp bonus, (FACT) and collect massive bone chips and possibly collect quest material. Stay at Befalen until 16ish.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then at 16 Head for Highpass hold, and seek out an orc group. This place is great until lvl 21. You get fast pops and great exp, and i made tons of cash with the bronze the orcs dropped probably around 100 plat. Sometimes the orc group will be full but since your a versatile Sk you can do one of three things...<br />
<br />
1) Ask for permission from the group leader to practice your 1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb whatever you use the most, since your leveling so fast they will be lower than they should be, but if yuor that good and yuor main skill is up to par with your level, then work on another one, b/c sks get alot of different kind of weapons that are good, unlike rogues who get good weapons but they are all piercing and druids and shaman get 1hb, sk's get different kinds so practice em all! But this method gets you no exp, =(<br />
<br />
2) You are lvl 16 and that means stronger pets and spells! so you have the opportunity to solo or group the gnolls in the zone, who should range from blue to you to possibly yellow or red, not 100% certain<br />
this should get you nice exp, while you wait for a group.<br />
<br />
3) You can go to the hidden cave, where Dylan Starshine (pretty sure how its spelled) pawns and wait, He looks like a Qeynos Guard. You can kill him, and obtain Page 34, the hardest part of the Testament of Venaer quest, the Testamnet is all all, and it has int and wis, So if you ever need an INT or WIS item there yuo go jsut pull out the testament, (the rest of the quest is fairly easy, jsut go to Qeynos and give sum drunkard sum gold and recieve the other page and book, and hit combine) fairly good quest, sumthing to do while you wait for a group. But sadly not much exp as killing gnolls.<br />
<br />
The great thing about Highpass among other things, is that there are Inns in the Zone and a Bank in the next Zone over which makes this zone very profitable. And if you are a brewer or potter this zone is pretty good, you can find most materials here. When you get in yuor orc group and a named Orc spawns, he is pretty tough, kill him and you will recieve either a very nice backpack (10 slot with 10% reduction and hold giant or large items not 100% sure) or a Shiny Brass Halberd, (sells for a few plat at the inn,) or sum kinda Gorgonda Idol, that has sum stats and a charge i believe. He also drops a plat or to, like most the other orcs do in the zone.<br />
<br />
*For levels 22-40 You msut not be KOS in Highkeep, or u need to invis yourself past the guards. To become &quot;un-kos&quot; you can do this by turning in the orc scalps the orcs drop in highpass to an NPC, his name is &quot;a volunteer&quot; or sumthing along those lines of volunteer. Make sure he is not kos to you as well, if he is keep killing orcs until he is not yuor faction will go up.<br />
<br />
Once yuor level 22 head for highkeep, Make sure you bind yourself here, that way if u get killed u still get exp from that mob! Then down to the first room, (i believe called LR on Terris Thule) the lair room is the one on the left from the ent, thats the lowest and safest level, then when yuo get a lil stronger and braver head to the middle room, the first room you came to possibly called the Guard room (GR??), then again when your braver and stronger go downstairs and in the first room you see, thats your destination for a lil while, after you get stronger still head down farther to the bottom room called the Raider Room (RR??) i believe once you reach 37 you can start to solo the room, and stay there until 40ish.  The reason i dont give specific levels when to leave rooms, is b/c you can do different rooms at the same level, so its kidna tricky to decide which will give best exp, but jsut get the one thats open, and if there are a few, then you lucky dog you get yuor pick. <br />
<br />
Highkeep is a Great place b/c the goblins drop major cash, usually a couple plat, and the weapons sell for sum plat so you can get sum nice cash. And the spawn times are nice, its kill, kill, kill, and u get lots of nice exp, but after alot of kills you will get sum major down time, but then it starts back up again.<br />
<br />
Well for levels, 45+ I cant really say, b/c i havent gone beyond that sadly, hopefully someone can add sum postson where to go from highkeep. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, i wasnt 100% (many times) on details, but hopefully you can figure it out.</div></div><hr />
