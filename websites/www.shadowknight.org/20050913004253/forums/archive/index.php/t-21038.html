<br />
every time we make it to this point we get swarmed with adds on those steps.  hoping someone can offer some input on how to get past this point, as it seems to be a bottleneck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daerkon</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is pretty easy actually. Invis through the water and then exit the water to the right of the stairs. There is a static mob on each side of the stairs. As you face the stairs back up one mob from the static mob to the right of stairs, you are on a narrow platform just under the water. If you basically stand on top of that mob before you break invis and engage you wont get any adds. Kill that mob and the one behind you, then pull the stair mobs and the wanderers one by one until you have them all. This takes a little time, but there is no risk as respawn is very long. I have done this multiple times on my own boxxing a group of 4 while farming the Blistering Larvae. After the wandering mobs are removed all of the remaining mobs are easily dispatched.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cauchy</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, I know the exact spot you're talking about.  Break from the top sort of circle ledge thing.  Your feet will still be underwater, which is a problem for mosquitos if there are any since you'll have that whole stupid water/land spell casting problem.  Anyway, breaking from the top is pretty easy, just single the turtles around the wall then work your magic on the stairs.  You'll have to fight mosquitos on the stairs, but by the time you're pulling them, it should be semi-safe to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
still no luck with the Pockmarked Aegis dropping, but now that we have the strat down for the trial i'll get my hands on one sooner or later.</div></div><hr />
