Syrik Iceblood says ''We can tell from the weapons that we have taken back from the Bloodgill goblins, that their smithing process must have been very unique for them to remain so sharp after four thousand years of use. Cabilis would like to study the weapons and learn this technique so we can better outfit our troopers. If you will bring me four of the same weapon I will spread your name through our city, and one day you may be able to walk the streets. I am looking for Steel Ch'Ror, Mak'Stor, So'Shar, Ta'Nak, Ga'Nak, and Re'Stek. Until then I will reward you with whatever coin I can get from turning them in for you.'' <br />
<br />
This guy is an Iksar Monk, 65. Indifferently to everyone, even if you have bad faction with Iksars (na na I don't =P). Give him FOUR of the same STEEL WEAPONS found in Veksar (I.E. Four (4) Steel Ga`Tnok) and you'll get something close to this: <br />
<br />
Syrik Iceblood says ''Excellent work Emancer. We will study the architecture of these weapons to better the legions of Cabilis. Soon your name will be known among the Iksar.'' <br />
Your faction standing with Syrik Iceblood got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Legion Of Cabilis could not possibly get any better. <br />
Your faction standing with Cabilis Residents got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Scaled Mystics got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Crusaders Of Greenmist got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Swift Tails got better. <br />
You gain experience!! <br />
You receive 6 silver from Syrik Iceblood. <br />
You receive 12 gold from Syrik Iceblood. <br />
You receive 12 platinum from Syrik Iceblood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Floppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wonder how substantial the hit is. If it's anything decent, this could be a nice alternative to flattening Kurns or the Explorer camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fantim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The hit on this is very, very significant.  Did 10 turn ins tonight and maxed every faction on the list.  I was only indifferent to some of them, now maxed.</div></div><hr />

Now softskins will be invading our nice quiet city.  At least before I knew someone had worked their butt off to get in.<br />
<br />
That said. they better avoid the necros.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zeixxs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems a very nice way of factioning, but i failed to see the necro faction (brood of kotiz) in the text, so it not cake yet.<br />
I do have some questions now though :<br />
R the swords no drop ? (can they be bought ?)<br />
How hard r they to get ? (solo/grp, deep/entrance...)<br />
Where is that monk guy ?<br />
<br />
Anyway its a very good news to all greenmist pretender (altough a post in armory says the sword is broken ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stugein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The weapons for the quest are NOT nodrop.  I haven't been to Veksar myself (I imagine that I would get mauled), but I have seen the weapons listed in various vendor inventories around PoK and other places.  So they are definately droppable/sellable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slagnath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the iksar being indifrent to everyone is rather disapointing. aren't iksar supposed to be xenophobic? hating all other races untill they prove themselves and stuff.<br />
<br />
now it looks like we could see plenty of happy halfling druids of happy halfling gods prancing around cabalis 'cus some iksar monk decided to be a nice guy=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shadowsoal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope the necros rape them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Agoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did some vendor farming in PoK and in LoIO and managed to get my Human Inny worshipping necro to indiff to Troopers dubious to others with only 5kpp spent and managed to earn 50% reg exp at 51 in the process.  This is much faster than when I did the faction the first time with my Barb shaman right after kunark came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>velin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone have an /loc in LoIO?  cant seem to find this guy.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beezellzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did this quest twice last night, he was standing at the pillars closests to the Sarnak Fort in LoIO....<br />
<br />
Also the first turn in I turned in 4 alike mallets and got the faction hits, then had 3 random weapons I picked up from Veskar think they were a 1hs, 2hs, and piercer....and got the hits from these 3 as well so the turn in may actually be 3 not 4.</div></div><hr />
