<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowscale</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I want to make sure we end up close to the &quot;Greenish Metal Shard&quot; camp.  We are doing a Royals raid in Chardok on Friday night.  And to be honest, I know nothing about the zone.  I can't even seem to find any maps of the zone.  I have one map that isn't labled, so that isn't much help.  Can anyone link me, or post here a good map so I have an idea where everything is in relation to each other?  I also wouldn't mind grabbing another &quot;History of Greenmist&quot; while I'm in there either.  Any help on these two spawn points or camps would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!!<br />

Left takes you to the mines and to the greenish metal shard, right takes to you the royals and the history of greenmist.  They are truely in totally different areas of the zone (and that fork is the path most guilds go through ;))<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't have the link handy to chardok, but if you search the posts I'm sure you'll find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agoni</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most Royals Raids take the path through the &quot;Gate&quot; across the bridge and past the &quot;Observer's&quot; camp.  Continuing down towards the Bridge Keeper spawn at this point you can go towards &quot;Korocust's&quot; or through the &quot;Graveyard&quot; towards the &quot;Royal's Residence&quot;.  At the Bridge Keeper's area you can continue on towards the mines and before you get to the bank you will find the Herbalist's Shack this is the area that will spawn your target.  It is not anywhere near the Royals as previously stated and getting your raid to make this detour for a rare spawn and a rare drop is not likely and entirely up to your powers of persuasion.  Good luck !<br />
<br />
P.S. If your target is the Shard then the path to take is through the &quot;Levitate&quot; tunnel this will shorten your trip and preserve your force by encountering less mobs on the way.</div></div><hr />

If you can get a strong group or two with the lure of two quest drops instead of one, it might help your cause.</div></div><hr />

I've been doing rare spawn camping all week, and to keep the masochistic theme going I'll be joining a guild raid on chardok for the necro epic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ianthe</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... a lot of guild preference goes into the path you take to the royals.  We tend to go into the gates, jump into the pits go to the fork.  You can go through the gate to the bridge.  You can also just go into the side tunnel and go down to the fork.  I've seen all three ways done.  Personally I don't like the take the gate path all the way to the bridge, it's a lot longer and more chances of screwups.<br />
<br />
My personal preference is to take the tunnel to the fork and take a right... but the problems of getting people to lev, and run into a tunnel are usually not worth it.<br />
<br />
Herbalist area is on like a 20 minute spawn timer (don't quote me on that, it's somewhere around there, I was more worried about getting the different aggros in the area figured out then spawn timers).<br />
<br />
Course my luck was the only time the guy popped for me was when he dropped the dizok escape staff (which made for a happy druid)...  Finally just ended up buying the stupid thing (only took a week and a lot of luck in auction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowscale</div><div class="date">07-20-2002, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the path we chose....  CoH by a non KoS Mage. =\   We ended up being ported to a room a little ways down before the library.  HOWEVER, the good news was I was able to pick up another History of Greenmist for an Iksar Shadow Knight friend of mine.  We ended up doing the King and Queen twice.  Everyone was exhausted at that point so we didn't make it to the &quot;Greenish Shard&quot; area.  We will be going back again sometime to camp the Herbalist (not sure for which class) but I guess that'll be my best chance to get one, cause I can't stand auction zones or channels lol.  =P<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help everyone!<br />
