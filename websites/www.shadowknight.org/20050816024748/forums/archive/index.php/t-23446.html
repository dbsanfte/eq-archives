<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utmost</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had great success getting runes in WoS at the camp called FU west. It is located on the other side of that big wall that runs through the zone which I can only assume is called the Wall of Slaughter.  The east side camp is basically the same, but can have a nasty add named Discordling Warfiend.  <br />
<br />
The problem with this zone is the dumb asses that occupy it. (Yes I've included myself)  Also, the camp can be highly contested, so if you join it and it seems to be a fuster cluck, it probably is.  Best to leave at that point and EXP or get an expidition for runes.<br />
<br />
Now the key to a good time here is getting the spawn cycle right.  Start with the Girplan that you can see out infront of the building dead ahead.  Next is the Girp inside, it is also a PH for a rare named.  Next go up hill behind that building, where a Noc and a Kyv are.  They are both PH's for rune droppers.  Split those and kill in either order.  I usually do Noc first and pull it around Girp building, then grab the Kyv.  Next is the far building.  There is a Noc and a Kyv infront, and an Ukun inside it.  All 3 of these are PH's for rune droppers.  I suggest splitting off the Noc and killing that first, because then the Ukun is a single, and can be pulled through that hole on the side of the building, and lastly the Kyv out front.<br />
<br />
The reason I like to start with the Girp out front is because you can see it pop and know that cycle is starting over.  And same with the Noc infront of the other building, you can see it pop so you know if you are getting behind.<br />
<br />
Spawn time is 20 min, so depending on group make-up you can pull other trash for exp while waiting for repops.  <br />
<br />
There will most likely be a group near you competing for the spawns, which makes for great conversations.  But if you can nail down spawn order, you should be gtg.<br />
<br />
Pretty much any class that can split mobs can pull for the group.  ENCH work well cause they can just stack one mezzed as the one you are fighting gets low.  Same with a bard.  SK's work well, but it can get a lil slow until cycle is broken if SK is tanking for the group as well as pulling.  Some of the named may see invism but afa the PH's go the Ukun is the only one that sees invis. I invented this.<br />
