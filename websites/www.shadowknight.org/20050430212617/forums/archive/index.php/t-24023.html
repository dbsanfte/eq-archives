<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenacil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i've noticed when i kill razorfiends in PoV with my 60 sk (they are yellow/red) i get AA's really fast, its slower with my 65 druid or 68 monk (same mobs are blue)<br />
<br />
maybe i'm wrong, though.<br />
<br />
but, if this is true, it means i should stay 60 and do tons of AA's (those in general, archtype, class) then get 65, rather than go 65 (without stability and agility, ouch!) and then do PoP/GoD AA's  :confused:  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arangar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">levels &gt; aa for most people / situations, the only exception I can think of is that grinding AAs will indeed be faster for you at a lower level if you got a group of friends that more or less will PL you in high level zones.<br />
<br />
but normally, staying at a low level means it will be harder to get groups, so that you find yourself getting more AA over time at a higher level anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To your basic question, yes xp is better from a yellow/red than from a blue.  Where you put that xp is up to you, and has been debated/explained many times here.<br />
<br />
Whether it is &quot;a lot&quot; better, is subjective.  At 70 in RSS on yellow cons, I'll see 5% aaxp per kill in a full group.  In MPG on a blue or white con, it will be 3-4% aaxp.  I'm pretty much assuming the ZEM is the same for both zones.<br />
<br />
XP per hour would be based on your group make-up and gear/skill.  Killing more blues per hour might be better than yellow/reds.  If you can kill yellow/red quickly and safely with no downtime, that would always be superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menon Lifeblight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same question, over and over again.  And the answer is always the same.<br />
<br />
Levels first.  Sure PoV is better at 60 than 65.  But guess what, aaxp in RS at 70 beats the hell out of PoV at any level, and the loot is slightly better too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">XP per hour ... always ... superior.<br />
<br />
Never ceases to amaze me how many people cant get this simple idea. From wasting hours to get just the right setup to hit one zone harder or the fool who wants big xp hits even if there is huge downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jchapin11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lets see if I can make this as simple as possable. I dont mean to flame by any means but so many people have an extremly hard time understanding this concept so here goes. (This information is purely for analagy purposes and by no means reflects actual in-game numbers)<br />
<br />
1 yellow/red takes 2 minutes to kill and requires 2 minutes downtime after. 1 yellow/red nets 2-3% XP and takes 4 minutes total time.<br />
<br />
1 dark blue takes 1 minute to kill and requires no downtime after. 1 dark blue nets 1% XP and takes 1 minute total time.<br />
<br />
Simply put: (4 minutes total time)<br />
1 yellow/red = 2-3% XP<br />
4 dark blues = 4% XP<br />
<br />
Before anyone starts flaming this applies to the average lvl of the group and not the individual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 yellow/red takes 2 minutes to kill and requires 2 minutes downtime after<br />
<br />
... As he said - with no downtime, obviously the yellow/red better.  With downtime that won't be true.  I've been in groups that can keep up Yellow/Red killing with no downtime.  Always better exp.</div></div><hr />
