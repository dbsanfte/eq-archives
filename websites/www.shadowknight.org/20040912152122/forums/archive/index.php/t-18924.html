<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dakibus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I took a two + year break from the game.  I just returned and I have been leveling my main (A Bard) and I was looking through my alts and checked out my level 24 Erudite SK.<br />
<br />
His stats stink.  I mean they are bad.  I think I actually put points into Int!!!!  His STA is horrible low.<br />
<br />
But here is my question.  I know its not incredibly difficult to get to level 24, but should I stick it out or should I reroll.  I already have any ikky warrior so I dont want another lizard tank.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dharkenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">delete your SK and make a pally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Droyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can always buy ?crustecean? armor to raise your STA.  Go to the bazaar and do searches on items with STA.<br />
<br />
As far as rerolling is concerned, think about the long term.  Your stats can be changed with gear and buffs.  Your race is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Erudites are fun....<br />
<br />
If I were you and I stuck it out......<br />
STA is not dificult to get it's probably on 1/3 of all armor I see...or if you go to bazaar just use STA as one of the filters<br />
<br />
If I were you and I re-rolled...<br />
Make another Erudite and put the stats in appropriate places... First make sure all stats are at least 75 then put stats where you want them.<br />
<br />
edit:  Erudite dex is not so high that you can really afford the dex loss from wearing crusty anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silvershadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Re-rolling at lvl 24 is not that big a deal. If you are unhappy with how you put your stats, re-roll and do it right this time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malheur VonRane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Many is the time I wished I had chosen Iksar over Erudite when I had the chance. I played both concurrently for awhile and chose Erudite for aesthetics rather than performance. If you want to have a large manapool and cast all day then stick with Erudite. I usually recommend Crusty armor for the big sta boost. If you want to be a little less gear dependant then I would restart as an Ogre or Iksar. anything inbetween is 6 one way half a dozen another.<br />
<br />
P.S. I don't like Troll Shadow Knights. Don't  ask me why cause I'm not exactly sure myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UGLA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you like the way ur edrudite looks then stick with that.  Starting stats are about meaningless anyway.  Play the race that appeals to you the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Back when I started my Human SK I put points into a lot of INT (even though I had no idea that's what SK's used for mana), little bit of STA (86 total starting), and CHA, yes CHA (*points and laughs*); I was the noobiestest.  As I went along I realized more what the best stats to gain were and I got gear to fit my needs.  There's no way I'm going to start an SK all over again no no no no no!!!!  Even around level 22 I completely refused to start over even when people said I wouldn't make it.  I sought out to prove them all wrong and succeeded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazral Shadowthirst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Erudites really annoy me as casters, but it is not everyday they weild weapons. The stats really don't matter. If you have the choice, boost AGI STA, and STR for your erudite. It does not matter if that makes you seem too much all round, it's about the look and the armor you get later.</div></div><hr />
