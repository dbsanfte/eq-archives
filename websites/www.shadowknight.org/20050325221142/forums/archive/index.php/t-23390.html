<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syfon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're in the process of implementing backflag quests for Planes of Power and Gates right now.  Just yesterday I had players from Test run through the first version of the Gates backflagging quest and got their feedback.<br />
  <br />
These will go live as soon as they're done and ready, and they should ease much of the backflag burden.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something of this nature is even more important on Test server than perhaps any other server. Our population is easily half and perhaps only 1/3rd of standard servers. Raiding is more affected on our server both due to this lack of bodies as well as server downages on a daily basis eating targets that might otherwise allow progression.<br />
<br />
The quests however will ease the game wide burden of guilds needing to constant backflag for new recruits and could now just be a requirement for guild application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Halfwarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thats all good and everything but we see how people act in WOS do we want those type of people in Poearth, and KT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't care much, people like that are already in PoE and KT on my server, due to open raids and the GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daywalka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I enjoy the fuck out of grouping in Earth and Fire. I can pull for hours and not see another chucklefuck trying to train me, or steal my pull, or stay stupid shit in /ooc or /shout like &quot;POKEMON RULEZ!!! YUGIHOE SUXXORZ!&quot; I hate WoS with a passion because of the fuckheads there. If those fuckheads are allowed into Fire and Earth, I will quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sesshou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My server has a ton of people in Earth that aren't really qualified to be there, but far fewer in Fire and even less in KT.  E'ci's public raiding system strikes again, for better or for worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skoggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know how the quests will work, so I'm just throwing out uneducated guesses here, but the term &quot;backflag quests&quot; doesn't necessarily mean some easy quests like the HoH/Torment/etc alternate entry quests. Backflag in particular implies being part of a guild that's already past the point where members being backflagged are. With the new quest system particularly shown with epics1.5/2.0, it's more than possible that there are some tricks going on to not allow random_unflagged_joe7381 to get into Fire, or god forbid Time.<br />
<br />
Alternately, it's always kinda been the way things worked in EQ - as content ages, it tends to be easier to access. This is primarily due to mudflation, true, and not really by intention (VP, ST, VT, etc still keyed)... and one could argue the same mudflation makes getting flagged under the normal system a lot easier (especially since level 70 was added) and thus should be enough, but I wouldn't be terribly shocked if upper level PoP zones, as well as KT (does &quot;Gates&quot; imply more than KT? cause Tacvi is still fairly exclusive..) be &quot;opened up&quot; through quests doable by anyone.<br />
<br />
Just tossing ideas out. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So your the only one allowed to play 3 year old (?) content that you have purchased, because only you have the skills to be able to handle that content?<br />
<br />
Backflagging for guilds is a pain, a severe pain and a big reason our guild fell apart.  I am assuming they have implemented some sort of method for a guild to backflag its members, whether that means anyone who wants one can get a flag, I guess we will have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont see any details of the process so I would be hard pressed to make any judgements about how fair or unfair any the process is going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm guessing the quests ard Shard-hunting esque or just below that level<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They want to put the fuckheads in the closed zones, because they are the majority, so they want to please them.<br />
<br />
They don´t care if they are spoiling the game for higher end players, cause its a very small percentage of the playerbase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Elementals isn't 'higher end players' anymore.<br />
<br />
It's a continuous dumbing down of EQ, but that's been going on for a long time.  Frankly, these quests better be extremely challenging, and have some test of skill to pass them.<br />
<br />
Backflag quests for GoD, at least up to KT, are silly, because it only takes a group to get in those zones anyways... and if you can't handle tipt, you have no business in KT.  I'm curious just how far they want to go with those quests however, ie, how far up the GoD chain.<br />
<br />
Time should always remain keyed, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kelv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Knowing Sony, I am willing to bet money they will implement backflagging quests all the way up to Tacvi, PoTime included...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Josahd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they implement a flagging quest for potime, I'll be highly pissed.  However, there's no precedent for unlocking end game zones, all the way back to kunark.  The one change I'd support is somehow allowing the 2/3 rule to apply to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah i see why it should remain locked cuase you hitting auto attack and then hailing a guy is just so fucking talented. Do you even listen to your own bullshit. At least half the wads who have that access just rode guilds up and then left em, but thats cool with you, that makes them A-grade material.<br />
<br />
And as far as the rabble coming in. You need to turn guildtags on my freind it is just as often as not a high end raider spouting innanities and being a fucktard in these zones. Handling yourself on a guild raid doesnt automaticaly make people perfect. Try again there. Nor does it make them automaticaly good in groups, ive seen many a raider come by that cant handle grouping they just act like we are doing tiny raids.<br />
<br />
I cannot tell you teh amount of complete slope headed morons who are EP or better flagged over my head who cant handle the simplest of group or raid functions so before you get on your little fucking high horse there maybe you should spent a day or two off the crack pipe and pay attention around you.<br />
<br />
This will be nice for me if i ever decide to be a raider, i wont have to consider the sleezy policy of guild hopping which is one of the reasons i have chosen to stay group content oriented. I have no problemwith 'doing the work' but trust me alot of guilds dont want to have to go do it agian, again.</div></div><hr />

most raiders iddn't turn on autoattack and hail.... or the guild would have never gotten flagged.  So many of these encounters require full participation, and one moron not paying attention can fuck it for everyone.<br />

There's morons on both sides, and your'e definitely one of them.</div></div><hr />

No my freind you are the one who is an idiot, and i never said all raiders. i know nearly every successful raid has a backbone of very attentive and skilled players. but i hear time and again this attitude that idiots dont get up there in droves and thats just poppy-cock.<br />
<br />
And in no way am i implying all raids are mindless. But you have to admit more are then are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arikash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What they're saying is that if they make quests that are easy to do it, the number of retards and asshats will grow exponentially.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes i understood thier feelings on that, my ill-worded rebuttle is such that the number of people will grow causing greater tension and higher visibility to asshats and said idiots. But with the game as far along as it is , there is no shortage of them who already have elemental access via E-bay, PA or just riding along on the coattails of the more capable.<br />
<br />
Unless your in the very high end of the game it is a safe stereotype from my experiences that at least half of your guild is indistinguishable from the vocal (or antics e.g. trains) monority of non-dedicated raiders.<br />
<br />
I do want to make it clear im not in any way putting down the choice of being a dedicated raider or suggesting that all of them are flawed, i find most of them are very easy to get along with and rather competent which is in accordance with the desire to succeed, but simply put A != B.</div></div><hr />

Are elemental flagging raids hard now?  Hell no, my guild is farming time.<br />
<br />
Were they when we were getting them done?  Many of them, yes.  That's the nature of the game... content at the edge of your ability is hard, once it's farm status it's not.  So no, our apps since then haven't necessarily 'worked' for their flags in the same sense (it's still a pain to get them all however).  Hopefully these alt quests require the same level of effort, and the same amount of time it took those 'afk and autoattack raiders' (sarcasm intended).  I'd be surprised if it did though... congrats on getting a gift!  Gimping the flagging encounters with level 70 wasn't enough, now it's time to give elemental access to anyone who can breathe.<br />
<br />
Getting the flags for time is a serious bitch, regardless of how you slice it... cor, rathe, xeg, all complicated encounters that are pretty easy to mess up.<br />
<br />
Implying that most people didn't work for their flags is asinine, and if the flags were so damn easy to get, they wouldn't be implementing a quest.<br />
<br />
It's my experience from grouping outside of my guild, that while there are exceptions, the majority of my server can't play worth shit.  Can't time a CH, can't duck a CH and SL, can't split, can't mez, panic when something goes wrong and make it worse, etc, etc.  Always exceptions.  And I don't know how well you play, but I do know you're clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Seku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ya gotta love WoS. I had LFG on and nothing was going on so went through NC and saw 4 folks headed to WoS all nekkid. So they invite me to tank for them in WoS. Like a fool I agreed. While they were rezzing and setting up at WoS ZI they managed to die 3 times due to trains. Now the trains aren't their fault but DAMN if trains are a problem move OUT of the tunnel to the side to avoid them. I didn't die once as I was smart enough to be invisible. I finally left in disgust.<br />

Sure would hate to see the same thing in Fire although it would be kind of funny to watch in Earth or Air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Killail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hi,<br />
  I would like to say a few words, about this, because lt does effect me. I am not flagged for Time yet. ITs my Goal and am working my butt off to get the flaggs. For me and how l play the game of EQ, its hard and eazy to get people willing to do the raids, I put together for flaggs. I do my homework l ask those who have done the raid, for &quot;battle tatics&quot;. This process l believe is like those who are only 1 or 2 flags away from being done. That l agree with, I have a necro that is only missing one or two flags. THose are raids hard to put together. ITs just a fact of EQ dumping down content is a way of life on EQ, hass been and always will be. I do agree with most if not all those who say that Plane of Time show be keyed and lock. It sad really, l put a lot of hard work into putting raids on for flags not only open end,but for my guild, IN the end am just one voice and one player. <br />
<br />
have fun and be safe <br />
         KILLAIL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have been trying to get into the EP's for over a year now and have been 3 flags away for about 6 months and I play(ed) about 4hrs+ per night at least 6 days a week.  The raider Vs. casual debate isn't the only problem with EQ....I want to raid and raid often, but most of the raiding guilds have already gone through the EP's and time.  What's left are sparatic raiding channels that are comprised mostly of idiots and grandstanding fucktards that were lucky enough to get dragged into the EP's+ or were ebayed.  So what am I to do with a 5K hp SK with no big guild connections?  With each new expansion those that already have twice my HP and AC get further and further ahead while I fade off into obscurity.<br />
<br />
   I'm not crying over the current situation, as the game is what it is and I started playing a little later then most, but if EQ2 pans out I will likely head there so I can be on the same field as everyone else for a change.  IMO, EQ is about adventuring to new places and fighting new mobs and I haven't been anywhere new or fought anything different in eons.  Thus, I am completely bored with the game and play solely to be amongst friends and hit the occassional small raid/bazaar gear target from time to time (and the rare successful raid channel/pick-up target).<br />
<br />
So what would I like? - I think the EP's should open up to all, but time should be left untouched....allowing everyone to get 2/3 of the way through a years old expansion isn't exactly shifting the balance of power in the universe.  Besides, those flags weren't meant to stop idiots and casual gamers as many suggest, they were put there to stop the uber from racing through before they could get the next expansion out....well it's been what 4 expansions since PoP?  I don't think anyone needs to cry over the EP's at this point.  There's also another reason to open up the EP's - the first tiers of PoP offer almost nothing in the way of loot as compared with what can be bazaar'd or LDoN'd which isn't a lot of incentive for the smaller guilds to work together for...I think opening up the EP's will help the newer and more casual players (that don't suck) find one-another and start solid guilds/alliances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Josahd - im not talking about your fun time when pop was fresh as a virgins pussy dipshit. im talking about NOW TODAY, this day the day where this was posted. Not years, and several expansions ago. Now count on one tally how many ticks of very tight encounters there are where someone doesnt have to be smarter then following simple riadinstructions and then count on the other tally how many you can get by with simply following simple raid instructions. <br />
<br />
Sorry to pee on your ego there but EQ is pretty stupid simple and always has been. Now if your going to tell me since im not exactly where you are i have 'no clue' then i tell you from somoene who does all casual grouping with strangers it really isnt that bad if you dont have a 10' pole lodged up your ass, I certinaly do not have as many or as frequent a problem as the higher end raider whiners do. And my % of problem people are about equal between EP + flagged raiders and not. The largest difference is the higher end geared folk have more leeway to hide thier incompetance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Wanted to pont out a couple more things after rereading all the posts in this thread:<br />
<br />
1) You can't compare old world content to PoP....true some of the old stuff has keys but PoP was the first multi-tiered/flagged expansions and there is no precedent....So saying &quot;they never had to do this before&quot; and &quot;mudflation always worked in the past&quot; is utterly retarded.  The problem isn't gear, it's finding enough competent people to put a dozen successful raids together consistantly.<br />
<br />
2) Implying that only uber people can survive EP+ is equally retarded...sure you can argue over one's ability to do CH and/or CC, but we tank (if we can even manage that on a raid).  It doesn't take overwhelming talent to /attack + /Piss off a mob.  I'm not saying that there aren't some well deserving uber SK's, but your gear isn't the only gage of your ability....If my neighbor happened to be the GL of club fu (one of the better ones on BB) I'm sure I would be an 8k+ hp SK rather then a 5K HP SK and my skillz would be no different.<br />
<br />
3) I completely agree about the morons pre-EP....I have yet to be on a raid where people haven't attacked before an assist was called and everyone followed simple, basic directions.  But where does this leave the few that can handle their toon?  As I said in my previous post (if you bothered to read that long-winded nonsense), I want to raid but the pickings are etremely thin for guilds looking to progress to high end content (sure there are a few that still hit luclin and such, but most are casual raiding and have little desire to do much else and I'm not one to join a guild just to wait for something better).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sorry if this is going to upset you, Hrafndarke.<br />
<br />
But these backflag quests are not for you (or any casualish player).<br />
<br />
They will be for raiding guilds to be able to skip having to redo ikkiniz4/uqua/inktuta for every few new apps. And that's it.<br />
<br />
The point is that even if your semi-casualish 20-30 ppl online guild all met up at the zone-in to txevu you would be able to do very little. <br />
Perhaps you are magining some kind of pick up raids made up of ppl exping in txevu... it's a joke. These zones are made specifically for raiding, theres nothing else to do in them... its bring 40-50 well geared (my gear is subpar for the content btw) ppl of the right mix of classes before you even think of zoning in. <br />
<br />
More than likely it's to help raiding guilds keep going when the inevitable loss of players occurs with EQ2 + WoW releases.</div></div><hr />

I guess that the quests will require drops or hails from the lower Tier Zones, which will require people to be 85% into<br />
<br />
So to get into PoE you will need to get into PoT, HoHb etc, for PoF SolRo etc.<br />
<br />
It doesn't look like they will open up Ele/Time to the casuals, well thats the way I read it.<br />
/shrug I am sure we will find out soon  :) <br />

Continuing your lunacy I see.  You assume much, but know little.  Thanks for informing me how long I've been flagged, or how difficult it was to get flagged.  You're proving my point, because you're wrong on all counts.<br />
<br />
To a guild on the edge of their abilities, getting flagged (to them) is as hard as it was for someone a year ago.  They might need less gear, or less numbers to do it, but it still requires effort.<br />
<br />
You're a typical grass is greener, jealous as hell of what other people have accomplished whiny bitch.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against people that are currently getting flagged.  I have issues with dipshits that want something for nothing.</div></div><hr />

If they open the EPs, its no biggie.  I will kite in Vxed while waiting for groups instead of fire.<br />
<br />
Time is not a flag but a key.  So, that will likely still be locked.  And for all the momo's out there....there is no requirement to be EP flagged to have a time key.  Only non EP god thing you need is Mystical Arbitor of Earth.  Other than that you can be raided in to all the other EP God Kills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Eggborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">At one time there was a lot of debate on this kind of issue on my Server.<br />
<br />
My former guild had broken up over the Luclin time sink in the past.  About 10 months ago, our leader showed up on line saying he wanted to reform.  Many who loved this guild came aboard and we got our Emperor kill, a few VT raids in and 90% of our members EPd.<br />
<br />
Our only problem was not that people werent skilled raiders and group members, it was that sometimes, the officers, and members had to afk for weeks sometimes.  This included the leader and some of the core.  The game moves on and people get antsy fast in EQ.   They want to see new things!!  <br />
<br />
We had two solutions for our low numbers:<br />
1.	We were good!! We did many EP access and EP (fire included) minis with 20 people!<br />
2.	We formed an alliance with a few guilds.  Well, for a while it got out of hand and was more than just a few guilds!!<br />
<br />
The alliance got a lot of flack with the same debates I see here, but for a while, it got my friends and I, who are decent players access to play in these zones we pay for every month, and the ability to play together with our friends who can play more often!!<br />
<br />
Eventually the lack of consistency did get us in the end and we were absorbed, into an awesome guild thank goodness! but absorbed.  Sadly, I had to say goodbye to long time friends retiring over it.  As a large guild with good members we do suffer from the same problems though.  There are always people who just cant play everyday, and may be unlucky enough to miss the nights we do those important raids needed to move on!!<br />
Yes we have allies, but not every guild can get along on the server always, so I have some good friends that should be with me on raid, but cant be!  I would very much support them getting a quest to come join the rest of their guild on raids and progression.  It sure beats them being bored, moving to another guild or retiring to some alt where I would see them rarely.<br />
<br />
If you click into a zone you cant play in, you die.  You move on.  If you dont, part of the game is avoiding the trains etc. of people who shouldnt be playing there.  Everyone pays the same for the game.  Just cause someone doesnt have the flag, doesnt mean they are an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps skillz was the wrong word to use...no doubt there are subtle nuances with each level of progression, but one's overall ability really doesn't change.  In other words, if you're a fucktard pre-EP you're likely a fucktard post-EP....progressing has just as much to do with the guild your in as it does your ability to play (though if you truly suck you're likely to be cut somewhere along the line).  Also, there's a huge difference between end-gamers such as yourself and someone at my level.....you need to be able to adjust and handle your SK on the fly as you likely have no information about new encounters.  I, on the other hand, have a plethora of knowledge and instruction to utilize with each new encounter....So, the things you learned in EP and beyond I already do because of this forum and other forums like it.  There's really not all that much gained at my level of progression.....the only exception would be if I were thrown into end-game I'm sure it would take me awhile to get the hang of things and I would likely suxxor in the mean time.</div></div><hr />

really this is not what's needed, whats needed is a backflaging solution for guilds, not more useless quest that no one will do or help with. quest that's harder/slower then the old way of flaging is not going to help with all the backflaging lot of guilds face:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new quest is easier than the old quest...hence the old quest results in a greater reward.  It's just the difference of doing it solo or doing it as a group.  If you thought the old quest was that much easier you can still do the old quest.  The only hard part of the key quest is the SF dragon requiring a raid.<br />
<br />
The worst part about VP now is the time sink for faction if you are there to quest rather than kill.  They make MM the only place to raise RoS faction basically and then up the experience in MM for sub level 35 players who get to run all the way there to watch a single level 65 clear the whole zone.  Not very fair to the noobs.</div></div><hr />

But these backflag quests are not for you (or any casualish player).<br />
<br />
They will be for raiding guilds to be able to skip having to redo ikkiniz4/uqua/inktuta for every few new apps. And that's it.<br />
<br />
The point is that even if your semi-casualish 20-30 ppl online guild all met up at the zone-in to txevu you would be able to do very little. <br />
Perhaps you are magining some kind of pick up raids made up of ppl exping in txevu... it's a joke. These zones are made specifically for raiding, theres nothing else to do in them... its bring 40-50 well geared (my gear is subpar for the content btw) ppl of the right mix of classes before you even think of zoning in. <br />
<br />
More than likely it's to help raiding guilds keep going when the inevitable loss of players occurs with EQ2 + WoW releases.<br />
<br />
Nah thats cool with me , if i wanted ep flagged id be ep flagged. <br />
<br />
And to the rest i agree completely, exactly what im saying. Its for guilds to keep the numbers they need to hit the content they earned. <br />

Everquest is a group / raid oriented game. One should know that when they buy it. Just because you pay for the game doesn't mean you will ever see even half of it. You pay vor the chance to see those zones but are garunteed nothing.<br />
<br />
There is a learning curve in EQ. I know knights that cannot get groups to save their lives because when they do MT for a group everyone except that knight ends up tanking for the group.<br />
<br />
Is EQ complicated? No of course not, hitting 5 or 6 buttons per mob in rapid succession doesn't take any real skill. But there are still those who cant figure out which buttons they are supposed to be hitting.<br />

There is ALOT of content I have still not seen in 5 years of playing this game. The difference is that you sound resentful (and there are alot of others like you) and I am not.

The obvious way to do this is allow the 85% in all zones and then a kill or a drop to perma flag you. That would make it only doable as a backflag, not a flag quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*puts on best grandpa voice*Let me tell you how it was during Kunark and SOL. I was in Legacy of Sorrow, one of the best guilds of the era, we were top 5 for clearing NToV, we did everything with stupid small numbers (Tunare with 22 pre-SOL), and we were assholes.<br />
<br />
This is how loot worked : I was the #1 SK during Kunark, therefore I got all choice SK loots first. Kojiro was #1 Paladin, so he got all choice Paladin loots first. Basheek was #1 Warrior, so he got all choice Warrior loots first. simple right? we farm the shit over and over so we're going to get more, so why fret, whine and cry? We were #1 in our class for a reason, time/effort put in. We played like maniacal madmen, EQ was an extension of our lives, and we earned every single copper piece. It was an accepted fact that Neku, our main monk and puller,  got all good all/all loot first, because he was our guild leader. It wasn't a democracy, it was cold, hard dictatorship. And we loved it. <br />
<br />
DKP to me leads to the downfall of all guilds, it creates too much of a 'democracy', the only thing I can stand other than the above mentioned loot order, is loot council - because thats somewhat similar, but it still doesn't have the excellent flavor that dictatorship does. Its hard now a days with rosters numbering in the low 100's, I wish EQ would return to the 50 or less guilds of years gone by :(.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say DKP is a democracy... if anything it's more of EQ communism, just join?  You have the same shot as anyone else on the top items, it makes every single person equal loot wise the only thing that matters is how often you raid and how often you &quot;buy&quot; loot, which brings me to another point... people who see loot as a paycheck for their work raiding piss me off.  People within a guild aren't equal, in almost any merit based system this will be reflected in who has what loot.<br />

<br />
Once your guild reaches a certain level of raiding, it was EP's for us, they get a lot of attention from people looking for a raid guild so they can gear up and move on.<br />
<br />
<br />
We had always done things on our own time table, and sometimes we were slow as hell getting to content, other times we blew through it.  We had a fairly casual approach and leaned towards individuals fun over guild progression.  As we gained more and more members a vocal minority of the newer members expressed displeasure with our approach and our apparant apathy towards progression at all costs.<br />
<br />
<br />
This lead to some pretty unhealthly mudslinging.  It drove away several long time members.  Members that poured every waking hour into our guild.  People that had put in 3 or 4 years of hard work, raiding, farming, and camping to get us to the EP level.  In fact we had a complete turnover of leadership (save for 2 people) twice in 6 months because a vocal minority would not stop throwing stones.  a few months later, we were left with a bunch of complaining followers and no leaders.  That was pretty much the end, the followers packed for greener pastures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Point?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Brael is right, the original core leadership took a fledging family guild and made it a EP capable raid guild.  They spent their EQ lives making that happen, then they were ridiculed by the membership for playing favorites, being self centered and above all or being greedy.  Without those &quot;old timers&quot; our guild would not have existed as a raid guild in the first place, and without them it fell apart.  So yes those that put in years to your guild deserve every break they get, they have earned it, people with 6 months in your guild are most times johnny come latelys looking to catch a ride to the top.<br />

<br />

Man I fucking hate newbies.<br />
<br />
With all the recent additions to the game such as: Level 70, all-access pass to great exp zones like WoS, MPG, Riftseekers, access to great droppable loot, new spells, new AA, there really is no excuse nor a reason why making an alternate quest to get EP flagged or GoD flagged should even be considered. <br />
<br />
First of all if you cant get EP flagged or GoD flagged on your own as a guild, with all of these new additions for both the hardcore player as well as the most casual, you really don't belong in those zones. Cry and bitch all you want, but seriously, if you can't get EP flagged on your own with all this stuff added in, then give up. Seriously, if you cant get flagged for an EP zone but you can exp in MPG it was just not meant to be. If you want to see newer things in game, but your guild consists of only friends who like to chat, then find a newer guild that fits your needs. As many like to say when they quit a guild &quot;if we are really friends, it shouldn't matter what guild tag we wear&quot;.<br />
<br />
Secondly why do people feel that because they are a casual player, zones should just open up for them because they pay a monthly fee? Why do you feel you deserve any special treatment in getting into these zones the older players who now have access busted ass day in and day out, without any of these new toys OoW gave us. It is all a part of the game. You want access to XXX zone, you gotta dedicate some time to it. You have a real life, girlfriend, job, lover on the side you need to spend time with? Fine. That doesnt mean the game should be made any easier for you because of it.<br />
<br />
Flagging into EP was a pain, backflagging sucked even more, but the reward for finally being EP flagged was well worth it. Go. Reorganize your friendchat guilds and become more focused on raiding if you want in. Get level 70 and farm some spells, farm some items, get some AA's, go in and you will see that its easier then you realized. If, however, you expect zones to open up for you because its old content or because its just not fair to the casual gamer, then wait for the ezpass quests to come out.<br />
<br />
A fair few months ago the time flagged guild I was in discused fair distribution of DKP. There was a core of old timer guild players that wanted bonus recognition.<br />
<br />
I will say to you what I told them. I don't give a fuck what you did two years ago, its what you do NOW that matters. I don't expect favours for having been a hard core raider in 99, and I sure as hell wont give you dkp just coz you were there for loot in 2001.<br />
<br />
If you are clinging onto some form of elitism because the planes are being opened up some when you should be focused on oow and god then bluntly you need to get over it.<br />
<br />
As for the idiot quotient. There are a crapload of idiots in uber guilds let alone raid guilds generally. Wake up already.<br />
<br />
As for older members in the guild. These are people who have stuck by it thru thick and thin. Everyone eventually needs a break from EQ, to straighten rl stuff out or whatever reason. When they do come back you should be treating them with some damn respect so they want to stay in your guild. You treat your older members like crap, they will find other guilds to give that same dedication too...and believe me, other guilds will snatch them up in a heartbeat. <br />
<br />
I always find it funny when someone says that its elitism or those who are EP flagged somehow feel they are better then someone else and thats why we dont want them there. Fact is...its game progression, and you are trying to jump it. If we had to kill it then you should have to kill it as well. Pure and simple. If XXX encounter was hard for us, then it should be hard for you. You want in, then you should earn it the same way. <br />
<br />
My final thought in this post. If you want to progress in this game, you seriously need to take a long look at your guild. If it doesnt have the tools or the talent to progress then you will be forced to decide whether you are happy just being where you are or if you need to look elsewhere (like I am sure many of us have had to do). If you want to apply to a higher end guild, make sure you can devote the time to it that they require. When you fill out their app, make sure you follow their application format (if they have one) and dont just put &quot;yeah I wanna join your guild to kill big stuff&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plane of Time, Kodtaz, Yxxta and several other raid zones are being made to follow the 85/15% rule. <br />
<br />
There will be single group or small raid force events that will flag you for specific zones. There will also be raid drops that essentially flag you for that zone. For example, an equivalent to the Quintessence of Elements will drop in Plane of Time itself and will flag you for Plane of Time (maybe after a short quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Rezzinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Actually, I read the entire &quot;backflag quest&quot; as um, exactly that.  Instead of a guild pulling out of their current raid targets to go down a few steps to backflag a much needed cleric or wtfever add, by killing a target that guilds actuallly need to progress thus stunting their growth, this is the alternative.  More than likely it involves people who are already flagged from the encounter they're trying to get a new member past so he can help with current raids, and probably involves stuff from zones beyond the one he's trying to backflag for.  This would  essentially keep the &quot;casuals&quot; out of the zones that everyone wants them out of, since it would basically require a guild that is already past that point to progress the person through the flaggage.  This frees up spawns (like the various pop sub bosses) and keeps guilds from having to redo an already completed event such as Ikk4 to get one person a sliver.  Stuff like that, I would assume, unless I'm way reading this entire thing wrong.  How that can be a bad thing in anyway, I just don't know =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Culdahl1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I agree with brael.....Time served should weigh in on loot decisions to an extent.  Exceptions would be if the veteran player is only raiding when there is loot to be won and is abusing his/her senority... also, if the new player has been giving 90% for 6 months or more and proven themselves to be a team player.  You've got to protect the loyal guild members from the loot-whores that guild jump.</div></div><hr />

I've went through the shit fest of Veeshan, I've seen good friends who come to every raid, play 110%, and end up getting jack shit because a warrior decided that a 20 Hp boost on a BP is worthwile putting in a request for. <br />

DKP is the fairest form of loot award, sometimes one might have to make a step away from it, such as epics, or flag/key drops. But 95% of the time, DKP works best, and fuck anyone who cries about their &quot;two years in the guild&quot; Anyone who complains that they should be given preferential treatment hurts the guild by causing the newer members to lack in equipment, and the guild getting a reputation for using &quot;news&quot; to deck out the &quot;olds&quot;<br />

Your argument is flawed to fuck and back, because in the end, everyone (besides clerics and enchanters) is Equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Hrafndarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">5 years vs 2 months going for the extremes are we. Well yes id consider a five year member over a .000005 second member too. DUH.<br />

Try 4 years, now attending 30% vs 1 year attending 90%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">4 Years of solid 30% or 4 years and they're now down to 30%?  Either would be worth more than you though.<br />

Ulvian, people aren't equal.  Older members always get smaller upgrades, if you went by upgrade strength the newest people would be the only ones to get loot at all times.</div></div><hr />

If Ulvian was in a guild for 5 years and had a Vindi BP, and a new member came along, and say some 300HP BP dropped, and he had some faggot piece of shit from the bazaar. By your ideals, since he is EQUAL to you, he should get the 300hp BP, since its a bigger upgrade for him? :)<br />
<br />
Fuck that, thats fucking sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I completely disagree with Brael. So youd special reward some 4 year vet who half asses through 20% of the raids then some new blood who burns his ass to meet not only 90%+ of all raids but goes out of his way to help everyone. It hate to join your guild. Maybe id put a toon in then go play others until i had some seniority.<br />
<br />
In the type of guild in question, someone who &quot;half asses through 20% of the raids&quot; would never become a 4 year vet.  <br />
<br />
DKP is the fairest form of loot award, sometimes one might have to make a step away from it, such as epics, or flag/key drops.

<br />
Fairest?  Probably.  Best for a hardcore progression-driven guild?  Not really.  DKP works great for the more casual guilds, but a well-lead merit system is the best way to make a guild more powerful.  For a hardcore raiding guild, the #1 goal of every member is, theoretically, the advancement of the guild rather than personal gain.  Gear is there to enable players to do their job better, thus helping the guild advance further; it is not a reward for showing up to a raid.  <br />
<br />
Hardcore raiding guilds and more casual guilds are two different mindsets.  The former is a single, cohesive unit; the latter is a body of individuals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Ulvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">True, but in a merit based system one has to hope that all the players understand the concept of themselves being equivalent of a cell in an organism. That organism being the guild, their guildies being other cells, etc. One cell's strenght is meaningless if the others are weak.<br />
<br />
Also you are taking another extreme comparing a BP which nowadays is eclipsed by LdoN shit, with a high end loot piece.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to is an ideal system would combine Dkp and merit, but no one would go for it. Merit alone offers too much in terms of greed affecting the free hand preferentialism, and DKP simply offering too much to the lifeless. Whereas before we have stated that dependability is a huge factor in a player's merit.<br />
<br />
Given the time of four years, someone who attends 30% Of the raids, versus someone who has only been in the guild for a year or so, and has attended 90 percent of the raids, as welll as offered extracurricular effort...I would merit-award the 1 year player. Given the older member did recently also recieve an item or two. This is a fully imaginary situation where these two members both want an item, and both have recently had the same amount of loot.<br />
<br />
Far as flagging goes, considering that is the main conversation issue here. I rephrase. Elementals are in no way challenging, I don't see why the flags for them shouldn't be trivialized a bit. I mean come the fuck on, Saryrn, Hedge, Bertox are  NOTHING else but severe fucking pain in the ass flags. Elemental planes aren't THAT complicated. And fucknuts will learn in terms of deaths not to exp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">So what you (and several others) are saying is, &quot;It's easy, so it needs to be made easier.&quot;  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">As far as the DKP vs. Merit derail goes...<br />
<br />
For a progression-driven guild, the best system would not &quot;combine Dkp and merit.&quot;  The best system would be a merit system.  Merit systems mean that the loot goes to the player in who's possession it will benefit the guild the most.  When the goal is advancment of the guild rather than personal gain, that's the perfect way for things to be done.  <br />
<br />
Sure, it requires excellent leadership, but that's kinda prerequisite to being a hardcore raiding guild to begin with anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Kyfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The problem with merit is that it has the potential to cause 10x the drama. Most guilds would rather have the slightly less efficient dkp method just to keep life simple and clear of whining/arguing/ranting/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Falthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">It's all good until until the horse you rode in on decides to retire or move on somewhere else because he/she is suddenly bored or grown tired of the drama.<br />
<br />
Having been on both sides and being the guild leader of a Qvic level guild... I'll take DKP for 500 Alex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>kuulaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Our guild fell apart not because of loot issues persay, but the desire of newer members wanting to have a set raid schedule and an open recruiting policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
We used to argue all the time about loot in a merit based system, after we went to DKP those arguments left and gave way to the above arguments.  It finally ate us up, but in the end I would not do things differently.  I had lots of fun during my 5 years in EQ and helped lead an honorable and well respected guild into the elements.  Yes it fell it apart in the end, but nothing lasts forever and our current and former members have built friendships that are lasting well after their EQ time has past, I am more happy about that than about anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Ulvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Frankly, far as guilds falling apart, I think its partially caused by the huge ass gap between the gear availeable to casual players, and the gear availeable to even the mid-tier raiders.<br />
<br />
The gap between gear has increased from 20-30 Hp per piece, with a neat effect like 5 Damage Shield, or EB, to 200 Hp per piece, and 6-12 Damage at the same delay (1h weapon). This makes EQ extremely unfriendly to newer players, and when those newer players enter guilds, they most definitely will have much shittier gear than someone who raids elemental planes. <br />
<br />
So you sit at a double issue: New players actually being valuable to their guilds far as their designated job of Dps, Tanking, or Healing goes. And old members being pissed off that in DKP systems newbies have assloads of slots to upgrade. So when the new, bazaar geared players enter, they are immediately thought of as moochers, because they are far inferior to a member who's even half-assedly raid equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Elkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">If they implement a flagging quest for potime, I'll be highly pissed.  However, there's no precedent for unlocking end game zones, all the way back to kunark.  The one change I'd support is somehow allowing the 2/3 rule to apply to time.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Mobhunter:<br />
<br />
Backflagging came up more than once this event and SOE appears to have a viable solution in the works. SOE will extend the 85-15 flagging rule, the rule that allows 15% of a raid to enter a flagged zone without the flag, to Time and many Gates zones. Raid mobs within flagged zones will drop one or two quest items that let unflagged members begin a quest to receive a permanent flag for that zone. Flags achieved this way will not backflag characters for previous zones. A Time flag quest, for example, will not award a Fire flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Beliaux_Dspayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">New people joining the guild often get upgrades &quot;very&quot; quickly. Not because of lack of DKP but because much of the stuff that drops is not a huge upgrade to current members. Seriously,if you have old time members looting the smallest of upgrades over someone who has crap gear,it's because that member doesn't have a set goal.In my guild I see one or two full members who ask for almost any kind of upgrade,but based on our system they often don't get them over newer members.<br />
<br />
My guild has a merit + DKP system.It's based on attendance and last piece looted. Pretty simple sounding,but our Officers have to keep very good records to make it work. Only one time have we had two members who had exact same attendance and DKP. Those two decided to random to see who won rather than make Officer decide. I've been here almost a year and it's the first /ran I've seen outside of XP groups.<br />
<br />
The argument of newer members getting loot over older doesn't matter if the older members know what they want. Just looking at current content for your guild makes gear decisions pretty easy.I used my Alla's account and did searches for gear in my current content + 1 and made a list of what's acceptable upgrades.If something drops that isn't on the list,I'm ready for the next mob. /shrug<br />
<br />
Newer members not getting gear? Get that Time flag and you'll see so much stuff rotting you won't know what to do with yourself. It's nothing to see someone newly flagged get 5 to 10 &quot;huge&quot; upgrades in one night. The only classes that don't seem to feel that love is Plate classes. Silk,leather and chain are often givin to new members whereas plate is still heavily contested when we do back flagging. Tier 1 thru 4 of Time has very little stuff that is still needed by majority of guild.Phase 5 and Quarm is the only stuff we are still farming.<br />
<br />
As far as adding a Quest to Flag someone for Time or KT,more power to them. It will still lock out the majority of casual players who aren't in the large Raiding guilds.It will also alleviate the Backflagging burnout we often get of doing Coirnav for the 50'th time to flag two people.It will also let the big mobs stay up for those guilds who are still working on PoP progression.<br />
<br />
All they need to do now is Instance Plane of Time and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />
