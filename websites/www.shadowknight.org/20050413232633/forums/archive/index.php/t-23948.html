<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been trying to get the AC25 augments from the Phyrillen Riftseeker man in the Riftseeker zone.  I am 3 boxing a Clr/Rog/SK.<br />
<br />
I can clear the area without too much trouble - but I can't seem to get past the Charm on the Riftseeker.  He always seems to cast it first - it always seems to stick - the SK bashes the cleric - it is an automatic-wipe. (My Sk has about 250 magic resist buffed.)<br />
<br />
My question is has anyone found a strategy to avoid being charmed or to avoid having the named mobs cast charm in this zone.<br />
<br />
Note: I know if i'm in a full group one guy being charmed is no big deal - but on my server there arn't too many people &quot;Looking for Group&quot; in this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's resistable, but with a -350 resist check, you're not going to be resisting it very often on 250 buffed MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">drop rogue for a bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not always so easy when you're boxing... you kinda need to have access to the character to bot it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>pazuzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes sadly I can't switch the rogue into a bard.....but out of curiosity - what can the bard do?  Are there any other classes that by themselves would help... I can focus on finding them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also notice that the mobs don't seem to cast charm after about 75% health...I just can't get past the first 30 seconds of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Croix VorAbaddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">but out of curiosity - what can the bard do?  <br />
<br />
Resists first off. Not difficult with /melody, I'd imagine.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you can time it right, and are good - Group DA. Hit it right as charm is cast, and perhaps it will fire, block charm, and you can keep going. Dunno how long till the mob recasts though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>window</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bard is just the easiest way to get your MR to 525+, and if you want to resist the charm consistently that's what you need.<br />
<br />
also, if your clr has radiant cure that should get rid of the charm after its landed, or the purify soul or whatever other clr AA would definitely get rid of it, but i don't think that'd help much because they seem to keep one person charmed pretty constantly</div></div><hr />
