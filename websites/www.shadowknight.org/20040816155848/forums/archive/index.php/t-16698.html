<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, im currently using a Black Rock Maul of Crushing ...23/23 15 int 75hp/75mana...what would u guys suggest i aug it with, DD or Lifetap...im thinkin LIfetap then i dont gotta worry bout choosing between MC and SoD.....any comments/flames/whatever may help. Thanks a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well,you can do what I'm doing for starters- go for one of the cheap 40ish point DD procs,then save up for a good one.<br />
 <br />
I like the Ykesha proccing (DD+Stun) and the lifetap ones,personally. I know one guy that's swearing by the poison DD ones,but I tend to be the hammer and shield guy that's mashing casters. Lifetap = fewer heals on me, stuns = more interrupted spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hadnt thought of the stun idea..sounds like a plan, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the guard procs&gt;all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im gonna do a dd, or a DoT in my Gso4w.  I really dont think the very small taps that ive seen available will be anymore effective, So im just gonna go with what i can get more dmg output with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would think Lifetap would be best if our AA works with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah. ya know how much a 75pt tap helps when your getting one rounded from 200-550. HELLA MITIGATION YO!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhowne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lifetap procs also put a dent into AE's...  ;) <br />
<br />
It's hard to say what the 'best' proc to add is - it depends on the situation for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For pve where you are not the main tank, probably lifetap is best.  For pvp, probably ykesha stun is best.  For tanking, probably guard is best.  Tough to say though.<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">75dd tap would seem effective if you have SA3 and are tanking KC...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SA only stacks with your innate procs, unless I am sorely mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok well then change that to ToL3 and it still isnt great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Solan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My personal opinion is that lifetap procs add up and hence i want as many of them as I can possibly get. That is just my view though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Krushum- have you been using guard proc augments? How's it been performing for mitigation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do you use SoC then?  It's only 65hp (assuming no SA...) - that's nothing compared to the output of mobs these days.  <br />
<br />
Seriously, every advantage you can get adds up.  A few ac or a small chunk of HP isn't really going to do much for you, but I'm betting you take all HP/AC upgrades you can get.  Any upgrade available will add up.  Just because it isn't game-breaking doesn't mean it's not good.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that the lifetap is necessarily the best; I personally prefer it because of versitility &amp; the fact that I just rather like lifetaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nostradomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am thinking of putting different proc on different weapons making each for a specific purpose.  I am thinking of putting Guard on my BBB, with the rune effect and SoC it will add just that much more to my durability on tougher mobs.  <br />
<br />
I am thinking of putting 150 dd and stun proc on my Opalescent 2hand Sword as my dps weapon with MC for Ldon groups and DD roles.   <br />
<br />
One thing about the Guard procs tho, is it really nessessary you think to get Guard 4.  Too get the full 5% melee shielded for 200 we would have to be fighting mobs that hit for 4k.  This may be realistic for warriors but what about sk?  I am thinking that Guard 3 would be more than sufficient for us since we dont take on mobs that hit for that much and we can save some points.<br />
<br />
Also, how much aggro does the dd/stun proc produce?  I would like a decent amount of aggro from it help keep aggro with my Opalescent since the pet proc doesnt do anything to help with gaining and keeping aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you want the weapon to be used for damage, why in the world would you want aggro on the proc?  To put it bluntly: you suck if you need procs to hold aggro, and higher aggro procs can kill you when your in full burn on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, with SA2, SoC does 130 lifetap, add 100 from GSH, and another 75 drop lifetap proc, thats almost 300 dmg, which is fairly decent. Considering mobs in bot hit from 300s-400s mostly, that almost negates there attacks. Not completely, because proc rates are not consistent unless I have avatar up, but its pretty decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hey Granoch,We are NOT the MTs in the guild obviously, Gizak is...But if u added a Lifetap proc to your wep, Since we kill dragons so much, U wont get burnt from there AoE DDs and such when we do that...I was thinking of doing the same thing, And the drags prolly would resist the stuns to make them even reasonably respectful, But of course, The Lifetaps may nhot go through either, Unless we Malo it...Which when we kill Talendor and things of that calibur, We really never malo it cauyse we usually only brign like 2 groups lol...But, Whatever u decide is cool...Im just saying Choose wisely =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Guard 2 =) done thanks for all the input guys..btw Guard does Mitigate alot..its wonderful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Averse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Havent tried it but heard the Mirror Aug is really nice.  It blocks spells and has a chance to reflect the damage back on the caster.  Friend said he was bouncing 700+ nuked from giants in BoT back onto em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Working on putting mirror iii in my one hander...i have guard 2 in my wmbs, and thinking if i put mirror in my Black Rock Maul, when im using shield to bash casters..gives the chance to send that ice comet right back to them..what do you guys think? am i wasting my time and points puttint guard in my WM? im not elemental flagged, im only lvl 55...what u think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What about mirror for pvp?  Would it have a chance to reflect manaburn or lifeburn or harmtouch back at the caster?  If so.. that would be a LOT of fun to see some people's surprise expressions hehe...<br />
<br />
-Bolas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Morgrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thankfully, our HT's are unreflectable.<br />
 <br />
Lifetaps however are funny as hell. You end up not only damaging them, but healing from the tap as well (Reflects treat you as the caster).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I may be a newb, But could some people explain wya some of these are? Guard 2? Shield? WTF!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ziggy my boy, these are new procs that came out with LDon...btw there are mobs in Ldon that have mirror on them....our mage cast flames of sirocco, and killed himself :( lol it mirrored all 3 hits.<br />
<br />
Little info on guard ii...<br />
<br />
Max dmg migitated 100..5% of total hit not to exceed 100..so in order to get the max mitigated mob would have to hit ya for 2k or so, but ive noticed even on mobs that hit for 300..the dmg it does mitigate makes a HUGE difference, this is the best proc ive seen for a long time..as far as mirror goes..it kinda sucks..18sec duration 5% chance to return spell to the caster..seeing a necro get hit with his own Funeral Pyre is kinda funny lol =p<br />
 anyway, im no gonna waste my time with mirror on my onehander but go for more guard!! i am FIRM believer in the guard procs and for tanking LDoN its ok..but say a PoP group..it rocks.. im gonna put it on my bow for when im pulling and give me the chance to get guard up before the mob gets back to camp..anyway..thats my experience with guard, its great..everyone should try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vinnayeny Vloshanaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">THE LIFE TAP SUCKS ASS...it doesnt add up, it barely fucking exists. Yes i do take substantial ac/hp upgrades because those are solid. <br />
<br />
And wtf is the knock in effect it has seriously.  It was oh so impressive to crit this stupid thing for 21 once.  DISSOLVED</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>TwobittRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">does the yheska proc have a high resist rate do to the stun? wondering if this will ever work in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>MasterVicker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok, I am hearing more and more that the LT augs suck ass.  You have my ears now on this guard thing.  I am quickly approaching 60.  I dont understand the diff. between gaurd 2-3-4.  What I dont understand is would I be losing value if i got the lvl 4 aug and am not being hit by mobs that hit for mucho.  <br />
<br />
Keep this good info coming.<br />
<br />
Vicker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>GranochTonka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Based on personal parsing and reading other sites, Guard III is more than enough, to get full effect of Guard IV a person would have to be tanking the likes of Quarm =p but anyhow, mirror is moving up quickly on my list..it can reflect AE's....Guard ii is plenty if you dont plan on tanking even 3rd tier..Guard III will suffice for elementals, so do what you will, Guard for us is more of a EXP Grp thing than a raid thing as Mirror would seem to have much more of a use on raids with the AE's flying..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Yabyab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Vinna, you just contradicting yourself calling lifetap sucky just because its 75damage/heal. And you getting a 150dd proc and call it better than the lifetap?<br />
<br />
 Since when does extra 75 damage means alot in terms of DPS? (assuming you are at least level 40+) a +75 damage per proc is just a 0.25 melee round that barely noticeable. But, the lifetap proc &quot;could&quot; save you your life when you get a delayed CH by double proccing or criticalling with SCF3 + ToL thats 300 healing.<br />
<br />
 Lifetap procs works with SCF3 AND ToL3 so you would get 2 AA skills working. While the DD you getting is just affected by SCF3 and everyone know that the DPS added is, Nada, Nothing, totally not noticeable. Unless you planning to group in KC with monsters of 1k HP total (still 75 more damage means nothing to these sucky monsters).<br />
<br />
 Lifetap procs helps &quot;alot&quot; when you solo. Much more than plain raw DD proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Hknightismaname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Mirror only works for spells that can be cast by PC so if NPC is casting a spell that is not flagged as PC spell then it wont work.<br />
And Mirror 1 has only like 5% chance of reflecting and Mirror III has like 15%. I have Mirror I on my Lance of Flame knight and never worked for me :mad: <br />
<br />
Now i have Rujurkan Bile on Ornate Greatblade works really nice with Dot and SoC all three procs goes off all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT : I didnt like Life tap procs because of the knock back effect.</div></div><hr />
