<br />
i quit playing EQ back then for the ole lady she was tired of competing for my attention with the comp hehe<br />
<br />
anyways i have been thinking of maybe making a return to the game i left just as legacy of ykesha was coming out. i made it to level 62 as a troll sk and had seen some of the end game up that point...<br />
<br />
i guess the question on my mind is ... how is EQ nowadays for SK's if i was to return i would play no other class but a troll sk but i remember being a bit disgruntled towards certain areas of the SK class in game <br />
<br />
any feedback would be appreciated<br />

I'll never forget one time you pulled the fear temple on a skyfire raid, just to get me umbral, since all the monks left and everyone else wanted to leave.<br />
<br />
I'm still on prexus, pm me here or look me up as Falarka if you have access to any account or eqim.<br />

<br />
btw, the guy who took over your account changed the name, and he's not too bright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alot of people disagree, because GoD has limited the role of a hybrid in tanking situations, but versatility will always outweight auto attack imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll need alot of aa (I assume you have next to none being lvl 62) but gear is incredibly easy to come across. You can get elemental/time level gear in one group situations in a multitude of zones. <br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell if you need advice : )</div></div><hr />
