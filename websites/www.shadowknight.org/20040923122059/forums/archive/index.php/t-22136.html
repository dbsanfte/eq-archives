<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Booze the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Server Update on July 16th<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
The servers will again be coming down tonight at 4AM PDT (July 16th,2004) to correct some AA issues and a few other lingering problems that resulted from the AA system change.  With the update,on the 14th, we changed the AA system to allow for more flexibility and control as we move forward and add additional AAs.  All of the AAs were affected by this change.  Some of the AAs have since been behaving incorrectly and we feel that these AA problems are enough of a hindrance to gameplay that it is necessary to correct them tonight. <br />
 <br />
Some of the issues we will be correcting tonight are;<br />
- Problems with Fading Memories <br />
- An issue with warrior shielding<br />
<br />
<br />
Look for a more detailed list with the update.<br />
<br />
<br />
We apologize to those of you, who had raids and other activities scheduled tonight and thank you for your patience.<br />
 <br />
Thanks all.<br />
<br />
The Community Team</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And they were supposed to have tested that first patch for an extra week?  What were they testing?  Zoning pets?  Removable augments?  They didn't think through the effects on some of the VP items.  They didn't thoroughly test the revising of the AA system.  So what did they do with that extra week?  At this point, I'm expecting yet another patch on Monday morning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SA3/SCF would fall under that category in my opinion, so I'd say yes.</div></div><hr />

They are beta testing Patch on US servers and only patch our once. No multiple repop for us Frogs</div></div><hr />

<br />
It counts as a loss on your LDoN record.  I've never heard of SOE doing anything to change that, and it's happened to me twice.  And what do you mean by refunding the points?  It's not like you lose any for failing a mission in LDoN, you just don't gain any.  And they won't just give you the points, because they have no way of knowing if you were going to win or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Androsulach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They should at least nullify the loss if you're in an adventure when the server is downed.</div></div><hr />

plus a buttload of named loots from various zones /hug rangerbot tracker<br />
My fiances slew of 8 alts couldnt be happier heh</div></div><hr />

txevu crashed in the middle of our raid yesterday and everyone there got rolled back. Byebye to names and the loot that already dropped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krushum Gudended</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">on innoruuk we are used to that, everyone forces a hardsave after looting</div></div><hr />

the guilds who are just into VT should be quite thankful sony is full of incompetence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">sorry for the offtopic post on vt but here it goes<br />
<br />
my guild is killing the shit out of VT.  we are most grateful for sony's BS.  hitting VT 3 times in one week is doing wonders for my guilds gear and is helping me stockpile DKP.<br />
<br />
plus VT is the win.  2 months of hitting up VT on a semi regular basis has geared up our non zerg raid force very nicely.  in 2 weeks of work we have become flagged for sol ro.  Agnarr saryrn bert MM all dead.  most were first attempts.  only MM beat us on our first try.  we had a ranger on the tiles.  he got guildremoved.   its amazing how little challenge PoP has presented to a guild that has just gotten its feet wet in VT.  sometime next week we should be elemental.  we rarely even CoH in VT.  we just train the raid repeatedly and offtank/ mezz them all.  only wipes we ever had was the interfloor agro BS.<br />
<br />
they used to say guk taught people how to play the game and it was true at the time.  VT teaches your guild how to raid properly.  just getting into VT teaches individual members how to work as a team for a common goal.  Everything about it teaches teamwork and raid skills.<br />
<br />
oh yeah forgot to mention this.  VT is extremely knight friendly.  Unslowed Eoms can be a little rough at times but everything except the named mobs is easily tankable by VT level knights.  If your guild is thinking about jumping into elementals the path to there is through vex thall.</div></div><hr />

Harsdave = teh win!</div></div><hr />
