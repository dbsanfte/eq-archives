<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>daarth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was duoing with a necromancer in PoD.  I would pull and fester and not long after would notice that my fester would be terminated after a necro was casting his level 20 darkness spell.<br />
<br />
I found that just a bit annoying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zakton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So the necro was casting Dooming darkness and you were using festering?   Or was the necro using a higher darkness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>daarth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necro was casting dooming.  He was a level 58 necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wizards tend to &quot;shackle&quot; mobs, also overwrites FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgaull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I recall... Dooming has been known to overwrite a number of snares, including all the Ranger ones.<br />
<br />
In fact I seem to rememeber reading once that, at one point, Dooming canceled out all other Snares except for the one recently removed from the Druid Epic.<br />
my fester would be terminated after a necro was casting his level 20 darkness spell. <br />
Dooming is level 29 for Necros.<br />
<br />
But still, if it is true about Dooming overwriting most other snares out there, and Necros get it at 29, then no wonder a level 58 Necro would still be using it in the Plane of Decease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taelnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Something I've noticed is that snare spells with the same level snare component will overwrite each other.<br />
<br />
Which means, dooming, festering, the wiz spell, ranger spells, etc.. all don't stack, but they also don't block, they just remove previous spell effect.<br />
<br />
What I'd rather see is have them stack(similar to dot stacking, actually mixed with it).  It's annoying to have a high damage dot snare overwriting by a no damage snare, or a lower damage one.<br />
<br />
Ideally i'd see the higher dot snare block the lower level dot snare of same line, stack with other dot snares of other lines, or itself from another caster.  Also &quot;stack&quot; with other snares, Is it really overpowering to have two snares on the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>daarth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have level of spell wrong, but it is a necro casting &quot;DOOMING DARKNESS&quot;.<br />
<br />
He was level 58 when I encountered this.  He is now level 60 and I was duoing lightcrawlers with him last night.  My Fester would not overwrite his Dooming.  His Dooming does overwrite my Fester.  <br />
<br />
We agreed we would try some other necro/SK spell issues on next we duo again.  One will be me casting my own Dooming Darkness instead of Fester to see if I can overwrite his Dooming and vice versa.  We are also going to try to see what happens with the boil/ignite blood series.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kizzestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necro epic overwrites FD as well. Often spells with a bigger hp component will overwrite a higher level spell with a lower hp component no matter how good the rest of the spell is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros use dooming, even at high levels, because of the low cast time. the higher darknesses take *forever* to cast...<br />
<br />
...and their mana saved by using a lower darkness is better spent on higher ratio less resistable dots. plenty of nice necro dots are functionally unresistable, whereas darkness line is quite resistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaBlade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In PoD a couple days ago, I was grouped with a 61 SK guildmate, who's Festering darkness would over-ride my dooming darkness. He taunted me about it because I don't have FD yet, so I remember it clearly. :)<br />
