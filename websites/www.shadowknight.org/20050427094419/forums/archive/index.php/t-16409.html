<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of people give me crap for being thrown out of our city by frogs. Is this really a bad thing? Think about it. We got thrown out of a swamp that was just slightly more than a couple of mud piles and huts and we got tossed INTO a thriving city (And the coolest and largest city) in Norrath. If you ask me thats upgrading my friend not losing anything. And what did the frogs gain? Let's see they lived in a swamp anyway with undead things so what has changed? Nothing!! Ha, thank you frogloks for helping us move in. Now, can we help you take the wheels off your trailer?<br />
<br />
/cackle<br />
<br />
   Oh dont worry I'll still kill them if I see them. They broke my entertainment center on the move. Trust me I'm never using A gay god and a frog company to move again<br />
<br />
Hold you head up high trolls! (You do that already when your sitting but...) Be proud of your new home!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my troll has no home city since the swamp was taken. he is bound in overthere, one of the less crowded areas close to a bank and pok book<br />
<br />
id like to see an evil race take a good town in recompense. maybe dark elves assisted by trolls take halfing down? burn it to the ground i say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To be honest in Kug's story he doesnt like trolls due to his shorter height. But I think trolls alone or even DE's alone could take Rivervale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good idea, send it to SoE. Tell them that the Trolls are looking for a new home and wanna go halfling bashing. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drynnious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually before EQ2 Freeport will fall to the DE's. But Neriak falls to the Halfling's I believe. This will probably happen in one of the upcoming expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah. I think Sony EQ is biased against evil races. NOTICE that no dark race has taken over anything. This means that 2 light races take over 2 dark cities and 1 dark race takes over 1 crappy city thats already evil. Oh well. At least we get the boat too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duke Xerro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Boo... Dark Elves are cool, they should conquer Norrath.</div></div><hr />

I have 6 AA points that say otherwise.<br />
<br />
I had people coming down to Grobb and cheering me on as I laid waste to every frog in there that could die.</div></div><hr />

You still got your asses kicked by tad-poles, get over it. :p</div></div><hr />

Neriak is too crowded. I'm bound and buy/sell in Cabilis. I am also very well liked in Paineel. I prefer other Cazicites to those inny worshippers in Neriak. <br />
<br />
Dated a DE once, never again. It was constantly &quot;I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU.... i'm sorry.. I love you so much... I CAN'T STAND YOU!<br />

Heh, who needs it? I'd rather deal with those Euridite babes..</div></div><hr />

I'd help. Halfings have had it too good for too long. Time for evolution to take a step forward and leave those fury toed bastards behind*.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Master</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, in the storyline most of the troll army was &quot;away.&quot; So the frogloks didn't really win, because out of pure logic it couldn't be done. But it makes you wonder, since most of the army was away, wtf did they do when they returned? Just give up and  move into Nerick? I'm sure a troll could take on about 4 or 5 frogloks. Lil frog hopp'n mother fuckers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol!!<br />
<br />
In all reality i think they did this to the worst group of all norrath. I think trolls are the most connected to their hometown than all other races. Hell at least i was. I was so pissed i went down and joined some of those who were camping the frogs which were a good variety of high elfs and trolls ogres and others hehe.<br />
<br />
Now that i think about it im still pissed.<br />
<br />
Damn at least they coulda bunked us with the ogres so we dont have to duck under all those little ratholes that the Inkys call doors! Theres still stuff to bash there too. <br />
<br />
I guess the good part is we can beat up all the de guys and take their hot chicks lol!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ziglug D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/rp on<br />
<br />
Yuz trollz tink iv yu moov in too da oger sitee yu can barsh uz? BAH AHAHAHAHAH! Yu ar supper! I EET YU!<br />
<br />
/rp off<br />
<br />
Game wise, I think trolls would be alot better off at the ogre home city, the trolls are even dumber than us, but atleast we're not arogant! And we are basically a HUGE outdoor city with a few stone tunnels...<br />
<br />
<br />
I like to visit the trolls in Neriak, but da darkies hate me...cuz I ate them when I was a teen...So I eat them more, and hope there arent any quests I am going to need to do there, but I kill at the halfling city to solo also so I think I am getting some better faction from there...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Calamity_Daemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Actually most trolls leave/left Grobb because they hated their own people. Competition was high between the men's and women's circles of power. Most male trolls would fight to conquer the smaller or weaker of their race. The women would literally tear tough rival's faces apart. Their was some rumor, though, that troll males would leave Grobb to find a mate in a barbarian (Though this is unproven and unlikely). In fact, I play Kuglog as a troll that hates his own people because he was smaller than most and had larger ears. Because of this he has no want to get back Grobb but he would destroy any froglok he sees because they put him to shame. Just though that that should be clear that many trolls DO NOT like their own people in the RP world...</div></div><hr />
