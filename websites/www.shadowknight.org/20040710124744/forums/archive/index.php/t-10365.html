<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok... I'm a level 63 ogre shadowknight.  I had 14 aa points spent -- run 3, regen 3, combat fury 1, spell casting fury 2, and I was Baron Bolas Bonesmith.  I wear an improved damage 3 item, Mask of the Dragon Slayer.  I saved up 6 aa points, and got spell casting fury 3.  My name didn't change... and all of a sudden, I stopped getting critical blasts.  So I logged off to the character select screen, logged back on... now I was Sir Bolas Bonesmith.. but still no critical blasts.  I got them much much more when I had SCF2 than when I have SCF3 (occasionally vs never).  So I logged all the way off and rebooted my computer.  Still shows me as Sir Bolas.  Still shows me with 20 aa points spent... still shows me with spell casting fury 3.  But I NEVER get a critical blast, ever.  That's not right.  Anyone know how to fix this?  I filed a /bug report and a petition.<br />
<br />
Also.. I just performed a critical heal (not a critical blast -- normal 350 lifetap healed me for 494) and I haven't trained Theft of Life at all.  How is this possible?  I took a screenshot and filed a /report and a /bug report for this.<br />
<br />
Anyone else had these problems?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>caffino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lifetaps can crit damage with SCF.  You can also have ToL go off for the heal, but it will say &quot;You have performed an exceptional heal&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah my mistake.. I hit for a normal 350 with my lifetap.. but then immediately had a melee crit for 494 right after.. and that confused me LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">However... I STILL have yet to get a single critical blast with Spell Casting Fury 3 after a couple of hours played... I got many many more critical blasts with SCF2 than with SCF3... this isn't right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warmaster Xsavuung Llaahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have SCF3 yet, but I did notice that the occasion of a crit didn't increase when I upgrade SCF1 to SCF2. It just crits for more. Spear of Plague crits for 533 with SCF1, 666 for SCF2 (love that crit!), so I assume it will crit for 800 once I get SCF3. But I don;t htink it will crit more OFTEN, just for more damage /shrug</div></div><hr />
