<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Markor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was tanking in BoT yesterday and a warrior from a uber guild zoned in and said LFG. 3 seconds later I was booted from the group and the warrior was invited. Lame. Not only can I not tank in GoD but now I can't even get groups in planar zones without being fully ele/time geared.</div></div><hr />

1)  They're pricks<br />
2)  You really sucked<br />
<br />
Assuming it's the former, just don't group with them again.</div></div><hr />

/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Markor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was doing my best and never lost taunt. I had 7.1k hp at the time and was doing pretty good at the time. I just can't believe I was booted. SOE is making it more and more difficult for the average player every patch/expansion they release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naelyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shiiiiit, I'm glad I don't group with people like that... I usually don't break 6k hp in groups, and though I can handle my agro like any SK should.... fuck, no way in hell I can take the damage that you can, and I can't say I've ever been kicked out of a group. Fucked up people.... I say fuck them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nezzka is bad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if they did that to me, i would have trained them and when they died i would laugh and think good thing they got that uber war... but thats me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kompleet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wait till they have mobs then HT the healer ;) or the chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dkhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You should have dueled the warrior for the position and sent him home crying. <br />
<br />
And then trained the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>derakolwtf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kompleet, can you not take your mind off pvp for even a second?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you get booted from a group in BoT, its pretty much because you just plain ole suck.<br />
<br />
Next time dont spit, and maybe they will let ya stay.</div></div><hr />

And then you could come to these boards and brag about what agreat RP'er you are....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kompleet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">NO!<br />
<br />
<br />
I made a SK to be a dominant PvPer on my server. PvE is 2nd issue. If I could pvp 24/7 I would.<br />
<br />
sure beats PvPing with my cleric.</div></div><hr />

It just means:<br />
<br />
1)  They're pricks<br />
2)  You really sucked<br />
 <br />
<br />
3) They were friends with the Warrior, and preferred grouping with a friend.<br />
<br />
Shitty deal in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Keevel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When that happens you need to pull out ye ole &quot;Will cyber for group&quot; sign</div></div><hr />
