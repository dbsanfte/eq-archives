<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I look at this board almost daily at work. Why is it that when ever someone sugests we(sk)get any upgrades like AAs/Skill ups/Gear etc...<br />
Most people jump to the &quot; Warriors will want more&quot; statement? Is it that bad that if a Sk gets a few upgrades that the WARR must have em too? Did the WARR just not get a bunch of DICS to push them further up the Tank roll. <br />
<br />
Why is it that others also bring up the limits that a SK has Vs. a WARR. I also see this only brought up in the RAID roll and not the regular game. Raids only pose as one function of the game not the rest of it.<br />
<br />
This is only a question, Nothing else.. :) <br />
Is it that bad at the End Game?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Balance of the classes is dynamic, and the classes that are affected by our improvements directly are Warriors and Paladins. Every increase that we see, we must also assume that the warriors will demand an equivalent raise in their skill set...no class ever seems to just sit back and take comfort in the fact that they are overbalanced in their current incarnation. There is therefore a sense that we need to incorporate the responding changes to other classes that are implicit in our own requests for upgrades.<br />
<br />
Even if they are not needed, they will most likely be demanded by our fellow plate classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see that point but....<br />
I see a lot of posts on how we need to be able to be better situated to tank with better skill or what not. That just means that WARR will just get one more thing to keep that gap. So in that situation why bother with all that crap? Just play the roll that you chose when creating the SK..If its about being able to Tank mobs in End Game/Raids I just cant pick up on the WE NEED mORE talk. Hell the game is supposed to be hard, our roll is our roll. <br />
I myself LOVE playing a SK. I started EQ as a monk and took him to 53 before desiding it wasnt for me. PLayed a BST and love it but I wanted more. Mage was cool too for a bit. Then the SK came to me and havnt stopped sence.<br />
<br />
I guess if we are allways going to be under the warrior then fine. If they increase our power to better tank most mobs then SONY will just make harder mobs to kill and then the cycle starts all over again.<br />
<br />
I think we need to focus not on Better Tanking because that will neve happen, but better Pets/Spells etc... Hell look at the BST.. That is one ALL AROUND class that needs NOTHING from anyone....I want that power in a SK,,,,,,,,<br />
<br />
Stattic  :D</div></div><hr />

Do you always contradict yourself in the same post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aoninie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't really get into the class balance thing. I love playing an SK and will continue to play one untill I can't get groups anymore. And as of yet I've never had a problem finding groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OK sure what ever. Im an idiot.<br />
<br />
I was just commenting on the BSTs power is all  but yes i like to play the SK more, its more my style. NO need ot jump all over me. lol<br />
<br />
I had a simple question on a topic that seems to pop up in every single post on this board. <br />
<br />
Anyway, Flame on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramgar SK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, and it will continue to pop up because it's a debate.  We are both tanks.  We both want to be as good as the other, but we are in different ways, so it will continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stattic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, Plus I dont understand the END game like most SKs on the board do too.<br />
For my game play I love it and can find myself loved in my groups and am always asked to group constantly.  Im never bored for the most part and pretty much woop up on a lot of WARR around me.(tanking/pulling/agro...etc....) <br />
<br />
Getting close to the HOH/BOT zones now and cant wait till 62. I have heared that at that point things will change for me as a tank and I welcome the change and the experience. It will only make me a better SK..<br />
<br />
<br />
Am excited to see if what I already love (sk) is going to get better!!! :D <br />
