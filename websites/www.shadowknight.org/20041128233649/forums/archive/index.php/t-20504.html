<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hoppen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kinda long, sorry.<br />
<br />
Tanking:<br />
Warriors: 	Have higher mitigation and hit points, defensive disc, Furious disc and the new Warlords Tentacity(insta heal with a weak DoT as the backside). Not to mention the extra hp's they get from Gates AA.<br />
<br />
Paladins: 	Have good self heals, LoH.<br />
<br />
SKs: Have some nice lifetap-procs, but that really only counts as a random regen. Lifetaps heal to little.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dps:	<br />
Warriors:	Have a higher dps meele-wise, fellstrike disc. weapon skill caps at 252.<br />
<br />
Paladin:	About the same melee dps(SKs aren't even close when compared to undead).Weapon skill caps at 225.<br />
<br />
SKs:Use a 50/tick DoT(and snare) to take aggo. Have more DoT's too. Pet is nice if mobs don't AE much. Weapon skill caps at 225. Spear/Scythe line of spells are nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro:	<br />
Warriors:	Have the best taunt skill(252), have tons of EB weapons, have AE taunt, Incite line of taunts, a 15% aggro mod on the Time BP, Furious Bash shields and Anger III from LDoN.<br />
<br />
Paladins:	Stuns, best snap aggro in the game(fast to cast, low mana and a usefull effect) 220 taunt skill.<br />
<br />
SKs: Have the Festering Darkness spell that is really good, if it hadn't been for the DoT in it. Some say Fear is good too, but it didn't look like it to me. Have 220 taunt skill. The 12% aggro mod is nice but annoying (takes spell and buff slot). The EB spells taunt way to little to be usefull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emergency situations:<br />
Warriors:	Combination AE-taunt + &quot;defensive disc&quot;or &quot;riposte disc&quot; and most situations should be under control pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Paladins: 	Use the non DD-stuns(so the chanter can mez) + root. Wind of marr, LoH, aa group heal.<br />
<br />
Sks:Can't help much really to taunt off. if we use the DoT on every mob, i doubt the chanter will love us much afterwards. And the Fear spell... Well it has a recast and isn't that good aggro. The lifetap HT only heal for 2300 when maxed aa, and is not affected by the &quot;Unholy Aura&quot;<br />
Best option then: Feign Death.<br />
<br />
Pulling:<br />
Warriors: 	Pull with the new taunt ability that has some range on it. Can't single out mobs tho.<br />
<br />
Paladins: 	Have pacify and can root a mob to get singles.<br />
Sks:Can FD-pull, but it is normally much to time consuming(Especially for the LDoN adventures). Can, however, do a warrior pull and FD if it goes really wrong. Can use pet too, but if you think FD is time consuming...<br />
<br />
<br />
Equipment:<br />
Warriors have it a lot easier when it comes to equipment. just need ac, hp, resists, melee stats, cha, Vengeance and regen. EB on weapons.<br />
<br />
Paladins need the same as warriors + mana, Wis, FT and a ton of Focus effecs. Need runes, scroll and lots of points in LDoN to get spells. Just need one 1handed weapon tho and EB on weapons is not a must.<br />
<br />
SKs have the same as pallys, but Int instead of Wis and some different focus effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc:		<br />
SK’s and Pallys have to use a 1-handed weapon and a shield to get the most possible hp, ac, etc(and Furious Bash). We don’t have any bonus attacks with 1-handers(with a 2h, we have increased 2x-attack and a chance of preforming an extra attack each combat round).<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary:	<br />
Warriors out-tank everything by far. If a warrior has high end equipment, nothing can take aggro from him/her(/it).<br />
<br />
Paladins are best in getting snap aggro, but can’t keep up with a warrior in the long run, unless the pally jumps on the stun button the entire fight. Far best of the tank classes to keep crowd control.Have very nice healing spells and skills.<br />
BSS(and Symbol).<br />
<br />
SKs should normaly have a bit better dps(vs undead is the not normal part), but lets face it… You don’t pick an SK in the group for dps.And if somthing goes wrong and we end up with 4-5 mobs in the camp, there’s not much an SK can do about it.<br />
Cloak of Luclin is about as good as BSS, but is self only.<br />
<br />
Other stuff that should be fixed:<br />
Harm Touch: When i used HT with the best bard song running, i did less damage than when i had no song on...Do we go past some way-to-low cap or somthing? Making Unholy Aura intergrated into the Improved HT and keeping Lifetap HT on 	a separate timer whould be much better.<br />
<br />
Zevfeer’s Bite: When you score a critical blast, you should heal for twice the 	hp and drain twice the amount of mana.<br />
<br />
Unholy Aura: Should be replaced by an other disc or make it so that every spell is affected by it.<br />
<br />
Leechcurse: The lvl 60 disc? Nope, they have managed to call the Lifetap HT for Leechcurse as well. Should be ”Leech TOUCH”! Fix the name please. And make it do as much damage as an ordinary HT whould have done, and make it affected by Improved Damage so that its actually worth spending aa-points in. Should have its own timer.<br />
<br />
Rest the Dead: Why do SKs have a lull undead spell that only goes up to lvl 46 mobs. Its completly useless for a lvl 65. We need an upgrade of that spell.<br />
<br />
All weapon skills should cap at 252.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Belyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I stopped beleiving in you when you said the spear line was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hoppen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes they could have had more damage/less recast/harder to resist, but take the LDoN adventures as an example, you should be able to hit almost every mob with 1 spear(depending on how fast the group kills/pulls). That adds up in the end. <br />
When fighting undead, i never go below 200dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tramlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well one thing that really pisses me off is paladins can pull a mob right through a raid , right past CHing clerics to enchanters to get a mob mezed without dotting or damaging it. we got all these fucking retard agro spells that suck compaired whatever there using, probobly a lvl 9 stun or something gay. sure would be nice to have a damageless agro spell that actually got enough agro to be of any use in CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That spell is the level 15 Fear.  Load the 49 one also if recast is a problem.  And most raid mobs these days are immune to snare, so know which those are and you can use CD for CC agro.<br />
<br />
Though, I really really do miss shadow vortex  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghismonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I disagree with:<br />
<br />
&quot;SKs:Use a 50/tick DoT(and snare) to take aggo. Have more DoT's too. Pet is nice if mobs don't AE much. Weapon skill caps at 225. Spear/Scythe line of spells are nice.&quot;<br />

&quot;Have the Festering Darkness spell that is really good, if it hadn't been for the DoT in it. Some say Fear is good too, but it didn't look like it to me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Fear spell...and isn't that good aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if somthing goes wrong and we end up with 4-5 mobs in the camp, there’s not much an SK can do about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Really seems like the poster needs to embrace Fear, a non-damage dealing 40 mana spell, as an aggro tool.  Also seems that an analysis of damage-per-mana should be looked into for spears, Blood of Hate, and snares.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with:<br />
<br />
&quot;Leechcurse(touch): ... Should have its own timer.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Although with Touch of the Wicked 3, if you use both skills as soon as they are available, they almost do have their own timers (if you used harmtouch only exclusively when Unholy Discipline was available)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tramlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i knew someone was going to say use fear , i use fear and it dont work for shit, let alone will it generate enough agro to pull a mob right through the middle of a 70 man raid and 3 feet from clerics in CH rot. fear is a fucking joke for agro but its all we have really as an option. like i said though it's wrong for a pally to be able to generate so much damagless agro that they can pull a mob right through a raid to enchanters without damageing it and wait for it to be mezzed and dont even have worry about it agroing on nearbye people. sure wish one of the 2384768 spells we have that there only purpose is agro could do what pallys can do with there one little stun. must be nice to have disease cloud type spell that dont even do damage or dot a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Catharsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fear rips mobs across the room for me *shrug*<br />
<br />
And sitting between recasts helps, even in a small way.  At least enough to get the mob closer such that proximity agro comes into effect.  Really shouldnt be trying to rip mobs from a distance anyways if it can be helped.  Get in range, press taunt, and then fear for maximum effectiveness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with the corrections. But he 's got a point in general.<br />
Warriors smoke us in tanking and dps, paladins do have the adge with snap aggro.<br />
But SOE does not really care, since we are the class they don't know what to do with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pallys have the best snap agro? Everytime I have been in a group with a pally as the MT, his snap agro has been a joke. I have wanted to ( and have done) shout &quot;Hey stupid, this is how you do it!&quot;.  Am I just good at it, or do all of them suck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">perhaps your own personal experience.  Our paladins are extremely good and capable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">perhaps your own personal experience.  Our paladins are extremely good and capable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From what I've seen lately, like the last 2 weeks, Fear is not even half as good as it used to be for grabbin aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shadowblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Always use Clinging darkness myself, never found fear too be that good either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ganaith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your analysis is so utterly out of whack, that i dont even want to begin with breaking it down piece by piece. <br />
<br />
But I love being sadistic.<br />
<br />
Tanking:<br />
<br />
You said nothing that has not been said before, nor did it add anything to the discussion. You are forgetting the *huge* difference that gear makes. Time+ its different then VT/pre EP. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dps: <br />
Warriors: Have a higher dps meele-wise, fellstrike disc. weapon skill caps at 252.<br />
<br />
Paladin: About the same melee dps(SKs aren't even close when compared to undead).Weapon skill caps at 225.<br />
<br />
SKs:Use a 50/tick DoT(and snare) to take aggo. Have more DoT's too. Pet is nice if mobs don't AE much. Weapon skill caps at 225. Spear/Scythe line of spells are nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet again, what did you base this conclusions on? SU3 btw is so thrice damned situational it isnt even funny. Paladins lack a load in the DPS department, and they fall behind warriors and sk's by a sufficient amount (based on various parses from my old guild)<br />
<br />
Use a 50/tick dot? You only use festering to take aggro? what about clinging? fear?  Have more dots too...i assume you mean blood of hate which is about the only usefull dot worth casting, and even then in general the mob is dead before it ends. Weapon skills are capped for us knights yes, what else is new. Spear and scythe lines nice...fun, maybe. You completely left out out lifetaps during this scenerio, which is a *lot* of casting DPS. not only that, you left out our DPS from our innate procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro: <br />
Warriors: Have the best taunt skill(252), have tons of EB weapons, have AE taunt, Incite line of taunts, a 15% aggro mod on the Time BP, Furious Bash shields and Anger III from LDoN.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Stuns, best snap aggro in the game(fast to cast, low mana and a usefull effect) 220 taunt skill.<br />
<br />
SKs: Have the Festering Darkness spell that is really good, if it hadn't been for the DoT in it. Some say Fear is good too, but it didn't look like it to me. Have 220 taunt skill. The 12% aggro mod is nice but annoying (takes spell and buff slot). The EB spells taunt way to little to be usefull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have the best taunt skill. How utterly great for them. In general, we dont even need taunt. AE taunt is a real plus, but not for aggro generation but for emergencies. Incite is great. 15% aggro mod on time bp. You are basing this on Time equipped warriors then? Furious Bash shields and anger 3. Furious bash, means dick. Anger 3, adds more to their aggro generation over time, which isnt really new either.<br />
<br />
Best snap aggro in game..what effect are you talking about? you mean, the part that is always resisted? Ever tried a combo of chain fear and cd, then tell me who gets snap aggro.<br />
<br />
You are seriously ONLY using festering darkness for aggro during MEZ SITUATIONS? You misguided tool, since when do you use a dot to generate aggro when mobs can be mezzed? have you even stepped into VT yet? Or for that matter, time?<br />
<br />
<br />
Emergency situations:<br />
Warriors: Combination AE-taunt + &quot;defensive disc&quot;or &quot;riposte disc&quot; and most situations should be under control pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Use the non DD-stuns(so the chanter can mez) + root. Wind of marr, LoH, aa group heal.<br />
<br />
Sks:Can't help much really to taunt off. if we use the DoT on every mob, i doubt the chanter will love us much afterwards. And the Fear spell... Well it has a recast and isn't that good aggro. The lifetap HT only heal for 2300 when maxed aa, and is not affected by the &quot;Unholy Aura&quot;<br />
Best option then: Feign Death.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are great for emergency situations where lots of mobs are inc, the control is gone, all the chanters are screaming and the clerics are switching targets. AE taunt+ defensive can save the day, correct, which i think is great.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a nice way to keep a mob stun locked ready for mez, just like we can. group heals are great and also can help with aggro generation. Using root...you must mean in Ldon, since where it matters much root wont stick anyway.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight. Do you even play the same class? Casting a dot on all the mobs? are you insane? I commonly train my ldon group with 8 mobs and no one but the mobs die. How? its a simple combination of fear and fast retargetting. Skill that a one armed monkey can learn. You completely forgot our leach disc too btw, who can be semi usefull. Also uberHT can be very usefull in oh shit situations. If your best option in this scenerio is feign death, then you should strip your armor, and go cry in the back with the wizards, thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pulling:<br />
Warriors: Pull with the new taunt ability that has some range on it. Can't single out mobs tho.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Have pacify and can root a mob to get singles.<br />
Sks:Can FD-pull, but it is normally much to time consuming(Especially for the LDoN adventures). Can, however, do a warrior pull and FD if it goes really wrong. Can use pet too, but if you think FD is time consuming...<br />
<br />
<br />
Misguided, once again. Their range spell means dick. a nice bow is enough to get the mob on you. No they cant single a mob, thats why in general, they dont pull. In fact, what does pulling have to do with warriors? Then you start talking about paladins and being the designated pullers. pally pacify is level based sir. Try it against level 60+ mobs. Rooting a mob to get a single is their only viable skill in that matter, which a shaman, heck any caster can do better and more efficiently. Sk's using fd pull too time consuming? This is only viable in Ldon, where getting singles matters dick anyway. We *OUTPULL* MONKS on some occasions due to snare split.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Equipment:<br />
Warriors have it a lot easier when it comes to equipment. just need ac, hp, resists, melee stats, cha, Vengeance and regen. EB on weapons.<br />
<br />
Paladins need the same as warriors + mana, Wis, FT and a ton of Focus effecs. Need runes, scroll and lots of points in LDoN to get spells. Just need one 1handed weapon tho and EB on weapons is not a must.<br />
<br />
SKs have the same as pallys, but Int instead of Wis and some different focus effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
The staggering amount of new information shocks me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc: <br />
SK’s and Pallys have to use a 1-handed weapon and a shield to get the most possible hp, ac, etc(and Furious Bash). We don’t have any bonus attacks with 1-handers(with a 2h, we have increased 2x-attack and a chance of preforming an extra attack each combat round).<br />
<br />
If i am correct, the AA ability was fixed so it includes our 1hander. Of course we need to use a shield to get the most possible hp ac etc, warriors do too you know :p What point you are making here is completely oblivious.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Warriors out-tank everything by far. If a warrior has high end equipment, nothing can take aggro from him/her(/it).<br />
<br />
True.<br />
<br />
Paladins are best in getting snap aggro, but can’t keep up with a warrior in the long run, unless the pally jumps on the stun button the entire fight. Far best of the tank classes to keep crowd control.Have very nice healing spells and skills.<br />
BSS(and Symbol).<br />
<br />
I tend to disagree with paladins having the best snap aggro. Crowd control between SK and paladin is the same.<br />
<br />
SKs should normaly have a bit better dps(vs undead is the not normal part), but lets face it… You don’t pick an SK in the group for dps.And if somthing goes wrong and we end up with 4-5 mobs in the camp, there’s not much an SK can do about it.<br />
Cloak of Luclin is about as good as BSS, but is self only.<br />
<br />
My dps is around 100-140 when i am burning my way through Ldon mobs. Thats not too bad. I get picked as puller/dps/tank in groups, but thats also due to knowing people. As i stated before, i TRAIN my group with 6-8 mobs, aggro and stick them to me so the chanter can mez them. So yes, the sk can do a lot about it. CoL is semi decent. Its not brells that is the problem, its aura of the crusader.<br />
<br />
Other stuff that should be fixed:<br />
Harm Touch: When i used HT with the best bard song running, i did less damage than when i had no song on...Do we go past some way-to-low cap or somthing? Making Unholy Aura intergrated into the Improved HT and keeping Lifetap HT on a separate timer whould be much better.<br />
<br />
I think that was suggested many times.<br />
<br />
Zevfeer’s Bite: When you score a critical blast, you should heal for twice the hp and drain twice the amount of mana.<br />
<br />
Its called theft of life. And zefeers is an inmensly powerfull spell in its current form.<br />
<br />
Unholy Aura: Should be replaced by an other disc or make it so that every spell is affected by it.<br />
<br />
Auto crit on all our DD would be a little over the top, but fun. Massive endurance drain will counter it probably, and give us a reason to actually use the endurance we have now.<br />
<br />
Leechcurse: The lvl 60 disc? Nope, they have managed to call the Lifetap HT for Leechcurse as well. Should be ”Leech TOUCH”! Fix the name please. And make it do as much damage as an ordinary HT whould have done, and make it affected by Improved Damage so that its actually worth spending aa-points in. Should have its own timer.<br />
<br />
Rest the Dead: Why do SKs have a lull undead spell that only goes up to lvl 46 mobs. Its completly useless for a lvl 65. We need an upgrade of that spell.<br />
<br />
This entire line should not have existed in the first place , and I am glad they are stepping off the parentcaster/warrior combo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Useless post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bastardlunatic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I dont know what you are talking about with agro issues.  I have never had issues with holding agro.  About the only thing that can draw agro from me when i am not paying attention is if someone debuffs a mob, slows and then decides to sit at its feet.  occaisionally it will take a swipe at them.  <br />
<br />
If god forbid my group makes an uneducated decision to let a paly tank i will consistently steal the agro just to make em look bad and there is nothing they can do about it.  Festering + 3 spears loaded + terror of thule + taunt + beg + voice of terris + procs.  Space out the spears and pepper the mob with an almost instacast DD every 15 seconds.  All the agro you will ever need.  At least its all i've ever needed.  But then again im not a raid tank.  Im the offtank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>aress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">by the way, I disagree with Brael on the value of Voice.  I think there is a noticeable aggro difference when one has it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>skang01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">A pally will have nearly the same aggro as SKs without having to worry about DoTs ruining mez.<br />
<br />
For max aggro, pallys can chain cast cease, desist, and stun almost indefinitely.<br />
<br />
cease - 1.5 sec - 15 mana<br />
desist - 1.75 sec - 25 mana<br />
stun - 1.5 sec - 35 mana<br />
<br />
Each of these are ~500 hate regardless of whether a mob is stun immune. <br />
<br />
If a pally is chain casting stuns, no one in an exp group or raid is going to draw aggro off him unless they're actually trying.  Under normal circumstances it won't happen, even with chain slowing shaman or chain nuking wizards.</div></div><hr />

You forgot avoidance, shielding, spellshield (the most important in GOD), worn and cast ds which stacks up dps wise pretty fast depending on encounter, endurance, and im sure endurance regen is coming soon in god gear which is the equivalent of ft for knights.</div></div><hr />
