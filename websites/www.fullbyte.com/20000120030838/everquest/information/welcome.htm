          Well, we thought we were gonna get some other things done in real life
          today, until we found out that <a href="http://216.155.25.102/">AllaKhazam's
          site has moved</a>. We have over 400 links to his site, which had to
          be immediately updated. We sure hope we got them all! While we were at
          it, we've added some <a href="keys.htm">Key information</a> that was
          emailed to us, put in a small correction on the <a href="recharge.htm">Recharging
          section</a> that was also emailed to us, and updated the <a href="spells%20and%20research.htm">necro
          spell area</a> based on a couple requests as well.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#80FFFF">We also added a new section, the <a href="archives.htm"> EQIC Update
          Archives</a>, which is where you can find old posts about our updates to
          the site. Needed to remove them from here because it was getting&nbsp;

          We gave up on the original site where the GM/Guide manual was located
          and luckily found another location of the document. The link has been

          Our apologies, but the GM/Guide manual which was
          &quot;advertised&quot; in yesterday's update seems to be currently
          unavailable. We checked the domain, and it's temporarily offline. Will
          continue to check it throughout the day to see if it comes back up. If
          it does, we'll let you know.</font>

          Big Update today. One of our visitors advised us that we had numerous
          bad links, so we went through every link on the site to verify them.
          All bad links that didn't have replacement URL's were deleted. Those
          that could be updated are designated with the <img border="0" src="eqimages/updated.gif" width="44" height="12">

          <p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow">Also, we've deleted the EQ Viewer program from the Downloadable
          Files page.
          It worked for some and didn't work for others (me included). We've
          replaced the file with another program, called <a href="files.htm">EQ
          Zone Explorer</a>, which also allows you to explore zones through the
          tutorial, and this one appears to actually work. Be sure to read the
          readme file prior to using the program.</font></p>
