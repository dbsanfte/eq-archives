<P><I>The word Net23, encased in a shimmering, glossy corporate logo appear on your tridscreen. It fades out and zooms into a newsdesk, at which Net23 anchor Melisandre Silver is sitting. Her beautiful features are centered in the tridscreen as she begins the nightly news.</I>

<P>"...and now we report on what's hot in Seattle Society."

<P><I>Trideo begins to play, showing a beautiful lounge with various people talking and hobnobbing. It looks like they are having a great deal of fun. A stage is set up as well, and as the clips go by, you see and hear Bell Book and Candle playing.</I>

<P>Melisandre begins to speak again, "If you weren't at Seven Dragons Dojo last night, you were dead. Featuring the internationally famous band, Bell Book and Candle, this party was /the/ place to be seen at. Everyone in Seattle's glitterati was there, and all were welcome to come and revel in the enjoyment."

<P><I>A shot of a regal-looking Japanese man that you may recognize as Kitoh plays, he is socializing with his guests and having a good time. Panning across the room, you can see various races from various walks of life drinking, eating, and listening to the band.</I>

<P><I>Melisandre goes on to speak about the latest fashions, showing shots of various articles of clothing.</I>

<P><I>The trid fades out to commercial. "Do you have a fear of walking the streets by yourself? Do you need someone found, followed? Does someone owe you money they refuse to pay? Contact Streetwise Inc., at 6347-52585 and we'll give you the utmost in service." A graphic showing the logo of Streetwise Inc. plays with the 6347-52585 number appearing again, attempting to impress itself and what it's for into your memory.</I>
