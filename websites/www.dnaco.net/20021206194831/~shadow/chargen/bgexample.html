Below is a background example submitted by a player kind enough to share
it with us. Please note, this is just an example, we don't want to see 
a bunch matching this one. We're also not saying that yours needs to be this
long or this short. Thanks!

<h5>Main Background</h5>

Fred Jones was born on May 10, 2029, the youngest of the three sons of Edna
 and Marty Jones. The Jones family was a quiet household of Trolls living 
in Tacoma. Marty worked long, hard hours as a Sanitation Engineer, while 
Edna maintained the house and raised her children. Though they were not 
affluent, Marty brought home enough money so that the family could live 
comfortably.
 <P>
From an early age, Fred was discovered to possess exceptional intelligence
 for a Troll, above average even for normal humans. Because he was a Troll,
 however, he was not allowed to take classes that would help develop his 
mind. His parents were unable to teach him more at home than the little he 
learned in school because their minds were average for Troll, and rather 
unsophisticated. To help, they called on a friend of the family, a dwarf 
named Theodore Ironhands, known by  Fred as Uncle Ted.
 <P> 
Uncle Ted took young Fred under his wing, and became a Mentor to the Troll.
 He taught Fred how to read and do math, as well as more advanced studies,
 such as how to express oneself. He also helped shape Fred's morals, by 
teaching tolerance and restraint. "Vengeance is never a good thing," 
instructed Uncle Ted, "But it is unfortunately necessary at times. When 
it is, never strike back immediately. Step back and make a plan, my boy. 
You've got the mind to think things out. You should always use that first."
  <P>
When Fred was nine, this was put to the test. The Night of Rage was a 
shock to his entire community, but the pain became more personal two 
days later, when Fred's oldest brother, Francis, was killed in the resulting
 riots. Frank had gone to Seattle to meet with old friends, and got caught 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. Despite his efforts to flee, he was 
cornered, and hung from a lamp post. News of this event was devastating to 
the whole family, and for the first time in his life, Fred felt rage. He 
was so overcome with anger, that he struck out at Uncle Ted. Though both 
were the same size, Ted was much better honed with the skill of fighting. 
The brawl was short, but decisive, ending up with Fred over the dwarf's 
knee, receiving a sound spanking. Uncle Ted then lectured the youth, 
making a lesson out of the incident, and showing Fred the price for acting 
without thinking.
  <P>
Ted: "Who killed Frank?"<BR>
Fred: "I dunno."<BR>
Ted: "So who do you go after to get even?"<BR>
Fred looks blankly at Ted, unable to reply.<BR>
Ted: "You go after the Humans?"<BR>
Fred: "Yeah?"<BR>
>WHACK< (Ted hits Fred upside the head)<BR>
Ted: "No boy! Ain't ya listenin'? Goin after people who ain't had nuthin to do
        with what happened ain't gonna do you no good. It just makes ya as bad
        as they are."<BR>
Fred: "So what do I do?"<BR>
Ted: "You wait. You watch. Maybe you ain't never gonna get revenge. If not,
        don't let it eat you up. That's worse than any disease out there. If
        you don't see no way to get even, let it go. Got it?"<BR>
Fred: "Yeah."
<P>
Fred's adolescence was quiet, considering the turmoil in the world. 
He gradually grew up, a bit short for a Troll, but still huge compared to 
humans. As a supplement to his other studies, Uncle Ted also instructed 
the Troll in his own hobby: Blacksmithing. Fred took to the craft eagerly, 
his natural brawn being a definite asset. As with any true learning process 
it took a few years, but Fred was able to become quite good at the task.
<P> 
Once he became an adult, Fred took a job in a factory, assembling trailers. 
The menial labor was hardly a challenge for his mental ability, but 
management was hesitant to place a Troll in any other position. Not one to 
make waves, Fred did his work, complacent, if not happy. When he was 
twenty-four, Fred met another Troll, Zoe Jones. The two became friends, and 
gradually fell in love. Two and a half years after they met, Zoe and 
Fred married. They lived in a simple apartment in Tacoma, and together 
had a daughter, Janet.
 <P>
All good things come to an end, though some endings are more tragic than 
others. On June 24, 2057, Zoe was walking to the grocery store pushing 
Janet in a carriage. Without warning, a car careened down the street, 
swerved across traffic, and struck the two, pinning them to an apartment 
building. Janet died instantly, and Zoe passed away soon afterward. 
The driver, who was drunk, received only minor injuries due to the 
safety features within the car. Fred came home to find his mother and 
father, who gave him the bad news.
 <P>
Even more devastating than the loss of his wife and child was the following 
injustice. The driver, Trevor Jackson, was the son of one of the high-level 
executives of the regional Ares office. With expensive lawyers, and a bit 
of political nudging, Trevor was given no more punishment than a 500 Nuyen 
fine for reckless driving. In order to save face in the public eye, and to 
prevent a law suit, the corporation offered a handsome settlement to Fred, 
as compensation. Under advisement of his lawyer, and Uncle Ted, Fred accepted 
the settlement, and raised no further voice against Ares.
 <P>
Without telling anyone else, Fred quit his job, and spent the money on 
cybernetics. For all intents and purposes, he appeared to vanish while 
he was recovering from the installation. It was Uncle Ted who found the 
grieving Troll.
 <P>
Ted: "Whaddaya think yer doin, Boy?"<BR>
Fred: "How did you find me?"<BR>
Ted: "I got my ways. You don't know everythin 'bout me. You thinkin to go
        take out that Jackson kid?"<BR>
Ted: "Yeah I was."<BR>
>THUMP< No longer able to reach Fred's head, Ted kicks him in the shin.<BR>
Ted: "That's about the most Dam'fool thing you could do. You really think you
        got half a chance 'gainst the security of a weapon corp? They drop
        a trailer on yer head or sumthin?"<BR>
Fred: "No... I dunno, Uncle Ted. I just gotta do something!"<BR>
Ted: "Then do it like I told ya, Boy. Think things out. Ares ain't yer
        enemy. Neither is that twerp who killed yer Zoe. Yer enemy is the
        system. And to take on the system, you gotta have backing. Trust
        me, kid. I know this. Go to the Ork Underground in Seattle if you 
        got a hair up yer ass and need to do sumthin. While yer there, see
        if ya can do sumthin to help the people there. Use that brain of
        yers. You know that helpin goes a lot farther than hurtin."<BR>
Fred: "I guess so."<BR>
Ted: "And before ya go, say good-bye to yer mother. Yer breakin her heart."
<P>
When he arrived in Seattle, Fred was surprised to find the squalor that 
seemed omnipresent in the Ork Underground. He was used to his relatively 
normal, middle-class life, and had never seen such poverty. He realized 
quickly that his thoughts of personal vengeance were selfish, and immediately 
set out to do what he could to help those in the Underground. After a 
short time, he set up a forge, and applied the talents he had learned for 
a hobby to helping those in need.
 <P>
After about a year, he was approached by a friend of his, who asked him 
if he wanted to do a ShadowRun. Fred had heard of these, but was hesitant 
at first. After thinking on it, though, he decided that this may be the 
better way to gain his vengeance. He was given training with guns, and was 
suggested to pick out a hand weapon as well. Fred went to his forge, and 
got the biggest hammer he could find, then attached an extra long handle.
 <P>
He brought the hammer with him to the first time he met the rest of the 
team, which was comprised of himself, two mercs, a rigger, a decker, and 
a Mage. He regarded the mage with suspicion, as he had never encountered 
magic directly before. Overall, however, he got along well with the other 
members, especially one of the mercs, who was somewhat impressed with his 
hammer. The team worked together for several months, honing their abilities
 and reflexes, and offering each other advice. Finally, they were ready 
for their first Run together.
 <P>
The Run was a disaster. Whether they were sold out by their Mr. Johnson, 
or by one of the team members, or whether it was just bad luck is hard 
to tell. They were ambushed on the way to the Run, and taken completely 
by surprise, in a few heated minutes of combat, all but Fred and one of 
the Mercs were taken out. The Merc told Fred to bug out, and the two 
fled the scene, barely escaping. After laying low for a few days, the 
merc left for New Orleans, saying that he never stuck around after 
being burned. Wishing Fred the best, he took off, and Fred returned 
to his forge.
 <P>
Now, Fred keeps to himself for the most part, working in his forge. 
He still entertains ideas every now and then of doing another ShadowRun, 
but he is understandably cautious. Perhaps he can be talked into it 
sometime in the near future...
</DIV>

<DIV ID="content">
<h5>PERSONALITY</h5>
 <P>
Fred is somewhat taciturn, rarely speaking more than one sentence at a 
time. Though he is quiet and generally solemn, he is not without humor, 
occasionally releasing a biting quip that one might miss if not paying 
attention. He is very smart and if he has reason to, he will speak his 
mind at length. He is polite to a fault, always using "please" and 
"thank you", and calling everyone except for his closest friends and 
family "Sir" or "Ma'am". He never tells anyone what to do, but rather 
makes suggestions. Some suggestions can be rather strong, of course. 
He is very slow to anger, but once angry, he is a force of rage.
</DIV>

<DIV ID="content">
<h5>Family</h5>
<P> 
Currently Fred doesn't live with anyone, except his cat, Mittens, a grey
 tabby whom he adores. The cat likes him because he brings food. His 
nearest family is in Tacoma, where his mother and father still live, 
along with his surviving brother, George. Though his mother and father
 are disappointed that he left his steady-paying job, they respect his
 choice of living the way he does now. He does not have many local friends
, though he gets along well enough with neighbors. Fred's best friend in
 the world is his mentor, Uncle Ted, who also lives in Tacoma. At this 
time, Fred has no romantic interests.
 </DIV>

<DIV ID="content">

<h5>APPEARANCE</h5>
<P> 
Fred is relatively short, for a troll. He stands at a height of only 
2.6 meters, though his frame is normal, and he weighs in at about 185 
kilos. His skin is lumpy and pale, with the occasional wart, and is 
made even less attractive by the obvious dermal plates. Two prominent 
warts are on his face, one above the right eye, the other on his chin. 
His eyes are grey, and usually have a pair of comically small wire-rimmed 
glasses in front of them. They perch precariously on his long, straight-sloped 
nose, and hook behind the horns sprouting from his temples. His ears are 
large, pointed, and have a small garden of hair sprouting from them. He has 
short, red hair, and he keeps his teeth and tusks well brushed and clean. 
Typically, Fred dresses in simple clothes, preferring drab colors, like grey 
or brown. While working in the forge, he often wears a synth-leather aporon 
to protect his clothes from sparks and hot pieces of metal. His attire is 
somewhat different when going on a ShadowRun, but he always wears a long 
orange scarf, knitted by his mother. He wore it the first time, and partly 
attributes his survival to wearing the 'lucky scarf'.
  </DIV>

<DIV ID="content">

<h5>THE FUTURE</h5>
 
Fred really doesn't know where his future will take him. His anger over 
his wife and child's death has faded, and the idea of vengeance seems 
to be an unrewarding prospect. He realizes his decision to implant the 
cybernetics was a rash one, but intends to live with it. He intends to 
keep working to help the people in the Ork Underground while he seeks 
a true purpose and calling in his life.
