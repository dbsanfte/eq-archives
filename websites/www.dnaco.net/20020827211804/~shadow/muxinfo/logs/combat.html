Greg says "Okay lets start with Initiative. Todai do you have any 
  opinion on the new initiative rules." 

Todai says "I agree with the rules as they are written. I think that 
  they will add a positive dynamic to the MUX and will hopefully make 
  PCs think twice about pulling out guns on each other." 

Todai passes the microphone to Rae 

.Rae also likes the rules as written, especially when involving scenes 
  with several pc's and not that many bad guys. now the slow pc will at 
  least get to do SOMETHING. 
Rae adds, "The change will also effect the trix in a positive way. 
Rae is done 

Greg nods "I liked the new rules at first for the very reason Rae 
  stated. The new init rules definitely give slower PCs a chance to act. 
  This however does have negative side effects. If you have an ultra 
  fast PC who has say Wired 3. They lose some of that speed. They now 
  may be hurt by someone who is much slower then them. The old init 
  rules provided a great advantage for these faster PCs. Before one PC 
  could potentially kill many NPC or PCs before they even have a chance 
  to attack. Todai you did this in your hit against the Jivers. With the 
  new rules this lightening quick PC maybe shot many times. And with 
  that I pass. lets continue going in a circle until we are finished 
  with the topic. That way we can comment on each others comments in a 
  formal discussion." 

Todai says "I agree that the new rules are in a way screwing over the PC 
  who has spent his life and/or chargen resources getting wired 3. I 
  think they have done a good job of balancing things out by giving the 
  faster PCs actions at the end of the round. Sure, people can stand 
  around and fire at the fast guy but it would be much smarter for them 
  to dive for cover. The disadvantage of not having a lot of actions 
  before everyone else can also be balanced by blowing off limbs to take 
  others out of combat without killing them. Done." 

Rae agrees. Also, though it hasn't come up yet, the lack of combat pool 
  in later rounds is actually to the faster pc's favor. Sure, the little 
  guy got to take a shot at him in the first round..likely blowing his 
  pool....now the fast guy can go. I really see very very few 
  disadvantages to this. Also the fast guy now has more than enough time 
  to react to events rather than using them all up right away. 
Rae is done 

Greg nods "Good points both of you. The CP portion is very good and I 
  had not thought about that at all. Still not sure I like them but I 
  have to agree with you both that the advantages are more benefitial 
  then the cons. I am finished with this one. Todai anythign else to 
  say?" 

Todai shakes his head. "Nope." 

Greg says "Rae?" 

Rae adds, "The faster guy can also hold his action, thus letting him 
  truly react to anything the slower pc does." otherwise, nothing else 

Greg nods "Okay great. Next. Damage and Init. Todai." 

Todai says "Not much has changed as far as I can tell. I like the system 
  the way it is written. Done." 

Rae acks, scrolls back and sees it ws her turn. I have no quibbles with 
  damage..semms remarkably the same. 

Rae is done....we have healing or is that someone else territory? 

Greg nods "I agree. Only difference I saw(and maybe I just missed it all 
  4 times I look at SR2) was that the init is modified immediately 
  following any damage. I don't believe SR2 said this. I like it ALOT 
  though. I am taking healing since it is in the Combat section. If it 
  is wrong it will simply overlay someone elses discussion. Next topic I 
  guess is Delayed Actions. Unless someone has aproblem with init ties." 

Greg passes the magic wand to Todai 

Todai says "I like the way that delayed actions are handled. The rule 
  book does a good job with the example to explain how they can be used. 
  The delayed actions will play a key roll with the new init rules by 
  allowing faster people to bide their time and keep themselves alive. 
  Done." 

Rae thinks that was very well said. I particularly like how it states 
  that the faster person goes before the person, reacting 
  infintessimally before to do so. I mean, well, player b holds. player 
  a says, i shoot kid. player b can react to save the kid BEFORE player 
  s shoots. really nice for fast folks 

.Rae is done she thinks 

Greg nods "I agree and I like the rules for all the reasons you two 
  stated. However once again I have to be a pain in the ass. There is a 
  portion of the rules that I don't like. If A delays until B takes 
  action I guess I feel like As init should be modified from the time he 
  takes his action not the time he delays his action. The book states in 
  SR3 that once the pass is over, the GM subtracts 10 from the ORIGINAL 
  init score. Done"Rae frowns. You sure about that? 

Rae goes and looks. thought if his original init was 27, he holds until 
  25, his next go is 15Greg nods as he read it straight from the book. 
  PG 103You say "Those are the old rules." 

Rae blinks, slightly out of turn. Wow yer right 

Rae likes it. Still limited to only one go per sequence though. ok, I'll 
  wait my turn now. 

Todai says "I agree with the way it is written. By recalculating the 
  init based on when they take their delayed reaction it "slows" them 
  down to the speed of the other person. They (player A) loses the 
  benefit of being faster." 

Todai says "Done."Rae has read the new ones. Yeah. Hmm. I think i do 
  like them. easier to keep track of inna timestop 

Greg says "Okay well I don't like it still and that is probably not 
  something we will agree on. It just bugs me because If I get a 17 and 
  NPC1 has a 9 and NPC2 has a 6 then I could delay until 9 and then go 
  again at 7. Potentially killing both. Your right though about it being 
  another way to make up for the init pass rules. Just because you wait 
  doesn't mean you can move twice as fast when you finally do act." 

Rae says "ooh ooh can i interrupt?" 

Greg says "Lets go around once more and get comments from both of you if 
  you have any. Then we will move on. For Rae we will go backwards this 
  time. Rae then Todai." 

Greg says "DOne" 

Rae says "nono. You can't have more than one action in an initaitive 
  pass" 

Rae says "so say 27 22 and 16" 

Rae says "27 delays until 22" 

Rae says "his next action is on 17." 

Rae says "we clear on that?" 

Rae says "22 goes" 

Rae says "16 holds action TO THE NEXT PASS" 

Rae says "17 goes" 

Greg nods "AHHHH! Good Point. Okay I no longer have a problem with it." 

Rae stops then, ifya get it 

Greg says "Todai anymore comments?" 

Todai says "Only to say that although you can't have two actions in the 
  same pass, you can get two back to back actions." 

Todai says "The example on 103 shows that. I'm done." 

Todai says "Actually. I think I misread. Please ignore that." 

Rae ponders. if you went on 29 

Rae says "and delayed until the end of that pass 

"Rae says "you could conceivably have 2 actions back to back. er, done, 
  bah sorry for out of turn if I was" 

Greg says "NP. Your right you could. If you delayed until everyone else 
  took there turn. So what do you think about this then? Is that 
  something that is important enough to warrent changing the delayed 
  action rules for our own personal use here on Seattle? Todai."" 

Todai says "I do not believe that we should change it. Assuming that 
  combat takes place and the fastest person decides to delay his action 
  to the end of the phase and gets away with it (ie doesn't get shot), 
  then that person should be allowed back to back actions. The only 
  problem I see with that could be in an ambush situation (with a very 
  lenient GM). Example on the way:"Player A is ambushing Player B from 
  some pretty good cover. Init's are rolled, Player A wins, and then 
  decides to hold his action, praying that the Player B will fail his 
  perception test to spot Player A. Assuming Player B does fail that 
  perception test, he gets doubly hosed by A who gets 4 shots. 

Todai says "I propose accepting the delayed actions as they are written, 
  but putting in a cavet &LTsp?&GT that back to back actions cannot happen 
  in an ambush situation."Todai says "Done."Rae assumes reaction tests 
  were made?Todai dohs. "I'm sorry. Ambushes are done by reaction test, 
  not init. That example is worthless. Please excuse me."You say "But 
  your right they could get two actions. But only if they succeed in 
  suprising them. We can discuss that when we get to suprise." 

Greg says "Rae do you think it warrents change or keep SR3 rules on 
  that." 

Rae thnks it can stay for now.... 

Greg says "I agree. It is minor and if it poses any really problems a 
  house rule can be made at a later date. Anyone have a problem with the 
  timed items rules? 

Todai says "I like the way it's written."You say "Rae?" 

Rae has no troubles withit either 

Greg says "Me either." 

Greg says "Okay well what do you think about the KP refreshing every 
  24hours. Says every 24 hours or at GM discretion actually. Todai do 
  you have any feelings on that?" 

Greg says "Top of page 104" 

Todai says "I like the 24 hour idea. It only requires that the admin who 
  runs the TS where KP is used, GMnotes the PC on how much karma was 
  used, including the date and time. The PC can then page any admin when 
  24 hours has passed to have the note removed. Done." 

Greg says "Rae?" 

Rae says "I hate gmnnoting, I hate removing, I get annoyed unreasonably 
  at the poor pc's who want it refreshed. It can be annoying if someone 
  forgets, and used for abuse by the pc's.On the other hand, it'd set a 
  reasonable standard, and POSSIBLY the refresh could be coded into the 
  dailies. If we leave this at 24 hours, then i'd recommend the code, 
  and ALSO that we discuss a general base of things that kp can be used 
  for." 

Rae is done 

Greg sits down on the fence "I like the idea of refreshing 24 hours a 
  day like Todai. However like Rae I know how annoying GMnoting can be. 
  As for coding it I don't know if that would work because it is not 
  refreshed at midnight but 24 hours from use. THis would be way to 
  crazy though and refreshing at midnight every night would be rather 
  taxing. I do like the idea though and one more GMnote shouldn't hurt 
  us to badly. Done so back to Todai if you have anymore comments 

Greg says "Taxing as in every single PCs attribute would have to be 
  changed. Lots of PCs here." 

Todai says "I still stand by my GMnote idea, but I'm going to agree with 
  Rae that having a PC page you to remove a GMnote can be bother some. 
  Instead a simple system should be setup. All karma pool related 
  GMnotes should be listed as "Current Karma Pool" so that when a 
  staffer shows up and drops a timestop, they can then check all GMnotes 
  on the involved PCs and easily find if any have had karma pool 
  reductions within the last 24 hours. If it has been more than 24 
  hours, the admin running the scene can remove the GMnote. If it isn't, 
  the admin can then remind the PC that they only have X amount of KP 
  for the TS." 

Todai says "Done." 

Rae hrms 

Rae says "ok, instead of a gmnote...maybe something like the damage 
  chart that the pc could see? 

Rae says "or else a number somewhere...kp avail" 

Rae isn't sure. But i hate gmnoteing and removing 

Rae is done 

Greg says "Okay. Lets move on cause it is gettting late. Let me say one 
  closing note. PCs wouldn't need to page RPAs to refresh KP since they 
  wouldn't need them until removed until they want to use the KP again. 
  Lets move on. From what I can tell the combat phase and actions are 
  all the same. Anyone have a problem with anything on pages 104-107 
  that we have not discussed?" 

Rae nopes. 

Todai nopesY 

ou say "Okay lets skip to Movement. Todai you have any comments on the 
  movement rules?" 

Todai says "Nope;" 

Rae acks....I'm so sorry, must go..kiddies squirming..and i've no 
  troubles with movement...can you two log this ifya continue? I'll be 
  on tomorrow as wel 
lGreg nods "Can you continue Todai?" 

Todai says "Not a problem." 

Rae waves 

.You say "Okay. Back to movement. Any problems with it?"Todai says "No 
  problems what so ever." 

Greg says "Me either." 

Greg says "I was unsure about the running once a combat turn but it 
  keeps people from moving faster then light." 

Greg nods "NP All this talking will dry out your mouth&LTG&GT How about 
  Surprise. Same as SR2 as far as I could tell. Any problems with it?" 

Todai says "I may be misreading the section, but I don't see where it 
  states HOW MANY actions a person gets. FASA does a great job of 
  describing the process of suprise (reaction test vs. TN 4 with 
  modifiers), they explain that you need to get more successes than 
  someone to act against them, but it doesn't say how many actions the 
  "winner" of the reaction test gets." 

Greg says "I think you only get one. Your right they don't say though. 
  Was one in SR2 I believe. We will assume one. Any other comments. 

"Todai says "None other than we should get an official answer as to how 
  many actions a person is allowed and write it down somewhere to 
  minimize confusion." 

Greg says "I agree we need to note how many attacks you actually get. 
  How about ranged combat. From what I can tell the only difference is 
  the ability to dodge. Did you find any other differences and what are 
  your feelings on this difference." 

Todai says "I understand the system but I have a few worries that really 
  aren't anything more than power gaming issues."say Well then lets 
  discuss them. That is one of the purposes of this meeting anyways 

.You say "Well then lets discuss them. That is one of the purposes of 
  this meeting anyways." 

Todai says "Lets say you get shot with a 14S sniper rifle. Your armor 
  takes that down to 9S. The TN for a damage resistance test is 9, the 
  TN for a dodge is 4 give or take. It seems to me that the smart player 
  will toss all of his dice into the dodge test because those successes 
  carry over to damage resistance even if he doesn't completely dodge 
  the attack." 

Todai says "Also, since you are allowed to use CP, in theory you could 
  toss more dice than you would for the actual damage resistance test. 
  So if the person knows they are going to be shot anyway, they dodge to 
  reduce most of the damage at a lower TN and whatever successes they 
  get from their body is just icing on the cake." 

Todai says "Done." 

Greg nods "Good point. I really like the dodge idea but your right it 
  does pose a cheap way out. Only thing is you have to know you are 
  being shot. If it is from behind or you are suprised you cannot use 
  it. Do you have any ideas of changes that could be made. I was 
  thinking roll against TN of number of successes but that makes it more 
  likely that you will have a TN less then 4. Done 

Todai says "The only thing I can suggest is doing away with the rule 
  entirely. I haven't actually played with SR3 rules so I'm not 
  confident in saying that it will unbalance combat. It just seems a 
  little weak that your 3 body PC who in the old day could only throw a 
  max of 9 (including KP) dice against an attack can now drop their 
  entire CP against a (sometimes much) reduced TN. It's not anything 
  worth losing sleep over, but it will be interesting to see how it 
  works out. Done." 

Greg nods "I guess the way I look at it is that it is a way to allow the 
  low body people to use there intelligence and there quickness to there 
  advantage. Trolls with big bodies can take the bullet in the chest but 
  this allows others with low bodies and high quickness atts to try and 
  jump out of the way.You say "I think it will even things out pretty 
  well actually for that reason. Now trolls wont have such an advantage 
  when they are being shot at."You say "And there are mods for bursts 
  and damage. You also need to remember that CP doesn't refresh every 
  time you get an action. Only once a turn. So if you burn it early you 
  are in big trouble." 

Greg says "DONE." 

Todai says "You bring up a good point of the dodge helping those who 
  aren't primarily combat monsters. I like that view. Onto the next 
  topic?"say Okay this is where I need your help. Don't let me skip 
  anything you think is important because IMHO there is a big gap here. 
  Next thing I found different is that Gel rounds are full power for 
  knockdown. 

You say "Okay this is where I need your help. Don't let me skip anything 
  you think is important because IMHO there is a big gap here. Next 
  thing I found different is that Gel rounds are full power for 
  knockdown."You say "You see anything before that?" 

Todai shakes his head. "I don't see anything before gel rounds. As for 
  gel rounds, why do you feel giving them full power for knockdown is 
  bad? Gel rounds are designed to knock people down, not kill them. I 
  think that it makes sense to give them better odds of knocking someone 
  down than a regular bullet. Done." 

Greg says "No I didn't think it was bad. Just I don't recall SR2 doing 
  that. I like it." 

Todai ahs. "Alright. Good deal." 

Greg says "Okay Do you see anything else in the combat section that is 
  different or that you have aproblem with." 

Todai shakes his head. "I like the dual cyber implant weapon rule 
  (increased damage). Other than that, the rules seem to be pretty much 
  the same and I have no complaints."You say "Ah yes your right. I like 
  that too. I guess that brings us to the Riggers rules then right?" 

Todai nods. "I'm going to admit that I know nothing about the rigger 
  rules and didn't read them. I have no desire to play a rigger. If you 
  want good input on the rigger system, I'd talk to Damien, 
  Shanghai/Reemul, or Tieriel." 

Greg nods "Well I appreciate your honesty. I guess we are done then. 
  Thank you for your help. Your input was very helpful.
