<h3>What are Archetypes?</h3>

<hr width=50%>
<h3>What type of Archetypes can I play?</h3>
<hr width=50%>

<h4><A name=Samurai>Street Samurai</h4>
 
There are so many characters that fall into the loose category of 
'samurai' that we could write reams of text that listed them all. Mercs, 
Bodyguards, Former Company Men, Former Military Officers, as well as your
basic street-pred urban predators. The main thing that pulls these 
characters all together is that their primary function is usually combat.
<P> 
Deckers have the Matrix, Magicians spellcast and go on astral quests, 
Riggers zip around with drones and cars and helicopters, but all samurai
usually have is the ability to kick some butt.
<P>
There is a surplus of "plain vanilla" street sams on SRMUSH.  Muscle is
relatively cheap for shadowruns because it's so plentiful. Also, if all 
you can do is beat people up, there are limited opportunities for RP. The
best way to make sure that you can keep busy (both in RP and shadowruns) 
is to make sure that your character is more than just a set of Wired 
Reflexes with a gun.
<P>
Adding 'specialties' to your character, be it mechanic, biotech, 
electronics expert, demolitionist, paranatural hunter or what have you, 
adds increase opportunities for RP.
<P>
Some guidelines for creating a samurai:
<UL>
	<LI> try and come up with an original skillset and cyberware mix
	<LI> review NEWS RULES SKILLS LEVELS when you choose combat skills and make
  sure that the level you assign to a skill is appropriate to your BG
	<LI> remember you don't necessarily need Wired Reflexes to be a good fighter
	<LI> most people that are good at violence have a specialty
	<LI> decide how your character feels about his cyber and why (s)he got it
	<LI> find something to make your character unique among samurai-types
</UL>
Being a muscle-type character in Shadowrun can be a rewarding experience
if you let it evolve beyond simple combat. Anyone can +roll dice in a 
timestop; the talented samurai grow into something more than just 
effective combatants.

<h4><A name=Decker>Decker</h4>
This is the straight stuff from the Matrix RPStaff, chummers. If you want
to be a decker, read it, learn it, and live with it.
<P< 
If you wish to be a decker on here you must have VR2 Virtual Realities 2
experience and have played a decker in tabletop games. The reason for this 
is that the decker is one of the hardest character classes on here. The 
matrix is almost totally automated and you will become totally lost if you 
do not have this experience. We suggest first time players to the MUSH do 
not try and play a decker unless you have a lot of experience with VR2.
<P>
DECKER CHARACTERS RULES FOR SRMUSH:
<UL>
	<LI> Character Attributes of 1 are not allowed
	<LI> Computer skill must not be below a 4 and above a 6; you may concentrate  the 6 to 5(7) though
	<LI> must take Computer, Matrix Etiquette, one of the programming knowledge skills , and B/R Computer skills
	<LI> must get a datajack
	<LI> no other skill besides matrix skills (above) may be above a 4
	<LI> must have at least 840k left over in resources completing cg 
</UL>
Background Rules:
<OL>
	<LI> Your background must be original (something different not the norm).
	<LI> You cannot use Megacorporations in your background; you CAN use a sub-sidiary of a megacorp, but limit the impact you've had on this corp.
	<LI> Try and stay away from creating a college-student with a lot of schooling
   this is a shadow world so keep that in mind with the backgrounds.
	<LI> DO NOT just answer the NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS straight out, but add the
   answers within your characters story.
	<LI> DO NOT add unnecessary character descriptions within the BG. 
	<LI> Your background should be written like a story/essay. Make it interesting
   to read and it should be a minimum of about 2 pages in length. 
	<LI> Somewhere in your story there would be 2 types of NPC character that the
   matrix staff might use to get you involved in Tinyplots. Note they do 
   not have to be fixers and should not be a family member or considered a
   "Buddy" contact. They should be just someone you met and have done some 
   biz with or that you owe something to. Try and describe this NPC a 
   little so a Mjudge can play them.
	<LI> Do not make your story all positive and filled with what you can do good
   with no flaws. Everyone has flaws and we like to see them in your
   background, too. (also review NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS).
	<LI> Finally, DO NOT have your character create fake SIN's in your BG, we 
   do not allow players to fake SIN's greater then a rating 2 on here.
<P>
Final tips:
<UL>
	<LI> Remember when making your character, you order your deck and programs 
  AFTER you have been approved so save those resource points. The more
  cyberware you get the less you will have to spend on that deck.
	<LI> Spend some time thinking about your character's Matrix ICON and what it
  means (if anything). 
	<LI> Decide how your character feels about the Matrix and define it in your
  background.  This character is a DECKER, so the Matrix will help define
  who (s)he is.
	<LI> There are some advantages to playing a metahuman (non-elf) decker. 
  Contact Matrix RPStaff for more information.
	<LI> Don't expect to start out as powerful as Dodger or Fastjack. You'll have
  to grow into your talent and it will take time. Enjoy the ride, it will
  be a lot of fun!

<h4><A name=Ganger>Ganger</h4>
The ganger system is a little bit in flux, so this section just contains
a few tidbits of advice for those who want to play street-scum. 
<P>
<OL>  
<LI> There are restrictions on what cyberware gangers can have, what skills
   they can have and more. Check out the Ganger Recruitment area in
   Chargen for more information. 
<LI> There are several IC gangs made up of players and NPCs.  If you want to
   be a member of a gang, it's a good idea to try and get in contact with
   some of the members of the gang BEFOREHAND as well as trying to discuss
   your app with one of the Ganger Admins (See +staff/all).
<LI> The GANGER ADVANTAGE. It seems like there's not a lot of up side to 
   being a ganger. You can't start with Wired Reflexes-2, your skills 
   aren't that great to start with and you've got pre-set enemies all over 
   the 'plex. What's the up side? In SR's combat system, every opponent 
   beyond the first you engage in Unarmed or Armed combat at the same time
   give as YOU imparts a +1 to their TNs to hit and a -1 to your TNs to hit.
   This means when you and three buddies fight a samurai, the sammy has a 
   TN of 6 and the three gangers each have TNs 2 to hit. The sammy's 
   probably going to get pasted. It pays to have friends.   
<LI> Gangs are a good place to start off as a player on SRMUSH. You have 
   some ready-made partners to RP with, you have some pretty clearly 
   defined goals and you can have a lot of fun.
<LI> Some (though not all) gangs require you to join them once you get IC. 
   You create a 'wannabe' character, someone who is ready to join a gang
   but hasn't yet done so. Then, you can attempt to join the gang through
   roleplaying.  From the personal accounts of many gang players, this
   is one of the most-fun RP experiences, as they try to convince the gang
   that they've got 'the right stuff'.
</UL>
<P>
More ganger information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Ganger Admins and players.

<hr width=50%>

<h4><A name=Rigge>Rigger</h4>
 Being a rigger is a chance to be more than "the guy who drives the cars".
Especially with the release of the Rigger 2 sourcebook and some dedicated
staff on SRMUSH devoted to riggers, they are flourishing as a character 
type.
<P> 
Here are some guidelines for prospective Rigger characters:
<OL>
	<LI> You should own a copy of Rigger 2 and understand the rules therein.
   Shadowrun MUSH uses the Rigger 2 rules (with some exceptions, see the 
   postings on the +bboards) and if you want to rig, it's best if you
   know them.
	<LI> In order to be a rigger, you must have a datajack and a Vehicle Control
   Rig.  Even players who claim they have played Riggers in TT games often
   neglect to give their character a VCR and thus, are not riggers.
	<LI> Explain the relationship your character has to rigging. Why does (s)he
   rig? How did (s)he get started? What kinds of vehicles does (s)he rig?
   Rigging is primarily for high-performance vehicles. Joe Public doesn't
   get a VCR so he can drive his Americar better. Nor does FedEx equip 
   its drivers with VCRs to drive their vans around, collecting packages. 
   You might want to be more original than "he was a corp rigger" or "she 
   was in the army and decided to become a rigger" as well.
	<LI> You get to start with a rigged vehicle and 2 drones, maximum. Choose 
   these to reflect the background your character has and what would be
   most appropriate, not just what you can get that has the most "bang 
   for the buck".
	<LI> Not every Rigger needs to be a mechanic. Though it helps to be able to
   jury-rig repairs on your main vehicle, if you need to go to a mechanic
   for this, it provides a good RP opportunity. 
</UL>
<P>
More rigger information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Rigger Admins and players.

<hr width=50%>

<h4><A name=Fixer>Fixer</h4>
SRMUSH offers a chance to play a Fixer, brokering deals for nuyen, power 
and shadowruns in the criminal underworld of Seattle. There are some 
forthcoming policy changes that will likely change how fixers are treated,
but in the interim, here are some general guidelines and advice for
wannabe-Fixers. The application process for Fixers is fairly demanding. 
With the additional power available to most Fixers, responsibility and 
maturity are also required. See your Fixer Admins for more details.
<OL> 
	<LI> Your rep is your livelihood. How you behave, in your BG and once you're
   IC, will determine what people think of you and what kind of business
   they're willing to transact with you. If you don't have the natural
   paranoia and shadow-smarts to play like a top-class Fixer, then don't
   create one in your BG . . . play an amateur Fixer who still needs to 
   learn all the ropes.
	<LI> Your most important skills are your Etiquettes and your Negotiation. You need to demonstrate HOW the character became  so street-savvy or corp-savvy (or whatever) in the BG.
 	<LI> You are who you know. Without contacts, a Fixer can't DO anything. You
   must cultivate contacts and relationship in order to be a successful
   Fixer.
  	<LI> You are more than a gear distribution device. Many players treat their
   local Fixer like a shadowy Stuffer Shack. They demand this, that and
   the other thing, all with APDS ammo and then the player will often 
   quote sourcebook prices to the Fixer and get all in a snit if they 
   can't get what they want or if the Fixer deviates from the list price.
   Equipment sales the LEAST lucrative part of being a Fixer. The margins
   on brokering shadowruns and info trading are generally much higher and
   much more likely to put the Fixer into the lap of luxury.
<P> 
More Fixer information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Fixer Admins and players.

<h4><A name=Mage><A name=Shaman>Mage and Shaman</h4>
Magical applications are restricted on SRMUSH. Currently, once a month or
so, applications are opened up and people can compete for a number of open
"slots" for various kinds of magical characters. The info on the opening 
and closing of applications is typically posted to +bboard 1 (General).
<P>
Because of the competitive process for magical applications, these 
backgrounds need to be EXTREMELY well done.  Applicants must display 
their knowledge of Shadowrun and Shadowrun magic, their creative ability 
and their sense of how the magic of their character 'works'.
<P> 
On average, the background for successful magical applicants run anywhere
from 20 to 40 one or two-paragraph Bgslots. This translates into 
something like 3000-5000 words. Length isn't a requirement, but most 
people find that in order to explain their character concept in the 
required depth, a fairly long BG develops.
<P> 
When writing a background for a magical character, the character's magic 
is one of the most important aspects of the character. Therefore, the BG
must include good detail about the character's magic, the character's 
feelings and/or perceptions about the magic and some sort of proof that
the player understands how Shadowrun Magic is supposed to work. It's not
absolutely required, but possession of the SRII rulebook, the Grimoire 
2ed and Awakenings will be extremely helpful to a magical character.
 
The Magic RPStaff can provide more insight into exactly what they're 
looking for in an magical application. In the meantime, here are some 
tips for magical applicants.
<UL>
<LI> Cat, Raccoon and Snake shamans are a little overdone here at SRMUSH
<LI> fetish-required spells are looked kindly upon because they stimulate RP
  with the MUSH's talismongers
<LI> playing a magical character is considered a privilege and magical 
  players are expected to be online and RPing as often as possible
</UL>
More magical information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Magic Admins and players.
