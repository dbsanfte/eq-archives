      <p><b>SKILL TRAINING TIME</b></p>
      <p>Under the training rules, the time a character must spend to improve 
        a skill depends on the type of skill being learned as shown on the Skill 
        Improvement Table. </p>
      <p>Characters can reduce the base training time by making a Skill Test using 
        the skill they are improving (this test represents how quickly the character 
        comprehends new topics and relates them to his existing ability in the 
        skill).</p>
      <p>The base target number is equal to the new skill rating being trained 
        for plus 2. If the character has used the skill often in game play, especially 
        in stressful situations, the game master can apply a -1 target modifier 
        to the Skill Test. (Admins may adjust this modifier to suit the character 
        and game situation if desired). </p>
      <p>Characters may also default to another skill or attribute for the above 
        test, per standard rules. </p>
      <p>Characters may also reduce their training by enlisting the aid of a live 
        or virtual instruction. To calculate the final training time, divide the 
        base time by the number of successes achieved on the Skill Test. If the 
        character achieves no successes, multiply the base training time by 1.5 
        and round up.</p>
      <p>Generally, training time must be uninterrupted--otherwise, the required 
        time period increases. If the character fails to train for a number of 
        days equal to his or her Intelligence Rating plus the new skill rating, 
        he must allow for extra training time. The extra time equals the number 
        of days remaining in the required training time multiplied by 2. This 
        extra training time reflects how long the character must spend &quot;getting 
        back up to speed.&quot; Characters may incur extra training time an unlimited 
        number of times.</p>
      <p><b>LEARNING A NEW SKILL</b></p>
      <p>Though the Shadowrun rules have always allowed player characters to learn 
        new skills during the course of the game (post-character creation), Shadowrun, 
        Third Edition, only offers a very basic outline for doing this (see pp 
        245-246, SR3).</p>
      <p>Characters can learn new skills through self-directed study (the do-it-yourself 
        method), or by training with a live or virtual instructor. Generally, 
        characters can use the do-it-yourself method to learn only skills related 
        to those the character already possesses. At their discretion, however, 
        individual gamemasters may drop this restriction, limit it to certain 
        specific skills, or even expand the restriction. </p>
      <p><b>Do-It-Yourself Method</b></p>
      <p>The do-it-yourself method enables characters to learn new skills without 
        the aid of an instructor. This method often makes learning more difficult, 
        and even dangerous at times (especially when learning skills such as Demolitions, 
        Biotech or Vectored Thrust Piloting, to name a few). In addition to these 
        common-sense examples, the gamemaster may otherwise restrict the choice 
        of skills that a character can learn on his own. </p>
      <p>To determine the final training time required to learn the new skill, 
        divide the base training time by the number of successes from the test. 
        If the test yields no successes, multiply the base training time by 1.5 
        to calculate the final training time. At the end of the training period, 
        the character possesses the new skill. (Characters who interrupt their 
        training may incur extra training time, as noted in Skill Training Time, 
        above). </p>
      <p>Characters always learn new skills at Rating 1.</p>
      <p><b>Training with An Instructor</b></p>
      <p>Instructors can aid characters in two ways. First, they may enable characters 
        to learn new skills they cannot learn on their own. Second, they can help 
        reduce the training time required to improve an existing skill or learn 
        a new one.</p>
      <p>Any qualified character can serve as an instructor. The student character 
        can try to convince a friend to teach him or her a skill, enlist the aid 
        of a contact, or seek out a professional instructor. Friends and contacts 
        may accept favors in return for instruction, but professional instructors 
        usually demand nuyen for their services (See Instructor Fees, pg 50).</p>
      <p>An instructor must posses two basic qualifications. First, the instructor 
        must know the skill the student wishes to learn at a rating of 3 or higher. 
        If the student wants to improve a skill, the instructor must have a skill 
        rating that equals or exceeds the rating the student wishes to achieve. 
        Second, the instructor must possess the Instruction Skill (see pages 87 
        and 95, SR3). An individual without the Instruction Skill can attempt 
        to teach a skill, but the person must default to Charisma to do so.</p>
      <p><b>Teaching</b></p>
      <p>When teaching a new skill or helping a character improve an existing 
        skill rating, an instructor makes an Instruction (4) Test. If the instructor 
        does not posses the Instruction Skill, he or she makes a Charisma (8) 
        Test (as if defaulting from Instruction). For every 2 successes the test 
        generates, add 1 to the student's Skill Test success total, for purposes 
        of reducing the student's required training time. </p>
      <p>If the Instruction Test or Skill Test generates no successes, the instructor 
        simply cannot teach the student. To simulate this failure in the game 
        universe, the student must compensate the instructor for his or her efforts 
        by forfeiting one day's worth of pay to the instructor, and must add 1.5 
        days to the training time for the skill--this represents the characters's 
        disappointment at failing with one instructor and the need to shift gears 
        to find another teacher, not to mention the nuyen spent on the first instructor.</p>
      <p>The gamemaster can use any number of reasons to explain the failure in 
        role playing terms--the instructor and student may have philosophical 
        differences, the instructor's methods may clash with the material, or 
        the two characters may distrust one another or simply be incompatible. 
      </p>
      <p>Characters who are leaning a new skill with the aid of an instructor 
        also receive a -1 TN on the Skill Tests for learning new skills. An instructor 
        must train with the student for the student's entire training time. If 
        the instructor leaves before the student has completed the training, double 
        the remaining training time. This increase represent the greater difficulty 
        of learning on one's own. </p>
      <p><b>Instructor Fees </b></p>
      <p>Instructor fees preset a convenient way for game masters to curb characters 
        that may threaten game balance by accumulating massive skill sets. The 
        Suggested Instructor Fees Table provides suggested daily instructor fees, 
        but gamemasters should modify fees as they see fit. After all, better 
        instructors will command higher fees than mediocre instructors, and instruction 
        in rare or highly prized skills will cost more than instruction in common 
        skills.</p>

      </table>
      <p><b>Virtual Instructors</b></p>
      <p>If a character cannot find a live instructor or does not want to use 
        one, he or she can purchase a &quot;virtual instructor&quot; (pg 95, SR3). 
        Virtual instructors may take the form of simsense chips, optical computer 
        disks or trideo tapes.</p>
      <p>As with living instructors, every virtual-instructor program has an effective 
        skill rating in the skill it teaches and an Instruction Skill rating. 
        The program cannot make an Instruction Test to reduce the student's base 
        training time, but all other standard instructor rules apply. Perhaps 
        the most important advantage a virtual instructor offers is that a character 
        can purchase a chip with a very high skill rating and then use the same 
        program when training for multiple advanced ratings in a single skill.</p>
      <p><b>Training Days</b></p>
      <p>A standard training-time &quot;day&quot; is 4 hours. Thus a training 
        time of 30 days equals 120 hours of study. </p>
      <p>A character who is particularly eager to learn or improve a skill can 
        train for more than 4 hours a day, though no metahuman can train 24 hours 
        a day. A character's daily training limit equals half o his or her Willpower 
        (rounded down) +4. </p>
      <p>Characters can train beyond their daily training limit, but such training 
        may prove ineffective. A character who wants to train in this manner must 
        declare how many hours beyond the limit he intends to train. To determine 
        how many of these hours will pay off, the character make a Willpower (10) 
        Test. The result is the number of extra hours of effective practice the 
        character can put in beyond his or her daily training limit. No matter 
        what the test result, the character may not exceed his declared extra 
        practice time.</p>
      <p>To determine the number of days the character will need to complete his 
        training at the new pace, simply divide the total number of hours in the 
        training time by the character's total daily training period.</p>
      <p><b>Improving Attributes</b></p>
      <p>If desired, gamemasters may allow player characters to improve their 
        Attributes in the same manner they improve skills. (For role playing purposes, 
        the player character will need to devise some way to &quot;work out&quot; 
        using the Attribute. For example, A character might lift weights for several 
        hours each day to improve his or her Strength. In all cases, the gamemaster 
        determines if a proposed training regimen is appropriate.) </p>
      <p>The base training time to improve an Attribute is the same as the basic 
        time for an active Skill (7 days times the number of Karma Points required 
        for the improvement). See 244,SR3, for karma costs of Attribute increases. 
        To reduce the training time, a player character can make an Attribute 
        (6) Test, using the Attribute he or she is improving. </p>
      <p>Generally, player characters can raise their Attributes without the help 
        of instructors. However, the gamemasters may require that characters use 
        an instructor it they want to raise an Attribute beyond its Racial Modified 
        Limit. </p>
      <p>Gamemasters may also require that the characters use instructors when 
        increasing their Willpower, Intelligence or Charisma Ratings.</p>
      <p>Instructor rules and fees for Attribute training are generally the same 
        as for skill training. However, the instructor skill qualifications do 
        not apply. Instead, the instructor must possess an Instruction Skill Rating 
        that exceeds the Attribute Rating the student wants to achieve. (The instructor's 
        ability to motivate the student is much more important than his own skill 
        during Attribute training.)</p>
