Gleichberechtigung                 Fri Dec 10    Occam

	If you don't know German, you're probably wondering what the 
title means. If I didn't have a dictionary, I wouldn't either. It 
literally translates as 'equal rights'. At the risk of sounding a bit 
old-fashioned, Metanite has always attempted to be the crusader, the 
knight in shining armor to the disparity of rights.
	You can stop laughing now.
	 In recent times, Metanite has been silent. Our voice has not 
been spoken, so our voice has not been heard. This is a voice that must 
be brought to the forefront again, a voice which does not read off 
propaganda or false reports but instead seeks two things. To speak the 
truth, and to speak for equality. 
	I sincerely apologize to you, the reader, if you think my words 
committed here to be nothing more than idealistic rambling. I also 
pray, dear reader, that I will be able to prove you wrong should you 
think that. If Metanite was to turn into a mere propaganda machine, it 
would be no better than the larger outfits for whom stories are edited 
to fit the outfit's "acceptable story content". Suppression is what we 
are fighting against - and we will not accomplish it by becoming worse 
as bad as those who would keep equality at its current imbalance. 
	So what does this mean for you? Well - the salient point is this. 
Metanite is here, and it is here to stay.

	It has recently come to my attention that I have neglected to 
give thanks to Sevrina Marcieu, who briefly took the helm of Metanite 
after the kidnapping of our previous editor. Her work during that 
troubled time allowed the paper to keep going. My hat's off to you, 
Sevrina.
	As the new editor here, I would appreciate it if all of our old 
advertisers would get in touch with us again so that I can meet you 
people who have chosen to support our cause. We subsist mostly on the 
contributions of our advertisers, who enable us to continue to put 
forth our voice to the public. We are, however, always looking for new 
advertisers. Please - do contact us and help support our cause. The 
office number is LTG6347-96961.
	Thank you for your support, and here's to a wonderful future.

Situations                         Fri Dec 17    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	News seems to exist to give us one thing. That is, as slang would 
say: Now chummers an chica's. That's the scan on how things went down.
	Ever since the early twentieth century, the press as a whole has 
started to become less and less an information service, and more and 
more a propaganda service. This is precisely what Metanite exists for - 
to avoid becoming sed service and instead to report what occured, as 
things occured. But a small operation like ourselves cannot do it just 
by ourselves. The simple factz of the matter are that we need your 
help. 
	We have several openings in our staff. As the Editor, I don't 
want to be the only columnist. More reporters out in the field are 
needed as well. Want to apply? Leave a message on our phone (LTG6347-
96961) or just drop by the office during working hours. Someone will be 
there to talk to you.
	We look forward to talking to all of you who apply. 
	And to all of you who expressed your interest in taking out 
advertisements, thank you. The wheels have been set in motion and 
representatives will be calling you to set up a meeting time.
	There are also quite a few people out there who have donated to 
our cause. Thank you. We hope that we will not disappoint your 
expectations of us.
	We're off to a great start. Let's hope to continue this.

Misty Towers Casino                Fri Jan 14    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	Well, well, well. It's always very reassuring to know that our 
comrades at Net23 are still quite capable of botching a story 
_unintentionally_. It appears that whoever was responsible for the 
research on the terrorist attack on the Misty Towers Casino either did 
not look quite indepth enough, or was nipping a little bit too heavily 
into the drink. 
	We have it on very good sources that security did _not_ take down 
the two troll hostage takers. Instead, two men sitting at the bar there 
were responsible for the death and wounding of the two. So, bravo to 
Tower Security for taking out the others, but credit must be reserved 
for the two civilians who stepped in to save the day. Blair and Peter - 
good work! 

	Now - all of the news these days seems to be about terrorism. We 
have, on the one hand, Free Humanis United - dedicated to wiping out 
all metahumanity. Now we have ORK. Two different causes. Both using 
tactics of terror. Zero worthwhile results.
	Terrorism seems to be the catch-all, 'best thought' way to do 
things nowadays. Take a look at history - never in a single case has 
terrorism ended up getting the desired result. It alienates more people 
than it rouses. 
	Oh - and one other thing. Metanite is putting up a 10,000 Nuyen 
reward towards the capture of any of the FHU leaders. A further 5,000 
Nuyen will be rewarded to anyone who is able to aid in the tracking 
down and arrest of FHU's sources of funding. We are also offering cash 
for information regarding FHU. 
	And thus, Metanite lays down the guantlet. We are a small 
newspaper. Nuyen does _not_ come easy to us. However, too many 
businesses - and people - ten thousand is chump change, as the old 
colloquialism goes. We challenge all who are capable - especially our 
brethern over at Net23 - to match our reward, or increase it. They have 
no fear of anyone rising up to catch them - let's show them fear!

Hunters Hunted - by N5             Wed Jan 19    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	Terrorism motivated by racism is at an all time high in our city. 
Who hasn't seen, read or heard of the interview with a representative 
of Free Humanis United done by Network23 Reporter Occam Averroist? 
	Even now, their violent actions have spawned new violence as the 
ORC Policlub joins the fray. One has to wonder how long this is 
supposed to go on lke this. 
	This reporter has decided to look for answers to that question. 
With Lone Star hard pressed to contain the threat, the eyes of the 
public turn to those whom most stereotype as 'glorified killers' - the 
bounty hunters. After some time trying to dig up one of those 
illustrious individuals, this reporter got her reward more by chance 
than by design. The following interview was recorded from a 
conversation with a man calling himself Knight. This man is one of the 
bounty hunters who work in this city. He decided to go after them, and 
in this article are his own words, verbatim:

{Ed: The following is a transcription of sed recording.} 

N5: "Metanite, among other parties has put a contract on the Free 
Humanis United. What is your professional opinion on this matter?" 

Knight: "Well, it's obvious that the Terrorists have been striking 
different parts of town, from airplanes to casinos, and in only one 
instance have I noted that a professional team of people were able to 
handle the situation, that being Misty Towers Security, but even then 
they needed some help. I can deduct that the Lone Star or any other 
offical Security Division is rather helpless and as a result Metanite 
has put up this bounty.. So that we <pause> Whether we are more 
professional is debateable,but the bounty gives a wider range of 
professionals a chance to take down the criminals..." 

N5: "It is obvious that FHU is a highly dedicated organization 
comprised of dangerous and well armed people. Since Lone Star was 
unable to contain the threat, how do you estimate your own 
probabilities to succed. <pause> In case you even considered going 
after them." 

K: "Well, Its true that the FHU is rather powerful, I have even had 
threats against my life.. But Terrorists are much like sheep. If the 
shepherd leaves, or in this case dies, they scatter, and are left 
untended. <pause> My chance of suceeding? Well that all depends if I 
can find the shepherd or not." 

N5: "So you considered killing their leader?" 

K: "I have considered it, and it's consequences, should I fail." 

N5: "You are not a member of any awakened race. Do politics motivate 
you in this matter?" 

K: "I don't think that the FHU is doing the right thing ... Everyone 
should be treated equal, but I would say, if there was a terrorist 
group that was fighting for equal rights, I would not hesitate to 
vanquish them either.."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

N5: "Did you ever turn down, or take on any particular contract for 
purely personal reasons? Apart from money of course." 

K: "All the time.. I will never get invovled in a bounty where friends 
are involved, or where I don't feel it is the right thing to do.." 

N5: "Let's consider that the leader, or any other member of FHU would 
offer you another bounty for the silencing of the Metanite chief editor 
or any other party that put a bounty on their heads. Would you take 
that contract?" 

K: "Never." 

N5: "So you want to say that such a policy is against your code of 
conduct? Or is it because the people in question are terrorists?" 

K: "Ad omnia paratus.. Prepared for all good works, miss." 

N5: "So your own morale and political views are definitely influencing 
which contracts you take and which ones you don't. Would you agree with 
that?" 

K: "Yes, that is correct." 

N5: "With your inside view on the 'scene' would you say that is a 
common code among those of your profession?" 

K: "Oh dear God no.. I only wish it was.. I can honestly say that 
glorified killer is a good stereotype." 

N5: "So would you say it's more likely that there will be more bounty 
hunters after members of ORC than there will be after members of FHU, 
considered the funding?" 

K: "I would say they would chase the highest price.. Yes." 

N5: "Even if they were members of an awakened race themselves?" 

K: "Well, that's a generalization of course miss." 

N5: "But you think it's possible?" 

K: "Most likely." 

N5: "You said with the larger base of perople after FHU, their downfall 
becomes more likely. Would you say due to the efforts of people like 
yourself, the people of Seattle can look forward to that happening?" 

K: "Yes.. In the near future this reign of terrorism will end and 
Seattle will get back to every day life."

	Well, judging from his words this man seems to try living up to 
his self given name. The question is, are his motives as true as he 
claims? Will he alone be able to make a difference? 
	Of course, there will be others who will go after the terrorists. 
Metahuman gangs, metahuman politiclubs and, of course, other bounty 
hunters who are in it for the money. The odds seem to speak against the 
members of FHU. Soon the dice will be cast, and they will be loaded 
against them. They themselves should think about that. Is your own 
death really worth the effort? It is unlikely that FHU will call off 
their crusade just because innocents get hurt or even killed, they made 
that quite clear. 
	But what if this crusade ends just like the very first one? With 
the crusaders dead, countless of innocents dead as well, and nothing 
changed? 

	Do they really think they can drive all the metahumans out of 
Seattle? 

	All of us together comprise metahumanity. We should begin to 
learn living together instead of fighting pointless battles against 
each other. In the end the members of FHU will be forgotten by all but 
those who lost friends, lovers or relatives to their pointless crusade. 

	In the end they will die as martyrs with a lost cause.

Hunters Hunted - Editor's Comment  Wed Jan 19    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	N5 spoke to perhaps one of the more honorable bounty hunters in 
the profession. I myself have had to deal with them before, and let me 
assure you that most of them are the kind to turn in their own parents 
if the price was right. Knight - your idealism is commendable. 
	Commendable, alas, does not always mean well-placed. Knight 
indicated his personal belief that cutting off the head will end the 
terror. I could not disagree with him more strongly. 
	You mythology buffs out there may already be familiar with the 
legend of the Hydra. It was a nine-headed beast which Hercules, a demi-
god, had to slay as part of his labors. The problem was, each time a 
head was cut off, another two grew back. Another one struck off, 
another two grew back. 
	Of course, Hercules managed to slay the beast, but not without 
cauterizing the neck with a torch before it could grow back. 
	Killing the current head of the FHU will have the exact same 
effect. Two more will spring up. This group is well organized, not some 
hodge-podge of escaped asylum patients, though many of us would like to 
think they are. Instead, they are a well organized group with backers. 
	Backers. People in the background funding them. The necks of the 
beast. 
	It's possible to go on almost infinitely capping the current head 
of the terrorist group, but without finding and destroying their 
funding IT WILL CONTINUE! 
	You may ask why we are offering more money for the capture of the 
leaders than information for the funders. Quite simple - the two are to 
intricately entwined, the reward for one will lead to the reward for 
the other. Keep the information flowing in.

	Well, well, well. The FHU has reared its ugly head again. This 
time attacking the workplace of a prominent Seattle doctor _just_ 
because she is an elf, not a regular plain ol' non-meta. But, then 
again, we can't really expect intelligence from this group of 'true 
humans'... 
	And that brings me to another point... is Lone Star or Net23 
running a coverup here? Think about it - 'commerial explosives'... 6 
kilos of commercial explosives would blow a _hole_ in the wall. 6 kilos 
of military-grade explosives, however... 
	We have a fund going for a reward towards these terrorists... 
let's keep that going. Even if you're just someone 'off-the-street' who 
wants to donate, any amount is wanted. Let's stop these people! 
	Even a breeder like myself can see that they could be the death 
of any of us. Not just meta-humans. They don't _care_ about anybody - 
collateral damage is just 'increased effect' to them. Even you die-hard 
racists out there (assuming that you'd come off your high-horse enough 
to actually read this humble publication) should fear for your lives 
from the FHU.

Juan's Pizzaria                    Wed Feb 16    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	For those that frequent the downtown area, there was what Lone 
Star chooses to term an 'incident' yesterday. Juan's Pizzaria, a small 
restaurant located due north of Tower Homes, now has a little bit of 
'extra ventilation' on the building. 
	It seems that Juan's was used as a drop-off point. Unfortunately 
there is no solid evidence for what sort of event, but a bag was left 
in front of the building earlier in the day. Description are sketchy, 
but one thing is agreed on by almost all the eye-witnesses we managed 
to interview - a black and white haired female went to pick up the bag 
abandoned there. In response to her grab, the doors on a van opened up 
and machine gun fire issued. 
	The female tried to get away, but was tackled off of her bike by 
an orc. The machine-gunner was killed via a pistol by a companion of 
the orc's. 

	Any more information on this event would be much appreciated.

	Early this morning a young ork woman was found dead in a puddle 
in a deserted area of the Underground. Preliminary medical 
investigation indicates electrocution as a possible cause of death. The 
USF is investigating the possibility that it may have been a murder, 
but have declined to comment further at this time. The woman was 
carrying no identification, but it is hoped that DNA tests will reveal 
her identity.

Corporate Crackdown - by N5        Thu Mar  2    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	The early morning of sunday the sixth of february seemed like the 
start of a perfectly ordinary day at Evergreen Gardens, an appartment 
complex right at the invisible border between the international- and 
the elven district of dowtown Seattle. Nobody would have expected that 
this morning should provide the setting for yet another act of 
corporate violence directed against citizens of Seattle. A troupe of 
six corporate operatives went into the appartment complex and opened 
fire on an elven tennant of Evergreen Gardens right outside her 
apartment. As if this display of wanton, callous violence hadn't been 
enough, investigations behind the scenes uncovered, that the elf hadn't 
even been the target of those cold hearted hitmen.

<<IMAGE - Three corporate goons in black suits and mirrorshades looking 
the Man in Black part up to the tee. The image is slightly fuzzy and 2D 
like it has been taken from security camera footage. One of the hitmen 
stands there in a perfect weaver stance shooting his gun. The muzzle 
flash reflects in his mirrorshades. The two others are about to draw 
their own guns, one of them obviously dodging an incoming bullet. The 
picture is taken from a strange angle, above the three men, which 
enforces the thesis that it was originally taken by a security 
camera.>>

	Witnesses report seeing another woman enter the building minutes 
before the corp black ops arrived. She was accompanied by a little girl 
in her early teens. Unfortunately none of the witnesses was able to 
give a satisfactory description of that other woman. The mystery woman 
vanished, nobody saw her leaving the building again. The little girl 
however was taken away by the corporate thugs, obviously kidapped. 
Witnesses outside report that the girl cried for help, futile appeals 
quickly silenced by the heartless operatives. What fate they have in 
store for the girl one can only guess. 

	The only person who could shed light on what really happened in 
that corridor when the shooting started was the young elven woman 
gunned down in front of her appartment. The DocWagon Paramedics who 
arrived to take away the mortally wounded resident were busy trying to 
save her life though, so none of them had the time or the will to 
cooperate telling this reporter her name. Further investigation proved 
that the young woman actually survived, but is under shock and seems 
unable to remember any details. 

	Since the hitmen didn't return to finish their work, it seems 
reasonable to conclude that the young tennant - who wants to remain 
anonymous - was not the one they were after. The woman with the girl 
most probably was. She also put up quite a fight, since of the six men 
entering the building, only two came out, the others died in there. 
Since the innocent resident was unarmed and had no weapons in her 
appartment, it seems the unknown woman had disposed of four operatives 
all by herself. This may have saved the resident's life, but not the 
little girl who went inside with the woman.

	Four men dead, a gunfight inside an appartment complex, a 
kidnapping, a seriously wounded citizen and an escaped mysterious woman 
should be enough to have LoneStar crawling all over the place within 
minutes.

	So you might think! 

	Yet no police investigations were initiated, not even witnesses 
were interviewed, nothing.

	Shawn Thibert, the manager of Evergreen Gardens, claims that he 
_did_ call LoneStar, he refuses to give any further information on the 
matter too. Officer Frank Slater of the 18th precinct confirms 
Thibert's call, but claims that the management has officially declined 
the offer to file charges against the operatives or the escaped woman. 
"Without any witnesses or charges our hands are tied." Slater replied 
when confronted with the "news" of the death of four people and one 
seriously wounded. Local residents were unwilling to report to 
LoneStar, as was Thibert. "I have no obligation to answer your 
questions. You are a reporter not the Star." Thibert brushed off this 
reporter's inquiries.

	Neither did DocWagon report anything. "As long as our customer 
wont press charges - which she didn't - we are not obliged to do so." 
they say in a written reply to our inquiries. 

	The question now is, why is everybody so decidedly unwilling to 
report anything, to press charges or why didn't LoneStar send even 
_one_ patrol just to check the scene

	The answer is as simple as it is unsettling. Those with enough 
money to bribe a whole neighbourhood into silence, or even to threaten 
them with reprisals, those with the funds to buy LoneStar off their 
back can move, act and kill outside justice. Not only inside their 
corporate Enclaves, no, even outside on the streets of Seattle, those 
people are not subject to the laws _we_ have to follow. 

	A witness from the international district - someone equally 
unconcerned about the law - claims to know that the car the operatives 
used belongs to the motor pool of Fuchi IE.

	Of course Fuchi denies everything. "This car was sold off a year 
ago since it didn't fulfill out corporation's high standards anymore. 
We are not asking how you came to the conclusion that it belonged to 
us, and you are well advised not to investigate this matter any further 
or we will ask. And we believe the answers we find could result in 
criminal charges against you and your news service." That's what Fuchi

department. Today - almost a week later - is another perfectly ordinary 
day in Seattle. One has to wonder when the corporate Men in Black will 
strike again.

	It could be today.

A Sad Occasion                     Tue Mar  7    Occam
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	Today we say goodbye to a Henry Jameson, junior reporter at 
Metanite. Most reporters benefit from being in the wrong place at the 
right time. For Jameson, his luck ran out, though as any reporter would 
want, he went out amidst a story. 
	A man walked off the street into the office of Metanite. Jameson 
was just being bandaged up due to an office mishap, when the man walked 
up to him and apparently touched him. The reaction was instantaneous. 
Jameson body went into a series of convulsions - death throes - and a 
green slime appeared all over his body. 
	A medic was summoned to try and prevent his death, but nothing 
could be done. 
	Our condolences to his family and friends. 

	Metanite is offering a small reward of three thousand on any 
information leading to the whereabouts of the man - presumably mage - 
that did this. 

	-The Editor

<<Editor's Comment: It appears that N5 has created a bit of a fad among 
our reporters. We have another person choosing to write under an alias. 
I can't really complain - at least he's putting something on the 
wires.>> 

	Heeeelloooooo Seattle! This is H - the big H. No relation to the 
chems, of course - that stuff will rot your minds, kiddies - why else 
do you think I'm stuck in Seattle? 
	So, this is just an introduction to big ol' me. I'm a retiree 
from what you would call 'flexible work'. Yah, shure, I'll come out 
with it. I'm an ex-runner, wantin' to hit the wires. An for you corpers 
out there who might think of tryin' ta catch me through Metanite here - 
don't even think 'bout it. I submit by wire - and the ed here don't 
know my true name. I use an alias because its convenient. 
	Why am I writin'? It's quite simple - there's a big, big world 
out there and the rose and nuyen-colored glasses of Net23 just won't 
cut it, period. I'm not sayin' that Metanite's the be-all and end-all 
of the free press. Hell, I'm pretty sure the ed's halted a story or 
two, but it's a lot better than the corp-sponsered newsnets. 
	This ain't news, this post. This is an opinion. If you wanna 
flame me, fine, go ahead. If ya agree with me, bully for ya - nice to 
see some brains out there. Oh - an' don't take offence at nuthin I 
write. I say what I mean. And if my writin' ain' purdy, forgive me. I'm 
not educated like most of them - my teachin' was the streets, not some 
lily-school. 
	So let's talk 'bout a little shooting incident that the good 
folks at Net23 didn't run, for reasons unknown. An apartment complex - 
Queen Apartments. A whole gang shot the place up, carried off some guy 
as a trophy - his dead body as a trophy, that is. Left some pretty lady 
alone after that. The gal talked to a friend, and I got the info from 
that friend. It seems she was a bit special... has some kind of 
history, the kind that motivates coverups. 
	By not reportin' this inc'dence, Net23's just showin' a major 
lack of openness. This is just another extension of their brilliant 
lack of clarity and honestness. They've already cover'd up some major 
activ'ty as an 'increase in gang warfare'... they've also done some 
other coverups on some pretty nasty stuff. And the general populace out 
there's still callin' them the 'definitive news source'. That's just 
drek, pure drek. 
	You want my opinion? You're getting it whether ya want or not. 
Turn off the trids. Ignore Net23 and their bogus reports, or keep 'em 
honest. If they put some s***-for-content story up there, flood 'em 
with info. Hell, flood Metanite with info. Just get the Truth out 
there. Because if ya don't, its only a matter of time before the corps 
run everythin', right down ta which street rat lives and which dies. 
	I'm savin' the ed the trouble of putting some of his idealistic 
shi-ite at the end of this, cuz' I've got my own message. I'm sayin' 
right here, I'm racist to the core. Ah think them damn breeders need 
someone ta take them down a notch, show 'em that us metas run the show. 
And I don't quite like them fancy keebs, actin' so superior just 'cause 
they're so damn beautiful. But this is a cause. An' if we don' 
cooperate, all of us, then we're no better than the people who are 
runnin' the show right now. They need to be reminded - if they choose 
to hate, the other can choose to hate back. That's what we're doin' 
with all of our racial-superiority-drek. Status quo will only change if 
we change it, and ourselves. 
	So, hate me if ya want. Love me if you want - that would be a 
hell of a change. But I don't care either way. This troll's got his 
'pinion out now, and the rest of you can go to hell.

BubbleGum Crisis                   Sat Apr  8    Flynn

Late last night a family and their cat were robbed of their precious 
gum ball machine, among other scattered items taken from the Jenkins 
Pharmacy located on the corner of Main and Maynard. Tiger the cat has 
been treated at a local vet, a celebrated hero after taking a can to 
the hip.
 Confusing to the Chins and Lone Star was how the three street rats 
arrested at the site managed to defeat secruity system, simply taping a 
cardboard box to camera with fix-o-dent. Any witnesses are encouraged 
to step forward with any information, contacting either their local 
Lone Star precient or Metanite's main office.

	Well, well, well. Ah hope all of yas been enjoyin' yer Easter. 
Some of ya fraggers probably lucked out an got the weekend off. Some of 
ya were unlucky an only got today or Monday off. Me? Ah told ya - ah'm 
retired. Well - while most of ya were probably in bed, snorin' yer 
heads off, I was up an' about. Where was I? Believe it or not, the big 
H was attendin' church. Why? What's so special 'bout today? It's called 
Good Friday. Which kinda makes me wonder - makes us Christian's seem to 
have a warped sense - and mebbe a bit masochistic too. 
	Ya see, when us religious freaks are in church on Good Friday, 
we're celebratin' somebody's death. Best quote I heard - when the world 
finally got a rabbi (a teacher for ya non-understandin' types) that was 
nice, patient, told the truth, and jist generally was a perfect, all-
around nice type of feller, of course we killed 'em. Yah - the name of 
the chummer is also a fairly used curse too - Jesus. 
	So, we're in a service, sittin' there, thinking 'bout some guy 
who, a few thousand years ago, decided to go along wit da Big Guy's 
plans an hop onto a cross. And die. Accourse, there's more to the story 
- I'll have that update on Sunday or Monday. 
	Why am I bringin' mah religious views up? Well - call it a bit of 
a parallel. Ya see, these days we got chummers actually tryin' ta make 
things better for all of us. An yet, they can be completely on da level 
and none of us'll believe dat. Jus' like JC. Hell - we tend to kill of 
those that want ta help us just as much as we kill off dose that try to 
harm us. Take a look at the rapid change of editors at Metanite. 
	So, I don' know 'bout you, but I'm opinioned out for tonite. Me, 
ah think I'm gonna do some reflectin'. 
	An just for consistancy: So, hate me if ya want. Love me if you 
want - that would be a hell of a change. But I don't care either way. 
This troll's got his 'pinion out now, and the rest of you can go to

Auction raises Easter funds        Sun Apr 23    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Where has the Easter Bunny gone? Apparently in the guise of couriers, 
all over Seattle. Easter Sunday was for a change in the eyes of many of 
these children, a day for cleansing and rebirth...a chance at a happy 
moment.
Bonded couriers spent the holiday visiting children in various places 
in the 'Plex, tenament houses, homeless shelters, hospitals, and 
orphanges...arms full of easter eggs, candies, and plush toys. Lone 
Star was curious in goods that travelled, but proof of purchase 
offered, causing LS to join in on a few of the deliveries. Easter Egg 
hunts garnered crowds through out the city, a reasonably clear day 
herald the festivities.
A "Shadow Auction" raised nearly 2 million nuyen for the goods. Well 
known faces of the shadow world were spotted in the crowd, the most 
famous of course, ran the whole show; Mary, a retired fixer...a leader 
in a forum not always recognized for their good deeds. Items donated 
were accepted anonymously, and sold the same way...cash in hand.
So here's a good job and a check on your karmic record...Mary and all 
the shadowrunners whose hearts were in the right place...a bit of 
cleansing for their souls.

	Well now... pardon me for bein' so fraggin' late on postin' the 
story, but I was sittin' down to a nice Easter dinner with friends. 
Accourse, ahm one of da lucky ones. Ah had someplace ta go. 
	But in any case... ah was givin' a three-day update. So, ah start 
wit da first thing ah heard when I got ta the holy house. "He is 
risen." 
	So, everyone responded, "He is risen indeed." 
	I ain't got nuthin' ta share wit ya today... except dat it's 
story-time. Yes, kiddies, Uncle H is gonna give yas a story fer dis 
day. 
	Well, dis story takes place in da barrens. Ya see, dere was a man 
- some guy - just a breeder, a norm, lookin average in every joe-shmoe 
way. An he was wearing a fiiine jacket, one of dem expensive ones. And 
the fool was walkin' through da 'rens in it. Ya'd think da guy'd get 
mugged, but people just generlly left 'im alone. 
	So, anyway. Dis guy's walkin' along in da 'Rens an he see's dis 
squatter with 'dis scar down 'is face, real ugly fragger. And he takes 
out a hankerchief, a fancy silk one, an' wipes the begger's face. Who 
knows how many diseases dat squatter had - and da man wipes his own 
face _immediately_ with dat pansy-'chief. And da scars transfers over. 
	No, he's now got dat ugly scar on 'is face. An' it reeks - da 
smell when gangrene sets in, open. Kind of a rottin' smell, turns da 
stomach of even an old-timer like me. Well, he walks 'long and he sees 
this poor, one-armed son-of-a-bitch. An he looks da squatter over. An' 
instead of laughin', he takes off 'is fancy coat. Well... first 'e sez 
to da squatter, "Take off yer coat." And da squatter does. And dis man, 
he gives his coat to da squatter - and his _arm_ comes with da coat. 
An' the squatter, fraggin' amazed, puts on da coat and starts movin' da 
arm! Like it was 'is own. 
	Da man, he puts on da jacket, now one-armed, and keeps walkin' An 
finally, 'e comes upon 'dis little kid, maybe eight. Dis kid, he's 
lyin' in da street, bleedin' all over da place. Really fragged up. Li'l 
kid pissed off some ganger, got sliced up bad. Da kid was as good as 
dead. Everyone's steppin' 'round da kid, 'cept some hungry street-rats 
waitin' for 'im ta day. And dis man - still in 'is dress pants, kneels 
into da blood, picks da kid up, an gives 'im a hug. Da kid gasps 
slightly, 'den _scampers away! And dis man, he turn's round and his 
clothin' is _soaked_ in blood. More blood den just dat li'l bit da kid 
would have got on 'im. He's bleedin' from da same cuts da kid is... 
was. An' he stumbles on. 
	Ah followed 'im. (Well - 'dis is a story. I wouldn't follow some 
damn fool 'round like that.) 'E stumbled on for blocks, 'till he 
finally drops down at some alley. An just lays dere, dead. 
	Well, ah didn't want no street scavenger's gettin at 'im. An it 
was too far out for a hole in da ground. So ah went over to a junk 
heap, moved da stuff around, putting heavy stuff on top. Den I opened a 
hole large 'nough to put 'im in, an' ah moved a dumpster in front, so 
dat yer average squatter couldn't make a snack out of 'im. 
	So, ahm a softie in a way. Ah walked by each day. Made sure dat 
dumpster was still dere, an made sure the junk was still in a pile. Two 
days, everythin' was set dere. An da third day, I got there... and da 
dumpster was pushed over on da ground, and da junk was collapsed. Frag, 
I thought, so much for dat saint. 
	And den, who steps around da corner behind me but da guy. He was 
completely healed - no scars, no pig-sticker wounds, an' with both 
arms. His clothes - white, like somebody added too much bleach to da 
water. An he stands dere, nods to me, and turns around, walking away. 
	Now, nobody _walks away_ from da Big H. So, ah turn da alleyway 
and follow 'im. An' follow im'. Do ya know how humiliating it is to be 
outwalked... yes, out_walked_ by a breeder? Yah. He just kept walkin'. 
An' when I got too tired, almost collapsed, he turned ta me, smiled at 
me, and then just kinda rose. Levitated, ya would say. Higher den ah 
ever saw anyone before. Ah lost sight of 'im. 
	Well, dat's da story. Take it for what ya think it's worth. An a 
happy, if belated, Easter.

Underworld Rumbles                 Wed Apr 26    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Late Tuesday evening, the protectors of this great sprawl we call a 
home, joined together to make a united stand against illegal 
activities. Providing a united front, Lone Star's Chief of Police, A 
liason from the Special Task Force (UCAS) and our own local DA promised 
siwft and through judical action against those involved in the latest 
crime to rock our fair city of Seattle.
It seems the syndicate war has scaled up. In the wee hours of Tuesday 
morning The Sports Bar, a popular college hangout as well as a 
suggested front for the Mafia; was bombed. Or more accurately, was 
simply destroyed as a high powered drone smashed the building to 
smithereens, killing 43 inside including the owner/bartender Maria 
(last name withheld pending familynotification). Damage to the 
surrounding area has closed off parts of the 100w block of University, 
19 were injured from the accident outside due to backlash from the 
impact.
Lone Star offers no comments regarding leads so far as to who is 
responsible for the attack, though it is rumored this is being as a 
retaliatory strike from the Yakuza in the so-called sydnicate war 
between them and the Mafia. UCAS will be cordinating with Lone Star to 
create a special task force, cracking down on suspected safe houses, 
calling these anti-terrorist raids. Towards the end, the DA promised 
proscecution to the fullest extent of the law to anyone involved in so-
called illegal activities.

Return Fire?                       Thu Apr 27    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
At approximatly 12:30 today, gunfire rang out in a neighborhood of the 
sprawl, well known to humans and metas alike as the I.D. central 
stomping ground of the Yakuza. The target? The Tokyo Rose located at 
the corner of Broadway and Jackson. Automatic gunfire rang out from a 
rooftop across the street. LS estimates approx. 50 rounds fired from an 
Ingram Valiant later found abandoned with no traces to the gunman. 
No casualties were reported and damage to the local club was minimal, 
broken glass and bullet holes riddling the solid wall of exposed side.
With the recent attacks against Mafia establishments (see previous 
story on the Sports Bar attack), this reporter has to question, Did the 
Mafia just deliver a wrist slap to the upstart Yakuza, if you will...a 
warning?
As always Lone Star welcomes any leads to this and other crimes.

Mystic Fire destroys ID docks      Thu May  4    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
A blurry picture of a badly listing frighter lights the sky with flames 
as hordes of rescue workers, firefighters, and Lone Star rush around in 
the foreground, working frantically. 

Earlier today, a frieghter taking on fuel suddenly erupted into flames 
down along the southside docks, pier 54. Little information is known at 
this time, workers were unable apparently to turn off the fuel shut 
offs, causing multiple explosions during the rescue attempts. 
Half way through the fight, an amazing sight as various elementals and 
spirits suddenly joined the fight to douse the flames, cheering on the 
worn and weary rescue workers to continue their tireless efforts to 
contain the blaze. It is unknown at this time who controlled the 
magical element that turned the tide of the out of control fire.
The ship, perhaps aptly named The Mystic Dream, registery unknown, but 
considered to be local. Several crewmembers survived, taken to DocWagon 
for treatement, their conditions are stable, names are not being 
released at this time. 

 Added on as a subscript, italized as a personal thought, << Arriving 
on the scene, I was surprised at the stillness of the terror as flames 
raged out of control. The burning scent of fuel as the heaviness of the 
air carried heat from the ocean into the pier as the boat listless 
crashed into the pier, the damage incomparable and impacting the close 
knit community of the International District. As a meta, I might be 
tempted to snicker and say, everyone gets what they deserve, but no 
community deserves to have it devesated with this type of disaster. 
Lone Star has taken up a collection for those families who have lost 
love ones in the blasts and fire...contributions are welcome at the 
main police station in Downtown and the dispatch centers located 
throughout Seattle, put me down for a chunk, so ka chum?>>

<<Low resolution picture continues to repeat the story on every 
Metanite newstand throughout the Underground and Topside.>> Yesterday 
morning, a rampaging troll opened fire inside the the Undergrounds 
premier strip club, L7. Casualities number upwards into the twenties, 
hardest hit were patrons of the club, off duty USF members as well as 
relaxing memebers of some of the UG's exclusive gangs.
Eyewitness accounts vary, 

 <<A voice over runs reedy through the newsstands small speakers. The 
real time video slow with low resolution, the picture jerky with rough 
movement. The image a Rusty Stil with blood splattered across his 
shirt, no visible wounds.>> 
"This is a crime against our brothers! Retribution will come, as soon 
as the great spirit has blessed our fallen comrades."

Little is known about the gunman at this time, descriptions agree that 
the gunman is a troll, possible cybered as his speeds are unnatural for 
a man of his build. Noteable is neon blue eyes, stunning through the 
carnage.

<<Another eyewitness, a sobbing halfer, she clutches what appears to be 
a young child's baseball cap and books.>>
"Wh-hy? He just burst out of t-that...that cl-strip bar and s-starte-d 
sh-hoot-ing! His bright blue eyes didn't e-even s-sseee us, Why...my 
Tommy!"

Kent Clinic and Tusk were quick to the scene, volunteers and medics 
alike taking care of the dead and wounded.

<<Visual pans to a makeshift triage set up in the middle of the street, 
the garnish lights of the L7 still flashing behind the bloody images. 
Various people work feverishly to save lives as the wounded wind, a 
long line down the street. The crowd of rubberneckers being held back 
by USF, both off duty and on.>>

Gunning down the USF guard on the door, the shooting started before he 
could call for backup. Fortunately most of the victims wounds were 
superficial at this, the second shooting in a string currently linked 
to a rampaging troll.

<<The camera focuses in on a pretty tusker, clad for surgery, 
assumption is she's a doctor. Her voice carries through the speakers.>>

"I was just getting ready for surgery, suddenly outside shoots started 
going off. I looked out the window and saw people scrambling from this 
troll, he must've been 12 feet tall, with bright blue eyes...he was 
wild, horns spouting off his head."

<The smooth voice cuts back in.>>

Again the authorities are asking the public for any information 
regarding this or the L7's shooting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
<<The editorial section with letters written in from the viewing 
audience simply scroll down the byline of the headlining news.>>

	All right. Through Metanite, we hear about all kinds of problems, 
things being tough here or there. Well, today, I decided to type out a 
few words about a place I know well, but that many others don't. So if 
you will, allow me to describe for you the Underground.
	The Underground. To some it sounds foreboding, consisting of 
dank, dark tunnels, where ghouls lurk to tear apart the unsuspecting. 
To others, though, it is a place of comfort, temperatures nearly 
perfect, no matter the time of year, and unless a water main breaks, it 
never rains. Some areas, like those the tour hits, have some of the 
most breathtaking stonework this ork has ever seen. And then there are, 
of course, the residential and business areas, that thrive with the 
sounds of childen and commerce. And the USF (Underground Security 
Force) is there, keeping a watchful eye over all, as do the numerous 
Rusted Stilletos and Stone Tusk gangers, who both strive to keep order 
in their areas.
	Most people think that the Underground is populated soley by orks 
and trolls, not so. Dwarves are common, and on the major night-life 
strip, humans are not uncommon. While in theory, even elves are welcome 
on the strip, due to gang turmoil, it is best to check before counting 
on safe passage. Off the strip, though, it is sad to say that pent-up 
prejudices often are vented on both humans and elves.
	So, what is it about the Underground that makes it what it is? 
Community. Since the Night of Rage, metahumans have been down in the 
tunnels. The author well remembers the days and nights in those cold, 
wet tunnels, and can only smile as he looks around at what developed 
from those soaked, burned, shot, and scared metas huddling in the 
sewers. But it is this feeling, the feeling of understanding and 
security, that binds the Underground together. Perhaps due to the 
hidden entrances, perhaps due to the tons of rock and concrete that 
span above, perhaps just due to the fact that we're all in it together 
to make the place work, perhaps those are the reason for the atmosphere 
of community. This author doesn't know.
	But what this author does know, is that it works. The place, for 
all of the disillusionment of some of the inhabitants, for all the 
prejudices that fester from wound suffered on the streets of the 
metroplex, for all the frustration of those who want to make it even 
better, the Undergound functions. It is home to families, businessmen, 
to all classes, and as such, is no more or less dangerous than any 
other place in the Metroplex, once you know the rules about living 
there.
	In closing, I would like to propose that perhaps there is a 
lesson in living in the Underground. And perhaps the author is a more 
tolerant man because of it. But, I would not trade it for the penthouse 
of the Starlight towers. My thanks for your time,
	 - Steel Wheels

Renraku denounces Fuchi            Sun May 21    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
	At it's finest, Enigma was the site for this years gala event, 
Renraku's Corp goes public, and rumors ran rampant with speculations of 
2060's announcements. Among the crowds were noticed some of Seattle's 
most notorious faces, ShadowRunners, information brokers and J's 
scoping out the future of one of the BIG TEN.
	The announcement regarding Fuchi project 'Biological Project 359' 
sent ripples through the assembled crowd, tension radiating on the 
faces of metas present and in the know. Rather than the ambiguous name 
attached to this project, it is a deadly predator in the biological 
warfare waged today. Tasteless, odourless, it also leaves no traces in 
the body once the victim has gone through the stages of a slow, 
agonizing, painful death.
	Another announcement connected Fuchi to FHU, Free Humanis United. 
Directing those presents attention to a planned attack on a children's 
home in Ireland, 'Children's Levy' where over a thousand children were 
schooled privately with their tutors. Lone Star and Renraku are vowing 
to find and destroy the production plant of this silent killer. But the 
race is on, and the fear is that FHU will use what is has already 
produced to stage this attack.
	Fuchi denies all charges of creating Biological Project 359 as a 
biological weapon. Calling this 'announcement' of Renrakus 'a fraud and 
a scam perpetrated by Renraku for Public Relations.'. Fuchi also 
disputes the rumored connection between then and FHU. Janus has been 
shut down while the facts are laid before the Corporate Court, 
scheduled to reconvene early next week.
	Throughout the rest of the lavishly appointed dinner, the topic 
kept resurfacing, rumors abound that Fuchi had also backed the Free 
Humanis United attacks earlier this year. Other rumors surfaced that 
Metas runners have for some time been shying away from Fuchi, or 
charging exorbant fees to do the requested jobs. A persistent rumor 
that passed from table to table, a recent death, one of millions in 
this our fine city of Seattle, am assumed runner by the name of Daytona 
was poisoned while frequenting Dante's Inferno, targeted because she 
headed the hit on Fuchi's R&D facility Janus where Biological Project 
359 was first developed.
	All in all a sober evening where gaiety should have reigned. 
Making this reporter wonder, are the Megacorps gearing back up to make 
their wars public? Leaving behind the shadowed attacks for full frontal 
assaults.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Early this morning a trio of underground heros turned in the prize 
catch...proof of death for a rampaging troll, one Zork Biggs.
Details are sketch as the team declined to talk about the 
experience....Apparently Biggs claimed a hostage late last night from 
Kent Clinic, a young doctor on duty. After retreating to the north UG 
tunnels, a firefight broke out, ending only with Biggs death...and 
several small explosions.
The proof offered? A still glowing neon blue cybereye...on display in 
the USF buildings until tomorrow afternoon. Information gleaned from 
the cybernetic equipment names the troll Zork Biggs, recently 
discharged from the UCAS army, medically unfit for further duty. No 
other information is known at this time.
And as for our heros? It is up to them to tell their story, retreating 
before the news became public, leaving us to thank them here...as a 
general breath of relief grips the underground for now.

Shadows to the Rescue?             Fri May 26    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<<The dolcelte tones of a pretty elf reading from a scripted story 
echoes out from the tiny speakers as you pass by a metanite news stand, 
some slot leaving before the bought stories finished...>>

An attempted kidnapping of two students, twins Joseph and Lauren 
Garadey was foiled today during a field trip to Seattles Aquarium. The 
brother and sister were with their 4th grade class when three 
individuals, who later claimed to be off-duty security officers, 
attempted to separate them from the group. However, the snatching went 
awry when a bystander tripped one of the guards and guns were pulled. 
As a last desperate attempt, one of the guards slipped a patch on 
Joseph, causing the boy to collapse, a quick thinking bystander removed 
the patch, later tested it turned out to be arsenic. The fake security 
guards escaped without detection, while the three bystanders 
intervening for the twins left unidentified, taking the twins to 
Seattle General where Joseph was treated for the poison and later 
released to a woman incorrectly identified as their mother.

<<The tiny picture changes over to a rough looking Troll, hunched over 
a small counter, nearly double as he tries to fit into the cameras 
angle, taking over the story in his gravely voice.>>

Now, this is where the story gets interesting, chummahs. Seems the 
rumor on the streets is the dad was one involved in the hit on Janus, 
you remember? The Fuchi project. And those guards who flubbed the job, 
no more than Fuchi guns out to make sure the story stays silent and 
folks dont talk. And the good samaritians that foiled the kidnapping 
attempt? Word is runners from the Robin Org, just taking care of 
business. Looks like Mary, a prominent J of the Robin Org who the kids 
were released to, keeping a close eye on dem until this thing blows 
over. Stability aint something these kids know, Fuchi gunning for their 
dad to keep him quiet, and dere mom? Shot down in an MCT double cross 
about 2 years ago...sometimes it pays to keep yer ears to the shadows.

The Devil?!                        Tue May 30    Needle
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Devil?!		by N5

What my collegue Ryan Dallion at Network23 - obviously a man with a 
religious streak - wants to attribute to _the_ Fallen Angel himself may 
just be the manifestation of an obscure being not unknown to the 
students of arcane lore. A spirit phenomenon causing people to act in 
the ways described has first been documented during riots in Madrid in 
2017.
While I am not claiming that this actually is a manifestation of an 
ephemeral creature commonly referred to as Wraith or maybe some kind of 
powerful free spirit, this is a lot more likely than the appearance of 
Satan. Thank you Ryan.

The latest attack by  this creature - whatever it may be - occured just 
before last weekend at a pit fight in the infamous Redmond Barrens.
A young woman (name withheld) who claims to fight only in self defense 
entered the contest without actually wanting to do so. She has no 
recollection of the events after her first fight there. The people with 
her report having trouble to drag her out of the Live 'til Dusk - where 
the pit fight was held - even after she got severely beaten by an 
opponent.

According to the eyewitnesses someone or something which has been 
described as stunningly handsome male by female witnesses, or drop dead 
gorgeous female by males was present at the Live 'til Dusk that night. 
An awakened witness used the words: "There was a free spirit, or 
elemental in the LTD that night, it's somekind of trickster or shadow, 
it's related to all the devil reports on NET23. I think that the thing 
feeds on death, pain, fear, whatever." 
The spirit creature drove off a group of mages confronting it by just 
staring at them. Numerous people present that night recall hearing 
voices that whispered "Things they didn't want to hear." in their 
heads. The witnesses also described pillars of flame being conjured up 
by that being outside the Live 'til Dusk and remember feeling the earth 
quaking. Since this creature obviously has great power over people's 
minds, that information remains dubious. If any witnesses can confirm 
that, please leave a message at Metanite if you are willing to give 
your version of the events..

A deranged dwarf was the only one present who could get near the spirit 
without being disturbed by it's powers. The man who has the number 
'666' tattooed on his eyelids (so much for the Devil) and is obviously 
criminally insane seemed to worship the creature. This reporter got to 
witness another attack by that individual on the people interviewed for 
this report two days ago.
The spirit - thankfully - did not accompany him.
The 'good cops' of Lonestar were able to stun the insane dwarf into 
submission and incarcerated him.
 Time will tell if 'The Devil' sticks up for his servants.

If anybody encounters a phenomenon like the one described, avoid it at 
all costs. Seek the advice of mages or shamans and stay away from 
people who begin acting strangely. Extreme caution is also advised when 
encountering the afro-american dwarf with the tattoos on his eyelids. 
He may be in league with the spirit.

Famed Genetics researcher Dr. Flayton disappeared late last night, foul

found at the kidnapping site, dead.
The wreckage that was Dr. Flayton's car was discovered after he failed 
to report in at Gametech labs here in Seattle. The famed geneticist was 
rumored to be working on a cure for the horrific HMHVV.

<<The tiny picture swings from the scrolling news text to a slender elf

Roadblock                          Sat Jun 10    Needle

Roadblock on the I5 interchange	by N5

Yesterday LoneStar and the Seattle Metroplex Guard installed a 
roadblock on the interchange of Interstate 5 east of the Union Street 
onramp. Heavy police presence and even the deployment of a Stonewall 
Main Battle Tank - courtesy of the Metroplex Guard - was intended to 
provide the means necessary to secure the interstate route and possibly 
detain the criminals who were involved in a recent heist.

Officer O'Brien of LoneStar was unwilling to comment on any connection 
between this roadblock and the recent abduction of the leading 
geneticist Richard Flayton of Gametech Labs. The officer only revealed 
that he's "...not at this time at liberty to say what were looking 
for." and that the presence of both the police and the Metroplex Guard 
has been requested by the Mayor.

 Officer O'Brien also said that "...something was stolen and we are 
trying to recover it before it leaves the city."
A necessary and not at all unusual precaution if it weren't for the 
heavy presence of armed forces. It doesn't take an MBT and a fleet of 
pursuit vehicles and Yellowjackets to stop even the most heavily armed 
and dangerous criminals.
Since the only 'heist' that occured lately is the abduction of Dr. 
Flayton, a connection is possible - even though denied by LoneStar. 
Anonymous sources who claim to have overheard a conversation about 
Flayton's abduction hint that there is more to the abduction of the 
geneticist. It appears that Dr. Flayton himself - who became famous for 
his breakthroughs in the research of a cure for the dreaded HMHVV - was 
suffering from a severe medical condition of undetermined nature. It is 
possible that the Governor of Seattle and the Mayor fear an outbreak if 
the missing scientist and his kidnappers remain in hiding.
Recent rumours of a new drug hitting the streets may be connected to 
the same incident.

Citizens are advised to relay any information regarding this kidnapping 
and it's circumstances to their local police station.

Meanwhile LoneStar takes the opportunity to round up suspects for other 
crimes at the roadblock on the interstate.

<<Some vid footage shows a man in his thirties being restrained 
forcefully by a group of LoneStar officers. One of the cops is 
obviously displaying a more than appropriate interest in the suspect's 
rear but is quickly ordered to stand down by Officer O'Brien when he 
notices the reporter and looks directly into the camera..>>

This man was stopped and searched by the police in connection with an 
unsolved murder case from three weeks ago. A family of five was 
brutally murdered and the Officer in charge - O'Brien - claimed that 
the suspect in this case looked "...pretty darned close to the 
gentleman that we just let go."


 As indicated by this statement, that individual was released after his 
ID was checked.
Still, with all due respect for the important service LoneStar is 
providing, methods such as this one cannot be accepted. If there 
wouldn't have been any media presence, this 'investigation' could have 
ended in a completely different way ...

Family Ties in Gang binds?         Fri Jun 23    Flynn

<<A short editorial piece scrolls down the Metanite newsterm, text 
based as the top news stories blast out sounds of gunfire and soothing

Today, I saw something that astounds me, that defies my image of gangs 
across this sprawling 'plex we call Seattle. An intimate view in the 
day and fight of a barrens brawler, I feel almost privileged to have 
been invited to be witness to the changing of the guards of power.
Most towners, view gangs as beneath their contempt, except of course 
when there is a Cougar pressed against their throat and pockets are 
being emptied of 'yen, yes...then the gangs have the respect they are 
craving. Between other gangs, there is a cock dance, a showing of 
colors and posturing, which sometimes turn deadly with a slip, a taunt 
that goes over the line.
What us towners don't see is the camraderie that knits a gang together, 
often becoming the family these kids never had, dysfunction in a 
society built on dysfunction, gangs are the Jerry Springer fodder of 
todays society. Having viewed a gang member crouched down beside a 
fallen buddy in a turf clash, donating the shirt off his back or water 
from his own hands...
In a word loyalty, something that is unavailable on the black market, 
an intangible item, that most would sell their soul to receive, and 
give up hope in this world we live in, where your back is never safe 
from friends...unless you are a ganger.

press release from Winston Abbey, the new liason from New Orkland to 
Seattle, previously President Flynn's personal aide. Heartened with the 
overwhelming response to his offer of immigration to the new found 
country, his office is working on the details of what may perhaps be a 
mass exodus of Seattle's underground."

<<News terms carry several stories regarding the recent military coup-
cum-New government takeover in South Africa. The babble tends to blend 
into the background as story after story is published, over saturating

Tales of refugees as they filter out of South Africa are shocking. 
(pictures flash up behind the pretty elven woman - Mostly humans with a 
few elves and dwarves being treated at a first aid camp in a 
neighboring country - Abuse evident on several faces) Stories of being 
made to abandon homes, children seperated from families and...those 
still missing. Reports coming out of Jo'berg is the new government is 
simply ordering non orks out of their homes and buisness with no 
recompensation, claiming them as payment for years of abuse against 
orks. Some residents of South Africa are understandably upset, several 
human families have no plans to leave the now ork occupied lands - 
though they are being given no choice.

"This is a plea to more than just my father, this is a plea to the

killing the innocences living in South Africa benefit the cause of ork 
rights? All it does is prove we are the animals that the Policlub and

become no better than those who wish to keep metas down. And until we

"Two nights ago, a surprising rampage was perpertrated by a long time 
resident of the Underground, a Rolph Gunnerson. Rolph was an ork, an 
older gentlemen by all accounts with no prior records with the USF.
"Rolph attracted the ground at approximately at 10 pm by throwing yen 
off the roof of the Broken Tusk. Once he had gathered an audience, he 
poured napalm over the sides, investigators are looking for leads on 
where he got this dangerous poison. Afterwards he opened fire with a 
light machine gun on the crowd below. Witnesses describe the terror of 
the event and describe the strangest part of this twisted tale. The 
entire time Rolph Gunnerson, an ork of the underground was doing his 
terrible deed...he was screaming anti-META statements.
"Later, USF found possible decking equipment in Rolph's home, along 
with an assortment of pills, believed to be drugs. His room was again 
decorated with anti-meta posters and slogans. USF believes that ICE 
reprogramed the orks mind, causing him to do these terrible things to 
his own.
A group of concerned citizens were quick to react, shell casings found 
later on the roof did not match Rolphs, nor was there exactly a body to 
recover.
"We are at Metanite news, wish to say thank you for the fast reactions 
of our nameless heros, they kept the tragedy from becoming a massacre.

To the Editor-

	Yes, I know that MetaNite generally deals with metahuman rights 
and affairs, but have we stopped to think that these current explosions 
might involve the metahumans, too?
	IF - and this is a very big if, mind you - you are not aware, or 
the readers are not, let me explain. Explosions have ripped through 
downtown Seattle, targeting medicinal clinics that mostly supported 
cyberware. The bombings were claimed to be the work of a new 'anti-
technology' group of terrorists.
	Now I ask you . . . why isn't this being covered by MetaNite? 
Network23 is all over it, that cold, calculated feel that says they are 
there, but they don't care. It's more news, though I will bet that the 
wounded reporter might be just a little more empathetic now. Shouldn't 
MetaNite be on it, as well?
	Hop to, folks. If you don't have someone who can bother with it, 
you have my number. I am more than willing to get my hands dirty . . 
.in fact, I am. What are *you* doing?

Letter to the Editor - Dante's     Thu Nov 30    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
To the Editor-

	Go to Dante's Inferno much?
	So, I'm at the rad club called Dantes Inferno, where anything 
goes, practically, and the Seattle youth may go and party. Hang loose. 
Whatever. Mind you, I've never been there before . . . and what better 
way to see what's going on in Seattle?
	What I find, folks, is a hell of a riot. Men falling over 
themselves, and I mean literally, to capture and molest three females - 
two humans and an elf. And when I mean molest, I am not exagerrating.
	Shall I start from the beginning? A bunch of males started 
groping anything female . . . apparently, they managed to grope the 
wrong set, for fighting broke out as they struggled against the forced 
attentions. FORCED attentions. And what did the bouncers do?
	 Nada. Nothing. Zip, zilch, zero. End of lot, end of category.
	The males the three women were with decided that would be a great 
time to go . .. but the madmen grabbed the three women and forced 
themselves on top of at least one, attempting to do the same to the 
rest.
	 Good thing these were no meek ladies! They fought their way 
through, and the rest of Dante's Inferno turned into a madhouse of 
brawling and lewd touching of ANYHTHING remotely female-looking.
	Again, the bouncers did zip until one man pulled a knife. Now, 
the way I figure it, you Dante employees, if you're a bouncer, you damn 
well better be paying more attention, yes? You're paid that bloody well 
for a reason . . . ever try maybe, oh, I don't know . . . DOING YOUR 
JOB??
	The fact that a club has turned into a center for teen depravity 
is an issue that I won't even get into right now. I am told the club's 
not always THAT wild.
	And again I ask . . . where was MaetaNite? Or is something like 
this a little below their lofty attention?

Album Review                       Mon Jan 15    Livewire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
Not many people have heard the name DJDawn. If you have, chances are 
you're a die-hard club goer or raver. She got her start playing clubs 
and parties in the Free States, and from those sessions comes her first 
album. "Tight" was released this October by Epicgram Records, and it is 
truly the product of a master beatsmith. This reviewer stopped trying 
to classify music in this genre a long time ago, but if I had to, I 
guess I could call it 'Eclectic Hardcore Electronica Orchestration'. 
Throw everything you know and expect to hear from a rave album out of 
the window before you play this one, chummers, because DJDawn discarded 
convention when she forged "Tight."

The album consists of 30 tracks, the average length of each track being 
around a minute and a half. From the opening song "Valkyrie's Ride" to 
the closing track "Velvet Downpour", the pace stays fast and the music 
stays hard. DJDawn does a good job of keeping the beats clean and 
seperated, even when the music is at its heaviest. I will admit the 
album does get a bit thick at times, but it's a good kind of thick, 
like eating cake icing right out of the container with a spoon. Most of 
the tracks feature a heavily distorted electric guitar to carry the 
melody, which I assumed to be a well-edited collection of samples. I 
was surprised to read on the liner notes that DJDawn actually played 
guitar for the album, so she didn't sample that stuff after all. I 
don't know how she pulls that off in concert, but I'm determined to 
find out, as she has made my 'Must See Live' list after this album.

Bottom line is this: if you're down for some seriously driven dance 
music, check out DJDawn. But listen at your own risk, because it's so 
thick and rich, it's gotta be unhealthy.

Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------


	A demonic debut, what better place to host the hottest show since 
the millennium than Dante's Inferno. The band Paradox introduced 
Seattle to their driving licks, wicked riffs and twisted lyrics, all 
with a show that fucked with your mind and chilled your blood.

	The stage an altar, but it was no sacrifice to listen to the 
songs as Paradox front woman Kallista belted them out, garbed as a nun 
of bondage, straps and cuts covering her exposed skin...a willing 
victim to the tormented songs from Blood, Sweat, and Other Bodily 
Secretions. Worship to the driving beats, fans pay homage to Rob 
Varangian whose driving bassline held the show together. Preaching to 
the choir, Reaper takes the fans up a notch in ecstatic devotion with 
her flying fingers, a pure miracle of guitar work. Divine drumbeats 
flow from the skins under the talented fingers of one 'Sticks 
'Sorrento. The floor show something else, Kallista at times being 
mauled by a vampiric demon before being sexually assaulted while 
weaving a hypnotic show with voice and sight...is it really or is it 
Kallista.

	Singing soon to be favorites on the local stations, the show 
closed with an old rock and roll classic, Steppenwolf's "Born to be 
Wild", a true theme song if I've ever heard one for the band Paradox.

	Bring down the house Sunday evening after the opening performance 
of Faust. Seattle player, Mark Jacheim cast as Mephisto died of natural 
causes. The show opened to a full house at the Seattle Arts and 
Entertainment Theatre, a resounding performance of all, but Mephisto 
was brilliant according to theatrical reviews of the show.

	Mark Jacheim's roles included, Iago from Shakespeare's Othello, 
Dorian Grey from Lord Byron's play of the same name, and Sangral from 
Moliere's The Doctor in Spite of Himself. Jacheim a well renowned 
theatre actor refused to participate in what he called the slide into 
depravity of simsense recording, staying true to his art as a live 
performance artist.

	Respected by many, he was a mover in volunteer work, his pet 
organization PASA, including Parents Against Substance Abuse. A 
recovering drug abuser in his own right, Jacheim became their 
spokesperson during the 2058-2059 campaign. Mark Jacheim will be sorely 
missed by the theatrical communities as well as the organizations which 
were blessed with his involvement.

	Mark Jacheim is survived by two children, Natasha and Nicolai 
Jacheim. His wife Maryena died in 2054.

	Species did not matter on who handed out the clothes and food, 
nor did it matter in who received them. Trolls handed out clothes and 
food alongside humans, humans and elves recieved the donations 
alongside dwarves, orks, and trolls.

	Father Vasili Kronopolos is visiting the St. Demetrios Greek

	The new tunnels in the UG are nearing completion. Starting along 
Kent and heading east, they should open topside somewhere in the 
barrens (current location undisclosed until negotiations are 
completed.)
	The tunnel operations is a boon to the stalled economy of the 
underground. Creating a veritable army of jobs within the tunnels. The 
fee to use the tunnels a modest 10 =Y=, will cover the costs of 
operation.
	An unnamed benefactor to the underground, backed the financial 
burden of starting the construction. Hopefully a sound investment for 
them.
	Be sure that Metanite will cover the grand opening and bring 
additional updates on when and where the newest tunnel will be in 
operation.

Cause and Effect                   Tue Feb 20    Needle

	CAUSE AND EFFECT
	Daring environmentalists and metahuman rights activists uncover 
disturbing facts
	about recent epidemic outbreak of the so-called meta-flu on the 
east coast. (N5)

December to January, the high season for infectuous diseases. Each year 
millions are infected in the UCAS and thousands even die of the ever 
new and mutated strains of flu.
This year brought a strain that had qualities which were unknown so 
far. On the east coast, and spreading as far as the Great Lakes area, 
and epidemic outbreak of a new strain that only affected metahumans was 
recorded.
At first, the medical community presumed that the different immuno-
biological makeup of metahumans was responsible for the susceptibility 
to the otherwise harmless virus. Now, the daring activists of Gaia 
Environment Action (GEA) in Boston uncovered evidence that seems to 
confirm the most sinister assumptions about this outbreak. In an action 
against the known polluter Magadon Chemicals in Boston, GEA activists 
were able to steal some recent project of the company. What they 
expected to be a solution used to breed nanobots - which was also 
reputedly highly toxic - turned out to be a nutrient fluid that could 
be used to breed viral agents tailored for metahuman organisms.
Magadon official Greg Mavrides officially denied that this solution 
served said purpose. In a public press conference on the issue Mavrides 
claimed that:

	"We used that nutrient fluid in our laboratories to breed 
cultures of organisms used to create the well known Magadon
	product Metagyne-C, a pharmaceutical compound used to alleviate 
the pains of child labor for ork and troll women."

GEA chemist Sangamin Taylor and metahuman rights activist Joyce 
Weinheimer say that this is an outright lie. Taylor is quoted to have 
determined, that

	"... Metagyne-C does not include anything that needs the breeding 
of organisms like viruses to work

And miss Weinheimer holds against Magadon, that the carrier organism 
that could be bred out of the solution will also attack elves and 
dwarves. She announced that possible connections between Magadon 
Chemicals and anti-metahuman groups will be investigated by 
professionals.
The meta-flu claimed the lives of more than 1500 infants, poor and 
elderly metahumans in the states along the east coast and as far into 
the UCAS as Michigan.
 In Massachusetts the NIH and the Centre of Disease Control recorded 
the highest number of infections. A fact only cementing the suspicions 
against Magadon who have their main chemical works based in Boston.

Atlantean Research                 Tue Feb 27    Needle

	Atlantean Foundation sponsored Research Mission returns	By N5


This weekend the Atlantean Foundation press spokesman of the Seattle 
headquarters announced a press conference about the recent Homer 
project coming to it's conclusion.
The Homer project was a research mission sent off from Gibraltar in 
Europe in January 2060 and has attracted the interest of the scientific 
community ever since.
Homer II, a mobile deep sea rig, spent more than one year traversing 
the Atlantic seabottom in hopes to collect all kinds of research 
material.
The spokesperson of the Atlantean Foundation, Sean Jarvis, said, that 
most of the research was conducted on behalf of the sponsors for the 
mission and involved geological surveys and marine biology research for 
the purposes of raw resource location.
Jarvis said that he was not at liberty to reveal the identity of those 
sponsors though.
Assumptions whether any of this was related to attempts at locating the 
fabled sunken island of Atlantis have not been confirmed.
On the question why the Homer II spent so much time in the vicinity of 
the Azores Islands - a reputed possible location of the mythical 
Atlantis - Jarvis replied:

	<<A video recording from the press conference is available for 
display here>>
	<<Jarvis, a man in his mid forties with grey sideburns and a 
slightly geeky image chuckles softly at the question>>

	"The mission experienced technical problems during that time."
	"We were forced to ground the rig and send a ship with a 
maintainance crew"
	"The repairs took us almost a week, but no, they didn't look for 
Atlantis there."

Obviously the mission was concluded on schedule despite this setback 
...
The Homer II arrived at Boston Harbour last saturday, only one day 
behind schedule.

Jarvis used the press conference to announce, that the Atlantean 
Foundation will hold further conferences with the scientists who were 
aboard the Homer II as soon as the collected material is reviewed and 
compiled.
The leading scientist of the project, the dwarven geologist Alexander 
Kosinski, and his assistant Marsha Doyle will be present at those 
conferences Jarvis said.
The first will be held at MITM in Boston, and a second one is to be 
held after that in the Atlantean Foundation's Seattle headquarters in 
the latter days of march.

Editorials


Dear Editors,

	What the police reports did not mention was the sheer 
unbelievably of the dwarf youth taking out a troll youth in a childish 
brawl. A child's scuffle, nothing morerumors are abounding within the 
tunnels of a teen manifest unusually strong magic at a tender age, and 
in such a tragic movement of self defense, really. I speak from 
experience, when I state firmly with conviction that no one simply in a 
blink of an eye turn their magic on to stunball an opponent. This as 
all spells are learned, mental blocks overcome.
	It is sad that in this awakened era, people still must make up 
fairy tales to explain away what they do not understand. Witnesses are 
mistaken, surely someone came to the boys rescue, and just does not 
want to take credit for saving him from a sure beating.

Editors - 

	Reports of strong magical manifestations are on the rise, 
especially in the Underground tunnels. It does not surprise me in the 
least that this young dwarf was able to suddenly in time of great 
pressure and need simply reach out and turn on his magic as needed. It 
appears that the cycles are coming around, the mana is rising and those 
who touch it will enjoy a greater empowerment

	Last night at approximately 10:45 pm at the Lake Washington Caf 
in the lower end of the ED a large troll terrorized local patrons out 
for a late meal. Lone Star is searching for the hostile metahuman, but 
has no leads or motives at this time.

	According to eyewitnesses, the troll, wearing a blood splattered 
white lab coat entered the restaurant while carrying a butcher knife. 
In the ensuring chaos, one waitress was attacked, dying at the scene 
before help could arrive. Several patrons rushed to the aid, one elf 
firing shots though it apparently did not deter the psychotic troll. 
Another patron wrestled the knife away before the troll left the scene, 
apparently scared off.

USF gunned down                    Thu Mar 15    Flynn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------

	Earlier today in the tunnels, just off of Somerset Street, a USF 
volunteer was mysteriously shot with a single pistol round while on a 
routine watch in the Ork Underground.

	The vigilant group was on alert following a rash of bizarre 
incidents that have been occurring lately in the UG. Having just 
recovered an as yet unidentified male tusker's body, hung in the nearby 
tunnels by barbed wire.

	A 2nd GEN USF Cop. Dax, was following a family tradition signing 
up as soon as he was able. He was eager, stealthy, and good. Making the 
Shadow Special forces, he will sorely be missed in the tunnels and 
within the core of the USF.

	An Irish wake is being held at Hogan's, this Saturday, March 17th 
at 7 pm. Donations for the family will be collected at the door.

home after closing his restaurant 'Spirits and Spears'. LoneStar has 
not ruled out foul play at this time. Any one who may have seen this 
man is requested to contact their local Lone Star Precinct.

activity in the underground tunnels, everyone and apparently everything 
has been on edge lately and HHO was no exception. Staffed with extra 
people due to the threat in the tunnels, the surprise was the problem 
came from within the orphanage.

	A small ork child by the name of Terrance, approx 8 years in age 
mysteriously died after reports of being chased by a headless monster 
with a mouth protruding from it's chest. The child ran from the 
building only to trip and fall, the resulting head trauma killing him 
instantly.

	Apparently only one adult has seen this creature, a volunteer at 
the Orphanage, he was unavailable for comment at the cusp of this 
tragedy to the HHO. Further news as the story develops.

	Friday, April 13th 2061. Jason McKenzie, former candidate for 
Seattle mayor was gunned down in broad daylight in the Halfer with a 
Rifle firing range. The shooting came mere hours before Mr. McKenzie 
was scheduled to announce his bid for senate. Mr. McKenzie, while 
seriously wounded, was saved by the efforts of two heroic women, who 
are currently unknown to Metanite.

	The would-be assassin was killed during the assault, his remains 
unidentifiable. Mr. McKenzie made a name for himself in the Seattle 
political scene back in 2030 as the future of Seattle. Tragedy marred 
his political career though, as he goblinized weeks before the 
election, ruining his political career. Since then, he has been known 
to do freelance legal work for metahuman families who can not afford 
legal counsel. His most noteable work was on the landmark Detwyler 
case, which most metahumans will remember as the case in which alleged 
Humanis Policlub members tried to frame an ork teen for the brutal 
slaying of a busload of children.

Tragedy at the Orphanage           Thu May 10    Bryan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
<<after you slot your nuyen, the following story flashes across the 
terminal>> 
 
 	It was a terrible scene last night at the Helping Hand Orphanage. 
At approximately 2100 hours, screaming could be heard from within the 
building, and a half dozen unidentified creatures chased children 
outside. The creatures appear to have been magical in origin, and 
attacked the children in the streets. 

 <<The display changes to show a low-light video feed, which slowly 
scans across the area in front of the Helping Hand Orphanage. All over 
the place, people are frantically evacuating the area surrounding the 
Orphanage. It's easy to see why. There are at least half a dozen 
'creatures' stalking the area of various descriptions. One is a 
chitinous bug-like creature, another resembles a bear with blue fur and 
no head, while another is a large slimy worm with tufts of black hair 
on the ends. People are trying desperately to flee the creatures, many 
of whom are children from the Orphanage.>> 

 	Despite the brave efforts of the USF and TUSK personnel on the 
scene, as well as the actions of several concerned citizens, only three 
children were saved from the predations of the beasts. Bullets proved 
to be of limited usefulness against the creatures, and the lives of 
five children and one adult were lost before the intruders could be 
driven away. There were also an indeterminate number of casualties 
among the crowd that had gathered there, although none are believed to 
have resulted in death. 

 	While the emergency crews attended to the wounded outside, a 
group of five gathered by the entrance and prepared to enter. There 
were 4 orks, three of them male, as well as a human female. One of the 
ork males appears to have worked part time at the Orphanage, while 
another of the males was a reporter for Metanite. The identities of the 
other three remain unknown at this time. 

 <<The video feed kicks in again, this time showing a viewpoint much 
closer to the front of the Orphanage. Four figures are visible; a good 
looking ork male with short, frosted black hair, a large, overweight 
ork male with red hair, an female ork with a large silver blade, and a 
young human female in green leathers. The image freezes for a moment, 
and then flashes to a viewpoint from in front of the door. Eerie light 
can be seen emanating from inside.>> 

 	What awaited the five inside was nothing short of horrifying. 
More fallen children could be seen, spread thoughout the building. The 
cause of all the desctruction was finally found in a back classroom, 
where an unidentified form sat upon a gruesome throne. After a brief 
burst of gunfire, the creature was dispatched and the monsters 
disappeared. What remained behind were the fallen bodies of over 20 
children. All in all, only seven children survived the terrible 
encounter, out of an estimated 30 who were living at the Orphanage. The 
horror etched in their tiny faces told all that the night's encounter 
had had an indelible effect upon them as well. The five who entered the 
Orphanage were unavailable for comment. One of the ork males and the 
human female were seen being brought out on gurneys to be treated for 
undisclosed injuries, while the other three left the scene under their 
own power. 

 	The events that transpired at the Helping Hand have rocked the 
Underground to the core. The Orphanage stands now, empty and cordoned 
off, as a brutal reminder of what happened there. The laughter of too 
many children will no longer be heard in the tunnels, and the 
Underground is the worse for it.
