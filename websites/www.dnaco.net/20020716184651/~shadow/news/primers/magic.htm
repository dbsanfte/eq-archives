      <p> Magic is just as important to the feel of the ShadowRun Universe as 
        the corporations and the cyberpunk atmosphere. Roleplaying wise, doubly 
        so. One of the largest RP problems I have seen is that those players who 
        know the game, who play mundanes, have mundanes that toss off information 
        about esoteric points of magical theory or identify spells/spirits/what-have-you 
        as if they know it all already as well as a mage. Magic in the ShadowRun 
        universe is uncommon. Nine out of ten shadowrunners who are not mages, 
        even if they have worked with one or seen one in the past, know little 
        to nothing about the way that magic works in the slightest aside from 
        the thousands of publications that have been written trying to explain 
        it-usually inaccurately. Yet everyone, it seems, tends to be an expert 
        on everything that they see, because the player knows the game system 
        and can come up with some way to rationalize their character understanding 
        Magic in all its forms in their background. Try roleplaying that you don't 
        know, it can be fun. One of the best characters on the MUSH used to seek 
        out mages just to ask them questions about how X spell or Y spirit worked, 
        or what a totem was, or something along those lines, and both he and the 
        mage involved had a lot of fun doing it. 
      <p>Magic is both powerful and difficult to handle because it tends to be 
        a mysterious force even to those who use it. One of the RP things that 
        makes this so is the fact that Mages are the targets for an entire WORLD 
        of astral baddies that the average mundane will never see or even have 
        to consider the existance of. Have a quickened spell or a spell lock sometime, 
        and become a ground for a fireball from an astral mage; or, try a metaplanar 
        quest; or, try summoning a spirit in a toxic domain and see what you might 
        accidentally wake up; or any one of a number of things. At least for mundanes, 
        their enemies are usually definately comprehensible, and they tend to 
        be (meta)human--this can not be said to hold true for mages. 
      <p>Mages can be any one of a number of different personality types, but 
        for the most part they are mysterious people who are on the same sort 
        of incomprehensible level personality-wise as are the cybered-out samurais 
        with less than 1 essence who are barely human: so completely out of the 
        normal ken that they are fun and interesting to play. Add some of this 
        to your mage and you will find that the players will have more fun and, 
        by the same token, if you are mundane, playing that you don't know everything 
        you the player know from reading the rules can make things a LOT more 
        fun.
