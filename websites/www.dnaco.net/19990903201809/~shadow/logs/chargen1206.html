Revver smirks at Lyam, "Crack some skulls?" 

Morris says "Ok, lets get this started." 

Lyam says "Several." 

Morris says "There have allready been 2 previous meeting in the 
  logistics team for SR3 rules. We have covered Chargen and skills, 
  leaving karma and the rules from the Beyond the Shadows chapter." 
Morris says "I want to get through that, then at the end we can go back 
  and cover any issues from previous meetings if there is time. Once 
  again this is not about implementation, but rather determining rules." 

Shutter arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Shutter says "Heya." 

Morris says "We will be focusing on any existing house rules and whether 
  they should be continued or whether we will us the base SR3 rules." 
Morris says "Ok, anyone who has a comment, page me and I'll keep a 
  queue." 

Robert Verde arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris says "We'll start at the beginning, the first section talks about 
  earning karma and how to distribute karma pool. We have our own 
  method." 
Morris says "SR3 has major differences based on metahuman or not, but 
  its a flat increase." 
Morris says "Should we keep our sliding scale where it is tougher to 
  increase the pool as you gain more karma?" 
Morris says "Amber" 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Amber says "I think due to the way metahumans now have a lower priority 
  over all and stats that rock, dishing the house rules on KP and going 
  with SR3 is probably the better road to take." 

Morris says "Lyam" 

Lyam says "I agree with Amber that humans and metas should have 
  different rates, definitely, but I think there should definitely be 
  some kind of sliding scale." 

Morris says "Ok, no other comments on increasing KP?" 
Morris says "Hjal, Tarp." 

Tarp says "Humans could go 10x5,20x5,30x5,40x5 and Metas 20x15,40x5" 

Hjal would like to see that if there is a sliding scale, I'd like it to 
  be the same for both. I'm still not decided if FASA is smoking crank 
  or not for docking meta kps :) 

-- You have just been +fingered by Gabriel. 

Morris says "Lyam" 

Lyam says "Given the new priorities, I think breeders definitely need 
  the edge." 

JunkBLDR agrees with Lyam. 

Lyam says "It's just that we have PCs here with 400 total karma." 

Morris says "Hjal" 

Lyam says "PCs with 40 KP?" 

Hjal nods to Lyam. "Basically. The only reason I haven't torn that page 
  out of my Sr3 is because the metas are now more advantageous. But 
  here, where karma pools tower, and are the single most important thing 
  in a time stop, I don't want to see humans having a decisive edge. 

Morris says "Lyam" 

Lyam says "Roll up a troll PC under SRIII, and an equivalent breeder. 
  It's the metas who have the decisive edge at Chargen time. Needs to be 
  balanced." 

Morris says "Tarp, Amber, Hjal" 

Tarp says "My suggestion allows humans to get their karma pool earlier 
  but in the long run when everything is evened out, the karma pools 
  would be the same." 

Amber says "Yes and with increases in stats comes lower costs for 
  skills, since going over your stat costs more, higher maximums, means 
  higher skills at lower costs in the long runs. They need to be 
  balanced." 

Morris says "Hjal, Theo" 

Hjal nods to Lyam. "Balance needs to be kept, but making the humans the 
  decisive edge in the long term isn't necessarily fair to metas, or 
  fair at all, since that's an open ended advantage... (early advantage 
  only lasts so long..) 

Morris says "Theo, Lyam" 

Theo says "I agree that the sliding scale should be used. I think some 
  modifications need to be made with the differences between meta and 
  human. Double the time to get KP is not a good way way to balance... 
  it's overbalancing, IMO. I like Tarp's idea, that in the long run they 
  sorta even out, but with Meta's still having a 'lag like humans have 
  now (that sort of thing)." 

Lyam says "I will have to look at Tarp's idea with some numbers. The 
  basic idea's sound." 

Morris says "Ok, no more comments? Right now it sounds like a sliding 
  scale is a good idea, but humans need the advantadge early." 
Morris says "Ok, what we will do is publish a new method before 
  implementation for people to look at and comment on." 
Morris says "Lets move on." 
Morris says "Next is the section on improving the character. Are there 
  any problem with the new karma costs for raising skills or 
  attributes?" 
Morris says "Lyam" 
Morris says "Lyam, Theo, Hjal" 

Lyam says "I think the new rules are a big improvement. I say we go with 
  them to the letter." 

Theo says "For the most part, I like them too. However, I'm not sure the 
  1.5 * attr is good. Granted, it's a very hefty price to pay to raise 
  an attr one point, but I see it being used more for metas to get their 
  'weaker' attr up to human max more than anything. I think it bears 
  more thinking about before we use that portion." 

Hjal thinks we should scrap any possibility of raising an attrib past 
  racial max with karma alone. 

Morris says "Lyam, Revver" 

Amber says "1.5 * Theo?" 

Lyam says "We do need to specify in black and white (or ANSI ;o) what 
  the training rules are, since the book pretty much leaves it to the 
  GM's discretion." 

Morris says "We'll cover training next Lyam." 

Lyam says "Hokay." 

Revver nods at Hjal, "I agree. I think x1.5 is a good price, but there 
  needs to be something to go along with it, like a smaller version of a 
  mage's quest. On that line, I just want to illegally throw in that I 
  hope Adepts have to do some significant to get their extra Power 
  Point. 

Morris says "Revver." 
Morris says "Just for the record, attributes are 2x value you are going 
  to." 

Revver says "They are?" 
Revver thinks. 

Theo says "Unless you want to raise over racial max." 

Hjal says "3x if we let ppl raise past max." 

Revver nods, "x1.5 regular price." 

Morris says "Ok, do we allow it, the book says it should be extremely 
  rare?" 

Lyam says "I don't mind either way." 

Amber says "2x regular price?" 

Morris says "Hjal, Revver" 

Tarp says "It requires so much karma, it couldn't happen that much." 

Hjal thinks without cyber or magic, you shouldn't be able to raise past 
  maximum. What does maximum mean then if you can just raise past it 
  anyway :P 

Revver says "I think we should allow it since it wouldn't happen (Law of 
  Deminishing Returns) and the problem you have with any RPG is that the 
  writers expect a group of 2-12...we have 200-1200. Big difference, the 
  world is bigger." 
Revver says "Wouldn't happen too much, that is" 

Morris says "Theo" 

Theo says "On thinking about it a bit more, I'm leaning more towards not 
  having it. Simply to retain the pros and cons of the racial bonuses 
  and penalties. I see this 'mover max' rule as counterbalancing this 
  somewhat." 
Theo says "over max, not mover max. =)" 

Morris says "Hjal" 

JunkBLDR excuses himself... 
JunkBLDR pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Hjal says "In conjucntion with Revver's comments, I'd like to add that 
  if we do allow it, we'll need to make rules on what conditions will 
  satisfy this rare, and preferential treatment." 

Shutter digests info. 

Morris says "Ok, anything else, if not we'll move on to training." 
Morris says "Lyam" 

Lyam says "We do need to specify in black and white (or ANSI ;o) what 
  the training rules are, since the book pretty much leaves it to the 
  GM's discretion." 

Morris says "Yes, The book gives several options, from rolling dice to 
  RPing it out." 
Morris says "Revver" 

Revver says "Agreeing with Lyam, ya'll (communal admin mind) needs to 
  lay out the needs for training. Like, one person said I could ICly buy 
  some sims to learn to drive better, but another said I 
  couldn't....it's just frustrating to be a rigger that is the 
  jack-of-all-trades, he who needs to do everything from fix weapons to 
  blow up buildings. It's just a lot of stress, and ya'll have no idea 
  how annoying it is to have everyone ask you to do stuff, but you just 
  don't have the karma and time to raise everything. I'm a rigger, not 
  Superman, damnit! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!" 
Revver phews as he gets that off of his chest. 

Morris says "Well." 
Morris says "Ok, we currently allow a karma reduction to encourage the 
  RPing of training. We also have a time to raise skills." 

Revver says "Seriously: It would be nice if you guys got together aand 
  put down training standards...Having each RPA having their own opinion 
  is frustrating to PCs." 
Revver says "I know, I mean training as a karma reduction." 

Amber says "We be spending all day reading logs, which I don't intend to 
  do." 

Revver says "No, Amber, I mean I was told by one RPA I could spend IC 
  money to get sims (a couple thousand) to 'train' in improving car, 
  then another said I couldn't." 
Revver says "Then I found another who said I could, so I was happy 
  *grin*, but a standard would be nice." 

Morris says "Lets stop that, we're not talking about rulings, were 
  talking about new rules." 

Amber says "I think the simple roll will do and if necessary send an RP 
  log surrounding that roll. Reductions can be given post, with some set 
  of standards?" 

Lyam says "Can I hurt him, boss?" 

Morris says "So we should use the roll to raise any skill?" 
Morris says "Theo" 

Lyam has no problem with that. 

Theo says "I don't like the fact that the TN is double the level raising 
  too. That's just too high." 

Morris says "Revver" 

Revver just wants to point to Star Wars for how raising attrs past their 
  max can be good and bad: It gets harder as you go upm, but it's 
  totally random, so you replace ICness with OOCness...I don't like 
  that. It's like saying whoever can spit farther in RL wins the Sammie 
  fight. Random OOCness for RPed/Training ICness = Very bad 

Morris says "Hjal" 

Hjal would like to comment to Theo, "The TNs should be high, since the 
  training should not be the standard. 

Morris says "Lyam, Amber" 

Robert Verde pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Lyam says "On second thoughts I agree with Revver. I don't think we 
  should base skill raises *purely* on an OOC roll, although we need 
  something, I think." 

Morris says "Amber, Hjal" 

Amber says "The target numbers are high to uhmm reduce the turn around 
  time on trainings. What Training doesn't tell us is how long it does 
  take, even for a failed attempt." 

Morris says "Hjal, Lyam" 

Hjal says "Lyam: The skill raise isn't dependant on the roll, the karma 
  cost involved is. (which is OOC as well) Related Concept: RPAs, we 
  handle mails to do karma burns, would like to kick out a notion: What 
  about making some sort of house standard on *justification* to even 
  spend karma to raise a skill, w/o training?" 

Lyam says "Does anyone have a problem with keeping our training rules 
  the same as they are now and just adopting the SRIII karma costs?" 

Tarp agrees with Lyam. 

Revver doesn't, he guesses, unless the present rules depend on OOC rolls 
  to pass/fail. 

Theo does too. 

Amber doesn't like reductions for training. Training is a given in 
  learning more of a skill. 

Lyam disagrees. 

Morris says "Hjal" 

Amber says "The whole training process as given in SR is OOC. There is 
  no IC about it. IC methods will flood us with requests that will take 
  away a lot of time." 

Hjal says "Well, I'd propose that the roll 2x skill level you're going 
  for remain an option (since I like it :) but not mandatory. If Lyam or 
  any other admin has a preferable training method, they go with that?" 

Morris says "Shutter, Amber, Lyam" 

Shutter says "I agree with the last part of what you said Hjal, In just 
  about any thing you do there is trial and error it is OJT for the 
  skill. Without training or practice you can't improve. So as far as 
  getting a karma reduction for training I'm not too hip on it." 

Amber says "You can try somewhat of a compromise. the 2x new skill level 
  roll combined with our training wait table (or something along those 
  lines) with -'s to the TN based on time taken. Possibly -'s based on 
  IC situation (rp, logs, etc). That's take a level of intimacy with 
  characters and what they are up to that many of us don't have the time 
  for , as much as we would love to." 

Lyam says "I think whatever system we adopt, it should be constant 
  across all admins. I have no problem with either the OOC roll or the 
  current system, or even having no system at all, but I think we should 
  have one or the other as a Rule." 
Lyam says "Amber's system works for me." 

Morris says "Shutter" 

&LT&LT&LTJudge&GT&GT&GT Lyam says, "BRB." 

Shutter says "Could it be implemented with a "Teacher, Mentor Skill" 
  that is actually invoked by another character and not the PC...You get 
  a karmic reduction if you have a good teacher?" 

Morris says "There is an instruction skill in SR3." 
Morris says "Hjal" 

Hjal hehs to Morris. Whut I was gonna say :) 

Morris says "Theo" 

Theo says "I think that given the existing time wait and that this is 
  RL... waiting months to raise a skill is just... a lot. Especially if 
  you fail multiple times." 

Amber says "Happens with spells all the time." 

Theo is talking about the die roll to see if you can raise. 

Morris says "Hjal" 

Theo says "The time wait is as long?" 

Hjal says "Unless I missed it (and if so, please someone correct me) Sr3 
  didn't omit the rule that retrying a failed task imposes a +2 tn 
  penalty each successive time. So, if you try to train and fail.. the 
  tn keeps going u[" 

Amber says "No no, but if you play a mage you can understand that time 
  it can take to learn something at 6 with those rules (since mages 
  already use them for learning spells 2x force of spell as the TN). It 
  can take about a month to learn a F6 spell." 
Amber says "If you use that Hjal, they get to use KP as well, not 
  recommended." 

Morris says "Revver" 
Morris says "Revver, Hjal" 

Revver says "As the only PC speaking, I'd like to say this: I like the 
  current waiting time. And Amber: There is a /vast/ difference between 
  mastering the intake and control of mana and the practice of adjusting 
  for wind and angles of in/decline for shooting a gun. I think we 
  should leave the time thing alone, don't mess with silly skill tests 
  (since bad rolls can screw someone over when they should be able to 
  improve their skill), and make a standard (or at least examples) of 
  how to "train" to lower the karma cost. Use the instruction skill, 
  slot instructional chips, stuff like that." 

Tarp agrees with Revver. 

Hjal would also like to reply to Amber's comment about KP usage. "Prolly 
  better left to fully explore in future section, but KP (as of now) is 
  only used in life or death situations. Training doesn't satisfy. 

Morris says "Amber" 

Amber says "No no, that's a different skill for a mage, ie Sorcery and 
  it has the same problems of being raised as any other skill. Spells 
  are done almost by memorization for hermetics, to inspiration for 
  shamanics. Learning a spell is significantly easier than learning 
  Sorcery up a level. Yet the TN is as suggested for Training a normal 
  skill now. Go figure, makes no sense. Spells in SR3 are a bit easier 
  to learn if you learn them with fetish or exclusive. Same could be 
  said for skills if you are learning a concentration." 

Morris says "Hjal" 

Hjal says "And Revver, the roll wouldn't decide whether you get to 
  increase your skill or not. It only resolves whether you get to do it 
  on the cheap or not. Karma burns are OOC, I see no problem with an ooc 
  roll to relate to it. Since one could potentially be denied to 
  increase the skill if one has the karma for training but not the full 
  cost, perhaps only allow the attempt if the player has enough karma to 
  cover in case the training fails." 

Morris says "Ok, anything else on training?" 
Morris says "Hjal, Theo/" 

Hjal says "Dunno if it got brushed under the rug or forgotten, but would 
  like to bring up a related topic.. not training, but justification. 
  Keep as is, each admin has his own critieria to even let players spend 
  karma, or a house standard?" 

Theo says "I think that as long as the roll doesn't determine if you get 
  to raise or not, it's OK. I just don't like the arbitrariness of 
  rolling to be ABLE to increase (not that it's a whole lot better for a 
  decrease in karma cost). I think if we implement the roll to be ABLE 
  to increase, we should decrease the time between tries." 

Morris says "Revver, Amber" 

Revver says "Ok, I've got an idea for training rules, it'" 
Revver says "Ok, I've got an idea for training rules, it'll just take me 
  a minute to type out, so amber should type out her comment." 

Amber says "The book is pretty clear that either justification and RP 
  are necessary or some kind of mechanical rule. While I have no problem 
  with working with players on justifying the expenditure for 
  Intitiations and such, I'd be kept far too busy doing that for every 
  skill. Reductions are a cop out in my opinion. Setting standards for 
  certain karma expenditures in a concrete manner would not be wise. I 
  prefer the roll with -'s for time in between and or RP and logs 
  (training). Simple, easy. For the most part, mages are already dealing 
  with this ficklness via spells." 

Lyam makes his excuses and shuffles out. 

Hjal sorries. 

Morris says "Theo, Tarp. Hjal" 

Theo says "I think that sounds like a good way to go, Amber." 

Tarp says "If something is centrally related to what your character does 
  day in and day out should qualify for the training reduction. You 
  wouldn't get a discount on skills outside of your field. Riggers would 
  get vehicles at training costs but would pay regular for unarmed 
  combat for example." 

Theo would like to add ome little thing that -1 TN per week is a bit 
  much with larger skills unless the current timeframe is decreased. 

Revver says "You have a PC who wants to increase his Stealth skill. Now, 
  to do this he has to do one of two things (for my example): get an 
  instructor, or get some instructional thing, like sim chips or videos 
  or something (either way they will have to deviate from their IC life 
  to do so). I suggest assigning ratings to each sim chip/video: this 
  will be it's 'teaching dice'. For PC trainers, the teaching dice would 
  be the taught skill (as long as it is 3 above the trainee's rating) 
  and 1/2 of the instruction dice (and the person needs 4 in 
  Instruction). The teacher then rolls the teaching dice vs the PC's 
  desired rating. You then subtract the amt of successes from the karma 
  cost (and it can't be less than 1/2 it's original rating). Whatcha 
  think? COsts for the sims/videos would depend on skill/rating. 
  Teachers charge what they want." 

Tarp boggles at the complexity. 

Revver says "And I disagree with Tarp because restricts people to 
  archetypes while SR3 lets people have personality...don't wanna see 
  that restricted." 

Morris says "Thery have the rules ofr teaching sims and their costs and 
  availablity in the rules." 

Revver says "It's not conplex." 

Morris says "Amber" 

Amber says "As it stands now, I think raising a skill to 6 requires a 
  wait of 12 weeks (going to make this slightly interactive to get 
  feedback as I go) ?" 
Amber says "That would be a TN of 12 in the SR3 rules?" 

I don't recognize "reever". 

Theo nods. 

Amber says "-1 TN for each week. I daresay they try in 10, because 2 is 
  as low as a TN can go." 
Amber says "You want to say a concentration is an additional -2? Fine. 
  Simple." 
Amber says "Done, I think. It pretty much matches the rules we do have 
  now." 

Theo says "Ah. it hought you meant add a week to that and you get a -1 
  bonus, so to get a TN of 6 you'd have to wait 4.5 months." 

Amber says "Heck no." 
Amber says "We trying to have fun here, not live here :P" 

Theo says "That's why I didn't like it. =)" 
Theo likes it then. =) 

Amber says "They can even try earlier, but then they take a chance." 

Morris says "So am I hearing to get rid of the karma reduction?" 

Revver doesn't understand Amber's idea. 

Amber says "And I wouldn't rule out an admin going +gmnote Revver/Has Ok 
  to train in X whenever. as rewards." 
Amber says "I do that for initiations." 

Theo says "I like the time reduction better. Costs the same for 
  everyone. You WORK for the karma. Time reduction so we don't have to 
  live here (as Amber says)." 

Amber says "Uhmm ok, let me see if I can explain Revver. Use sr3 rules. 
  TN of 2x skill." 

Revver nods. 

Amber says "For each week you haven't tried to raise the skill, it's a 
  -1 to the TN." 

Revver says "Oh, okie." 

Amber says "About what we have now, except a bit faster, actually." 
Amber says "Since a TN can't go below 2." 

Revver says "I still object since I don't like rolling to raise a 
  skill...BUT, I have a compromise, might I say it?" 

Amber says "That's the guaranteed level (or as close as you can get). 
  Raising before then is your own call." 

Revver says "Amber: do you want karma costs reductions, or not?" 

Amber says "No way" 

Revver says "Might I say something in advocation of it?" 

Amber says "But I am for the 1.5 below racial max." 

Revver says "Well, yeah." 
Revver says "We're talking SR3 here...Ok, here's my comprimise." 
Revver says "We use the idea I put forth (which is the idea SR3 has for 
  instruction) and put it in for training times (using the ones we have 
  here). No karma reductions. Reason I say this is cause I don't like 
  the idea of someone being able to horde karma and not raise a skill 
  for a while (like their being out of town, or something), then come 
  back and raise it. Just doesn't sit. Just because they don't raise it 
  doesn't mean they practice it." 
Revver sticks in that he has RPed every single skill raise he has done. 

Amber says "If they aren't here for eons, they shouldn't be getting 
  karma." 

Revver means they get karma, go on vacation/hiatus, come back. 

Morris says "Ok, lets move on" 

Amber says "I don't see a problem with it. They earned the karma one way 
  or another. Are you requiring instruction for every raise?" 
Amber says "One more thing, Morris?" 

Morris says "Ok" 

Amber says "Here is the comical side to all this. Raising Sorcery is now 
  easier than learning a F6 spell." 

Theo says "there would have to be a minimum time to raise. I'I'd roll 
  every day against TN of 12, eventually, I'll get it." 

Revver says "As Magic person, you can restrict how mages raise skills, 
  but please don't suggest restricting everyone because of what you see 
  going on in magic." 
Revver suggests moving on before Amber roasts him with a fireball. 

Amber doesn't restrict raises in skills ;) I encourage them :) 

Revver just cries as Amber, "Next topic, Morris?" 

Morris says "Ok, next is use of Karma Pools." 

Amber says "Ok, looks like a messy subject. Move on? :)" 

Revver suggests using them. 

Morris says "It now specifically has rules for using it over extended 
  tasks." 

Amber says "And for open tasks." 

Revver steps back since he hasn't read all the karma pool rules lately. 

Morris says "Any problems with them as written?" 

Amber likes them. 

Morris says "Ok, last thing I want to at least mention is the disease 
  and toxins. Any problems with the rules?" 

Amber says "They're pretty much the same." 

Morris nods 

Revver says "That the wrap, Morris?" 

Morris says "I will not metion that we will not be using the be fair 
  rules on page 251 as I feel that they are inappropriate to this MUX." 
Morris grins 

Amber grins. 

Shutter nods 

Revver screams. 

Morris says "Ok, thats it from Beyond the Shadows. Anyone who wants to 
  bring something up can do so now." 

Revver notes there is nothing in SR3 saying PCs should be nice or 
  respects the GMs, either. 

Amber says "Nope. Their call , however." 

Shutter shakes his head a "Nothing to add." shake. 

Amber says "In re to Theo's last comment on the messy subject" glancing 
  at Revver, "Limitting rolls to once per week is probably good. With 
  losses to -'s due to time if they don't make it."" 

Revver looks around, "Hurm...only PC in a room with hormonal-driven, 
  moody admin people..." Sweating a bit, Revver backs out of the room, 
  "Oh my, look at the time, I've gotta go work on that paper...yeah, 
  that's it." 

&LTOOC&GT Revver can pose oocly, too. 
&LTOOC&GT Revver says, "Ok, seems people wanna talk to me ICly before I 
  brush them off to go work on my term paper. Later ya'll. Morris: I 
  tossed you a @mail, too." 

Morris looks around. "Thanks for coming 

Revver waves one last time, turns...and bolts. 
Revver pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Shutter says "See ya." 
Shutter slinks out the door. 
Shutter pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Morris says "This is the last meeting, next we start implementation" 

Amber says "Alright :)" 

Theo says "Implementation. Joy. =)" 

&GT&GTAnnouncement&LT&LT Shutter says, "If you have paged me in the last hour 
  and needed something...Page me again please." 

Theo returns from a small bout of cleaning to go home and idle there. =)
