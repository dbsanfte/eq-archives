      <p>In the year 2018, Dr. Hosato Hikata of ESP Systems, Inc., created the 
        first ASIST interface. ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction System) technology 
        allowed electronic devices to stimulate the areas of the brain which controlled 
        the senses. The entertainment industry went wild with the new "simsense" 
        technology, but other researchers saw it as a key to the containment of 
        the information explosion. </p>
      <p>In 2026, the first cyberspace travelers were taking halting steps into 
        what we now call the Matrix. The first cyberterminal was a room-sized 
        isolation chamber with multi-contact point jacks and multiple hook-ups 
        for the operator. These were designed for military intelligence applications. 
        The first volunteers went mad. </p>
      <p>In 2027, a great refinement in cyberterminals was made. As computer systems 
        became increasingly complex during the late twentieth century, many programs 
        replaced lengthy strings of commands with simple pictures, or icons, that 
        symbolized specific commands or programs. The user picked the icon wanted, 
        and the computer would do whatever the picture meant. By the late 1990s, 
        a typical user was dealing with so many thousands of icons that data-processing 
        systems were breaking down under their own complexity. </p>
      <p>By 2029, Sony Cybersystems, Fuchi Industrial Electronics, and RCA-Unisys 
        had all developed prototype cyberterminals that allowed the user to interface 
        with the world data network via his or her nervous system, which translated 
        the data and issued the commands. Instead of typing in commands or clicking 
        a mouse at an icon, operations were carried out literally at the speed 
        of thought. These early cyberterminals were massive, requiring that the 
        user be in a sensory deprivation tank. Largely funded by various intelligence 
        agencies, the goal of the research was to allow agents to raid data systems, 
        creating strike teams of "super hackers." </p>
      <p>In the United States, the CIA, NSA, and IRS pooled their resources to 
        exploit this development. Under the code name of "Echo Mirage", they recruited 
        and trained a team of "cyber-commandos." Fighting bulky equipment and 
        psychoses induced by the overwhelming sensory signals generated by the 
        primitive cyberterminals, Echo Mirage was advancing toward a workable 
        technology when international disaster struck. </p>
      <p>On February 8, 2029, computer systems across the world were attacked 
        apparently at random, by a virus program of unprecedented power. Systems 
        crashed, their data was wiped clean and even their hardware was burned 
        out by the effects of the virus. As the killer program spread, governments 
        toppled and the world economy neared collapse.</p>
      <p>During the first quarter of the year, the virus shattered the Grid, the 
        data network that held the world together. By presidential order, Echo 
        Mirage was activated to counteract the virus, but the "straight-arrow" 
        agents of Echo Mirage were overwhelmed by the psychological demands of 
        psycho-physiological combat in cyberspace.</p>
      <p>Echo Mirage's masters responded by recruiting the most brilliant, if 
        erratic, data-processing mavericks from the industry and the universities. 
        Their choices were drafted under a presidential emergency order and rammed 
        through a brutal training program. A cadre of 32 men and women graduated 
        with their sanity intact. </p>
      <p>It was not until August 2029, however, that the new cadre, armed with 
        improved cybertechnology, could mount a coordinated attack on the killer 
        program. </p>
      <p>Eighteen minutes after engaging the virus, four members of Echo Mirage 
        were dead. When the data logs were analyzed, two things became apparent. 
        First, the virus program could induce lethal biofeedback in humans accessing 
        the Matrix. Second, no existing computer security could even slow down 
        someone using a cyberterminal. </p>
      <p>The corporations involved in the effort were horrified at the ease with 
        which Echo Mirage penetrated their most secure data systems. In reaction, 
        secret corporate research was begun to develop new security software that 
        could repel intruders using a Matrix interface. This included research 
        to duplicate the lethal effects generated by the virus. The resulting 
        software was the first generation of intrusion countermeasures, or IC, 
        now known worldwide as "ice." </p>
      <p>Echo Mirage learned techniques to isolate and contain the virus. Equipped 
        with new combat programs and beefed up cyberterminals, they began the 
        lengthy task of purging the Grid of infection. By late 2031, they had 
        wiped out the last known concentration of virus code.</p>
      <p>These second-generation terminals used desk-sized hardware and needed 
        no sensory deprivation tank. Shortly after the final purge of the virus, 
        four of the surviving seven members of Echo Mirage decamped into the private 
        sector, taking with the secrets of the new technology. </p>
      <p>In May 2034, Matrix Systems of Boston came out with the first "gray-market" 
        cyberterminal. Six weeks later, Matrix Systems' main computer crashed 
        and its two founders died in apparently unrelated accident.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of the military-industrial complex, the damage had 
        already been done. Matrix technology was loose. Fuchi Industrial was the 
        first major corporation to break ranks against the invasion of the deckers 
        when, in 2036, it marketed its own third-generation cyberdeck, the desktop 
        CDT-100.</p>
      <p>The majority of cyberdecks sold today are licensed machines that inject 
        a unique signature into the logs of any systems they access, thus recording 
        all legitimate activity in the Matrix. For years, however, pirate users, 
        or deckers, have been acquiring decks and modifying them. Deckers suppress 
        their system's signature and add capabilities that are of little use to 
        an honest cyberterminal operator. That's the way of the world in the 2050's.
