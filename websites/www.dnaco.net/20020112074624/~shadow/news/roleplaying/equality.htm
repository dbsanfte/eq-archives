      <p>To begin with...<br>

        ALL PLAYERS <b>ARE NOT</b> CREATED EQUAL!<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, people don't think that its fair that your character has to 
        start from scratch where other characters are coming in with enhanced 
        cyber, magic or contacts. <br>
        <br>
        Fairness is a fallacy, in real life and in Shadowrun. There is nothing 
        fair about this gaming world, so get used to it. But, you, as our players, 
        do deserve some sort of justification. So read closely, and perhaps you'll 
        understand why such a thing is happening.<br>
        <br>
        Some characters are NPCs for short and long-term plots. You WILL NOT know 
        the difference between an NPC and a PC. That is for the roleplaying staff 
        to know. Some of these characters might be more powerful than the mass 
        of the populace. Some might be l ess powerful as well. Some may even be 
        characters that CANNOT be made through standard character generation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some characters are PC's with a background element that we particularly 
        like, or are of a type of character which we wish to encourage more of. 
        This means that they may come into the game with some sort of 'boost'. 
        This boost could take the form of cybe rware, more spells, more money, 
        better contacts, or even a basis in RP in the city, as if they had been 
        there all along. Some PC's might even be Vampires, Free Spirits or Dracoforms. 
        Anything is possible. <br>
        <br>
        Q: How can I be one of these 'enhanced' characters? <br>
        A: Depends. If your background is truly excellent, you might receive benefits 
        (be 'amped', short for 'amplified', in our current jargon). Other times, 
        you might be approached by a staff member and asked to play a certain 
        specific type of character. And occasionally, manna from the heavens falls 
        upon thee and you are risen above your peers in a blinding flash of light 
        to become an amped character completely spontaneously. (Well, no. But 
        it <b>could</b> happen.)<br>
        <br>
        Q: So, you're telling me that a character can come in, today, and be more 
        powerful/influential than the character I've had after 6 months of hard 
        work?
      <p>A: Yes. Doesn't that happen in reality as well? Come to grips with the 
        fact that things are not always fair in your eyes, but may be in someone 
        else's, or could be important for game balance.
