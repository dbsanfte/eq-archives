<P><I>The scene opens up with a tactical map of Seattle. Blue dots move all over the city while small red dots are constantly flashing all over the map.</I></P>

<P>        "This is Cindy O'Banyon with 23News reporting. The map you see here is a graphical representation of the actions that Lone Star was forced to deal with around 2am this morning. The blue dots are Lone Star units, while the red ones are of panic buttons currently being activated. Around 1am this morning, Lone Star responded to an anonymous tip that a group of elven gang members were hanging around in a resteraunt on Alaskan Way. A local resteraunt there, Shorty's Bar and Grill was surrounded by Lone Star as they sectioned off the area and started Riot Actions. Noone was injured according to official reports and the gather of people there was dispersed."</P>

<P>        "Moments later the rest of the panic buttons all over the city were pushed as if on queue. Lone Star responded almost instantly by setting up roadblocks in the major areas of the city. Any one that looked suspicous was stopped on site. After an hour of heavy patrols, things started to die down. As Lone Star was pulling out, another rash of panic buttons in different locations erupted again. Lone Star dealt with it in force. They once again set up roadblocks, called out the citymasters, and began to stop everyone out at 4am. Our investigations say that they will continue with the blockades until around 6am at which point they will ease up."</P>

<P>        "Around the same time as the first panic button went off, a trailer full of electronics was forced from the freeway and into the Barrens. Once there, a robber dressed as a Lone Star Officer stopped the convoy. Once stopped, an all out warzone broke out complete with explosions, elementals and high powered weaponry. When the dust cleared an 18 wheeler was destroyed, it's cargo stolen, and several security agents slaughtered. No known agents have claimed the attack as theirs. Network 23 will continue to investigate these two crimes."</P>
