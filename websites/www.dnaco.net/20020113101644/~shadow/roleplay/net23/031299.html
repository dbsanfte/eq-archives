<P><I>Over the screen, the words 'NEWS UPDATE' flash along. A soft pecking is heard, as if it were real typing, as each letter appears from an old type writer, and then a quick white streak covers the screen, and it shows a picture of Renraku's Arcology in the Seattle Skyline.</I></P>
<P><I>A native of Seattle's voice begins:</I> "Renraku shocked the market once more in its turn out of cutting edge technological advances, that most R&D calls impossible for many years, with the introduction of there second Robotics Lineage Drone , the 'Second Hands' all-purpose Utility Robot."The drone is capable of ingesting and processing more then 1 gigapulse of information, every micro second, and the ability to act upon it with semi-autonomous authority without a System Administrator watching over them. Thus making them 24 hour, 7 days a week workers, and raising any manufacturers efficiency by 33%. "<P>
<P><I>The voice pauses, as the view of the arcology shifts to a simple gray sleet, with a metallic chrome drone of some sort in it. A pair of mechanical arms forming from the side, as if it were a scorpion. Tracks and a third axle of movement are also visible on the sleek chrome drone, and many devices form off it, the chrome itself having a soft green glow to it, as the voice continues.</I></P>

<P>"The drone is estimated at a price of two-million plus... With this introduction of this robotics drone, Renraku stock prices have once more raised a flabbergasting rate in just a matter of hours, to an amazing 90% raise, topping off the price per stock at 13.44Y, of the first tier corporation. Raising it to the 4th Richest Corporation in the world..."</P>
<P><I>The voice pauses, and shuffling is heard, and the screen flashes once more, to a picture of Chairman of the Board of Yamatetsu, Yuri Shibanokuji, an ork with gleaming white tusks, and surprisingly good looking for one of his race. The voice begins again:</I></P>

<P>"On the flipped side of the coin, with the paralyzing death of former Chairman of the Yamatetsu Corporation, Tadamako Shibanokui, the TSE (Tokyo Stock exchange) value has dropped a staggering 55 once more, cutting it in half to a mere 1/3rd of the corporations former holdings, at 3.23Y.</P>
<P>"This is believed to be the fact of the introduction of rather under developed management introduced into the company, and the sudden realization of there many sites against the Environment in their holdings within the Imperial State of Japan." The voice pauses once more, shuffling pages silently , "Net 23 news, for when you want the news, without the faces." it then goes back on listing the many tragedies within the world.</P>
