      <p> Some characters on the MUSH are, or at least should be, considered larger-than-life. 
        One unfortunate RP trend that I see happening all the time is that the 
        players refuse to treat the organizations and corporations around them 
        with the respect due to them, which is always a no-no. A recent example 
        involves the Mafia. One player felt that he was tough enough to get away 
        with acting as a maverick within Mafia territory. He had the presence 
        of mind and the good RP skill to change his identity entirely, but even 
        this can turn out wrong--as it did--when magic proved to be his undoing. 
        When the Mafia caught up to him months later and interrogated him, there 
        was not a whit of respect nor obiesance in the character's demeanor, no 
        apologies, or anything of the sort. He felt that with two grenades in 
        his pocket he could stare down the Don of the Mafia and get away with, 
        well, just about anything he wanted. This was a poor tactic and resulted 
        in his death, although I knew beforehand that the Mafia players really 
        didn't want to have to kill him, they just wanted the respect due to them. 
        They didn't--they got a threat instead--and he died. 
      <p>When you are caught by someone bigger than you, when you have an organization 
        on your back who knows what you have done, the answer is probably not 
        to fight. It just doesn't work out, most of the time. Running and hiding 
        is one option (but you had better be very good at it). Another option 
        is to make reparations to the organization you have offended. Making contacts 
        in the Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, et. alia. is always a good idea; paying 
        these individuals respect is something that will go a long way towards 
        ensuring your survival, and God forbid you should piss them off, apologize 
        immediately and offer reparations if you can. Such a resolution is, nine 
        times out of ten, not only possible but desireable, even if most players 
        don't seem to get the idea that sometimes it's okay to acknowledge that 
        you are not the coolest person in the world, and there are people out 
        there tougher than you are. 
      <p>The same thing applies (although in a less deadly sense, for the most 
        part) to the corporations. A little schmoozing with, say, the PR head 
        of a corp (provided you can), or a reporter, working to make a contact, 
        even dealing with people whom your character really doesn't personally 
        like, can prove extremely rewarding to you in terms of future payoffs 
        and RP opportunities. I've found that some players tend to be very lazy. 
        They don't want to work for their friends, they don't want to really RP 
        anything hard, they want the administration to toss TPs in their laps 
        and they want PCs around them to just spill everything about themselves 
        or it isn't worth it to them to pursue that friendship or relationship. 
        Such a thing is a sad way to RP, in my opinion. There's no challenge in 
        it and it ruins the texture of the game. The most successful RPers on 
        the MUSH work to make friends of enemies, don't reveal too much about 
        themselves, and as a general rule, tend to work really hard to develop 
        their characters' personalities. 
      <p>Another element here is that there are some people whom you should make 
        a bigger stink over. When the Mayor enters your location--treat him with 
        respect. When a simsense star sits at your table, display the appropriate 
        amount of awe. If a Great Western Dragon hangs out at your bar, keep in 
        mind just who you are dealing with. Other characters (names reserved for 
        anonymity's sake :)) are the hottest shadowrunners on the MUSH with the 
        reputations to prove it. Act that way around them. I'm not going to say 
        that people should immediately kiss these characters' butts or go out 
        of your way to court their favor, nor will I tell you exactly how to react--beyond 
        saying, AT ALL TIMES, keep in mind exactly who it is you're dealing with. 
        These people are news, they are powerful individuals (ESPECIALLY when 
        you see, say, Samantha Villiers out for a night on the town). Talk to 
        them as such, and if you can have them as friends--more power to you.
