      <p>Shadowrun MUSH has one cardinal sin: using OOC knowledge ICly. Don't 
        do it. 
      <p>OOC knowledge means, simply, out of character knowledge. The term refers 
        to any information of any kind you, the player, gain, that your character 
        doesn't know. Using OOC knowledge IC refers to the practice of having 
        your character make decisions on the basis of things that you, the player, 
        know about and your character does not. 
      <p>It's impossible to forbid people to find out about things OOC, and we 
        don't try to. We understand that you talk to your friends about the game, 
        and such. We merely ask that you not take unfair advantage of others. 
        We also feel that using OOC knowledge IC makes the game less fun for everyone, 
        yourself included. For examples of what's not allowed, see below, <b> 
        OOC examples</b>. For the consequences of using OOC knowledge IC, see 
        below, <b>OOC consequences</b>. 
      <p><b>OOC examples</b>
      <p>A classic example of OOC knowledge abuse is giving an OOC friend preferential 
        treatment. Let's say that your character is a netrunner who's about to 
        go on a good run with a big payoff, and you mention this to a friend of 
        yours in real life over lunch. The friend points out that her character 
        will suffer if the run is successful, and asks you to keep your character 
        from going on it. 
      <p>Your character should, of course, still make the run. There's no reason 
        why your character, as opposed to you, should change his mind. Hopefully 
        your friend won't be too mad at you; you didn't really have much choice.
      <p><b>OOC consequences</b>
      <p>Anyone can accuse anyone else of using OOC knowledge IC. We'll take all 
        complaints seriously. We will not merely accept the accusation as truth; 
        there is no place on this MUSH for witch hunts. We will also, since we 
        take the accusation seriously, be up set if it turns out to be false. 
        Know that you can accuse people, but don't treat this ability lightly. 
      <p>If the Directors and staff find that you've used OOC knowledge IC, we'll 
        give you a warning. If you do it again, we'll remove your character from 
        the database. This makes nobody very happy; you don't have a character 
        anymore, and everyone else has to deal with someone suddenly vanishing. 
      <p>All in all, it's much better to talk about the possible problem with 
        the person you want to accuse first. If you can resolve matters without 
        going to us, so much the better. Accusations should be a last resort.
