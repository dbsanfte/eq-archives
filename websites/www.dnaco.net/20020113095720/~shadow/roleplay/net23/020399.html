<P><I>The Net23 logo appears. It shimmers as it spins until it eventually fades into the Net23 studio from commercial. Suzanne Writhers is seated behind the news desk. She taps her papers lightly and looks to the camera to begin</I></P> 

<P>Writhers -- Welcome back. Another disturbing report this evening. Another dead body in the Barrens. We go live now to Arturo at the scene.</P> 

<P><I>No cops have showed up yet and Arturo seems to be hurriedly dressed. The camera shows Arturo infront of a wall in the Banshee parking lot. A few gangers parade around giving the finger and such, but Gallivan ignores them professionally.</I></P> 

<P>Arturo -- Thank you Suzanne. I'm here in the Banshee Parking lot where a mysterious crime just unravelled.</P> 

<P><I>Arturo motions to a dead elven body slumped against one of the Banshee's outer walls. It is an elven male, encased in black armor of some hard yet flexible mesh. The suit is very ornamental, with intricate carvings and designs. The helmet raises to a coned peak and the mask is demonic. He has been shot 4 times through the chest. The camera focuses on the body while Arturo does a voice over</I></P> 

<P>Arturo's Voice -- Net23 recieved a call not moments ago of a mysterious murder committed. This elven male has been shot four times with .45mm bullets. The body was either shot or thrown from the roof of the Banshee, because it landed in the front. Due to the request of a Jiver, two men on the scene carried the dead elven into the Banshee parking lot.</P> 

<P><I>The camera pans out again to Arturo. He stands with a worried look on his face.</I></P> 

<P>Arturo -- Little is known at this time of the mysterious murder, but Net23 is investigating it. If anybody hads any information, we urge you to call the Net23 hotline. This is Art Arturo, Net23 news, Barrens. Back to you Suzanne.</P> 

<P><I>The shot of Arturo fades back to the newsroom.</I></P> 

<P>Writhers -- Thank you Art. We'll be right back after these short messages.</P> 

<P><I>The Net23 logo appears. It shimmers as it rotates until it eventually fades into commercial</I></P>
