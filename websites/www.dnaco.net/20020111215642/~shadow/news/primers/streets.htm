      <p> One of the most prevalent mistakes present in the players I've seen 
        on ShadowRun MUSH (and perhaps one of the most easy to make) is the lack 
        of attention to setting and the logical extensions thereof to your roleplaying. 
        By this I mean being unaware of where, exactly, you are, even if it's 
        not described in the @desc or noted on the BBoard or in a handy OOC poster 
        that tells you how to act or what's going on. A lot of things that should 
        be common sense aren't (further going to prove the old maxim that "common 
        sense is rarely either.") Two examples of this glare out at me. First 
        one is what occurs in my own nightclub creation, Silhouettes. The @succ 
        for the door says, "You pass the troll bouncer's inspecting gaze and are 
        waved into the club." This is to simulate not a search for weapons, but 
        a fashion check. If you look at the exit (look SI from Pier 42--all exits 
        have descriptions, by the way; if they don't, that is a building error 
        and should be reported), you will note it describes a line of people waiting 
        to get in. I don't suppose it's quite fair of me to expect that every 
        player on the MUSH has been to a posh nightclub, but I am here to tell 
        you that, in a place like Manhattan's Limelight or any one of a number 
        of clubs, if you don't look the part, you don't get in. This is also described 
        several times in relation to Dante's Inferno in the book "Nosferatu", 
        and can be witnessed basically at any major nightclub. Yet, when I tell 
        my security staff to enforce this, they yell at me because the players 
        don't listen. 
      <p>Furthermore, as our time frees up, and we get more judges, you will find 
        that your @desc means a lot more in a lot of situations. Imagine a roving 
        LS patrol down Alaskan Way sights a few squatters moving around with "bulges 
        in their clothes". What do you think is going to happen? HOW YOU LOOK 
        IS IMPORTANT. Silhouettes might be the shadowrunning hotspot, but it's 
        a nightclub. It's for the shadowrunning elite, a la Club Penumbra (in 
        fact, there IS no Club Penumbra on the MUSH. Silhouettes was designed 
        to replace it). Hundreds of people walk in and out of there, if you're 
        dressed like a squatter, or even if you're totally DRAB--if you have no 
        FLASH--you wouldn't have been allowed in in the first place. 
      <p>By the same token, there are problems with RPing IN clubs like Silhouettes. 
        Just the other night I was at a club in Manhattan and I realized a lot 
        of things happen in Silhouettes' Main Cave which are blatantly impossible 
        in real nightclubs' dance areas. Same thing with the Alabaster Maiden 
        and every other club in the game world. In the CLUB areas, there are so 
        many people, such loud music, such bright and dancing lights that produce 
        a visual cornucopia, that when someone walks in, odds are, you won't notice 
        them immediately. And as far as HEARING them, well, that's near impossible 
        over the music unless they're shouting, or inside the same SoundShield 
        as you are. So saying something to the whole room is not going to be heard. 
        The Alabaster Maiden has the balcony, if you just want to chat, the music 
        ain't so loud up there; Silhouettes has the soundshielded tables and bar 
        and the Caverns for quiet meetings. But you won't get noticed in the Main 
        Cave as soon as you walk in, nor will you be heard over the music. Now 
        that the mutter code is in, this becomes more realistic--but there are 
        times when people don't USE it, which is annoying.<b> +help places</b> 
        and <b>+help mutter</b> are two of the best RP commands you could use, 
        so read them. 
      <p>Now we come to the other part of the MUSH that suffers the most abuse 
        and misconceptions as to how to roleplay within it, that being: The Barrens. 
        For simplicity's sake on the MUSH the Barrens are both Puyallup and Redmond 
        and neither; while we call it Redmond, we usually just make Redmond an 
        amalgamam of both places. Lone Star Enforcement Rating there is pretty 
        low. What enforcement there is is sporadic at best. The cops have agreements 
        with the gangers, the organized crime influences, etc. alia. there. Basically, 
        if it's something less than a major war that would disrupt other portions 
        of the city, or unless the Mayor's on one of his annoying let's clean 
        the Barrens up kicks, you're SOL in terms of Lone Star getting involved. 
        If you're not street scum or a criminal, THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD PLACE 
        FOR YOU TO BE. By the same token, if you ARE street scum or a criminal, 
        whether or not it's a good place for you to be depends on exactly where 
        you ARE. If you're a ganger in the wrong side of town, wearing your colors 
        on someone else's turf, be prepared to be meat. If you're not a ganger, 
        and you're just out for a night at the Banshee or at Dox's Arcade, you 
        had best not be an agressive sort, and you'd best learn your place in 
        a location where the gangs rule, and not start anything funny--or you're 
        meat for the machine. 
      <p>Even the Mafia and Yakuza watch their asses out in the Barrens. Why? 
        Because, sure, they might have the cash to cover things and the men and 
        women to do it--but the Barrens runs by its own rules, and gangers might 
        individually be no match for your Joe Chromed Shadowrunner/Yakuza Goon/Mafia 
        Enforcer, but they travel IN PACKS. And numbers can KILL better than any 
        chrome ever could. Wired 2 might make you move twice before the ten of 
        them do, but the odds are against you ever surviving the four you can't 
        kill in those two actions--not to mention the heavy resistance you'll 
        meet when word spreads even if you DO survive. And you know, since Lone 
        Star doesn't mind a few busts in the area and gangs don't have that much 
        illegal chrome, it could be as simple as Bob Ganger making an anonymous 
        tip to LS about Joe Chromeboy who he figures must have some nice little 
        illegal chrome under that skin to get you busted in the Barrens, presuming 
        the gangs don't deal with you themselves. 
      <p>What you act like means more in the Barrens than it does in Downtown. 
        It can mean the difference between living and dying, for the most part. 
        This isn't to say that the gangs will kill you for any imagined slight, 
        but they can sure as shit beat the crap out of you for that same slight. 
        Intergang politics are as labrynthine and confusing as any megacorporate 
        politics ever were, and usually more bloody in the end. If you're a ganger, 
        your leaders will have been briefed on the basics concerning other gangs--talk 
        to them about how to handle things. And never be stupid in the Barrens. 
      <p>In conclusion, I suppose the one thing that I'm saying when it comes 
        to location is that there are things that are IMPLIED by the area that 
        are not DESCRIBED. We can't describe every pedestrian, every nuance of 
        atmosphere, in every description. We rely on a little creativity from 
        our players to fill in things based on context. I recall one combat that 
        occurred a long time ago where three gangers chased another ganger out 
        of Live 'Till Dusk and through contested turf territory (LTD is primarily 
        a border-turf area). The gangers chased the guy and shot at him through 
        a crowd, and one of them hit a pedestrian. Two pedestrians opened up with 
        weapons of their own, and a third one wasn't taking no shit from the human 
        ganger who told him to keep his head down or die (this one was a large 
        Ork shadowrunner) and HE opened up on the three gangers. I didn't get 
        any complaints for this judge call, but just to let you know--this is 
        what might happen. And sometimes with less than what you might consider 
        warning.
      <p>STAY ALERT--TRUST NO ONE--KEEP YOUR WEAPON HANDY (thank you, Paranoia!).
