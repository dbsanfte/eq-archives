Here we are, the brave souls who dared to face each other in Real Life. 
(Some of those souls aren't as brave as the rest of us, however, and have 
asked to be kept anonymous as far as their characters are concerned.) Top 
row: "The Dynamic Duo," James and Reuben (PC names withheld); Matt, Dan, 
"Speaks-with-Modems" John (Bogart); Scott (Shayd-pronounced-Shade). 
Middle Row: Nick (Bubbles); "Hostess With The Mostess" Alison (Glorie); 
Dave (Locke). On the ground: "Energizer Bunny" Andy (Lachesis); "Let's 
Spar" Allen (PC name withheld). Yes, I was the only woman in the group. 
Ah, what a weekend... ;)

Karaoke on Navy Pier. SOMEONE had to shut up the DJ, so the MUSH party's 
finest serenaded the crowd with their rendition of "The Monster Mash." 
John's got a darn good voice, and man can Andy dance! :)

All of the MUSHChatters. Well, all that made it to the party, anyway.

The man is a wonder. While dialing random phone numbers just for the heck 
of it, he dialed a modem and, by imitating the bleeps and chirrups it was 
making, actually conversed with then machine. He was awarded the title, 
"Speaks-With-Modems" for his talent.

Yes, it was hot. And granted, he was in jeans and was therefore prolly a 
bit hotter than the rest of us. But, I ask you, does it take the whole of
Lake Michigan to cool him off?? Well, he seemed to think so, and stripped 
off the shirt (not the jeans, thank heavens), jumped the railing, and 
hopped into the lake. At which point, while clinging to the rim, declared 
calmly, "I can't get back up." Right about this time, a jet ski roared 
past, and the wake nearly sucked our hero under the pier.

Allen, the ever vigilant, leapt to his rescue and dragged him from the 
scene. (Meanwhile, Alison is grasping the railing in a near panic and 
envisioning the 
headlines in the the next day's Chicago Tribune: "Canadian Man Sucked To 
His Death By Ravenous Navy Pier" ("He was just trying to cool off," 
distraught "virtual" friends claim.)

Most of the group wanted to do this Battletech thingie, so that's where 
we are in this pic. Matt, John, and I decided to sit it out, but John 
took this pic of Dan, Matt and I before Dan headed into the arena. If 
onloy I had copies of the photo booth pics Matt, John, and I took....
