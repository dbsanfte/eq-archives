<P><I>The word Net23, encased in a shimmering, glossy corporate logo appear on your tridscreen. It fades out and zooms into a newsdesk, at which Net23 anchor Ali Harambee X is sitting. He is wearing an expensive and neat black suit which goes well with his African skin tones. His eyes move up from the LCD display on his desk and he begins the night's news.</I>

<P>"Earlier this week, Seattle lost a recognized artist, Dokotor Christian Doom. He was found dead in the Redmond Barrens, apparently dead of a drug overdose. He was wearing little for clothes, considering the cold of the night, and by an ATM in an alley. Dokotor Christian Doom was employed by Seattle radio station KBLD as a DJ, and he was also the owner of Dead Man Dancing Studios, a lucrative recording label. His own band under the label was known worldwide, selling millions of records. Shortly after he was found, investigators noticed that monetary amounts summing approximately 2 million nuyen were gone from his accounts."

<P>"In other news, Seattle was rocked by a massive storm 2 days ago, during which a spirit entity described by onlookers as looking like "the Grim Reaper" in front of the International District bar known as The Joke. Net23 will bring you more on this subject later."

<P>"Storm damage to Seattle businesses was estimated in costing hundreds of thousands of nuyen, mostly stemming from water damages."

<P>"Thank you for tuning in to Net23, the source for all you need to know."

<P><I>Ali looks up and smiles grandfatherly as the newsdesk fades to black, being replaced by commercials extolling McHugh's latest 1=Y= special on their burgers.</I>
