<P>MELISANDRE SLIVER: Despite repeated attempts to rebuild, Redmond is generally known as the district with the most gang members and squatters in all of Seattle. Because of its low profile, corporations often conduct private business on the streets of Redmond. But what can happen when this business goes sour? We go now to Trisha Williams with the special report.</P>
<P><I>Trisha, moderately attractive, blue eyed, blonde, and wearing her signature leather coat is standing on top of what appears to be a garbage heap. In the distance you can see several lit trash barrels with squatters warming themselves from the chilly weather.</I></P>
<P>TRISHA WILLIAMS: Thank you Melisandre. In the worst squatter neighborhood in all of Redmond, you can find all manner of things discarded. Newspapers, old appliances she holds up examples of both, even a corporate credstick. This was the situation in Redmond earlier tonight.</P> 
<P><I>She walks to the right along the garbage heap, still reporting. The camera pans to get a better look at her, and a panoramic view of a seemingly unending field of trash and rickety cardboard lodgings.</I></P> 
<P>A credstick containing tens of thousands of nuyen, lost among this chaos, and found again by a man while trying to find refuge from the cold weather.</P> 
<P><I>The camera pans towards even farther right, and gets a view of a big area bordered by yellow Police Line tape. Behind the tape, body bags are being loaded into an ambulance.</I></P>
<P>Which resulted in the deaths of five squatters, eight Renraku security, and a tense standoff between Lone Star and Renrakus own corporate security forces.</P>
<P><I>Camera abruptly cuts to Trisha standing on a sidewalk outside of the apparent garbage heap.</I></P>
<P>The man was known to his friends as Vince. He was known for finding the best things to salvage from the neighborhood, the Rats Nest. Tonight he found more than he bargained for: a corporate credstick from a Renraku corporate executive which he had apparently intended to use to conduct some business. How it got into the garbage pile is unknown, but when Vince attempted to cash the credstick, it activated a tracking signal which Renraku security forces almost immediately zeroed in on.</P>
<P><I>Camera cuts to a mangy looking squatter with a hoarse voice and apparent tears in his eyes.</I></P>
<P>SQUATTER: Well, they drove up in two vans, and got out. They were all wearing suits with the Renraku logo sewn into the cuff. I asked them what they were doing, but they just walked right past me, and pulled out SMGs. I tried to stay out of their way</P> 
<P><I>Camera cuts once again to Trisha talking to a Lone Star commissioner. A voice over is muting out what theyre saying currently.</I></P>
<P>TRISHA (VOICE-OVER): When Lone Star responded to several panicbuttons from outlying neighborhoods, a firefight had already broken out.</P>
<P><I>Sound from interview is unmuted</I></P>
<P>COMMISSIONER: When the patrol cars got there, there several men in suits and some people in rags who we assume to be squatters were exchanging fire. When they moved in to stop the situation, the squatters ran away and the men immediately stopped firing. 5 squatters, including 3 children, were apparently killed in the cross-fire.<BR>
TRISHA: Did you realize that they were Renraku Security?<BR>
COMISSIONER: It has yet to be proven that they have corporate affiliation of any kind.</P>
<P><I>Camera cuts back to Trisha talking on the sidewalk.</I></P>
<P>TRISHA: But it seems rather obvious now. <I>She holds up a scrap of a suit, with a Renraku logo clearly sewn into the fabric</I> This scrap of a Renraku suit was recovered shortly after the crime near the bodies. Lone Star contests, however, that that scrap could have come from anywhere. In the meantime, 13 are being carried off to the morgue.
<P><I>Camera cuts to squatter from before.</I></P>
<P>SQUATTER (crying): They killed my son the ****ers killed my son.<BR>
TRISHA: Another human tragedy on the roughest streets of Seattle. Back to you, Melisandre.<P>
