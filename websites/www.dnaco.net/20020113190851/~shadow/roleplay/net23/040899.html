<P><I>The familiar Net23 logo continues to circle in the center of the screen. It is gently interrupted by Melisandre Sliver, beautiful elven news anchor, who begins the night's highlights</I>  
 
<P>"In local news, an elven youth was found in the parking garage of the Downtown strip mall, severely beaten. Police are speculating that this may have been a racially motivated crime, but no conclusions have been drawn yet. This footage of the incident gathered by an undercover Net23 reporter shows the incident occurring in its entirety" 
 
<P><I>A human male in his late twenties stands near an elven youth. The human stands about 5'10" tall and has the body of a dock worker. When he speaks it is usually in clear very proper English. Like it's right out of a text book. His voice is smooth and low with a heavy Italian accent. He is wearing gray suit with a black turtle neck under it, with expensive-looking Italian shoes and a pinky ring on his left hand. The man stands in front of the boy as two very big men, both human and wearing brass knuckles, stand behind him.</I> 
 
<P>"Derrin, you KNEW the situation when you started working at the restaurant. The basement is off limits and you still decided to throw your little party. Now Ive got people asking all kinds of questions." He puts his arm around the elf. "What are we gonna do with you? Youre a popular guy, so you cant disappear. Maybe Tony can help you remember the rules."
 
<P><I>The two men drag the young elf into some shadows. You can hear him beg for mercy. Some kind of ambient light amplification kicks in, showing the men beating the youth in the head with their brass knuckles, and slamming his limp body into the dumpster outside the strip mall. When the blood starts to flow and it gets ugly, visible signs of matting out occur, to make it suitable for prime-time. The man speaking previously lights a cigarette as this occurs and begins to smoke. Once the boy has been knocked unconscious, the man signals to the two men to follow him, and they wander north, towards Dantes Inferno. The camera zooms in on the body, enough to see a bloody pool near it, and an arm wrenched into a position that it couldnt be in unless it was broken. The scene fades to Melisandre back in the news room.</I> 
 
<P>"No word yet on the identity of these aggressors, however it is suspected they are connected to organized crime. The most disturbing thing about this crime is that it is only one of a series of crimes that has occurred in the area of Dantes Inferno. So far, though Lone Star has tightened security, incidents like this are still occurring. If you have any information pertaining to the incident, please do not hesitate to call the Net23 hotline, at LTG #6347-47046" 
 
<P>"In other news, the International District has seen yet another corporate-related crime. After hacking their computers and knocking out four employees with high-tech weapons and magic, perpetrators snatched a van belonging to Diamond Removals, Inc., a small removals company based in Downtown Seattle. An unknown matrix perp planted a false callout in the corps computers, and the moving men were ambushed as they arrived. Police have yet to recover the van, or identify any of the perpetrators." 
 
<P><I>Melisandre begins to go on to news from the rest of the nation. The Net23 logo rotates in the corner once more, and then you turn off your tridset.</I>
