<h3><a name=attributes>Attributes</h3>
What are attributes?
<P>
Chargen attributes gives general definitions regarding each of the 
six attributes, explaining what each level could mean. 
<P>
Keep in mind that this is for HUMANS.  For metahumans, apply the racial 
bonuses and/or penalties when considering how you compare to OTHER 
people of your race. A 3-charisma human is comparable to an ugly or 
obnoxious elf and so on. In most cases, if your base attribute is a 1, a 
5 or a 6, you should make some note of it in your background because it 
is exceptional.

<h5>STRENGTH</h5>
<OL>
<LI> (Weak) <BR>
You're childlike in your weakness.  Ten-year-olds could bully you. Feeble 
is a good adjective.
<LI> (Underdeveloped) <BR>
You're a couch potato, the most exercise you get is walking to the fridge.
Climbing stairs is a chore.
<LI> (Average) <BR>
You're no wimp, but not especially strong, either. You don't notice a 
LACK of strength for everyday tasks, but feats of strength aren't your 
forte.
<LI> (Improved)<BR>
You're a weekend athlete. You are reasonably strong, stronger than a lot 
of people anyway.
<LI> (Superior)<BR>
You're either a serious athlete or your job requires lots of heavy lifting
(I.e. dockworker). You can toss around heavy objects with an ease that 
makes many people jealous.
<LI> (Maximum unmodified human)<BR>
You could compete in the world's strongest (wo)man contest. Strength 
training is a daily fact of life. Powerlifters and/or top-end bodybuilders 
are here. Picture Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Mr. Universe prime.
</OL>

<h5>BODY</h5>
<OL>
<LI> (Weak) <BR>
You're scrawny, and in poor health. You are easily injured, you cannot 
sustain much abuse.

You are either kind of small or you are just a bit of a wimp.  You aren't
a toothpick but perhaps you just never developed.
<LI> (Average) <BR>
You are of average constitution.  You're occasionally sick, but you get 
over it.  You can absorb a little damage and keep moving.
<LI> (Improved)<BR>
You shrug off minor nicks and cuts.  You're a fast healer. You can take
a punch and not fold up like a cheap suitcase.
<LI> (Superior)<BR>)
You can really take a beating.  You almost never get sick.  You heal 
faster than almost anyone you know.
<LI> (Maximum unmodified human)<BR>
Bare-knuckle world champion. "Punch me in the face again! Pain don't hurt!".
You had cancer, but your body's immune system ate it.
</OL>

<h5>QUICKNESS</h5>
<OL>
<LI> (Weak) <BR>
Slow, uncoordinated.  Someone with MD or similar problems. Gross 
deficiencies in motor control. Perhaps just REALLY slow-moving.
<LI> (Underdeveloped) <BR>
Clumsy in some way, perhaps just unathletic.  Can perform most everyday 
tasks, but lacks grace and/or speed.
<LI> (Average) <BR>
Jane Q. Public.  You can throw a ball, type at a reasonable pace, move 
without colliding into things.
<LI> (Improved) <BR>
You can juggle, you have a good sense of balance, you a quick on your feet.
<LI> (Superior)<BR>
You're a gymnast.  You can pluck thrown objects out of the air with ease.
You can juggle knives and not get cut. You're a good sprinter.

Below 60 IQ - you're either slowwitted or you think REALLY slowly.

60-85 IQ - were your parents related by blood? You're not too bright, it 
takes you longer than others to understand things.
<LI> (Average) <BR>
85-115 IQ Just you and the masses.  You aren't a genius, but you can 
understand things that most people do.
<LI> (Improved)<BR>
116-130 IQ - You're a sharp cookie.  You catch on to things quickly and 
you have the mental agility to easily comprehend new things.
<LI> (Superior)<BR>
131-160 IQ You're a MENSA candidate.  You are usually one of the brightest 
lights in any crowd. You can think on multiple levels. 
<LI> (Maximum unmodified human)<BR>

immediately grasp most concepts and are lightning fast on your mental feet. 
</OL>

<h5>CHARISMA</h5>
<OL>
<LI> (Weak) <BR> 
You're either really ugly, really obnoxious, really disgusting or some 
lesser combination of the three.  People avoid you. 
<LI> (Underdeveloped) <BR>
You've got some real social deficits and/or you ain't pretty to look at.
You may just be homely and/or shy.
<LI> (Average) <BR>

the ability to persuade people to do what you want.
<LI> (Maximum unmodified human)<BR>
You've either got a body to die for, a personality to kill for, or a 
bunch of both. R-r-r-e-g-g-l-e! Honey Brighton's body and/or the cult 
of personality.
</OL>
<h5>WILLPOWER</h5>
<OL>
<LI> (Weak) <BR> 
You are a slave to your hormones and your digestive juices.  You are easy 
to convince and you likely have the attention span of a Chihuahua in heat.
<LI> (Underdeveloped) <BR>
You are easily swayed, you have trouble concentrating on things for very 
long, you are a follower not a leader.
<LI> (Average) <BR>
You possess moderate self control.  You can -usually- resist temptations, 
and force yourself to do unpleasant things, but you aren't perfect.
<LI> (Improved)<BR>
You are stubborn.  Once you decide something, you can usually stick to it.
<LI> (Superior)<BR>
You have great self control.  You have mastered your id, ego and superego 
and made them your servants. 
<LI> (Maximum unmodified human)<BR>
Your will is an (almost) immovable object.
