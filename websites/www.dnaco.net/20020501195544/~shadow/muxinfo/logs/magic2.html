RPMeeting Room(#34136RIh) 

A large room with some pillows around the floor to sit on. On the far 
  wall is a simple white board for people to write on with some colored 
  pens on the base of the board. 



People in the room: 

Hjal 

Amber 



Amber says "Are we done with astral and can move into Sorcery?" 
Amber says "One thing.." 

Lisa Cooper says "what about all the living-walls barriers, etc?" 

Amber says "I saw that the lodge ratings are cumulative.. I'm assuming 
  that means wards are as well. Anyone see anything saying for sure?" 

Bert says "Wards don't use materials anymore" 

Amber says "That would prolly be why I didn't see it then :]" 
Amber says "Right, though I should also point out that all astral 
  barriers are dual-natured." 

Lisa Cooper says "in SR-III... but not in SR-II. A lot of places here 
  have living walls as barriers" 

Amber says "they all have physical components." 

Roy says "Lodge ratings are cumulative? You can add to an existing 
  one.." 

Hjal nods to Roy. "That's what I just said.." 

&GTFrom afar, Shiro Yamada pokes. 

Roy says "That's not what you said, it's what you meant :)" 
Roy says "And I think you do a 'ritual of change' kinda thing to 
  increase wards" 



Amber says "Placing wards is a ritual, no matter what you do." 

Roy nods 

Amber says "Anything else on Astral?" 

Lisa Cooper says "nothing here" 

Roy says "It'll be fun to track down all the places with defunct 
  barriers :)" 

Amber says "Not in the least :)" 

Roy grins 

Amber says "Ok, sorcery..." 

Roy says "Woo, I like it all :)" 

Amber says "I'm assuming the combat spells can be cast at whatever 
  damage level you whim at the moment." 

Lisa Cooper says "they can" 

Amber says "Which makes for a headache of a +sheet conversion" 

Roy says "There's no mention of personal spells" 

Hjal looks to Bert. "I know you don't want to do +sheet talk.. but 
  coming up with guidelines on how to bring the spells into Sr3 is gonna 
  have to be answered.. should be by us I think. 

Roy says "Not too bad Hjal..divide it up among single target and area 
  effect spells and spread around the other points" 

Amber says "Now or later, but it'll have to be done." 
Amber says "Not to mention expendible fetish no longer exist." 



Bert says "If we want to discuss that, let's put it at the end of the 
  queue and move on." 

Hjal nods. 

Amber says "Sorcery looks pretty much as it was with a few exceptions. 
  Learning and limits." 
Amber says "Dispelling is not a metamagic ability anymore." 

Roy says "No more magic theory skill" 

Amber says "There is Roy.. it's a knowlege skill now. Magic Background" 

Roy says "Yeah, but you don't need it to learn a spell" 

Hjal nods. 

Amber says "No, but they can be used as a complimentary skill." 
Amber says "So in essence, they can." 
Amber says "Every active skill has a corresponding knowledge skill that 
  is complimentary." 
Amber says "Or could be complimentary, depending on what they get." 

Lisa Cooper hmms.. "wait.. what is the point of this? just to read out 
  loud the new rules?" 

Amber says "Complimentary is like centering = every 2 successes gives 
  you an additional die." 
Amber says "In one aspect, ya. 4 ppl can read the same passage and come 
  out with 4 different versions of the rules :)" 

Bert says "The point of this is to determine if the new rules could be 
  considered malignent to our MUX, and if changes need to be made, if 
  so." 

Amber says "We are going through it from beginning to end, easiest way 
  to cover the facets?" 

Roy says "So, what we decide is going to be final eh? :)" 



Bert says "Well, Final in that it will be the rules introduced at the 
  convrsion. They are subject to change anytime after that." 

&GTFrom afar, Shiro Yamada thinks he prolly would, yes. =) 

Amber says "Any other comments about Sorcery?" 

Lisa Cooper says "sure.. but we'll get that when we get to spellcasting 
  :)" 

Amber says "That's under sorcery, spit it out :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "well... the entire system is changed." 

Roy says "What you roll is, yeah." 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Amber says "I have a comment about spells.." 
Amber says "And elementalists." 
Amber says "Fire elementalist only casts combat spells.. but fireball, 
  for example, is now a manipulation spell. Cast by Earth Elementalists. 
  I tried to find the rule saying elementalists can cast elemental 
  spells of their element, but never found it." 

Bert has given Elemenalists access to manipulation spells in their 
  element in the pasyt 

Hjal nods. "It seems like a logical house rule, if Fasa declined to make 
  it. 

Roy says "FASA should have just made a spell list for each. Lazy punks" 

Amber says "I'm just wondering if its there, and I just missed it." 
Amber says "And by extension, will Earth elementalists have access to 
  spells of elements other than earth? Like Fireball?" 

Roy says "We should scrap the category spells and make a list for each 
  :)" 

Bert says "No Hjal." 
Bert says "Only spells dealing in their element" 

Amber has disconnected. 

Hjal nods. "Acid seems a good candidate for Earth.. lightning/blast for 
  air, and so on. 

Bert says "Earth Elementalists will just need to be more creative.:)" 

Amber has connected. 



Roy says "I'll even make the list :)" 

Bert says "Guys, this is something that existed with SR2. I think we're 
  losing our focus here." 
Bert says "The focus is the changes between SR2 and SR3." 

Roy says "Why not fix the bad things when we switch over? :)" 

Amber says "Well, I disagree with the loss of focus thing, but arguing 
  about whether we're off track *would* take us off track ;)" 

Bert says "There is nothing good nor bad about this...You're talking 
  about optional rules which are periphery to our purpose" 

Amber says "Alright, back to the change in Casting" 
Amber says "It's a Sorcery dice test now instead of the F of the spell." 

Lisa Cooper nods. Sorcery + spell pool 

Amber says "it's a change that makes sense to me." 

Roy nods 

Amber says "The F is used for other things, typically resistance." 

Lisa Cooper says "me too.. I like it" 

Roy says "What if you have a concentrated skill?" 

Amber says "Such as?" 

Roy says "Well, sorcery into spellcasting..just thought about it, I 
  gotta look at all the new things that use iot" 
Roy says "it" 

Amber says "Then you use the concentrated value." 
Amber says "Concentrations and what can be concentrated on, changed a 
  bit in SR III." 
Amber says "It's aimed more at the ways the skill can be used instead of 
  types of things it deals with." 
Amber says "For ex Conjuring no longer has a concentration of Elemental 
  type." 
Amber says "It has Summoning, Banishing and Controlling as choices." 

Roy nods. I had something there, but it slipped my mind is all. I find 
  it later 

Amber says "Anything else on Sorcery?" 

Roy says "Ok, I remember." 

Bert says "Can a mage cast a spell higher than the spell's force?" 

Roy says "I'm a little fuzzy on the Sorcery concentration Spell Defense" 

Bert says "Can a mage cast a spell higher than forc that thy learned?" 

Amber says "It's an irrelevant question?" 

Lisa Cooper says "you mean with more dice than it's force?" 

Roy says "You can only defend a #of people equal to Sorcery skill(or 
  concentration) ?" 
Roy says "Ah, I see..you assign dice from the skill or Spell Pool for 
  defense" 

Amber says "You can cast with your full sorcery and spell pool (up to 
  your sorcery # of dice or what you allocated, actually)." 

Bert says "Jimmy the mage knows Firebolt 3. Can he cast a Firebolt 5 if 
  his Sorcery is 6?" 

Amber says "F has not much to do with how you cast the spell." 
Amber says "No." 

Roy says "But a spellcasting concentration is going to hurt you there" 

Amber says "He casts a Firebolt 3 always." 

Lisa Cooper says "but rolls more dice" 

Bert says "Ok, so the Force is an absolute limit of the force of the 
  spell." 

Amber says "Right." 
Amber says "Or you can still cast lower for lower drain I thought.." 

Bert says "Oh, Jimmy couldn't cast a Firebolt 1 either?" 

Amber says "If you want to cast it at a higher force, SR III tells you 
  to relearn it at that force." 
Amber says "Nope, 3 and that's it." 

Roy says "You can cast it lower Amber :)" 

Amber makes them blow up the city. 

Lisa Cooper thinks Roy's right 

Roy grins 

Bert chuckles 
Bert nods. 
Bert says "I think so too...At least that's how it was for SR2" 

Roy says "Page 178..They can cast the spell at a lower force, if 
  desired, but can never cast the spell at a higher Force then they have 
  learned" 

Amber says "Lower yes, higher no." 

Bert nods 

Amber says "Its under Sorcery - Definition of Force." 

Bert says "Ok. Anyone se any problem with that? If not? Let's move 
  in.:)" 
Bert says "Let's move onb too.:)" 

Hjal presses his 'Vote for Move On' button. 

Amber says "Ok, Conjuring..." 
Amber says "I think I see a discrepancy in something." 

Roy says "Pretty much the same isn't it?" 

Amber says "Hmmm?" 

Lisa Cooper says "well... it's similar. One rule change i've noticed for 
  shamans is that the spirit stays at a domain when the shaman moves 
  out" 

Roy says "Oh, now you can only hit an astral spirit with mana spells" 

Amber says "Pg 182, Astral Spellcasting, says you can cast spells while 
  projecting at any astral form, to include Spirits. Pg 189, Astral 
  Conjuring, says the only thing you can do to a hostile spirit in 
  astral space is engage it in astral combat." 

Hjal would think that the pg 189 thing is simply incorrect. 

Roy says "Well, I think they meant you can't attempt to control it or 
  banish it" 

Hjal nods. "They meant to say 'all you can do is engage in combat, or 
  cast spells on it' :} 

Amber says "I think." 

Lisa Cooper nods. I think they just ment that you can't balish them 
Lisa Cooper says "banish" 

Hjal nods. "Chalk it up as 'soon to be errata'd', and keep in in the 
  back of the mind in case it causes confusion? 



Amber says "Sounds good to me." 

Roy says "Also, elementals of opposing elements don't just subtract 
  force" 

Amber says "I'm trying to find the difference Lisa was talking about. 
  Spirits in a domain leave when a shaman leaves it's domain unless 
  carrying out a requested service." 

Lisa Cooper says "right.... that's what I ment." 
Lisa Cooper says "So you can leave a hearth spirit to guard your home, 
  for example." 

Amber nods, "Any other changes that stick out?" 

Lisa Cooper says "for elementals: remote services" 
Lisa Cooper says "you don't need to decalre 'em in advance" 

Hjal nods. 

Amber says "Handy" 
Amber says "Still uses up all remaining services tho." 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Roy says "So now you can wait until it has one left" 

Amber nods, "Makes more sense to me." 

Roy says "Cheesy :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "I don't think I recall seeing bonding an elemental to 
  a place... but maybe I just missed it" 
Lisa Cooper says "or was it in the Awakening/Grimoire?" 

Amber says "Bah. Nature spirits are helluva lot more useful.. makes 
  elementals a bit more useful." 

Hjal :) 

Amber says "That's in grim II" 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Amber says "On to Foci?" 
Amber says "Bleh, yeah, lots of changes there." 

Bert has disconnected. 



Roy says "Yep, some hard ones too" 

Amber says "Nothing that's not preferable to SR II &LTg&GT" 

Roy says "True :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "of course the biggest change is the absence of spell 
  locks and the sustaining foci" 

Hjal grins to Amber. "We've got the Mundanes/adepts using spell 
  sustaining foci question to answer :) 

Amber says "We toss that with SR III, gonna have too, unless they 
  justify it somehow." 
Amber says "I can't see them being able to use them, no matter what the 
  justification." 

Roy says "A magician could cast it into the focus, but again they can't 
  be turned off" 

Amber says "Your expendible spell foci are in here now instead of as a 
  limitation to the spell. They add dice." 

Hjal nods. "A magician could, but the mundane with the focus on his 
  person has no control over it. 

Amber says "That could come in handy, used against somebody. Hold em 
  down while we put a sleep sustaining focus on them!" 
Amber says "Ditto for adepts.. even if they can see it with astral 
  perception. (well.. they could remove it.. but not control the spell 
  it sustains)" 
Amber says "I didn't notice.. spell sustaining foci don't dissapear 
  anymore when they're placed, do they?" 

Hjal always thought that was cheesy with spell locks. 

Roy says "Spell locks are cheaper to bond :)" 
Roy says "Duh, weapon foci" 

Amber says "No kidding." 

Roy says "Power Foci work on like, any magic test. Spells, conjuring, 
  defense.." 

Amber says "Old question:" 
Amber says "You can hold a weapon focus, and not have it active, yes? I 
  beleive that's still true.." 

Bert has connected. 



Bert says "Anyone logging btw? :)" 

Roy says "Yeah, you have to activate all foci now before they can be 
  used" 

Amber says "But, can you hold it, and have it not active?" 

Roy says "Including expendable foci I would think" 
Roy says "I would think so Hjal" 
Roy says "Just like spell locks now :)" 

Hjal nods. "And the other one.. the proverbial physad with weapon focus 
  cyberspurs. :) 

Lisa Cooper says "power focus monowhip :)" 

Amber says "Ah, never mind. I found the answer." 
Amber says "Weapon foci add dice to whatever relevant combat skill." 

Bert says "Anyone logging btw? :)" 

Hjal isn't, but can backlog 

Bert says "Please? :)" 

Amber says "Logging" 
Amber says "We going to hold off any decisions on obsolete foci, until 
  MITS comes out?" 
Amber says "mmmmm such as?" 

Roy says "I don't think the new book will have spell locks" 

Amber says "Spell locks become spell sustaining foci, but what about 
  reusable fetishes, and fetish foci?" 

Roy says "Um, resuable are the same" 

Lisa Cooper likes that. Too many mages were walking around with 
  increased Rea and Increased Willpower 

Roy says "Fetish foci have become expendable foci" 

Hjal ahs. "Ya, I see." 

Amber says "I think they consolidated their foci rules into SR III, at 
  least the majority." 
Amber says "I still don't see way to ground through one." 
Amber says "Well the astral spellcasting rules say you can *target* an 
  active focus, there must be rules for grounding somewhere..." 
Amber says "By default an active focus is a target for a mana spell." 
Amber says "But what good is that?" 
Amber says "Drop an area affect mana spell through a focus, and 
  sleep/melt alot of brains in that room." 
Amber says "You can't." 

Roy says "Maybe there is no more grounding, you can only break the foci" 

Hjal missed where it says you can't. 

Lisa Cooper hmms.. foci, especially spell locks were very powerful so 
  they added grounding to balance it. Maybe now, when spell locks are 
  gone, they saw no need 

Roy says "Well, even if you overcome a focus it's not detroyed. You have 
  to suppress it" 
Roy says "To completely destroy it you have to make a charisma test" 
Roy says "Unless you destory it in astral combat" 
Roy says "Wait..that makes no sense" 
Roy says "Ah, I see. You have to overcome it through combat, then 
  destroy it with the charisma test" 

Amber says "Technically an astrally perceiving mage can drop a spell 
  onto an active focus, it's dual natured." 

Roy says "Dunno, maybe they didn't want grounding anymore :)" 

Hjal nods. "if an astrally projecting magician drops a spell onto a 
  focus, the spell grounds into phyiscal space, just like Sr2, yes? Only 
  in Sr3, this doesn't destroy the focus. 

Roy says "There is no mention of grounding spells" 
Roy says "I don't even see mention of casting a spell at a focus, but 
  I'm probably just missing it" 

Amber says "No.. .there isn't. I think they tossed it out or may make it 
  a higher mystery." 

Roy says "Ok, I found it :)" 

Amber says "I find the removal of spell grounding to be very 
  distasteful. It's got to be in MITS, prolly right next to ritual 
  sorcery." 
Amber says "There are plenty of mentions of attacking foci." 

Roy says "have to use a mana spell in the astral plane" 
Roy says "Grounding was weakly justified anyway" 

Amber thinks if it comes out it will end up a higher mystery. 
Amber says "The looming, even if rarely used, threat of a spell coming 
  from no-where is key to keeping ppl from going overboard with foci. 
  Even if the sustaining foci can now only sustain weaker spells (until 
  ppl buy more powerful ones)" 

Roy says "Combat spells work from inside out of the target, but you can 
  suddenly attack a person through another object?" 

Amber says "With an area affect spell, definately." 

Roy says "Those aren't as bad" 

Amber says "Area affect spells don't target people you cannot see." 

Roy says "It makes more since now that foci are dual-natured" 

Amber says "Not mana area affect spells, at least." 
Amber says "It's the only thing you could use to affect something in 
  physical space besides the focus via grounding." 

Lisa Cooper says "except for elemental manipulation spells, Amber" 
Lisa Cooper nods 

Amber says "You can't target anything physically from astral space, they 
  make a hard point of that." 
Amber says "Unbreakable barrier there." 

Roy says "Yep, which would tend to rule out physical spells" 

Amber says "Targetting, and affecting, are different things." 
Amber says "With grounding, you target the focus." 
Amber says "You affect, the ppl in the area." 

Roy says "And you break the focus :)" 

Amber says "There is no grounding" 

Hjal thinks that just because they don't mention it, we shouldn't decide 
  it's gone. 

Roy says "Heh" 

Amber says "No more ritual sorcery either then? :)" 

Roy says "Nobody uses it anyway" 

Amber says "They redefined the rules for targetting completely, 
  however." 
Amber says "It's not that that don't mention targetting foci, they do." 
Amber says "And attacking them" 
Amber says "Not like Ritual Magic, which has no mention anywhere." 
Amber says "Well, I'm flatly gonna resist removal of grounding. Until 
  it's printed, (or continues to be absent from MITS) that you can't do 
  it, I say you still can." 
Amber says "What are our 'Go back to' subjects? Adepts and Astral 
  Damage?" 
Amber says "Add Grounding to it?" 

Hjal nods. 



Roy says "What grounding? :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "we're not done with the regular subjects yet, IMO" 

Amber says "Ok, back to Foci in general." 

Hjal gahs after reviewing notes. "I have a thing for sorcery too, after 
  Lisa :) 

Amber says "Uhmmm ok?" 

Hjal looks to Lisa. "Go ahead, unless you're not ready." 

Lisa Cooper says "are we done with Foci yet? and into spells?" 

Amber says "Spells would be under sorcery. :)" 
Amber says "No, spells are after foci in the books. Last part of the 
  chapter." 
Amber says "Ok, since I'm the out of time one lemme get it out of the 
  way." 

Lisa Cooper says "ok" 

Amber says "ok?" 
Amber says "Learning spells. You can take the exclusive modifier to make 
  learning easier under Sr3." 
Amber says "Right?" 

Lisa Cooper says "or to learn it so the drain will be smaller" 

Amber says "Later on, when mage is in a time stop, how to tell if that 
  exclusive flag on the sheet means he learned it easier, or he now gets 
  to cast it higher force? We gonna ban exclusive for learning bonus?" 

Roy thinks you have to learn it with lower drain or higher power 
Roy says "Make a gmnote" 

Hjal thinks we should make new flags for the +sheet, imo :) 

Lisa Cooper thinks that the +sheet will be changed anyway... with more 
  differances than just adding new flags 

Roy says "They should have drain on them for spells, as well as TNs" 

Amber says "But that's what I had. On to spells :)" 

Roy says "One more point on foci.." 
Roy says "Using an expendable focus with a spell is an exclusive action" 
Roy says "To activate it" 

Amber points something out. "If a spell is marked as exclusive or fetish 
  limited, and affects the drain, the number afterwards will be 
  different than the number before it (or vice versa depending on how 
  they format it). if it was used to make it easier to learn, both 
  numbers will be the same. 
Amber says "But if you exculivfy a spell, the code automatically ups the 
  force ;)" 
Amber hasn't had to deal with that yet. 

Roy says "The code will be changed" 
Roy says "Germany did it already right?" 

Lisa Cooper says "Germany are 100% SR III" 
Lisa Cooper says "or rather IS 100% SR III *baps self*" 



Amber says "Alrighski... Spells?" 

Lisa Cooper says "Okey... a couple of things I'd like to point out" 

Hjal hoorays that they said all hostile spells get a resistance roll. "I 
  hated Transform." 

Lisa Cooper says "Transform has a resistance roll... but I was getting 
  to that, Hjal :)" 
Lisa Cooper says "Petrify has a Threshold of half the victim's body. 
  Does Threshold mean that you need that number of succeses?" 

Hjal nods. 

Amber says "You need to get *more* than that number, actually." 

Lisa Cooper nods 
Lisa Cooper says "anyway... in my TT we changed spells in the Grimoire 
  (like Transform, for example) to work like that as well. I think it's 
  a good house rull 'till MITS comes out" 

Amber says "Transform isn't in Sr3, but I'd put a threshold on it too. 
  *nod to Lisa* :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "it's in the Grimoire... I asusme all spells in Grim II 
  are valid until MITS comes out?" 

Roy says "Alot of them are in SRIII :)" 

Amber says "Well, unless they're combat spells with a set damage code, 
  or obsolete.." 

Bert says "Can we look at spells taht are in SR3? Like Heal for 
  instance? :)" 

Amber says "Like hellblast.. no need for it. Fireball can be cast at 
  deadly if you like now" 

Bert says "Big changes there.." 

Roy says "Why? Heal works the same as it does here now" 

Lisa Cooper nods. "Of course... my point is - we'll need to review them, 
  see if we can need to change them or discard them, etc" 

Bert says "Looks like they adopted our old house rule" 

Lisa Cooper says "Treat doesn't" 
Lisa Cooper says "The TN is now 10 - essance, not 8" 

Roy says "Hm.." 
Roy says "The drain is less" 

Amber says "Which one is, Lisa?" 

Lisa Cooper says "just less drain" 

Amber says "Ah." 

Bert says "Jen killed our old House rule saying it was unfair." 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Bert says "But looks like FASA adopted it" 
Bert says "So..." 



Roy bets Roger thought it was unfair 

Bert says "What to do? :)" 
Bert grins at Roy.:) 
Bert says "Be good.:)" 

Lisa Cooper says "we follow FASA's rules?" 

Roy says "I think you have to allow things like totem modifiers for 
  healing spells to be added to force for that purpose" 

Lisa Cooper says "otherwise... people will just learn Heal 1. No point 
  of learning it at higher forces" 

Roy says "What about things like power foci..spell category foci, 
  specific spell cofi.." 
Roy says "foci" 
Roy says "I agree that spell pool die shouldnt allow you to heal more, 
  but foci should." 
Roy says "At least any you bond with" 

Amber says "Uh uh, they just make it easier to cast." 

Lisa Cooper doesn't agree with Roy's previous point (allowing totem mods 
  to raise force) 'cause then the +2 to combat spells, for example, will 
  be VERY powerful. 

Amber says "And may well help reduce the time it takes to heal somebody, 
  but not how much." 

Roy says "No, not the force, but the force as in terms of how many boxes 
  you can heal :)" 

Amber says "The totem mod wouldn't rais the force, just the max amount 
  the spell can heal by +2 boxes" 
Amber says "Uh uh, no reason to buy more than Heal 1, then." 
Amber says "Same difference" 
Amber says "It's not a resisted spell" 
Amber says "if I understood Roy's idea" 

Roy says "Well, you can learn Heal 6 or bond oddles of foci" 

Lisa Cooper says "that doesn't make sense, Hjal... why have it change 
  the force of a healing spell and not of a detection or combat spell?" 

Amber says "It wouldn't change the force" 

Lisa Cooper says "that's what force means in heal" 

Amber says "Not recommended." 

Roy says "I don't want the spell to be more effective Lisa, just loosen 
  up the max boxes you can heal" 

Lisa Cooper says "Well... the force of Heal IS how much boxes you heal. 
  No other meaning" 

Bert says "How about leaving the bonus to extra dice, and if we find 
  that the boxes are a problem, we could change it later?" 

Roy says "Got a point" 

Hjal nods. "Change the text of the heal/treat. Max boxes you can heal is 
  the force of the spell, plus a number of boxes equal to the number of 
  bonus dice from totem for healing spells, if applicible 

Lisa Cooper doesn't agree... that would be unfair for people that have 
  totem modifires that aren't health 

Roy says "Well, if you give it for one, ya kinda have to give it for 
  all" 
Roy says "However..." 
Roy says "The extras successes can go into making the spell work faster" 

Lisa Cooper says "right... or to resist drain" 

Hjal nods. 

Roy says "Which is better then nothing" 
Roy says "Drain?" 

Lisa Cooper says "I mean... if you put 2 less pool points into the 
  sorcery test and into drain resistance instead" 

Amber says "Ah, I have a healing spell question after this one." 

Roy says "Aha, gotcha :)" 

Amber says "Ok?" 



Amber says "Can only heal mojowise once on the same set of wound, 
  barring professional medical care and all that. We supposedly have 
  docwagon pcs, and street docs.. we really should define that better." 
Amber says "Can a magician street doc cast heal again, since he's a 
  'professional medical provider', or will they have their own spells?" 
Amber says "I don't follow." 

Lisa Cooper says "basically it means... if you were healed, you can't be 
  healed again. If were healed down from S to M and then got up to S 
  again, you can't be healed lower than M" 

Roy says "You HAVE to use the magic first" 

Amber says "What she said" 
Amber says "All fast healing precludes the body type healing rolls by 
  the nature body type healing rolls are made. For the long term." 

Hjal nods. "If your runner buddy casts heal on you, and heals one whole 
  box, the hospital, can somehow, use mojo to heal the rest. I'm saying 
  we need to say how they do that. 

Amber says "If at any time they get healed, things change and the rolls 
  have to be redone." 
Amber says "because PCs can't do it." 
Amber says "They don't do that." 
Amber says "But we have PC docs, so some can." 

Roy says "Whoa, slow down. Start over :)" 

Amber says "If they could cast spells :P" 
Amber says "If your buddy only heals one box, you're SOL for more mojo 
  healing." 

Roy says "None of that makes any sense at all" 

Lisa Cooper says "hmm... Hjal have a point. Supoose your buddy, the lowy 
  mage, heals 2 points. Then a really wiz one comes and can heal 4. You 
  should allow healing 2 more boxes." 

Roy says "In SRII that wouldn't work, but mundane healing did work that 
  way" 
Roy says "I think..bleah" 

Amber says "Ok, lemme start over." 
Amber says "If you get a healing spell on you, you're screwed if the 
  spell fizzled or didn't do a good enough job. Heal and treat can't be 
  used again." 
Amber says "On those wounds." 
Amber says "How-freakin-ever...." 

Roy says "It says: A character can only be magically healed once for any 
  single set of injuries" 

Amber says "I'll wait till this is finished then bring up something." 
Amber says "'Professional Medical Care' that can provide magical 
  healing, *can* use mojo again on them." 

Lisa Cooper says "it says so?" 
Lisa Cooper says "where?" 

Amber says "It doesn't in the description." 
Amber says "in anycase, I ran into this already.. here is what I did, 
  because I want(ed) the charactes to have the full benifit of healing 
  up." 
Amber says "it was in the Sr2 book in the chapter that had the normal 
  healing, I'm looking there in the Sr3 version now." 
Amber says "I allow multiple healing attempts on the same wound set at a 
  +2 TN (Cumalitive) irreguardless of who cast's it, with no results 
  unless more successes are gained. But...." 
Amber says "The circumstance I was dealing with dealt with SR II rules 
  where each spell is a different category ie Heal L , Heal M, Heal S. 
  You needed the appropriate level spell to begin with." 

Hjal nods. "My own opinion was that the NPC 'professional docs' learn a 
  wide variety of spells that are nitpickly precise, and only usable on 
  certain body parts/wounds, and so are unappealing for runner types to 
  learn. However, they can be cast regardless of previous magical 
  attemtps. 

Amber says "It wasn't heal, it was Cure Disease, actually." 
Amber says "What, you think somebody is going to come along with a Cure 
  Concussion F6 spell?" 

Hjal nods. "And only a doc would bother learning it. 

Amber says "Would be neat to see." 
Amber says "A runner would rather learn a spell that is applicible to 
  any wound." 

Lisa Cooper nods. Makes sense... if I'll take an RL example: A runner 
  will be like the person giving the first aid, then that person is 
  taken into the hospital where they can do operation and use all sort 
  of neat stuff to fix 'im up. 

Amber says "Things like 'Mend Femur' and 'Unclog Aorta'. Specialized 
  medicine to the extreme.. and usable on top of the generic 'beginner' 
  healing spells." 
Amber thinks those would be manipulation spells. 
Amber says "Interesting rationale." 
Amber says "We could design a whole slew of healing rules. I think it's 
  excessive though." 

Roy says "One spell per injury :)" 

Lisa Cooper agrees with Amber... Health spells don't other with the 
  'how', it just heals 

Bert nods and agrees. 

Hjal nods. "FASA didn't bother because you don't play Docwagon and 
  street docs. 

Roy says "If the shaman blows it, well, thems the breaks. Work 9-5 if 
  you don't like it? :)" 

Bert says "KISS method works best.:)" 

Amber says "And the generic medical care rules don't say the docs aren't 
  using magic on you." 
Amber says "Thinks one spell per injury cast by runners." 

Roy says "Ah, but they had that in one of the books. Playing docwagon 
  folks" 

Amber says "Docs can heal, even if your team mage already tried." 
Amber says "The rules are written around runners. No matter what 
  'alternate campaign' rules they've toyed with ;)" 

Roy says "And this place is about runners :)" 

Amber says "Well that's debatable ;)" 

Roy says "With weak attempts in other areas" 

Amber says "The best compromise if any is to only allow a healing type 
  spell of a F higher than the previous uses to try. And only succeed if 
  the success are more and perhaps as per repeated spell attempts at a 
  tn of +2" 

Roy says "I vote for the one attack, one magic heal attemtp" 
Roy says "I can live with that" 

Hjal likes the KISS principle too. "One try per PC. Blanket. NPC, or 
  street docs, can try once more on top. 

Roy says "What about PC docs?" 

Amber says "If they're spell casters, they can try, even if a pc already 
  tried. That's what I just said :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "Amber.. your rule makes sense, but I can't help but 
  feel that there's a loophole somewhere :)" 

Amber doesn't like her rule. 

Roy says "So..runner shaman tries, PC street doc tries, NPC real doc 
  tries?" 

Hjal No's to Roy. 

Amber says "I made that rule and exception for a specific plot" 
Amber says "one non doc tries, then a doc tries." 

Roy says "Oh, ok, NPC or street doc" 

Amber suggests the runners learn Stabalize and then hand em over to the 
  pros. 

Roy nods. "That's only for deadly wounds :) 
Roy says "But you're not requiring the street docs to know special 
  spells/" 

Amber says "Healing is severely abused as it is on the mux." 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Roy says "And she should know ;P" 

Hjal nods. "I don't know if we even have any mojo docs, I don't think 
  so, so its academic for now. 

Lisa Cooper suggests doing it as FASA suggested, and that's it. 

Amber says "ICly, my character could heal, but I've usually opted to buy 
  professional care." 
Amber says "Lisa, if we went FASA, we'd have to rechargen everyone who 
  wasnt' a runner :)" 

Roy says "Good :)" 

Amber says "Probably even going to rechargen them too." 

Bert says "Not exactly Hjal.:)" 
Bert nods to Amber.:) 



Amber says "FASA rules only cover one kind of capmaign." 

Roy says "Yes, but the rules are the same" 

Amber says "Everyone plays the same thing. Gangers, Mobsters, runners. 
  No mixes :)" 

Roy says "Mobsters aren't runners" 

Amber says "That's why the admins are here, with gmnotes, to flex things 
  a bit if need be." 

Hjal nods to Roy. 

Roy says "But they do the same kinda things" 

Amber says "And Amber, that'" 

Lisa Cooper thinks that FASA's rules make sense... if you wanna risk and 
  heal your partner without being skilled, know you may hinder the work 
  of pros. Like RL 

Amber says "And Amber, that's what I'm addressing. The 'docs' and 
  healing." 

Roy nods. "Good point Lisa" 
Roy says "That's why first aid for military folks is stop the bleeding 
  and that's it" 
Roy says "Let the experts sew him up" 

Hjal shrugs. "The simplest answer would be yes, to say the pros can't 
  help once the amateurs have touched them. But it takes away from the 
  pros, and also is awful rough on the players :) 

Roy says "Rough? This is a cyberpunk world Hjal :)" 
Roy says "Doctors can still stabalize a PC" 

Hjal will remember this convo the next time you think I'm being mean, 
  Roy ;) 

Roy says "Keep them from dying" 
Roy thinks he has nothing to worry about, because I don't do stupid 
  things in the first place :) 

Amber says "The precident we set with allowing specialist spells is not 
  a good one." 
Amber says "It would go to the point of somebody (A pro in cybertech) 
  trying for Nueral processor boost for wires. To get an extra +1 or 2 
  reaction points out of them." 

Roy says "And that's the real bottom line. We've already got TONS of 
  things to worry about before we start adding custom rules we really 
  don't need" 

Hjal nods. "Dangerous, yes. But, if we make a hard line between 
  specialists, and runners, it's not so bad. 

Roy says "What defines a specialist? A skill level?" 

Amber says "A simple status." 

Roy says "What about that runner out there with Biotech of 6?" 

Amber says "Runner. Doc. Yak." 
Amber says "Nope. A runner with biotech of 600 is still not a pro." 
Amber says "I think the runners should be aware of the risks (anyone 
  with the Healing spell is)." 

Roy says "Or the yak doctor with skills of 6?" 
Roy says "That's crazy Hjal" 

Amber says "Skill 8 is definitely a pro." 

Lisa Cooper says "Think of a list of 20 specialist spells, each one 
  works in only 1/20th of the cases. No player will 'em, unless he's 
  willing to spend lots of Karma and take 8 or so of these" 

Amber says "There are alot of crazy rules." 
Amber says "World class is professional caliber by far." 

Roy says "Why make more?" 

Lisa Cooper says "Roy... you don't like rules? go play WoD :)" 

Roy says "I LIKE the rules for the most part. Why don't we use them as 
  written if they work? :)" 

Amber says "Anyways, we've defined the difference in Heal between SR II, 
  House rules and SR III." 

Hjal nods to Lisa. "Very specialized spells is what would keep the 
  general playerbase from abusing the healing. 

Amber says "Because they don't work for non-runners." 
Amber says "They won't buy them and mages are some of our worst abusers 
  of the system." 

Roy says "Why not?" 
Roy says "Non-runners should go to the hospital :)" 

Amber says "Lisa's concern with +Willpower for Physads is a passing one. 
  Full mages do it anyways." 

Lisa Cooper says "there could be one magical doctor who'll only buy 
  these kind of spells. Will make hellofalotofmoney :)" 

Roy says "Heck ya :)" 

Amber says "Those NPCs exist." 

Lisa Cooper doesn't like the Increated Willpower spell either :) 

Roy says "Well, now they have to sustain them..adepts with attribute 
  boost isn't too bad" 

Lisa Cooper says "increased" 
Lisa Cooper says "or however... I can't spell this late :)" 

Roy says "It's the ever-present boost that kinda sucks" 

Amber says "No, Roy, they quicken them." 

Roy says "Well, if there is quickening anymore" 
Roy says "Now anybody can dispell quickened spells I'll note" 

Amber says "Let's leave Heal as is, it's not going to kill people that's 
  for sure." 

Hjal isn't talking about Heal spell. I'm not saying change *that*. :) 



Amber says "You can only use heal once per injury fine." 
Amber says "You can still get magical healing in a hopsital tho." 

Roy nods. "When we get the high priority stuff hashed, then we can work 
  on expanding :) 

Amber says "Not by the rules. If you cast Treat, Heal is not an option 
  later." 

Roy says "The Heal spells says one magic healing per injury." 
Roy says "Heal or Treat" 
Roy says "It doesn't say one HEAL spell or one TREAT spell. Magic 
  healing" 

Amber says "Those rules apply to *those* spells. Not all magical 
  healing." 

Roy says "It says magical healing period." 

Amber says "under those spells." 

Roy says "What other spells are there?" 

Amber says "NPC docs have a zillion healing spells." 

Roy says "This is not the time to be creating whole new spells and rules 
  for them" 

Hjal nods to Roy. "So.... 

Roy says "So let's leave it as it's written" 

Amber says "The other choice is to simply ban 'runners' from doing 
  multilpe heals, and letting the docs have another crack." 

Roy says "Wait..runners from doing multiple heals?" 
Roy says "They can't." 

Hjal nods. "That's what I'm saying. 

Amber says "But, if we make docs be able to do something because they're 
  'docs', and runners can't, regardless of their +sheet skills, you were 
  complaining about that being unfair ;)" 
Amber says "it's 'classes' in status, a slew of new spells, or fragging 
  over the professional docs. One of those choices." 

Roy says "No, I didn't say it was unfair, I said it was unworkable" 
Roy says "It's one wound, one spell. I don't see where you are getting 
  this proffessional doc stuff" 

Lisa Cooper says "how about the "There'll always be NPCs being able to 
  do stuff you can never hope to do, and that's that" rule?" 

Amber says "It's one Heal/Treat per wound. Not one spell." 

Hjal nods to Lisa, except that we allow PCs here to play what should be 
  NPCs in a TT game. 

Roy throws up his hands. "Fine fine, whatever. Let's add more crap on 
  top of the pile we already have, no problem :) 
Roy says "But if a street doc can heal again, then that doc needs 
  special spells" 

Hjal nods to Roy. 

Roy says "Enhanced Heal or something" 

Lisa Cooper says "have a healing-adapt! :)" 

Amber says "Makes sense, and if the doc is made to buy more spells, will 
  help keep him from branching out and being tempted to go on runs :)" 
Amber says "Which Element is that?" 

Roy says "And I'm not sure about dividing pros and non-pros based on 
  imagination" 

Amber says "As far as icy justification goes, since the spells are 
  specialized, one could argue that you need specialized gear with 
  them." 

Roy says "Nah, don't start adding spell components" 

Amber says "Or simply averting the whole argument, and saying the only 
  docs who can use these specialized spells are NPCs. All PC docs will 
  be mundane." 

Roy says "Is heal the last topic here? :)" 

Amber thinks that unbalances the mux (not a TT) in favore of orgs. 

Roy says "I need some fresh air and a cold drink :)" 

Hjal doesn't have another one. (unless we're gonna go into +sheet 
  conversion stuff :) 

Roy can't take that stuff tonight :) 

Lisa Cooper says "Well.. another change are elemental manipulation 
  spells" 
Lisa Cooper says "I like that... a fireball can hit you even if you ARE 
  hiding behind a sheet of paper" 

Roy grins 
Roy was always a big fan of the flamethrower spell :) 

Amber says "Who made a list of open items? :)" 

Roy thinks we have adept powers(costs and packages, etc)..barriers was 
  it? 

Hjal thought were were just gonna go with the costs as is for adepts.. 
  but ok :) 



Amber says "Adepts, astral damage, grounding are all that's open" 
Amber says "And heal, abandoned due to all round frustration? :)" 

Roy says "Astral damage was the Stun damage right?" 
Roy says "I think I can clear that one up" 

Amber says "Damage to the body is always physical.. if that's what you 
  mean" 

Lisa Cooper says "Astral damage? you mean damage to the uncon body?" 

Roy nods to Lisa 

Amber says "And it's effect on the astral" 

Lisa Cooper says "well... I thought we agreed to use the semi-overflow 
  solution." 

Roy says "I think you have to do physical damage to the body, stun 
  doesn't do anything" 

Amber says "You take both stun and physical to your astral form.." 
Amber says "Ok, wasn't sure." 

Roy says "Stun damage is fatigue right?" 

Amber says "deadly stun disrupts, deadly physical is deadly physical :)" 

Lisa Cooper says "the only question is what happens when the physical 
  body dies" 

Amber says "That's in the rules." 
Amber says "The spirit roams free... wailing and dragging chains. For 
  however much longer the essence holds out :)" 

Roy says "Well, when you project you always take physical damage from 
  spells, because you do not have the resources of your physical body to 
  draw upon" 

Lisa Cooper says "Amber - there's a problem with these rules" 

Amber says "Well you can apparently take stun damage somehow, or they 
  wouldn't bother to define what happens when you take deadly stun." 

Lisa Cooper says "If physical damage to the body transfers to the astral 
  form, than Deadly damage to it, should disrupt the astral form, 
  right?" 

Roy says "So, that leads me to think that the body is 'disconnected' 
  partialluy" 
Roy says "Hjal, that's for your astral form" 
Roy says "You can take stun damage in the astral plane" 

Amber says "I thought that's what we had begun talking about" 
Amber says "Sowwy" 

Roy says "But you can't do stun damage to the body, and it transfers 
  over" 

Hjal nods. 

Lisa Cooper says "wait... so my problem is still not solved:" 

Amber says "Stun damage to the body comes out as phys damage." 

Roy says "No" 
Roy says "It comes out as NO damage" 

Lisa Cooper says "Does D physical damage to the body disrupt or not the 
  astral form?" 

Roy says "I don't think it does Lisa" 

Amber says "It's interesting." 
Amber says "Damage carries over both ways.." 

Lisa Cooper says "so.. what does it mean when they say that physical 
  damage transfer to the astral body?" 
Lisa Cooper says "See... there's my problem" 

Roy says "Lisa: If a guy shoots your body, it hurts your astral form." 
Roy says "Well, I see now." 

Amber says "But it says that you don't die when the body does. So what's 
  the tn penalty? +4? Or still +3 for serious, while doing actions?" 
Amber says "A D PHysical Damage doesnt disrupt the astral form." 

Lisa Cooper nods. So you just have +4? 
Lisa Cooper says "then what? a L hit kills you?" 

Amber says "your astral form took deadly damage when the body did, but 
  it's still alive.. with 10 boxes o damage." 

Roy says "10 boxes of damage would be a deadly wound to an astral form 
  as well" 

Hjal shrugs. "I'd assume so Lisa. Don't think there's physical overflow 
  for an astral body :) 

Roy says "Why wouldn't you die? :)" 

Amber says "The text plainly says you do not." 

Roy says "The rules suck for astral damage :)" 
Roy says "But it's a contradiction" 

Amber says "You live on for however much longer your essence woulda held 
  out." 

Hjal nods and shrugs. 

Roy says "The text also plainly say one magic healing per injury right? 
  :P" 



Amber says "For heal/treat :)" 

Roy says "No, MAGIC HEALING" 

Lisa Cooper thinks they just tought "hey... wouldn't it be neat to have 
  astral forms of dead people flowing around seeking revenge" so wrote 
  it in without much thinking 

Amber says "Lets save it for when it comes up again ;)" 

Roy says "They didn't edit it when they changed astral damage is the 
  problem" 

Amber says "Well, that's how it worked in Sr2, I beleive." 

Roy says "Let's face it, FASA doesn't think about alot of things they 
  do" 

Hjal nods. "So, to come up with an answer. You float around with +4 tn, 
  and any additional damage kills you? 

Roy says "Maybe the astral damage should stay SRII rules until they fix 
  it?" 

Lisa Cooper waits for the official SR-III FAQ to come out :) 

Amber says "Or you're unkillable for that time (not a good idea at all)" 
Amber says "Or you simply don't float around? :)" 
Amber says "You could split the wording." 

Lisa Cooper says "how about just remove the astral damage rules and 
  that's it? You can't get hurt while in Astral. That should solve all 
  problems" 

Amber says "transfer and suffer are two different things." 

Hjal likes that the damage goes both ways. 

Roy nods. 
Roy says "It's a mess :)" 

Amber says "Damage transfers and manifests between the two. But is not 
  suffering." 
Amber says "Take the boxes, but not the TN, you mean Amber?" 
Amber says "Suffering, occurs only to damage given to the Astral form." 
Amber says "Or vice versa?" 

Roy says "Well, what happens when you return? You have the same amount 
  of damage, not double" 

Amber says "The damage goes both ways." 
Amber says "But only i fthe astral form suffers a direct attack giving 
  it D stun will it disrupt." 
Amber says "And the pc is still deadly stun.. there's no reason to split 
  hairs on that." 



Amber says "Then make it simple. Damage flows both ways." 
Amber says "So we have the dead body, living astral form problem." 
Amber says "They are one and the same." 
Amber says "The living astral form, has what status? How much damage, 
  and what penalties?" 
Amber says "Or are you wanting to make a house rule, that if the body 
  dies, so does the astral form?" 

Lisa Cooper says "that'd suck :)" 

Amber says "It suffers no damage from the attack that killed it." 
Amber says "The link is severed at that moment." 
Amber says "You can't even go find your body" 
Amber says "The link isnt there anymore." 

Lisa Cooper says "that make sense" 

Amber says "So what about damage it previously had. If someone beats 
  your body for 9 boxes, then kills you, is your astral form at no 
  damage, or 9? The body's gone..." 
Amber says "It still retains previous damage." 
Amber says "Why?" 
Amber says "Because the link existed." 

Hjal interesting rationale. "And an elegant answer." 
Hjal shrugs. "It works. Dunno how fair tho :) 

Amber says "It's not a perfect world. They can still heal their astral 
  form." 

Lisa Cooper says "Amber... problem:" 
Lisa Cooper says "There's overflow damage" 
Lisa Cooper says "10 doesn't kill you" 

Amber says "10 what?" 

Lisa Cooper says "boxes of damage" 
Lisa Cooper says "but it still distrupts the astral form" 

Amber idles to read SR III damage rules. 
Amber says "It's 10 boxes of physical, not stun damage." 

Lisa Cooper says "so.. if someone goes from S to +3 overflow..." 

Amber says "You can't disrupt the astral form, since you can't do stun 
  damage to the body." 
Amber says "*That* bit, I had a problem with, but oh well ;)" 

Lisa Cooper hmms.. anyway, I vote on 'move on' :) 
Lisa Cooper says "it's getting late" 
Lisa Cooper says "or rather... early :)" 



Amber says "We gonna have a meeting dedicated to giving directives on 
  code changes and direction on what's allowed for +sheet changes?" 

Hjal :) 

Roy says "Gah, don't say 'giving directives on code changes'" 

Hjal did that on purpose.. mostly because no coders are here. 

Roy says "The BCS will crucify you" 
Roy says "I'm a coder" 
Roy says "Just a lowly one :)" 

Hjal wonders if Bert snoozed off. 

Amber blehs. "Where are we?" 



Amber says "Trying to wrap up." 
Amber says "Figure out what we have to do yet." 

Roy says "Where in nutball land" 

Amber says "Uhh, I wouldnt worry about code changes. They'll for them 
  when they want them." 

Roy says "We're" 

Amber says "Same 3 issues, still open?" 

Roy needs a smoke real bad for the first time in months :/ 
Roy says "Damn you people :)" 
Roy says "I think so" 

Hjal has gotten mushiebrained too. "What are the 3 again? 

Bert sliced his thumb open on a knife...Gonna be outta it for the 
  duration. 

Lisa Cooper thinks that we came up with good solutions to the astral and 
  healing problems. So they're not perfect, but still 

Amber says "How about this, rules from other sections that apply to 
  Mages, that are different?" 

Roy says "Adept, Astral Damage, Grounding" 

Amber says "What did we decide on for Astral Damage?" 
Amber says "We didn't." 
Amber grins. 

Lisa Cooper says "We didn't decide... but I thought Amber's last one was 
  good" 

Amber says "Ok, let's set those three up and any rules from other 
  sections that affect mages for the next and hopefully final meeting?" 
Amber says "And anything forgotten." 

Lisa Cooper nods 

Roy says "Sounds good to me" 
Roy says "Somebody email FASA :)" 

Amber says "Ya, except for the circumstance of 10 boxes not killing :)" 
Amber says "This time, try and make a list of the changes we pointed out 
  and compile them into a @mail?" 

Roy says "I gotta run..somebody let me know the time and date of the 
  next meeting? BTW, Mondays are out for me" 

Amber says "Mmmm, ok, Roy" 

Roy waves, I'll be back in about hour I think 

Amber says "I'll need this log and I will just do the compiling myself." 

Lisa Cooper says "would REALLY rather it is on thursdays or fridays" 

Roy has disconnected. 

Amber says "Night, day?" 

Roy has left.
