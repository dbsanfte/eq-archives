      <p>Overview: This News file is written in a Question &amp; Answer format 
        and is geared for complete newbies to the commands of the Matrix. It is 
        important to note that while this seems like a lot to read, it's mostly 
        'padding' to make it flow better, so don't be scared off:) Enjoy and good 
        luck. <br>
        <b><br>
        What are Matrix Terminals? </b><br>
        In the late 20th century offices would often use 'Dummy Terminals', these 
        were merely computer screens and keyboards that were wired via a network 
        to allow people access to files, without the massive expense of a full 
        setup. Matrix Terminals are merely the 2060s version of those, enhanced 
        slightly to allow them to handle the complex imagery. These low powered, 
        small optical drive machines (typically 5-10 MP) allow users to access 
        the Matrix in a userfriendly fashion, without worrying about all the gimics 
        of high tech devices.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How can I get a Matrix Terminal?</b><br>
        Simple, go to your friendly electronics store and buy a Desktop computer 
        with 5-10 MP of memory, it should only cost you about 100-200 nuyen. <br>
        If you live in a nice enough place (Middle or higher lifestyle area) you 
        can get reimbursed as well. That's all there is to it.<br>
        <br>
        <b>How do I use a Matrix Terminal?</b><br>
        Ah...the real meat and bones of the whole concept. This is a multiple 
        step process, which I shall attempt to describe below....<br>
        <br>
        -=Preparation=-<br>
        Locations: You can go to 6 different locations, 3 'public' and 3 not so 
        public.<br>
        <br>
        **SeaSource**: Seattle Source, a corporate sponsored area that you can 
        go to for basic information regarding the city (sorry boys and girls, 
        nothing illegal).
      <p>**CARL**: Computer Aided Research Library. Think of this as a huge neighborhood 
        library which connections to libraries around the world.
      <p>**Opposition**: A virtual bar, a nice, private place to get together 
        and have those chats. Now you can _virtually_ pose: Players sips his drink.! 
        (hehehehe)
      <p>**Shadowland**: Often thought of as only a rumor, Shadowland is a data 
        haven for rumors and information about the shadowy underworld of Seattle. 
      <p>**Hiring Hall**: In connection with Shadowland, Hiring Hall is a place 
        where those not so legal activities can be advertised discreetly.
      <p>**Magland**: Similar to Shadowland, but this caters to those magically 
        active and magically curious. As 'illegal' as it seems notable professors 
        and world leaders on magical causes have been known to post there.<br>
        <br>
        The first three locations will be automatically set when you jack into 
        the <br>
        system, the last three you will have to do some work for. Shadowland/Hiring 
        Hall and Magland are 'secret' locations, which change often and can be 
        found via one of two ways.<br>
        <br>
        +data havens roll &lt;'ml' for magland, 'sl' for Shadowland/Hiring Hall&gt;. 
        Or contact an MJudge.<br>
        <br>
        Either way you'll (hopefully) get a four-digit number back. When you get 
        <br>
        that address you have to set it with a simple command:<br>
        <br>
        +set (shadowland/magland) address * : where * is the address. If you enter 
        shadowland, it will also set Hiring Halls address.<br>
        <br>
        Voila, preperations are complete, now let's go in.<br>
        <br>
        -=Going Places=-<br>
        (NOTE: If this is your first time using the computer, make sure you log 
        in <br>
        with 'login &lt;password&gt;' (The default password is 'password')<br>
        <br>
        1) type 'terminal *' to jack in. In place of the * put your Persona name. 
        <br>
        This is a one-word name which will be used within the Matrix (IE: Frog, 
        Goober, Fastjack, The_Neon_Samurai). Yes, you will note that with this 
        command it's possible to change your name often.<br>
        <br>
        2) After a few moments you will be jacked into the Matrix, sitting in 
        either the Seattle RTG or a local host (depending on where you are at). 
        Take a moment to look around and enjoy the sights. When you're done, you're 
        ready to move. The key method to moving about in the matrix to these six 
        mentioned locations is the 'SCGO' command. It is extremely easy to use.<br>
        <br>
        'scgo Seasource/Opposition/Carl/Shadowland/Magland/HiringHall' (pick one 
        of the names, ie 'scgo seasource').<br>
        <br>
        *Zap* you're there. Gotta love those high speed connections.:)<br>
        <br>
        -=Using those Places=-<br>
        When you get to these places, you can finally use their resources. The 
        primary method of information exchange is via a message board located 
        on these matrix systems. Using these is just as simple, with the commands 
        setup like the familiar BBroads. The commands are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        bbscan - This shows a listing of all the files in the host.<br>
        bbread &lt;FILE&gt; - This will display the contents of &lt;FILE&gt;<br>
        bbpost &lt;FILE&gt;=&lt;TEXT&gt; This will Post &lt;FILE&gt; with the 
        message of &lt;TEXT&gt;<br>
        bbreply &lt;FILE&gt;=&lt;TEXT&gt; This will reply to &lt;FILE&gt; with 
        the message of &lt;TEXT&gt;<br>
        <br>
        IMPORTANT NOTE: ALL &lt;FILE&gt; names MUST be one word.<br>
        <br>
        -=Leaving the Matrix=-<br>
        And leaving the matrix is just as easy.<br>
        'turn off terminal'<br>
        <br>
        That's it! All you needed to know about using the major resources of the 
        Matrix are right there. Any more information in this NEWS is simply advanced 
        information that is not necessary for you to have for the basic usage.<br>
        <br>
        -=ADVANCED TOPICS=-
      <p>***COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT COMPUTERS IS IN +CDHELP***<br>
        <br>
        <b>What if I happen to see another person within the Matrix?</b><br>
        This will happen on occasions, two or more people will appear in the same 
        matrix host at the same time. Treat it just like you would any other role-playing 
        scene, except you have to use a few different communications commands.<br>
        <br>
        Make yourself visible to others: '+unhide persona'<br>
        Looking at someone: 'v &lt;name&gt;'<br>
        Talking to someone: '' &lt;blah&gt;' (That is a Single Quote ' mark)<br>
        Posing: .pose<br>
        <br>
        <b>I don't like the Default UMS Description for my persona, how can I 
        change that?</b><br>
        'desc &lt;enter description here&gt;<br>
        <br>
        <b>What if I don't want to keep typing in my name?</b><br>
        This is simple, but will require a different command to log in. To set 
        your name type: 'name &lt;your_person_aname&gt; After you do this, to 
        login you must type: 'computer jack in telecom'<br>
        <br>
        <b>I had the Shadowland/HiringHall and/or Magland Address, but now it 
        doesn't work!<br>
        </b>Shadowland/HiringHall and Magland change locations about every five 
        or six days, you will need to do another data havens roll to find their 
        location and reset the address.<br>
        <br>
        <b>What if I wanna do X?</b><br>
        For more information that's beyond the scope of this news file, look at 
        <br>
        +cdhelp, that'll give you a LOT of information. In addition, the channel 
        <br>

        of Decker or Matrix related questions.<br>

        <b>Terminology:</b>
      <p>Persona: An 'icon' or represention of a computer user within the trix.<br>
        UMS: Universal Matrix Standards, these are almost completely gone these 
        days as corporations have switched to using customized graphical interfaces, 
        but some UMS icons (such as a default persona) remain. These are 'generic' 
        models.
      <p>Host: A 'room' or place within the matrix that hosts something.<br>
        File: A message on the boards.<br>
        MatrixJudge: See God.<br>
        Coder: God's Savior.<br>
