      <p> TinyPlots (TPs, as they are largely referred to by most veteran MUSHers 
        out there) are the largest part of any MUSH's livelihood and usually the 
        ultimate goal or motivator of all activity on the MUSH. In short, a TinyPlot 
        is to a MUSH what a module is to an RPG, but it's a lot different in its 
        execution as well as its permutations. 
      <p>First let's take a look at TinyPlots in general. The usual TP, no matter 
        what the originator is, is founded on a basic premise: present a problem 
        or puzzle, outline the obstacles to solving it briefly, and that's it. 
        Unlike modules for RPGs, there is rarely any single solution provided 
        to a problem or puzzle on a MUSH largely because the dynamic nature of 
        a MUSH and the fact that a lot of the obstacles to solving your problem 
        will involve PCs and NPCs and organizations, and one can never tell or 
        predict how a PC or NPC will work (well, NPCs are pretty easy to predict, 
        in a general sense, when you run them--but there's no telling what methods 
        the players might use to solve things that might cause the NPC to do other 
        things than your carefully-laid plans.) Almost every TP that I have seen 
        follows this basic format, regardless of its origins. 
      <p>Now, on to the different types of TPs and how to integrate them into 
        the ShadowRun MUSH genre best, or how to get involved with them. First 
        we'll take player TPs. Player TinyPlots are <b>not</b> TP ideas suggested 
        to an admin, which eventually become admin-run TPs (discussed later), 
        but rather, TPs revolving around the players themselves. Examples include, 
        but are not limited to: Your PC's approved background contains a mentor 
        who beat him or her up at one point, and you want to seek him out; your 
        PC is part of the Mafia and you want to find out more about your enemies 
        the Yakuza; your cat is lost and you miss it; you want to be initiated 
        into a gang; you've just discovered that your lover works for the corporation 
        that killed your parents. These don't even really require admin intervention 
        or GM intervention for the most part, unless of course they involve NPCs 
        that the GMs need to run or create for the plot (the mentor is one example), 
        or an object that needs to be hidden even from you (your missing cat). 
        So if you want to run these things, be my guest. 
      <p>The purpose of the organizations on the MUSH is to do just this (cf. 
        the above item about the Mafia and the Yakuza), they are funded so that 
        they can provide cash to purchase the temporary assets (read: shadowrunners) 
        to discover this sort of thing or to buy the information they need, or 
        the equipment they might need, to effect these tinyplots. When you do, 
        however, run a complex tinyplot that might affect some large organization 
        or business or something fundamental outside of yourself and a few other 
        PCs, that's when you should contact a Plot RPAdmin who can tell you whether 
        or not the idea is feasible based on the information these admins have 
        collected on a lot of other tinyplots. They coordinate things that way. 
        Player TinyPlots are key to the MUSH. One complaint that we get a lot 
        is the lack of karma for roleplaying. Personally, I've got no objections 
        when a player @mails me or pages me (POLITELY) saying, "I just did X and 
        Y and Z, and this other guy/gal figured out Z and AA, so I would like 
        to submit a request for a karma award if you feel it warrants it." That's 
        the proper way to go about it. The improper way to go about it is, "I 
        did this and I should get karma! Why don't we get karma? This sucks!". 
        And you shouldn't make plots just to get karma, nor should you totally 
        go overboard with karma requests based on every little thing--if it's 
        significant, and you can objectively say that you think it might warrant 
        karma in a reasonable shadowrun game, then suggest that a karma award 
        is warranted. 
      <p>A little side note: NEVER EVER BUG A JUDGE AFTER A SCENE ABOUT KARMA 
        AWARDS. We know all about karma. We will award it as neccessary. Of the 
        30 or so times I've judged a scene and had players page me, "Will we get 
        karma for this?" or "When will you award karma?", only ONCE was it warranted 
        insofar as I had forgotten, the other 29 times, either no karma was awarded 
        or I was too busy with the denoument of the scene and was planning on 
        awarding karma later. If a few days pass after a scene and you still haven't 
        gotten any karma, a polite reminder is appropriate. Other than that, though, 
        please--don't disturb the judges. 
      <p>Admin TinyPlots. There are people who have said that these are not neccessary, 
        which makes me laugh slightly. Why do we have them? Because no one usually 
        wants to play the villain, or the bad guy. Admin tinyplots are usually 
        MUSH-wide, and they are usually open to anyone who is keeping their eyes 
        open and is in a certain place at a certain time, or takes it upon themselves 
        to investigate things. The plot hooks are out there, and many is the time 
        I have worked with various organizational PCs to get them to start a TP, 
        or fed information out over streetwise channel or ***Network 23*** or 
        Shadowland that relates to a TP, or fed info to a fixer. Watch these sources, 
        and more. There's a lot of CRAP out there information-wise--if there weren't, 
        the plots would be obvious--but by the same token, you can find plot hints 
        just about everywhere if you look hard enough. And sometimes we take people's 
        backgrounds and play with something from in there until it's a TP. How 
        do you get involved in one of these TPs, you might ask? Get involved with 
        the MUSH and its PCs and eventually you will brush up against one of these 
        things. Stay in character and impress people, and you will be noticed--and 
        I don't mean totally go out of your way to impress them, but impress them 
        by being a good character. The more you RP and the more your RPing enhances 
        and spurs other people to react and RP with you, the greater your odds 
        of being "in on things" when their characters get involved in a TP thread. 
      <p>MegaPlots are not-so-tiny tinyplots. Things like this include the ongoing 
        Mafia-Yakuza rivalry, the Barrens Race Riots, and those PERSISTING rumors 
        that the Ancients are tied to the Tir. Not specifically involving an attainable 
        goal, or at least an easily attainable one, these are plots that provide 
        roleplaying opportunities in an environment reacting to a situation. Anyone 
        can at any time get involved in things like this depending on the character 
        and, while they're not usually karma-heavy, they're usually a lot of fun 
        to be in. And they can certainly be karma-heavy at the end. Let's say 
        there's a coordinated effort by a corporate PC or even a shadowrunner 
        to bring Shiawase Corporation down to AA status from AAA megacorporate 
        status. God knows this will take forever, if it's at all attainable, and 
        is a MegaPlot. It will probably have as its components several partial 
        tinyplots included in it. Take the ongoing rivalry between Ares Macrotech's 
        Knight Errant and Lone Star corporation for the contract for Seattle. 
        Those of you who have been around forever have seen bits and pieces of 
        this in the news (and there's a lot that's not in the news, chummers). 
        This is an ongoing MegaPlot. There have been (and will be) many plots 
        based around the political situation, damaging Lone Star by KE or LS damaging 
        KE, and everything else. The obstacles are myriad, and the goal is clear, 
        and who knows if it's ever attainable? It all depends on what happens, 
        now, doesn't it? 
      <p>These are my examples of the way that TinyPlots work, and at least how 
        I've seen them work on ShadowRun MUSH. There's a lot out there--if you 
        know how to look, and, if you can't find it--do it yourself!
