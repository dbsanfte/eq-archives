      <p>There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about racism, and the Humanis 
        Policlub in particular, on this MUSH. This should help to clarify a great 
        deal of misconceptions. <br>
        <br>
        The Humanis Policlub is not a 'human gang' as the Ancients are an 'elven 
        gang'. The Policlub is very different from the Ancients. It is much more 
        organized is an extremely powerful organization. It has powerful allies 
        (such as Alamos 20K, a large terrorist orginization, or perhaps the Yakuza). 
        It is not composed of a bunch of dullard racists that drink beer all day 
        and go and burn crosses by night. No, the Humanis Policlub is much different 
        than that. <br>
        <br>
        First, you must realize that MOST people in Seattle are in some way racist 
        towards metahumans. They've all had bad experiences with metas and they 
        don't forget it. Seattle is *NOT* in the politically correct world of 
        today. No, most people (including all of you humans out there) have some 
        sort of racist tendencies in one way or another. So do high level corp 
        executives, as well as lowly street squatters. The Humanis Policlub is 
        comprised of all different types of people.<br>
        <br>
        Think of all the contacts you could make. Think of all the powerful backing 
        behind the group. Think of all the power. Now, there are worries that 
        the same things that happened to the old Policlub members are going to 
        happen to the new ones. Don't worry, you don't have to act blatantly racist 
        towards metas. You can just ignore them, imply derogatory remarks every 
        once in a while, or maybe even interact with them (as your character realizes 
        that they may once in a while have to speak with them). In fact, you can 
        almost act like everyone else. <br>
        <br>
        By and large, the Humanis Policlub is more like the Christian Coalition 
        or the National Rifle Association of today. These are groups that do not 
        hold terribly universally popular opinions--and in fact, their opinions 
        are reprehensible to a lot of people--but they have a lot of political 
        clout. <br>
        <br>
        Joining the Policlub could reap great RP awards as well involvement with 
        many TP's. Joining the Policlub doesn't mean you have to act like Aries 
        (a legendary punk who hates all metas--very loudly and vociferously) or 
        you're an instant target. No, it means fun. :) Racism is always fun (but 
        only in ROLEPLAYING!!!) This is just a MUSH, and acting like a racist 
        here isn't going to mean you are in RL. It's just all part of the RPing 
        experience.
