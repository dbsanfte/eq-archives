NEWS DETROIT SITE HISTORY
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
 
The setting: The brisk evening air blows wild through the hibernating 
branches of the tree's surrounding the medium sized ranch style house.  A 
boy and his 4 friends muddle over piles of paper and scattered dice.  One 
of the boys who'm everyone called Lucifer sat behind a open notebook on 
it's standing edge.  Each person laughing and eating some form of 
Dorito's were all at the table for one common reason.  To play Shadowrun...
 
The reason: Lucifer sat at the table and gazed upon his friends and 
smiled.  "I love Shadowrun."  He loved Shadowrun so much.  Why?  So many 
reasons come to mind that it's hard to say.  The most prodominant of 
these being the creative thought process, the gathering of friends, 
sharing of ideas.  All these fit the glove.  
	Turning his head he surveyed his friends.  Havok stumbled over a 
LINUX Unleased book on or about page 600 or so.  His friend Tracey sat 
there laughing in a very odd way and drawing her character in stick 
figure art.  While Eric sat there filling his head with more Shadowrun 
information than Mike Mulhvill prolly knows.  
	During this time of thought Lucifer was attending school at the 
local community college along with Havok and Eric.  Havok and Lucifer 
each heading in the same educational direction.  CPS.  Eric off on his 
own world learning, Vulcanology, Intro to the Internet and History of 
Dinosaurs.  Oh..  He's a libral arts major.  Go figure. 
	Lucifer decided one day while playing on Shadowrun Seattle that 
this online experience was so great and shown him so many new ideas and 
aspects to the Shadowrun universe that it needed to be expanded.  Seattle 
was begining to become to small for it's exponential growth.  So the idea 
of California Free State was thrown into the mix as a prospect for a new 
Shadowrun Site.  Lucifer decided that the check points and playability 
and restrictions of the city made it to much of an unhospitable place.  
So after a few weeks of thinking he figured it out.  Detroit, MI.  Why 
Detroit?  Lucifer lived near Detroit and worked in Detroit.  The city has 
a upbeat edge and enough crime to fill the holes that society has left.  
A perfect setting for the next site.
	To make this site he knew while he could go it seperate of 
Seattle.  He would have no code support.  For systems such as the matrix 
and  astral that can become quite a headache.  Why would people want to 
play in your city when you don't have the code quality of Seattle?  They 
wouldn't.  So we needed to have Seattle hold our hand as we strived to 
get on our feet.  A post was mad one late December 96 night.  The post 
alerted hundreds.  The first man to speak up in a loud voice.  Shayd.  He 
asks a simple question.  "Why?"
	The question is answered with an open heart and Seattle offers 
it's help.  Sometime in December 96 Shadowrun Detroit goes up on a site 
provided by a friend of a friend.  Willie lets us use his site.  Time 
passes the site becomes to small for our needs.  We lose our home and 
roam the streets begging for room and board.  Megalinx take us in.  Only 
for a short time though as this place wants rent.  So then we go to our 
father of sorts.  Boss cat Morris.  He offers us a machine and all we 
have to do is pay for the electricity at a one time charge of 16MB of 
ram.  We pay and bingo we have a house again.
	Time goes on and things get shaky.  New staff and new ideas are 
coming to quickly.  The site begins to have growing pains.  Lucifer 
leaves for personal reasons and Dan takes control.  Dan and Geoff and 
their staff begin to make this place into a streamlined code enviroment 
with equal RP opportunity.  However as this new staff and hence new era 
come to their peak the troubles again persue the site like a hunter.  The 
site again goes through it's diffuculties.  Staff members leave for 
undisclosed matters and new faces step in to take their place.  A new man 
takes the stand.  Zeke.
	Zeke had been with the original staff since close to day 1.  He 
brings in his new staff and moves Dan's papers out of his desk.  This 
staff falls short though.  While stronger perhaps in Roleplaying ability 
it's code skills faulted and mayhem ensues.  Code falls apart on a daily 
basis.  Those who did have some remedial coding ability did their best to 
hold the site togeather and for a time did.  But the code patches began 
to stop up the plumbling.  Things got worse.  
	Now we come to today.  Lucifer has returned.  Taking the position 
as Head Director and asking Shayd for his services the site begins to 
take a distinct form again.  Code being repaired.  Spelling being fixed 
(Heh.)  The city again growns.  The familiar wind blows again through the 
humble december tree's outside Lucifer's new house.  This time last year 
he began a new idea.  This time this year he sets out to finish it.  He 
can't do it alone though.   He needs his friends.  He needs his staff.  
But even we can't make this place great.  We still need you.
 
So we go on...
 
Lucifer

NEWS ADMIN APPLICATIONS

        When a position in the administrative staff is open on Shadowrun 
MUX, we will post job openings on the General bboard with instructions on 
how to apply, and who to apply to.

        As a general guideline, in addition to other qualifications, 
potential staffers must have a minimum of three months experience as a 
player on Shadowrun MUX.

        If there is no opening posted, and you still want to help, 
please contact one of the Wizards and inquire if they need any help.

        Also, something to note, that MIGHT discourage some of you:  
 
            ROLEPLAYING STAFF CANNOT PLAY PLAYER CHARACTERS!

	Well, yet again a new staff has moved in and a few of the old have
moved out.  The current Co gods of the site are Lucifer and Gregg.  Since
the arrival of the new staff it's become apparent to the old and new that
while a general staff had good motivations, it simply does not work.  It
never has.  As a result of General staff we've encountered over 4K of 
objects that have been since @dest'd.  Finding multiple staff members 
creating the same code, all implementing it in different ways.  Not to
mention staff members serving their own ends, and stepping one another 
toe in general.  So that idea has been laid to rest and a organized staff 
structure has been revived.  This will eventually be replaced with bio's of
the staff members.  However, not everyone's title and or position has been 
hammered out.  Were working on it.

Breaktime Doughnuts <BD>;bd(#14EX)
Type: EXIT Flags: ANSI
A small shopfront, old looking. The sidewalk in front is swept clean, and the
large window looking into a cozy doughnut shop is free of smudges. 
'Breaktime Doughnuts' is painted on the window, and is over the clear

NEWS BUILDING ROOMS
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
All rooms MUST have the following attributes set:
        @Desc, &AURA
        &CREATOR, &STAFF_NOTES
        &SECURITY, &SECURITY_RATING, &MAGICAL_SECURITY
        &WHERE_PLACE, &WHERE_ZONE
 
Keep your descs clear and concise. Try to portray a complete image of the
room, including where exits and 'places' are. Please watch your grammar and
use a dictionary. This makes the job of the person inspecting your work 
much easier. A good practice is to write your descs/auras in your favorite
word processing program and run a spell check upon completion.
 
Auras give an accurate idea of the emotional content of the room. Remember 
an aura is the ONLY description an astral person sees, so make the main 
features of the room clear for them as well. See 'news building astral'
for more info.
 
CREATOR is you. Put your name here. Please use correct capitalization of
your name. eg. NakedBLDR

STAFF_NOTES is an attribute staff uses to note things about the room for
judging purposes. If there is something noteworthy that a staff member
should know about the room you can place it here, but the majority of the
time just set it to 'none'.
 
SECURITY is a listing for the Judges that explains in relative detail the 
security and other features of the room. Considering that Shadowrun is a 
violent world, this attribute is useful in the event combat or other 
nastiness occurs in your room. Statistics should be cleared with the 
appropriate RPAdmin. Remember, the more detailed you are, the better the 
chance of the Judge handling the call as you believe your building's 
personnel would.
 
SECURITY_RATING delineates Knight Errant response time and is a scale from 
AAA to Z. See 'news building secratings' for more info.
 
MAGICAL_SECURITY is the astral security of the room. It's like security 
for the netherplane.

WHERE_PLACE is for the name of the building. eg. You have a building called 
'The Palladium'. All rooms within the building should have WHERE_PLACE set to

WHERE_ZONE is for the current part of Detroit the building will be linked to.
eg. Downtown, Warren, etc..
 
- No rooms may be set JUMP_OK, under any circumstances.
- All these attributes MUST be set for a successful inspection. If you are
  missing attributes, you will be requested to add them before your building
  will be approved. PLEASE make sure ALL of these attributes are set on your
  room, as well as the required ones for your exits, before you request an
  inspection.

Breaktime Donuts(#449RXg)
Type: ROOM Flags: ANSI UNINSPECTED
This is a 20'x35' foot doughnut shop. There are small two person tables along
one wall opposite the counter with ten stools in front of it. Behind the 
counter is a small walkway, then a ceiling high wall of shelves of doughnuts.
Doughnuts of every shape and size. Several of the sections of flavors have 
fresh steam rising from them, adding to the almost cloyingly flavorful aroma
filling the comfortably warm interior of the shop. The shop is well lit with 
soft lighting, not the harsh flourescents so common in cheaper establishments. 
A doorway behind the counter leads back to the small, overworked bakery and 
fryers. There is a steady flow of patrons at all hours, greedily eyeing the
shelves of goods, and apparently the delivery boy has a heavy responsibility,
leaving the shop with an armload of syntagma boxes. There are always a few
cops in here, loaded onto stools, subduing a few doughnuts and a cup or two 
of the best hot caffeine drink on the block.

WHERE_PLACE: Breadline Doughnuts
SECURITY: This is a doughnut shop. Of course it's AAA response time. 
          Unofficially, of course. The cops will treat anyone who messes with 
          this shop -very- badly.
Aura: This is a 20'x35' foot doughnut shop. There are small two person tables
along one wall opposite the counter with ten stools in front of it. Behind the
counter is a small walkway, then a ceiling high wall of shelves of doughnuts.
Doughnuts of every shape and size glowing with sinful sweetness. Several of 
the sections of flavors have fresh steam rising from them like a happy sigh,
adding to the almost cloyingly flavorful mist of joy filling the interior of
the shop from 34 years of making people happy. A doorway behind the counter
leads back to the small, overworked bakery and fryers. There is a steady flow
of patrons at all hours, casting of a mixture of anxiety and anticipation, 
and apparently the delivery boy has a heavy responsibility, leaving the shop
with an armload of syntagma boxes and a stressed glow. There are always a 
few cops in here, loaded onto a stool, greedily subduing a few doughnuts and
a cup or two of the best hot caffeine drink on the block, glowing with a smug

When creating auras for Rooms and Objects there are a few simple things
to remember:
 1) Astral space is made of moods, emotions, textures and tones. It is
    perfectly alight to include feelings in your astral descriptions.
     For example:
        A person on the astral plane looking at a letter or sign would see
        the emotional content of the item, not the actual words.
 2) Man-made objects show up on the astral plane. They are generally
    shadows of the real thing, with magical influences showing up.
 3) Background count is important. A Room can have a general emotional 
    feel to it based on past events that have influenced the etheric space.
    However, permanent background count is very rare.  Please consult a
    magic admin prior to placing a permanent background count on a room.
 
Well thought out astral descriptions will add to overall quality of the MUX,
and you never know when you'll want to play a magician.

NEWS BUILDING COSTS
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
Having a building built for you by a construction company on the MUX costs 
the following amount in IC funds: 

LOW LIFESTYLE AREAS:
 
 Simple, one-story structure is 50,000 =Y=
     Rooms for buildings are approximately 20x20x12' and are 1,500 =Y=
     Each additional stories are 10,000 =Y= per floor.
 
 If a building already exists, adding to it has a 10,000 =Y= charge, plus
 room costs, etc. 
 
 RENTAL
 
 Rental costs are ten percent of the building's total cost PLUS any IC
 security a player wishes. 
 
 EXAMPLE:
 
 Joe wants to build a two-story house with four rooms.
 50,000 for the building
 10,000 for the second story
  6,000 for the four rooms
 Total is 66,000 PLUS any security costs. Rent for this building would be
 6,600 numen per month plus any security. 
 
 This is for LOW LIFESTYLE CONSTRUCTION. The following are price increases
 for other lifetime areas. 
         MIDDLE - LOW cost + 40 percent
         HIGH - LOW cost + 80 percent
         LUXURY - LOW + 160 percent.
 Please remember that the staff of the MUX will work with you on prices,
 and financing is available.

				 Rep
--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
     Deckmeister A comes up to me and says, "I'd like to place an order
from Decker Bob. A MPCP 6."
 
     Me: "Bob? Kewl guy, seen him around a lot. Okay, it'll be two weeks
before you get that gear."
 
     Deckmeister A comes up to me an hour later. "Got another order for
you, Another MPCP 6 from Decker Charlie."
       
	Me: "Charlie? Hrm, who's...oh, I know him. Been in the trix once or
twice. Okay. It will be four weeks before you get that."
 
     Could the availability times of MPCPs have changed from two weeks
to four weeks in the matter of one hour? Nope. Still the same old piece
from the same old people. So why does it take two weeks longer for
Charlie to get his? Simple: Charlie was not well known. Charlie spent
more time out of the trix then inside of it. He doesn't go out and explore
the matrix systems, figuring out the insides and outs of each. And he
rarely triggers, not from skill, but from lack of time.
     Bob on the other hand spends at least some time in the trix every
time he logs on, whether it is simply cruising the shadowlands or actually
exploring. He makes himself known, in the matrix ways, and is someone who
triggers, not from lack of skill, but excess time in there (it happens).

     Is it wrong of me to favor people who have been in the trix more then
others? No. Why? The deckers who are well known and actually WORK for a
living will receive bonuses. Deckmeisters will be able to grease palms,
"Hey, the guy who wants this btw...he's Bob." "Oh? I'll see what I can do
to help you out."
 
     So how does a newbie decker get up there? Get into the trix. Word
gets around, whether you see it or not. Rumors can do wonders amongst the
deckers. POST IN SHADOWLAND AND MAGLAND. Plus, if you aren't IN the trix,
sometimes those SHADOWLAND posts that talk about jobs might interest you.
 
Yes, there are jobs there, and elsewhere. And no deckmeister will go
hunting someone he/she has never heard of.
  
    Rep and experience carry a lot of weight out there in Matrix land,
and don't think I forget it. Those of you who haven't been in the trix
much or are not posting in the Lands are down, believe it or not, in my
ratings (although I still love ya all :b). There is absolutely no reason
you can not explore.
 
      So get out there and hack, cuz it may come back to haunt you.
 
Another factor that will tell your rep will be through the census rating.
Your census rating MAY effect how much a given job will pay. If your
rating is higher then others your pay should/may be more depending on the
situation.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
1. To see the help check out +cdhelp for decks, I strongly suggest you
read it all and if possible copy them down. If you own a computer you
should read the +lhelp PC, and make sure you set your computer OOC. Also
you should check out +casehelp and find out how your chipcases work.
 
2. Next the admin staff would like you all to help us out. We need you to
add yourself into our database. To do this just type +add me decker
****Warning **** if you have your deck and computer on and in same room
you must NOT log onto the computer. As this command will setup 2 database
entries. And you really make the matrix staff upset.
 
After you get all your matrix equipment it is VERY smart to type say
num(<object name>) and store all your objects DB#'s on yourself by typing
&var_objects me=<list of DB#'s>.  It comes in handy when something happens
and your objects can't be found,  it makes it so much easier to track them
down.

Hi there gang. Seems like they wanna get more people using the matrix....
of course we do :) More fun. I wrote this little tutorial up, but I'd like
to know what you guys thin. This is for beginners doing minor functions.
Since you guys trix everyday (we hope) I want you to look over this and
tell me mistakes, suggestions, or whatever via @mail. Thanks :) Much
appreciated.
 
Lots of people think that running the matrix is difficult. Well, yes,
it is. Deckers have to memorize LOTS of commands to do all the things they
need to do. However, that doesn't mean the matrix is off limits to
everyone else. Yes, even someone without a datajack, but with a desktop
computer, can manage to get in there and look around.
A desktop computer (available from vendors at a number of stores around
town) will grant someone access to the Matrix. With a few commands, you can
be up and on your way, AND not have to worry about ICE or anything like
that (unless, of course, you want to face it, but I wouldn't recommend that
on a desktop...)

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
Steps to getting Online
 
1) Persona Name and Description: You have to give your persona a name.
 
Simple command:
 
     name <what you want yourself to be called>
 
Then you have to get a description. That's just as easy with :
 
     desc <deck> <your description, remember, keep it computer like.>
 
Once those two steps are done, you're ready to jack in.
 
2) Going OOC: If you are using a computer, you should have it set OOC.
 
To make sure that you can make it through without triggering and having
to wait for a MJudge type:
 
     +deck set OOC
 
Nice command...but you're limited to moving, reading and writing, and
RPing.
 
3)Jacking in: First, make sure there are jack in points.
 
     +scan ports
 
If you see ports, you're in luck. The command with a desktop is:
 
     computer jack in <port name>
 
Page a matrix admin if you think there should be a port in your area.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
4) Communications: Once you're jacked in, you'll notice some things are
different.
 
Like...talking and looking. Here's the commands below:
 
     Talking: 'blah 
 
     Looking: v or v <object>
 
     Posing: .wave
 
5) Moving around: Moving in the matrix is different as well. In the matrix
there are three different types of nodes: Regional Telecommunications
Grids - RTG (like a country code), Local Telecommunications Grid - LTG
(like an area code), and Hosts, which are systems you can go into. It runs
RTG-->LTGs-->Hosts. To move you need to know these commands:
      
     sclogon RTG <hacking pool or 0 for none> <RTG four number address>
 
     sclogon LTG <hacking pool or 0 for none> <LTG four number address>
  
     sclogon HOST <hacking pool or 0 for none> <HOST four number address>
 
Some experience and time in the 'trix will tell you which command will be
needed where.
 
By the way, you'll note that LTGs are not listed from the RTG. The Detroit
RTG lists the sight of AccessNet, a public host system, but the rest, you
have to find. Ask your friendly decker for a host address that might be fun
(like SHADOWLAND and MAGLAND)

6) Files and Information: Ah, information, one of the most important
reasons for visiting the matrix. Files are put up in the Matrix almost
like a bulletin board...well, cuz they are in a since. You only need to
know a few commands to manipulate these information databases
	scscan file <hacking pool> - Let's you find files in the
system. Good one to start out with.
 
     scread file <hacking pool> <file name>
 
     screply file <hacking pool> <file name>=<Message>
 
     scwrite file <hacking pool> <file name>=<Message>
 
7) Logging Off: When you are all finished, there is one simple command.
 
     Graceful Logoff
 
     Running the Matrix isn't necessarily left up to just deckers. In
the numerous books by FASA in which deckers post, you'll see remarks from
Mages, Street Sammies, and even the average citizen. What you have here
(+deck set OOC) will allow anyone to do it. Sure, finding SHADOWLAND or
MAGLAND may be difficult, but if you REALLY want to find it, you will.
Either ask...or learn from word on the street. Be patient, and you'll
learn. Just remember that you can always join MatrixGeneral and ask a
question or use the ever friendly online help manual....+cdhelp

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
DO NOT DECK FROM HOME
 
Okay, so you got your house all set up. Your computer chips nearby, a
comfortable chair, your buddy to pull you out in case of trouble, etc etc.
You jack in to the trix to do some serious deck punching. What's wrong?
You're decking from home.
 
People, PLEASE! Use your head. If your hacking a system and get traced,
you're as good as dead. Go some place like Hojo's and rent a coffin, deck
from there. Might not be as comfy, but a hell of a lot safer.
 
DO NOT FORGET POSING
 
First off MJudges are sick of seeing none of you deckers RPing within the
trix. If anything you'd be RPing twice as hard. This is what you do. This
is your whole purpose on the MUX. If  anyone caught not RPing within the
trix while in a IC situation, they will be force dumped, giving them a nice
shock.
  
DECK IN CONTAINER
 
Do not put a deck in any bags or containers. If you do put it in a larger
container like a locker or such MAKE SURE YOU DROP IT before you try
and use it. For smaller bags and cases a deck will not fit in those, you
must use the deck conceal command instead.
 
MORE THEN ONE PROGRAM/FILE ALIAS
 
 If you have a desktop computer do not try and load a program that has the
same alias as a SOURCE code file you have designed.  DO NOT put the same
program or file in the same storage object <chipcases and chips I'm
talking about> that have the same alias or you will erase one of the copies.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
MORE THAN ONE CHIPCASE
 
DO NOT ASK FOR a second chipcase, 1 chipcase per person, there is too much
of chance you will mess up the chipcases as they will both want to do the
same code and it could really mess things up.
 
SAME PARENTS
 
Also remember desktop computers and decks have the same parents and do not
keep both in the same room or on you. If you must have both on you, DO NOT
logon to the computer.
 
MOVING PROGRAMS AND FILES
 
PLEASE when loading chips on your chipcase DO IT SLOW otherwise you will
loss information and mess up the chipcase. Also when moving a files off
decks DO THAT REALLY SLOW, there is a wait while it creates the chip if
you start another before the first is done it will really mess up both
files. Make sure the chip is on you before you to the next command.
  
SOURCE CODE ON OFFLINE
 
This is going to be the only warning, DO NOT put source files on offline
storage units, if your caught doing this you not going to like what
happens.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
TRADING PROGRAMS
 
Ok this is a reminder, if you do not own the program chip, you better not
have it loaded on your PC or deck. This is your only warning, IF YOU
DO NOT HAVE A CHIP FOR A PROGRAM, remove it from your storage. A few of
you are using copies of each others software to the point where your decks
are mirror images of each other. It has already happened that a decker
made the mistake of saying he hacked a place he hadn't. Unfortunately, he
unknowingly said it to the live security for that place. The security
person took the decker in for it, too. When the deck was scanned, lo and
behold, there was all the software they'd seen on the icon. The icon was
different though... but that's easy to reprogram. So what happened? Sad
story... he'll more than likely die for it. All the crying in the world
about this being un-IC will change nothing. You run the risk of this
happening to yourself if you are going to mirror your deck off of someone
else's...
  
You may sell a program to another player but you must send the RP log of
the scene to Lucifer. Otherwise it will be considered a trade and the program
will have to be removed.
 
PAYDATA IN CHIPCASES
 
DO NOT DO-- I strongly suggest if you want to keep your paydata files,
DO not put the paydata chips into the chipcases, seems for some weird
reason its not getting the info.

                                Remember
--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
1. When you load programs or files, on the cdhelp it says <program or
file>, please use program if its a program or file if its a file.
 
2.  THE MATRIX IS IC, which means if your in the matrix and something
happens I don't want to hear I'm just checking it out.
 
3. There are also some system commands that will need a judge present. If
you need to do one of these commands, check the +staff and see if there is
a MJudge ON duty, if so use the mjudge call, if not please @mail your
request to *MatrixRP.
 
4. There is a deck command now for MAGLAND and SHADOWLAND. check it out.
And don't forget about the public database called SeaSource where the
online email database is at.
 
5. Please the computers have 2 DELETE commands DELETE <filename> for text
files, and +DELETE PROGRAM FILE, for program. If you use the DELETE
<filename> for program being programed, it will mess up your storage memory.
 
6. You will also see on the status Program<#>_0, just ignore that _0 its
just that source code doesn't have a rating.
 
7.Two Types of TASK bonuses:
 
Task Pool- is a pool of dice like a combat pool, this pool is used to
increase your chance at doing something technical. Encephelon and Math SPU
effects this, which effects how many dice you will roll to see if you can
program the program or hardware and how long it will take.
 
Task Bonus- is a bonus to when you programing on how long it actually will
take you per hour. So if you task bonus is 3 it means every hour you work
your actually doing 4 because of the hardware your using.

8. File Finding Commands
Ok a reminder scan_file is used to check for files placed on the host,
locate_file is used for TP runs and such where the info is not actually
typed out on the host. And to retrieve files found through a locate_file
you would use the file subsystem test command not the read_file.
 
9.To contact a judge or admin of the matrix staff you have 3 choices.
 
A. @mail MJudge, This will add you in the matrix judge queue so only one
matrix admin gets it. Please send TP runs and such here.
 
B. @mail *MatrixRP, This is used to inform all the matrix admins about
something going on in the matrix or around the matrix. Please don't send
TP's here unless you think every matrix admin needs to know.
 
C. And to call a MJudge you can use the +mjudge <message>
 
10. And lastly The mjudges can not see your OOC messages in the matrix,
we are not in the same object as you so we will never see it.
 
11. From now on you must wait at least 15 seconds before doing commands.
As there is now a 10 second wait in the command that checks the ICE and
alerts. If you do the commands too fast you may trigger more then one
piece at you and it could be even worse for you.

*****Combat Posing*****
 
1. You would pose your attack, make sure it includes what your attack
program looks like and try to make it as detailed as possible.
 
2. Then do the attack command, check out +cdhelp combat for the correct
command.
 
3. Now at this point the mjudge will tell you what happens and they may
 or may not ask you to pose the miss or hit.
 
****Program Posing*****
Every time you do a system command you MUST pose
what your icon and program if loaded would look like as your doing the
command.  And remember in general your program will act the same way just
may look different depending on the hosts theme.
 
****MATRIX SPEED REMINDER**** 
Just a reminder, when you go into a matrix host, don't zip along commands
like nobody's business. 1) You could trigger something. MJudges can get in
there and unlock your deck and get things set up without you even knowing
you triggered, but if you slam off commands left and right, the mjudges
can't do that. 2) Sometimes a judge will be following you. MJudges will
follow you from place to place, and then spring surprises on you when
you're least expecting it. However, if you hop into one host, then into the
next, you might trigger something and miss it.
So, when you hop into a host make sure you take time to read the
description, and pose your system commands as well. Always pose. A good
10 to 15 second wait after a command can't hurt and it'll increase RP
potential.

ROLEPLAYING LOGS
 
If you have any MATRIX RELATED Roleplaying logs, feel free to send them to

MUST have MJudge approval and a log must be sent to Rubik. This doesn't
mean if you're sitting in a bar and a friend asks you for the address to
SHADOWLAND and that's it, you should send it. Nope, this is actual drawn

LONG FILE REMINDER
 
Okay, just a little reminder. If you see a post in SHADOWLAND or MAGLAND,
or anywhere for that matter, that looks long, do us a favor and don't add
on to it. Start another file, named Blah2 or something like that, just
reply  in another file. If you make one file too large, you'll start
cutting out the end (you can see that on a couple of old posts). Just a
helpful reminder to keep us all fully informed)

Now you don't just have to DISPLAY something, you could add AUDIO? MOVIE?
 
Hence, <<AUDIO: (LISP) Opiate, Tool>>
 
AUDIO being the routine sent to your deck, kinda like modern day Java.
LISP being the sound language. Now that is not totally right, since I have
no idea what the AUDIO language is for modern day decks but nothing like
bullshitting ehh? ;) Opiate being the song, and Tool being the group. Now
that group doesn't exist in 2056, but that is just an example.

Ok small change in the way bandwidth work on this MUX.
 
You icon bandwidth will = <your active memory used>/ <your jackpoints
bandwidth> then divide that by 2. Also redirect datatrails can lower your
chance to be traced so do not forget to do those on important runs. This
icon bandwidth will be used when a trace ICE is activated and is trying to
locate your jackpoint. Also remember if you adjust your IO bandwidth with
a refrain it will also effect the trace bandwidth rating, so be careful
raising that, only do that when you know its clear. And I/O bandwidths will
only be used during downloading load files. You will only be able to
download the decks I/O rating <plus more if you refrain> of a file per
phase<turn>.

Combat Maneuvers
 
Ok we are not using the parry or position attack maneuvers, but we are
using the evade detection.
Ok so you want to know how that works, its simple. You can evade ICE or
another decker if they spot you. To evade ICE you will roll your evasion
rating, TN#= security rating - cloak program, against the hosts security
rating against your evasion. Or if you evade another decker, you roll
evasion against there sensors - your cloak program + there lockon program.
They will roll sensors vrs your evasion.
 
Now if your successful in evading the other decker, they will have to do a
sclocate decker command to find you. And the ICE will locate you again in
a number of combat turns equal to the number of successes you got when you
evaded them. Now if you increase your security tally during this time, the
amount changed will reduce the evading time.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
Programing Times
 
WE have some very custom rules on how programing will work on here.
FIRST, NO you will not be able to see your time left to program or how
long you have worked.
 
Now I was nice and added something a bit more IC......
 
During the time you program you will get a few pemits at different stages
telling you, you failed or getting closer to finishing.
And of course at the end you will be told. And if your offline and still
programing when one of these stages are hit, you will be told first thing
when you connect the next time.
 
Ok this is how the programing time will be calculated
 
1. Programs- calculate normally as in VRII and then convert it to hours
<times book value by 24>. Then divide the total hours by 4, and you got
your base time.
 
Which means squaring its rating and multiplying by its program modifier
as shown on page 101 in VRII. You would times that by 2 and convert it to
hours <times by 24>. Then you take that time and divide that by 4. And
that is your base time.
 
2. Hardware- calculate normally as in VRII and then convert it to hours
<times book value by 24>.  Then divide the total hours by 2, and you got
your base time.
 
3. Upgrading - You would use the rules above to find the difference between
the two source files and that will give you your base time.
 
4. After you have completed a source file <program or program part of
hardware> you will be able to make 3 copies of the completed program but
you not make ANY copies of hardware source. After the program part of
hardware is completed you will have to cook the source which can be done
with a computer if you have encoder added onto the computer. If you do not
have an encoder you will not be able to cook it.

Ok these are the rules for BREADBOARDING.......
  
In chargen a META character only may get a breadboard Deck or any IC
character may build a Breadboard Deck after they are out of chargen.
 
1. Breadboard prices will be 35 percent off normal price for ALL hardware.
 
2. Breadboards will not be able to be concealed.
 
3. Breadboards will not be allowed in a Bag, locker or anything like that.
If found doing it you will loss 5 karma period, we do not want to hear I
didn't know.
 
4. If you move the deck around there is a 10 percent chance the deck will
not work the next time you jack in. As there are a allot of large and
delicate parts including lose wires and connections. To repair the deck you
will need to make a computer B/R test, TN# of 4 base time will be 4 hours
and you must have Micro Kit.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
 
Ok here is the deal on paydata......
 
You take it to a Paydata specialist which includes Deckmiesters and Some
Fixers.....find them IC
 
Paydata works like this, you do a locate_paydata command in a host, what
this command does is figure out how many paydata files are found and what
type. Yes it will give you a basic idea what the file is, giving you a
better chance of RPing selling the file. All paydata files found but
SHADOWFILES are considered filed with OOC info it's just there for RPing
the selling ,not for actually gaining info. Now shadowfiles are different,
if you get this one you must contact a MJudges before selling it and they
will tell you specifics on what the file is, this will be a good way to
spur Tps around you guys. Also some PC fixers out there have VRII datapads
which will allow them to also purchase your paydata giving you more chances
to sell these files besides with only Deckmeisters. And a side note, these
Paydata files are now Rated, NON SHADOWFILES are 0 through 10, and
SHADOWFILES rate from 0 to 20.
  
Now if a file is rating 0, it means that file is worth nothing and you will
not be able to sell it :-), consider it someone else already got the file
and sold it making your file worth shit.

We have had problems with people finding shadowfiles in hosts that would
never actually have anything we can work with or would not have shadow
type info. So if you pick one up and a MJudge thinks its not a good spot
for a shadow file we will consider it a normal file. This is because the
matrix is really large and we can not keep up with every host and their
shadowfiles.  And remember shadowfiles actually don't give you more money,
they are only there to stimulate TPs for the future for you.
 
When you go to sell them, the buyer will check to see how much the MJudges
will give them as a price for the paydata. NOW be warned when he checks
the price your stuck, the chip will be destroyed and he and you will be
given a round number where the two of you can talk about the price.
Now base price is 2000 give or take .25 to -.25 percent depending on the
rating which effects the price also. At this time there is no time
penalties, but if the file is older then 5 days it will be worthless and he
will not give you drek for it.

for apartments, If its Low lifestyle, some do not get Legal ports. If you
do a +scan ports and there are no ports then the place doesn't have a port,
even if the desc says so, as the builders do not choose where ports go.
Now if you have a middle or high class place you should have legal ports.
   
Now if you want to make a Illegal port, you need to @mail *MatrixRP, with
the DB# of the room and a MJudge will contact you.  Now when they contac
you, you will be charged 100 -Y- for the fake port parts and you will need

Ok so you ask where can I do this, that is simple go to the online hacker
lounge called The_Opposition,
<ill even give you the address for free, 4042>.
 
Go to the first host and type that command and you might find a system.
 
Ok way it works, once a week you can go there and run the command, it
uses your Matrix Etiquette skill against a TN# of 5, the number of success
you get is the number of systems you can hear about for that week. Now you
can only hear about one system a day, and every day after that first day,
for that week, you try and hear about a new system but you will have to
roll Matrix Etiquette again but only against a simple TN#2, if you fail
the guy didn't like you and told you to beat it, if you pass you get a

since the system went in. Check it out and remember all info there is OOC.
On the player side this info is considered VERY OOC, you can brag and
tease the others if there online time sucks but DO NOT that info IC unless
you find out IC. The census command will also be used by the some RPA's to

FILE Info
 
The decker must write a fake info file containing basic background info,
new sin number and name. This file will be added to the host with a MJudge
present.
 
And lastly the order of commands in the systems:
 
1. Locate File <something along the lines of looking for Sin information
database>
 
2. Download File
 
3. Then lastly Edit Log File, to validate your entry.

little bit of information on every fake SIN you make. (IE, we're gonna make
you actually work ;)). Before you make a Fake SIN you will need to @mail
*MatrixRP with the following information on the person who you are going to
make a fake sin for:
 
PC Name, the name on the SIN, the Occupation of the SINner, Date of birth
and place of Birth, education, medical history, and Licenses and permits
(where you include what COUNTRY).

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--

Ok well we finally started working on getting frames up and running. Now
we are going to be using custom rules for Smart frames <yes we do not have
DUMB ones yet>. Smart frame will only be used to do general searches and
info gathering, they can not be controlled by you and they can not be set
up as combat frames. This will explain how it will work, first you will
have to buy or program frames. After you got a frame loaded on your
computer you jack in, and use the +send frame <frame alias> <HP>=<what
your sending your frame to look for>.  Note, be as specific as possible
and as detailed as you can, it will make your base TN# lower. At this
point it will Log your search, rolls, and program modifiers <see more
latter in post>, and the MJudge will determine your base TN# and base
time and will get back to you with the info within 3 days. Also note you
get only get 1 search a day unless you in a IC host with a MJudge.

Program Modifiers: The stats of the frame and what programs will effect
how well it can handle info searches.
If your frame has these programs they will help find the info by making
it easier to get the info. You take the programs rating and divided the
rating by this modifier Cloak|3 Sleaze|1 Evaluate|.5 Analyze|3
Readwrite|2 Browse|2 Deception|3 Validate|4 Relocate|4. Now add these
number up then subtract these 2 modifiers if your frame doesn't have a
Masking of 2 subtract 1 and/or if the frame doesn't have a Browse then
subtract another 1. That total will give you the program modifier of your
frame.

Haaaa another note, you don't have to actually spend time coding it like
programs. Its just a base time and in that time you can run the +program
frame complete command.

Now to see the help on how to program a frame check out +lhelp PC frames.

Well, now you can!

       Yes, that's right, our very own genius Matrix coder, Trinket has
created Matrix cameras. Now you can get cheap and quality entertainment
in the Matrix without paying premium prices. All you have to do is find a
meat world location with a camera, find that places Matrix host, and then
do the appropriate system tests. Of course, a Judge DOES have to be
present for the entire time, but it's better then nothing :) Enjoy
Remember you can always control more then one slave, just takes more
tests.

     All require that a PC have a SIN at _least_ rating two or higher. In
addition, a DW "client" will need a bracelet, so the Decker has to add a
address that's reasonable for the bracelet to be delivered too (usualy via
snail mail). It helps if this is not placed in the Barrens :)

     number, +bbwrite SIN, etc.

     Accounting 5 successes on a file test: Billing information and records
     showing that it has been paid.

     Also need to complete X successes on a Biotech test. (This can be done
     by the Decker OR someone who has biotech and assists with the
     creating of the files)

Super Platinum: Requires:

     A lotta dreams chummer, a lotta dreams.

NOTE: These are just the basic contracts. If a PC appears odd enough to
warrant more in depth searches, this won't cover all that.

     Also, a note about DNA samples. The runs on the Secure databases
sort of involves "pointing" a file to a DNA sample. Like saying "This
mage uses this DNA sample..honest"

        So, you want to be decker? Well, chummer, it's gonna take a little
book knowledge to be a killer decker on our game. It helps to have some
experience, and more often then not, you have to know *exactly* what your 
doing. This not NOT for the faint of heart. Being a decker is easily the 
most difficult of characters to play on the MUX. If you want to be decker 
we, the admins, STRONGLY suggest you purchase VRII from FASA. Read it, 
study it, learn it, memorize it, inject it into your brain. Do not take 
this statement lightly. You have been warned.

and additions from FASA and making sure that deckers have plenty to do to
keep them interested. Matrix judges judge plots and scenes that take place in
the Matrix. If you want to drop a line to either of these groups of people,
@mail *Matrix. If you need to talk to an mjudge immediately, for example, when 
you are in the matrix and want to complete a task, you can use the +mjudge 
command. Type +mjudge <brief description of problem>. The latest revisions to 
the Matrix system have made most judge calls automatic. When you trigger a 
command in the Matrix, a judge will be called. If none are online, a mail will 
be sent so they can get back to you.

                      Current State of the Matrix
        The human mind cannot directly comprehend the flow of data in the
Matrix. If users were restricted to old-tech tools--command lines, file
names, programs in clumsy procedural languages--the system would be
unmanageable. After the Crash of 2029, ASIST technology opened up the
possibilities of actual DNI (Direct Neural Interface) access to computers,
and the Matrix was born. Now, the user takes a microsecond trip through a
computer-generated landscape in order to find a file. If the user is
validated to see a file, he finds it right where he expected. The interface
routines he uses may look like clerical workers, or a huge library, or simply
appear as dazzling patterns of energy. The user sees the file, touches it,
and the data downloads into his cyberterminal.
        Users do not need to remember codes, command sets, or file names. If
they want something, they go get it. If they want to program a process for
the laboratory or an assembly line, they mentally perform the motions
involved or build a model using virtual components, and the computer learns
from them. Modern chemists, for example, build molecules according to
formulae as if they were using children's building blocks. The computer then
translates these actions into a program that will operate the process in the
real world.
        Legitimate users have registered cyberterminals that identify
themselves to the Matrix at every step. But, the cyberdecks of deckers have
no Matrix identifiers. Deckers remain anonymous, and when everything goes
right, they can dance through the secrets of the Matrix, laughing at the
security measures. Of course, when things go wrong, they can die in the
Matrix as well.

                                Icons
        Every object that the user sees in the Matrix is an icon. The persona
programs and utilities running on the cyberdeck are master copies of the
software that makes decking possible. When a decker logs on to a grid or
host, the cyberdeck loads versions of those programs onto the Matrix system
using the deck's active memory. In a nutshell, deckers deal with two sets of
programs: the front-end programs on the deck, which convert the decker's
neural impulses into computer command transactions; and the server programs
in the Matrix, called utility programs, which convert those commands into
programming commands that influence what the system does.

                                Grids
        The words grid and Matrix are often used interchangeably, but the
grid is actually the telecommunications net which makes up the web of the
Matrix. There are three types of grids that exist in the Matrix:
        RTG  | Regional Telecommunications Grid (owned and maintained by
             |   a monopoly vendor)
             |
        LTG  | Local Telecommunications Grid (analogous to area codes of
             |   the 20th century)
             |
        PLTG | Private Local Telecommunications Grid (grids owned by

             |   megacorporations)

                                Hosts
        Hosts are what used to be called mainframe computers, but mainframes
in the 2050's do not have to be single computers. In fact, many of them are
linked series of massive parallel processors in smaller configurations. There
are four kinds of hosts in the modern Matrix:
        Blue Hosts   | Most public service databases or small companies
                     | too poor to afford powerful security.
                     |
        Green Hosts  | Average level systems that have the capability
                     | for powerful security, but seldom use it.
                     |
        Orange Hosts | Secure systems that hold information important
                     | enough for the system owners to take great precautions
                     | in protecting it.
                     |
        Red Hosts    | Contain top secret level data that is so important 
                     | the owners will not hesitate to kill to protect it.

see news matrix * hosts) Security values range from 4 to 12, though they
sometimes range higher.

                          Subsystem Ratings
        The five subsystem ratings--Access, Control, Index, Files, and
Slave--represent the resistance of a system's subsystems to unauthorized
manipulations by a decker.
        Access  | The access rating measures a system's resistance to
                | unauthorized access.
                |
        Control | The control rating measures a system's resistance to

                              Initiative
        The initiative of a decker is determined by the reaction 
attribute of
the decker's persona. An unenhanced persona has a reaction of 1D6. Reaction
increases and running in hot mode increase a decker's reaction in the Matrix.
Wired reflexes, magical augmentation, and vehicle control rigs do not affect
the persona's reaction in the Matrix.

        There are three kinds of actions in cybercombat. An icon can take on
free action and either two simple actions or one complex action during a
combat phase.
             Free actions: Delay Action, Speak a Word, Terminate
                     Upload/Download, Unload Program, and Unsuppress IC
             Simple actions: Attack, Combat Maneuvers, Improvise Attack

                          Combat Maneuvers
Evade Detection
---------------
        An icon can perform an evade detection maneuver to evade an opposing
icon that has detected it. If an IC program has evaded the decker, he must
use the Analyze Icon operation to relocate it.
Parry Attack
------------
        The parry-attack maneuver makes it more difficult for an opposing
icon to hit the decker. The maneuver lasts until the next attack by an icon.
Position Attack
---------------
        The position attack maneuver allows the icon to position itself for
an attack on an opponent. If it fails, though, position attack makes it
easier for the opposing icon to hit the decker.

                              Cyberdecks
        Cyberdecks are stunningly complex devices, even by the standards of
2056. Not only do they contain a simsense interface that lets the user
experience the Matrix in full-sensory splendor, but they have more processing
power than a warehouse full of 20th century computers.

                                 MPCP
        The Master Persona Control Program, or MPCP, runs on a grouping of
optical chips at the heart of the cyberdeck. It contains the master operating
system that integrates the deck's programs. It translates Grid signals into
images that the user can see, hear, and smell. It also turns the decker's
neural signals into computer instructions that manipulate the Matrix. If the
MPCP crashes, the decker is immediately dumped.
        The MPCP's principal duty is maintaining the cohesive integration of
all the deck's components and active programs into what is known as the
persona. Visually, the persona appears as anything the decker wants, but
technically it is the decker's body while in the Matrix. The persona's
attributes are a combination of the MPCP and four programs, called persona
programs, that all decks must run.

                           Persona Programs
        Because persona programs are installed in chips, they do not use up
any of the cyberdeck's active onboard memory. There are four persona 
programs:
        Bod     | Bod is the persona's Body attribute. It is what
                | determines the amount of damage that the decker's icon
                | can take in combat.
                |
        Evasion | The Evasion attribute allows the persona to evade IC
                | programs and commands.
                |
        Masking | Masking is the persona's ability to blend in with
                | Matrix hosts. This attribute help to defeat various
                | tracer and identification programs.
                |
        Sensors | This attribute lets the persona detect things in the
                | Matrix.

        Active memory is the cyberdeck's "RAM", to use the old-tech term. A
deck's active memory limits the utility programs the deck can run and have
ready for use by the persona at any one time.

                            ASIST Levels
        The ASIST interface component controls the simsense experience of
cyberspace and the decker's DNI (direct neural interface) connection to the
Matrix, as routed through the interpretive software coded into the MPCP. The
interface also has a control program of its own to handle the data exchange.
        This is not a home sim entertainment unit. The typical signal
strength on a full-bore cyberdeck is not too far below the brainkicking
current a wirehead gets from a Better Than Life chip. That gives the best
interface to the Matrix, and when a deck is running at that intensity, it is
called a "hot" deck.
        However, a decker can deliberately reduce the intensity of the ASIST
signal, down to about the level of legal simsense. This is called a "cool"
deck. Cool decks reduce the persona's speed in cyberspace, but black IC
cannot inflict lethal damage over a cool interface. Psychotropic black IC,
however, works over both levels of interface.
        Tortoises are cyberdecks without ASIST interfaces. They use low-end
graphics display and interface devices to access the Matrix without a DNI
interface. Tortoises have a severe penalty to Matrix access speed and
reaction time.

hardware work to reinforce the deck's resistance to invasive code such as
viruses, gray and black IC, and other hazards of the course.

        Intrusion counter-countermeasures (ICCM) technology protects deckers
from the worst effects of black IC. New generation ICCM technology allows
ICCM devices to be built directly into cyberdecks. An ICCM filter increases
the decker's chances of jacking out successfully when under attack by black
IC. The filter also allows the decker to use willpower and body attributes
interchangeably when attacked by black IC. The ICCM is not effective against
psychotropic black IC.

speed indicated the maximum I/O bandwidth that a decker can allocate to a
task.

                         Matrix and Cyberware
        Cyberware has dramatically improved the power of human mind when it
is applied to decking. Though conventional cyberware such as wired reflexes
are of no use the Matrix, new mental improvements are now almost a necessity.
Headware Memory
---------------
        Allows a user to store data in storage chips in their cranium.
Datajack
--------
        Necessary for decking. Allows data to be sent to and processed by the
brain.
Encephalon
----------
        A combination microcomputer and expert system that allows the
brain to access all internal memory stores and functions. Allows mental
multi-tasking Available in levels ranging from one to four. The level one
and two encephalons give a point of intelligence bonus, and the level two
encephalon gives a task pool bonus. Level three and four encephalons give a
two point intelligence bonus and give two and three task bonuses 
respectively.
Just a reminder, intelligence directly affects Hacking Pool.
Math SPU
--------
        A math subprocessor in the brain that allows the user to mentally
complete very complex mathematic equations. The Math SPU functions as a bonus
to the mathematics skill and it adds half its rating to technical, technical
build-repair, and science skills. This means that it increases the Hacking
Pool by half its level, which ranges from one to four.

                                Paydata
        Virtually all systems contain datafiles. The vast majority of these
files offer nothing of any relevance to shadowrunners, but some contain
information that may be quite valuable in the marketplace or may answer
crucial questions. This information is called paydata. Paydata can be new
technology from the big brains in R&D, business plans worth money to inside
traders, incriminating information ripe for blackmail, or anything else worth
value.
        In Shadowrun MUSH, paydata is accessed by a system command, Locate
Paydata, and downloaded. Any decker can execute this command as many 
times as
they please, but corporations and governments pay particular attention to
repeat offenders. They expect and allow a certain amount of datatheft from
their systems, but if things get out of hand, they send investigative agents
and nail the source of the problem with unmatched efficiency. Other deckers
will also find out that you are the one causing system security to increase
and they may decide to come and have a chat with you.

                             I/O Bandwidth
        I/O Bandwidth handles uploads and downloads. I/O bandwidth allows the
decker to do multiplexing, or allocating different portions of his bandwidth
to the transfer of different files. A decker can also use the retrain system
operation to increase or decrease his bandwidth. When a decker increases the
bandwidth above the rating of the jackpoint they are using, it is easier for
trace IC to locate them.

                             Alert Levels
        There are three levels of alert in the host systems on the Matrix.
No Alert
--------
   Generally activate trace IC and reactive IC upon detection of 
intruder. If
intrusion becomes more obvious, passive alert is activated.
Passive Alert
-------------
   The presence of an intruder is likely, but not certain. The system will
activate proactive white or gray IC. All subsystem ratings in the
host also raise by 2 under this alert status.
Active Alert
------------
   The presence of an intruder has been verified. In active alert,
retaliation is barred only by the power of the computer, though it hardly
ever reaches that level before the decker is killed. The host will activate
proactive white, gray, and black IC in addition to calling in law-enforcement
deckers to protect the system. After this point, leaving the system and
returning becomes much more difficult. The host may, if threatened to a
considerable degree, shut itself down.

                             Matrix History
        In the year 2018, Dr. Hosato Hikata of ESP Systems, Inc., created the
first ASIST interface. ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction System) technology
allowed electronic devices to stimulate the areas of the brain which
controlled the senses. The entertainment industry went wild with the new
"simsense" technology, but other researchers saw it as a key to the
containment of the information explosion.
        In 2026, the first cyberspace travelers were taking halting steps
into what we now call the Matrix. The first cyberterminal was a room-sized
isolation chamber with multi-contact point jacks and multiple hook-ups for
the operator. These were designed for military intelligence applications. The
first volunteers went mad.

        In 2027, a great refinement in cyberterminals was made. As computer
systems became increasingly complex during the late twentieth century, many
programs replaced lengthy strings of commands with simple pictures, or icons,
that symbolized specific commands or programs. The user picked the icon
wanted, and the computer would do whatever the picture meant. By the late
1990s, a typical user was dealing with so many thousands of icons that
data-processing systems were breaking down under their own complexity.
        By 2029, Sony Cybersystems, Fuchi Industrial Electronics, and
RCA-Unisys had all developed prototype cyberterminals that allowed the user
to interface with the world data network via his or her nervous system, which
translated the data and issued the commands. Instead of typing in 
commands or
clicking a mouse at an icon, operations were carried out literally at the
speed of thought. These early cyberterminals were massive, requiring that the
user be in a sensory deprivation tank. Largely funded by various intelligence
agencies, the goal of the research was to allow agents to raid data systems,
creating strike teams of "super hackers."

        In the United States, the CIA, NSA, and IRS pooled their 
resources to
exploit this development. Under the code name of "Echo Mirage", they
recruited and trained a team of "cyber-commandos." Fighting bulky equipment
and psychoses induced by the overwhelming sensory signals generated by the
primitive cyberterminals, Echo Mirage was advancing toward a workable
technology when international disaster struck.
        On February 8, 2029, computer systems across the world were attacked
apparently at random, by a virus program of unprecedented power. Systems
crashed, their data was wiped clean and even their hardware was burned 
out by
the effects of the virus. As the killer program spread, governments toppled
and the world economy neared collapse.
        During the first quarter of the year, the virus shattered the Grid,
the data network that held the world together. By presidential order, Echo
Mirage was activated to counteract the virus, but the "straight-arrow" agents
of Echo Mirage were overwhelmed by the psychological demands of
psycho-physiological combat in cyberspace.

        Echo Mirage's masters responded by recruiting the most brilliant, if
erratic, data-processing mavericks from the industry and the universities.
Their choices were drafted under a presidential emergency order and rammed
through a brutal training program. A cadre of 32 men and women graduated with
their sanity intact.
        It was not until August 2029, however, that the new cadre, armed with
improved cybertechnology, could mount a coordinated attack on the killer
program.
        Eighteen minutes after engaging the virus, four members of Echo
Mirage were dead. When the data logs were analyzed, two things became
apparent. First, the virus program could induce lethal biofeedback in humans
accessing the Matrix. Second, no existing computer security could even slow
down someone using a cyberterminal.
        The corporations involved in the effort were horrified at the ease
with which Echo mirage penetrated their most secure data systems. In
reaction, secret corporate research was begun to develop new security
software that could repel intruders using a Matrix interface. This included
research to duplicate the lethal effects generated by the virus. The
resulting software was the first generation of intrusion countermeasures, or
IC, now known worldwide as "ice."

        Echo Mirage learned techniques to isolate and contain the virus.
Equipped with new combat programs and beefed up cyberterminals, they began
the lengthy task of purging the Grid of infection. By late 2031, they had
wiped out the last known concentration of virus code.
        These second-generation terminals used desk-sized hardware and needed
no sensory deprivation tank. Shortly after the final purge of the virus, four
of the surviving seven members of Echo Mirage decamped into the private
sector, taking with the secrets of the new technology.
        In May 2034, Matrix Systems of Boston came out with the first
"gray-market" cyberterminal. Six weeks later, Matrix Systems' main computer
crashed and its two founders died in apparently unrelated accident.
        From the perspective of the military-industrial complex, the damage
had already been done. Matrix technology was loose. Fuchi Industrial was the
first major corporation to break ranks against the invasion of the deckers
when, in 2036, it marketed its own third-generation cyberdeck, the desktop
CDT-100.

        The majority of cyberdecks sold today are licensed machines that
inject a unique signature into the logs of any systems they access, thus
recording all legitimate activity in the Matrix. For years, however, pirate
users, or deckers, have been acquiring decks and modifying them. Deckers
suppress their system's signature and add capabilities that are of little use
to an honest cyberterminal operator. That's the way of the world in the 
2050's.

        IC stands for intrusion countermeasures. Some IC just impedes the
decker, maybe tries to get a network ID on him. Other programs are designed
to crash his icon off the Matrix. Still others go after his deck. Finally,
there's black IC--which flat out tries to kill him.

                                White
        White IC affects only the decker's online icon. It affects the icon's
ratings, but not the cyberdeck's permanent ratings or utilities.
Cripplers | Cripplers are proactive white IC programs that each
          | attack one of the decker's icon's attributes. Acid cripplers
          | attack an icon's Bod rating. Binder cripplers attack an
          | icon's Evasion rating. Jammer cripplers attack the Sensor
          | rating, and marker cripplers attack the Masking rating. Armor
          | and Hardening do not protect against cripplers.
          |
Killer    | Killer is proactive IC that causes damage directly to
          | the icon in cybercombat. The damage level of the killer IC is
          | determined by the security code of the host that runs it.
          | Killer IC on Blue or Green hosts does medium damage. Killer IC
          | on Orange or Red systems does serious damage.
          |
Data Bomb | A data bomb is reactive IC that acts as a booby trap
          | attached to a specific datafile or remote device under the
          | Slave subsystem. It will explode if the decker attempt to
          | access the file that it is protecting. Data bombs can be
          | defused with a systems test on the subsystem controlling it.
          | The defuse utility helps this process considerably.
          |
Probe     | Probe is a reactive IC that interrogates the decker and
          | tries to detect unauthorized programs. The probe program
          | increases the decker's security tally for every successful
          | interrogation it performs.
          |
Scramble  | Scramble is reactive white IC that protects elements
          | of a host's Access, Files, or Slave subsystems. Scramble comes
          | in two varieties: exploding and poison. Exploding IC works
          | like a data bomb and explodes if a decker tries to access a
          | protected subsystem. Poison IC destroys the data under its
          | protection if unauthorized access it attempted. Often times,
          | this data is backed up in another system off the Matrix.
          |
Tar Baby  | Tar baby is a reactive IC that attempt to crash a
          | decker's utility programs, specifically operational
          | utilities. When a tar baby successfully attacks the decker,
          | it crashes both itself and an operational utility in active
          | memory. A decker can perform a Swap Memory operation to
          | restore a lost program.

                                 Gray
        Gray IC programs attack a decker's cyberdeck and utilities directly.
Any damage caused by a gray IC attack permanently affects the deck's ratings.
Damaged chips and other components must be replaced to restore the deck's
original ratings.
Blaster   | Blaster IC is proactive IC that attacks just like the
          | Killer IC, but if the decker's icon crashes, the blaster IC
          | will do damage to the MPCP. Hardening reduces the probability
          | of damage being done by blaster after a crash.
          |
Rippers   | Rippers are gray cripplers that attack and damage
          | persona chips. Hardening reduces the effect of ripper IC.
          | Ripper IC is separated into different categories and is named
          | just like crippler IC.
          |
Sparky    | Sparky IC attacks just like blaster IC, but if the
          | decker's icon crashes, it will send a jolt of electricity to
          | the MPCP and the decker's brain. The jolt can range anywhere
          | from a little electroshock therapy to a killing blast of
          | power. Hardening reduces the power of the damage.
          |
Tar Pit   | The reactive IC known as Tar Pit works in the same way
          | as its less powerful counterpart, Tar Baby. If a tar pit
          | crashes a utility, it injects a virus that corrupts all
          | copies of the program in memory. Unless a copy has been
          | stored in offline memory, the decker has lost it for good. If
          | the copy has been stored in offline memory, the decker cannot
          | retrieve it until the end for the run.
          |
Worms     | Worms are reactive IC programs that are used to booby
          | trap subsystems. Deckers can remove worms with the disinfect
          | system command. But, the worm can infect the deck through that
          | command as well. Hardening helps defend against worm infection.
          |
          |       Dataworms logs information about deckers and report it to
          |           their owners next time the decker logs onto the Matrix.
          |       Deathworms make cybercombat much more difficult.
          |       Tapeworms erase files that are downloaded onto a deck.

Lethal Black IC
        Lethal black IC fights like killer IC  with one important difference,
black IC attacks cause damage to a decker and his icon, rather than just the
icon. The damage code for the IC depends on the security code of the host
which runs it. Blue and Green hosts run moderate damage IC, and Orange and
Red hosts run serious damage IC. Deadly wounds caused by black IC may produce
permanent aftereffects such as memory lapses, hallucinations, tremors,
phantom pain, migraines, or similar conditions.
Non-Lethal Psychotropic Black IC
        Non-lethal black IC causes mental, not physical damage. Deckers
resist such damage with their Willpower. Non-lethal IC can cause anything
from profound fear of the Matrix to a maniacal state of rage.

                                Trace
        Trace IC is a hybrid of white and gray IC programs. Basically, trace
IC works in two distinct stages: the hunt cycle and the location cycle.
During the hunt cycle, the IC tries to get a fix on the decker's datatrail.
The location cycle is the process of tracing the datatrail back to its
origin. The trace factor is the level of difficulty a trace will have in
locating a decker. This can be influenced by the choice of jackpoint, the
rating of any running camo program, or the number of datatrail redirects
done. Trace IC that has found the decker's jackpoint can make it much easier
for IC to lock on to the decker. Trace IC also has the tendency to make it
more difficult for the decker to jack out.

                       Crashing and Suppressing
        When a decker crashes an IC, the rating of the IC is added to the
decker's security tally. The stealth option on a program can reduce the
amount by which the security tally rises when an IC is crashed. A decker can
also choose to suppress IC with a point of his detection factor. The decker
can choose to release the suppressed IC in order to regain detection factor,
but when the IC is released, its rating will be added to the security tally.

                           Matrix Programs
        Theoretically, a sufficiently godlike decker could command the Matrix
with nothing but his bare persona and skill alone. Less divine netheads,
however, must supplement their puny skills with utility programs. Utilities
come in four flavors: operational, special, defensive, and offensive.
Operational utilities apply to a decker's System Tests. These prove
especially useful when performing system operations, hence the name
operational utilities. Special utilities perform specific tasks in the
Matrix. Offensive utilities are used to damage opposing deckers, IC, and so
on. Defensive utilities are designed to prevent damage taken in cybercombat.

                          Operational Utilities
        Operational utilities increase the chance of a system operation
working correctly. They do this by lowering the effective security rating of
the host by the rating of the utility when doing a system command. For
example, an Analyze 4 program run on a host with a control subsystem 10 would
have a target number of 6 rather than 10. The operational utilities and the
system operations they affect are:
Analyze    | Analyze Host, Analyze IC, Analyze Icon, Analyze Security, Locate
IC
Browse     | Locate Access Node, Locate File, Locate Slave
Crash      | Crash Application, Crash Host
Defuse     | Increases chance of defusing data bombs

                           Special Utilities
Compressor | Reduces the size of data being downloaded or
           | uploaded by 50 percent. The maximum file size that the
           | compressor can compress is 100Mp x Rating. The decker must have
           | enough memory for the uncompressed file when uploading.
           |
Sleaze     | The sleaze program combines with the deck's Masking
           | rating to enhance the deck's Detection Factor.
           |
Track      | Track is Trace IC for deckers. It allows a decker to
           | trace another decker's jackpoint and make his jack-out
           | operations more difficult.

                          Offensive Utilities
Attack
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames, IC
Options: Area, chaser, one-shot, optimization, penetration, stealth, 
targeting
        An offensive program designed to inflict damage on online icons by
introducing memory faults into the algorithms of the opposing icon.
Black Hammer
------------
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The black hammer utility is a black IC program that targets the
decker, not the deck. It can kill a decker without knocking his cyberdeck
offline, making the connection traceable. The maximum rating of the black
hammer utility is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up.
Hog
---
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The hog program crashes running utilities on another decker's deck.
Killjoy
-------
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The killjoy utility is like black hammer, but it inflicts stun damage
instead of physical damage. The maximum program rating for a killjoy utility
is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up.
Poison
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The poison utility attacks the Bod Rating of targeted personas and
behaves like Acid IC.
Restrict
--------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The restrict program attacks the Evasion Rating of targeted personas.
Reveal
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The reveal program attacks the Masking Rating of targeted personas.
Slow
----
Targets: IC
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The slow utility reduces the execution speed of proactive IC. Note
that temporarily disabling IC in this manner prevents the IC from raising the
decker's security tally. However, suppressing the IC requires 1 point of
Masking. Trace IC is only vulnerable to the slow utility during it's hunting
cycle.
Steamroller
-----------
Targets: Tar Baby, Tar Pits
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The steamrolling utility is a specific type of attack program
intended to target tar IC programs. It inflicts (Rating)D damage on the tar
IC.

                         Defensive Utilities
Armor
-----
Options: Optimization
        The armor utility reduces the power of damage inflicted on a decker's
icon by the rating of the armor program. The armor program only works on the
decker's icon, not their meatbody. The armor utility loses 1 rating point
every time the decker takes damage, or in other words, whenever the armor
utility does not absorb ALL of the damage, it loses a rating point.
Camo
----
Options: One-shot, optimization
        The camo utility rating is added to the trace factor, which impedes
the attempts of trace IC to follow a deck's datatrail.
Cloak
-----
Options: One-shot, optimization
        The cloak utility makes evasion during combat easier.
Lock-On
-------
Options: One-shot. optimization
        The lock-on utility makes sensing an opposing decker easier during
cybercombat.
Medic
-----
Options: Optimization
        This program heals damage takes by the decker's online icon. It loses
one rating point for every point of damage it heals. Deckers can perform a
Swap Memory operation to restore the medic utility to its full rating.
Restore
-------
Options: One-shot, optimization
        This program restores deck attributes that have been damaged by an
attack. The program cannot repair damage to actual persona chips caused by
gray or black IC.
Shield
------
Options: Optimization
        Shield enables a decker to parry attacks in cybercombat. The shield
utility loses 1 Rating Point every time it is used, whether the operation
succeeds or not. Deckers may load fresh copies of the utility by performing
Swap Memory operations.

                     Programming and Construction
        The minimum setup needed for programming is a personal computer with
memory equal to or greater than the size of the program being created. If the
personal computer has double the amount of memory needed in confers a one
point task bonus. Programmers can also install programming suites or 
shops to
make programming easier and faster. Using a mainframe instead of a personal
computer also adds a bonus to all programming tasks. However, the mainframe's
Security Value must be at least half the rating of the program being created.
Mainframe time can be purchased at Security Value x 100 nuyen per day.
Programming suites can also be purchased for mainframes. Mainframes running
programming suites cost twice as much as a normal mainframe.
        Programming and deck construction are both tasks that take a specific
amount of time depending on the difficulty of the task. Various equipment
furnishes the programmer or deck constructor with task bonuses. Task bonuses
significantly decrease the time necessary to complete a task. This equipment
includes shops, kits, facilities, programming suites, and mainframe computer
time.
        Characters may also work together in teams to produce programs. The
maximum size of a team equals half the Computer Skill, rounded down, of the
team member with the highest Computer Skill. The maximum rating of programs
the team can produce is one point higher than the Computer Skill of the
member of the group with the highest Computer Skill. The team cannot share
tools and task bonuses. Each team member must have the minimum required
facilities to complete the program.

                            Utility Options
        Options are special additions to programs that alter their function.
Program options require a greater amount of memory to program a utility and
run it. Some options reduce the size of a program while increasing the amount
of memory needed to program it. Changes in a program's rating due to option
addition do not count against the maximum rating that a programmer can
design. These options are the only ones implemented on Shadowrun MUSH:
Area         | Allows a program to engage multiple targets on the host
Chaser       | Negates the penalty against attacking shifting IC (may
             | not exist with Penetration)
One-Shot     | Turns the utility into a single-shot program and
             | reduces its size in memory
Optimization | Reduces the size of a program in memory by 50
             | percent
Penetration  | Defeats the shield defensive utility (may not
             | exist with Chaser)
Sensitive    | Renders programs effective on only one
             | manufacturer's mainframes and reduces a program's size by 75
             | percent
Skulk        | Enables a deckers to eliminate or decrease additions to
             | their security tallies when crashing IC
Targeting    | Provides a greater chance of success in attack

                                Frames
        Frames are combinations of decker-designed utilities, just as
constructs are combinations of IC programs. Frames can be smart or dumb. Dumb
frames exist only as long as the decker can control them and is active on the
host. Smart frames are capable of independent existence in the Matrix,
whether their creator is logged on or not. Smart frames must be equipped with
DINAB, which makes them act like a decker would. Smart frames have their own
initiative. Deckers usually use frames as auxiliary weapons against IC and
other deckers. The frames work like friendly deckers in the host, attacking
whatever you tell them to.

                     Matrix Attributes and Skills
        The mental attributes are the most necessary ones for deckers.
Intelligence is crucial to maintaining a high Hacking Pool. New ICCM
technology allows for deckers to use Willpower instead of Body to resist
attacks by black IC. Quickness should be high enough for a decent Reaction,
but deckers usually rely on their decks for their reaction speed. Deckers
usually spend so much time improving their Willpower and Intelligence that
they have no time to increase their Charisma, but this reflects the
time-honored tradition of anti-social computer nerds.
        The Computer Skill is absolutely essential for deckers. It has a
Software Concentration and a Decking Specialization, but beginning deckers
will suffer if they increase skill in Decking at the expense of programming
ability. The maximum rating of the programs that characters can design equals
the rating of their Computer, Software, or Matrix Programming skill. The
ratings of character-designed MPCP and frame cores cannot exceed the
character's computer skill multiplied by 1.5.
        Computer B/R is the skill used for building and repairing decks.
        The Matrix Etiquette skill governs searches for equipment, software
sources, local access to Shadowland, and other goods and services. This skill
also keeps the decker current on the latest major players are in cyberspace
and lets him pick up the latest rumors in the global gossip of the Matrix.

NEWS MAGIC GROUPS
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
What Makes A Good Magical Group:
 1. Groups Must Add Something To The MUX.
        What we mean by this is that the magic groups presence and purpose
should add to the RP of MUX. It should bring something new to the MUX
to further enhance RP for all PC's, by striving to include others not a
part of the group, or even non-mages for that matter, in group related TP's.
The key to this is getting other PC's involved without truly 'getting them
involved'. A few examples would be hiring others to do their work for
them, trying to convert others to their cause, or using stealth and
manipulation of the PC populace to achieve their desired goals. The list
could go on and on. Be creative. 
2. Be Original.
        Anyone can come up with a 'down with the corps' or 'hunt down the
vile toxics' as a basis for their group, but if you want the reduced
karma costs your gonna have to a _lot_ better then that.

3. Tiny Plots
        The groups background and mission should be well thought out, as
to provide a jumping off point for TP's. Both for the group itself, and
also for the majority of PC's on the MUX. 
4. Some Final Thoughts...
        Any group that is the equivalent of a magical shadowrunning team
with a cause _will_ be turned down. The reason for this is that mages are
the most powerful class in Shadowrun and on this MUX. Other classes would
not be able to compete, and it would throw off the balance of power on
this MUX.

NEWS MAGIC PERCEIVING
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^  
The commands for astral perception are "+perceive on" and "+perceive off". 
We did not hardcode into these an @emit, so people couldn't immediately
tell by a system message that you were doing so.  HOWEVER, we expect ALL
mages to roleplay when they are astrally perceiving.  It is very obvious
that the person is not totally within "this world" if they're wandering
around (things just don't look the same), and if they're being closely
scrutinized, the eyes can glaze over, etcetera.  Don't walk around
constantly perceiving and keep in mind that when you are perceiving, you
are an astral target, drop hints to those around you when you are
perceiving, and everything should be just fine.

NEWS MAGIC FAQ
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
(1) How do I get a Magic character?  
Magic characters are a unique character type that is not accepted on a
regular basis.  For the majority of your time on the MUX, you will find
that Magic applications are not being accepted.  However, when they -are-
accepted, you will know by an announcement made on the 'general' BBoard. 
The number of 'magic slots' being filled will be posted as well as the
types of characters we are looking for.  This does not mean that other
more original applications will not be accepted--but rather gives an idea
of the type of characters that are being sought after.  Experienced
players will be given preference, so please be sure to include previous
characters played in the application.  Directions of where to send the
application and the deadline will be posted as well, so keep your eye
constantly on the General BBoard.:)
 
(2) Can I apply for a magic character, when magic characters are not
being accepted, if I have a really cool great idea?
No.  In fact, this will serve to do nothing more than annoy the Magic 
admins, and that would be bad.  Your best bet would be to save the 
character concept for when the General Board announcement is made.

(3) I just killed a mage, my friend retired his magic character, my friend 
just killed his magic character, I just retired my magic character. Can I 
have that magic slot?
Again, no.  MAGE CHARACTERS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE.  
We fill the magic slots on a bulk basis.  The magic slot that you are 
coveting will be filled with the rest when the General Bboard 
announcement is made. 
 
(4) Ok, I have a magic character, but I want to initiate (increase magical 
prowess).  How do I do that?
Initiate grades are earned ICly through hard study, training, time, and 
experience.  OOCly, there is a cost involved with achieving each grade 
(No drek, neh?).  Karmic costs depend on whether you initiate alone or 
as part of a magic group (magic groups are discussed below), and whether 
you wish to take on an ordeal (a test or quest).  The actual cost is 
figured out using a base cost (6+desired grade), multiplied by another 
number.  
                        Self-Initiation         Base Costx3
                        Group Initiation        Base Costx2
                        Self-Init+Ordeal        Base Costx2
                        Group init+Ordeal       Base Costx1.5
 
These is also a time cost associated with the initiate grade increases 
that governs the time between initiations.  Grade 0 (the first initiate 
grade) can be achieved at anytime as long as the Karma can be paid for 
by the mage.  After that, the time cost timetable is as listed in NEWS 
RULES MAGIC INITIATION.

Where do we start?
See NEWS MAGIC GROUPS.
 
(6) I need magic supplies, but I don't know where to get them!
There is always at least one active Talismonger in the game.  You'll need 
to do a little IC legwork to find them, but they exist.

 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
 
To raise an attribute on Detroit is different from that of Seattle.
 
Our rules work like this:
 
<Desired Rating> * 2 - <racial modifier>
 
IE: A human wants to raise his strength from 4 to 5.  
 
    5 * 2 = 10
 
10 is his karma cost for doing this.
 
Now say a elf wants to raise his charisma from 4 to 5.
 
    5 * 2 - 2 = 8
 
The -2 comes in because an Elf's racial modifier for Charisma is +2. 
Hence, it's easier for him to become prettier. If an Ork, hoever, wanted 
to raise her intelligence it would take more effort and a longer period 
of time than for a Human.

We are aware that Shadowrun is a game, and it is here for the fun of the 
greatest number.  Unfortunately, it has become necessary in the past to 
exclude players from the game due to overly disruptive activities. It is 
the responsibility of the administration to maintain a fun and playable 
environment for the large number of players who enjoy Shadowrun MUX.
 
The MUX has several different levels of punishment applied at different 
levels of offense.  It also has an administrative justice system.  These 
are laid out in NEWS POLICY DISCIPLINE2.

"Offenses":
The following are all offenses meriting disciplinary action by the 
staff.  This list is by no means exclusive, however, it represents those 
actions which we have encountered so far:
* Harassment (sexual or otherwise--see NEWS POLICY HARASSMENT)
* Personal insults directed towards another participant--Player OR Admin
* Multi-playing (see NEWS POLICY ONE)
* Cheating (this loosely-defined term includes any intentional action to
   circumvent any of the rules of the Shadowrun game or the MUX)
* OOC knowledge crossover (see NEWS POLICY OOC)
* Damaging the MUX's database
* Hacking other players' passwords (unless it's IC ;))
* Malicious interference with the operation of the MUX or its staff
* Falsely accusing anyone of any of the above.

"Punishments":
Punishment options for the administration of Shadowrun MUX in dealing 
with offenses by players and administrators include (but are not limited to):
* @booting: terminating the connection of the offender.  You are allowed
  back on.
* Karma docking:  Deducting karma from the PC.  (NEWS RULES KARMA DOCKING).
* SLAVE flag:  Allows the player to logon, but the player cannot affect
  the database in any way until the flag is removed.  Usually a means of
  gagging a player and enforcing non-logon punishment.
* @nuking:  Deletion of a character from the database.
* Newpasswording:  Changing a character's password for any amount of time.
* Sitebanning:  Disallowing all connections to the MUX from a player's site.
"Justice System":
  While Shadowrun MUX is in no way a democracy, we have in place an 
administrative staff to provide checks and balances so that no one is 
unduly or unfairly punished.  As per NEWS ADMIN STRUCTURE, you may appeal 
any decision made "up the chain" of command--but keep in mind, when doing 
so, that we talk to one another.  Rarely will any punitive action be 
taken without an agreement among admins and Wizards.

otherwise get into arguments with *PLAYERS* or *ADMINS*. 
    
        DO NOT PESTER OR HARASS *ANYONE* WITH OOC PAGES OR COMMENTS.
  
 This is unacceptable, rude, and extremely childish.  IC roleplaying is
another thing - your character may be cruising for a bruising, but it's
OK.  Pages, OOC chatter, +mail and the like constitute communication
between players, and therefore you are harassing the PERSON.
   
 What is harassment?  Harassment is continuing to page, +mail, or 
chatter OOCly with someone who has indicated offense at your tone, 
content, or statements  after they have asked you to cease and desist.
  
 In a legal sense, what you do could be construed as harassment, and
even though there is a whole Internet between players, one could still
be charged with a criminal offence.

ShadowRun MUX has one cardinal sin:  using OOC knowledge ICly.
Don't do it.
 
OOC knowledge means, simply, out of character knowledge.  The term
refers to any information of any kind you, the player, gain, that your
character doesn't know.  Using OOC knowledge IC refers to the practice
of having your character make decisions on the basis of things that
you, the player, know about and your character does not.
 
It's impossible to forbid people to find out about things OOC, and we
don't try to.  We understand that you talk to your friends about the
game, and such.  We merely ask that you not take unfair advantage of
others.  We also feel that using OOC knowledge IC makes the game less
fun for everyone, yourself included.

A 'shadowed' command is a command that you create (usually upon yourself)
that 'catches' another command's input.  An example of this is creating a 
'$tt *' command on yourself, so you can spy on tabletalk.
THIS IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL!  Such an infraction will result in the nuking of
your character.

  If, for *ANY* reason, your character picks up something that is NOT
yours by purchase, you *MUST* get in contact with a judge AT THAT TIME
so the judge may decide if it was In Character for you to have been
able to steal things.
 
  If you do NOT use a judge to aid in your nefarious activities, and you
get caught, you will probably meet an ignominious (bad thing, chummers!)
fate and be nuked.
 
  Some players may be familiar with MUDs, where anything not nailed down
is up for grabs.  Shadowrun MUX is not such a place.  Often, items which
are left lying about or rooms which are unlocked are that way because of
(perhaps) code oversights or the simple fact that the obviousness of not
being able to steal from the place or enter it to begin with is in the
description of the room.  We rely on players to use common sense in
entering areas which are unlocked but whose descs indicate that they are
high security, we do not code "mobs" to guard everywhere.

       Detroit being the Auto capital of the world still to this day is 
filled with land marks marking historical events, and those marking time's 
that would rather have been forgotten.  
       Such places as the Renaissance Hotel, and the Henry Ford Museum are 
place's that shall outlive time itself.  While other place's like The 
Windsor Tunnel have marked the death of many individuals and the downfall 
of relations with what at one time was Canada. 
       Alamos 20K claimed responsibility for the destruction of the 
famous tunnel, connecting Michigan to it's neighboring country.  However 
no evidence has been brought to light on such claim's.  
       During 2012 when the Ares corp decided to make it's home in Detroit,
they began building the four hundred plus floor arcology.  This mass tower
of black-golden walled terror is what is referred to as the Tower of Death
by many.  This is Ares's main arcology.  While none of the major R&D projects
are carried out within those walls, some claim that they have seen Lazarus 
the Dragon land atop the building.  Some suspect that this beast deals 
with the mysterious, powerful Damien Knight.  However such accusations are 
purely speculation.  
       The Detroit Tiger's stadium which was at one time in inner city 
Detroit was destroyed in 1999. In the beginning of the opening 
season for baseball the new Stadium went up right across the street from 
the old one.  Opening on the year 2000.  It was regarded as one of the 
engineering feats of the century for being built so quickly.  Needless to 
say, the Tiger's lost the next three years consecutively.  However, in the 
year 2004, they brought the pennant back to Detroit, where it belongs.

NEWS DETROIT CLIMATE
 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

       Detroit is in a temperate climate zone.  The four seasons come and 
go like any other northern hemisphere area.  Winter's tend to be extremely 
cold at times, with the lake effect snow coming from Lake Ontario, and 
Lake Huron.  However, with the normal Michigan weather, the old quote, "If 
you don't like the weather, wait five minutes." still stands true.  In 
the middle of dead winter Detroit's been known to have temperatures one 
day reach to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, then the next being -32.  The 
Detroit area is known for getting massive amounts of snow during this time 
of year.  January is the time when it starts to really cool down, though.  
       Spring time in Detroit is actually very refreshing, although 
soggy.  Places such as Downtown Detroit have been known to flood.  
Usually this time of year, the masses begin to become more active, as the 
sun shines through, warming things up.  The temperature during this 
time can be anywhere from blistering cold, to unusually hot.  Hey, it's 
Michigan were talking about.
       Summer time in Michigan is just that.  HOT and MUGGY.  The 
humidity level in the inner city is very high, and those lucky enough to 
have air conditioners use them on a hourly basis.  The bad thing is, that 
this HOT trend usually does not let up during the summer.  It's hot and 
it stays hot.  With the humidity factored in, it becomes sticky, and 
quit tiring.  Heat stroke, and sun burn patients are admitted to Detroit 
General on a daily basis.
       The fall in Michigan is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable 
time most residents can think of.  The trees turn colors, and the 
leaves fall.  This becomes quite the tourist season, as many take 
the Am-Track train into upper Ontario to see the leaves and waterfalls.  
Coming along with this season is the dreaded Devil's night.  During this 
time, the night before Halloween, Detroit become the playground for 
rapists, arsonists, and gangs.  Literally all hell breaks lose.  Police 
are out in full force, and the fire dept. is on full alert.  Riots, 
murders, city wide fires have broken out on nights such as these.  And 
just because Knight Errant has laid claim to Detroit as its Home office, 
don't be fooled into thinking it's now safe.  With the extra law 
enforcement, it makes the evil-hearted want to strike out more against 
society.  Citizens have formed local security unions to prevent the 
damages caused from this night.  Although police try to detour such 
action, many people don't listen, and as a result end up dead in a ditch.

Public Transportation has became a major concern during the early 
2010's.  The streets seemed to be so packed that even the Police 
Officers on horseback couldn't navigate the sea of asphalt.  During this 
time, Detroit's pointless L-train became more alive with people who 
refused to drive to work on the cluttered streets and highways.  The 
Traffic Commission couldn't keep up with the constant use of the road 
system, and the streets literally began to fall apart.  When the city 
learned that the Ares Corporation was building its HQ in the inner city, 
they  hoped that they would help rebuild the intricate street system.  
And that they did.  Not only did they rebuild the streets to the 
wonderful condition they're in today, they also installed a subway system 
underneath the old city, and expanded the L-train.  The once congested 
streets of Detroit have now receded slightly, and horses are once 
again able to walk down the sidewalks. It just made it so more cars 
can fit on the road and didn't help much.

        The major colleges around the Detroit area that we will be using 
will be Wayne State University.  This is a Liberal Arts school, not 
specializing in any one topic, but covering all the areas of undergraduate 
education.  WSU has always been a rather laid-back school.  The campus 
not particularly nice looking, seeing as how it was built in the center 
of downtown.  The professors are of mid-level knowledge, and not exactly 
the best in the state.  However the school has won previous awards for 
its high rate of students who find jobs after graduating.  No percentage 
is assigned to those who become Shadowrunners. 
        Around the turn of the century when the awakening began, the 
school was opposed to changing it's curriculum.  However after the schools 
board of directors noticed that a lot of would-be full-time students were 
going to the University of Michigan and Michigan State University for their 
higher-level education on topics such as HoloLISP programming, Thaumaturgy,
as well as  Magical Theory, they decided it was time to succumb to the 
changing times.  They took on extra professors, and asked the community 
for extra funds to build an extra wing for those such classes.
In time their class loads began to exceed their teaching capabilities.
Eventually the school has become widely recognized for it's teaching's in 
Magical Theory and Matrix development.  At this time the school had a matrix 
node of its own established for VR classes for those who possessed a 
desktop computer and had the knowledge to operate it.

Weapon Offenses:
  1) Possession: 
     The owning or _carrying_ of equipment or firearms designated as 
     restricted items-basically, the offender has the weapon on him at the 
     time the officer apprehends him.
 
  2) Transport: 
     The act of carrying or transporting said items, either on one's person 
     or in a vehicle. Mostly when an offender is traveling with such a 
     weapon at the time of his arrest.
 
  3) Threat: 
     Brandishing weapon in public, regardless of use. Carrying an 
     externally visible weapon, such as a gun stuck in a belt, is 
     considered a threat.
 
  4) Use: 
     Use of any weapon against living targets, public or private property, 
     and any usage in the general vicinity of living targets, public or 
     private property. Only concerned with actual usage, not any harm 
     caused, or intent to harm. (e.g., a gun is fired into the ground in a 
     public area, causing no damage to persons or property)
 
  5) Intent: 
     As above, when the intention to explicitly damage said targets is 
     present. (e.g., the offender fires a rifle into a patrol car purposely 
     to stop pursuit.)
 
  These offenses rarely come alone, and are only for the weapons. Damage 
  caused and lives taken incur their own penalties and sentences.
 
  For qualifying individuals, permits are available. Each individual item 
  must be separately registered, and a broad category permit may be issued
  for registered weapons. See forthcoming news entry on permits for further
  information.

Murder 1: First-degree murder. 
  A charge or premeditated murder is difficult to prove, and thus is 
  rarely filed. To be charged with Murder one, it must be proved that the 
  suspect planned and conspired to kill his victim.
  Death Penalty(30 yrs to life, no parole)
 
Murder 2: Homicide. 
  Second-degree murder is that charge filled when direct intent to kill is 
  provable, but when it is not possible to prove premeditation.  For 
  example, if a bar patron gets angry, pulls out a gun, and shoots the man 
  sitting next to him, the charge is homicide. The intent to kill is 
  obvious, but no premeditation.
  10 yrs-life
 
Murder 3: Manslaughter. 
  Any action that results in the accidental death of an individual. In 
  cases where death occurs but the intent to kill is not provable, the 
  charge is usually manslaughter.

[EDITOR'S NOTE: This policy was originally drawn from the Lone Star 
  Sourcebook, then softened considerably to avoid the culture shock and 
  challenges to a MUX-style setting that such a hostile environment would 
  create. As of this moment, spells have not been completely retrofitted 
  into the weapons violations systems, but this work is underway.]
 
Magical Law in Detroit:
     Part of your SIN records show that you're a magician or not (handy for
medical things too). You are required by law to take a course in magical
responsibility and basics in like high school or something, or you don't 
get a diploma (big deal, it gives people an excuse to have at least a 1 
skill in their magic stuff). You can go through life just fine like that, 
and stave off the corp recruiters that see that magic flag on the database 
or do like NPCs to and get hired on. :) Now, if you wanna LEGALLY be 
empowered to cast harmful magics, you get this expensive permit that costs 
you (or your employer) 5k per year. If you learn a combat magic technique 
along the way and don't tell anyone, you can still use it in that 
timestop.... just don't let the cops see it or they slap a big ol' fine 
on your for something akin to the use of an unregistered military-grade 
firearm.
 
 This promotes: 
 A> Magical characters working for corps (recruited and they'll have 
    the corps pay that fun permit thing). 
 B> The cops can tell if they have to send in special teams when they
    arrest you. 
 C> It makes sure PCs keep the fact that they know combat magic as
    hidden as much as the fact that they have that cache of SMGs hidden 
    in their apartment.
 
     Summoners are held accountable for the actions of their spirits by the
reasoning that a spirit is an extension of or under the orders of its summoner.
If they have combat-oriented foci and/or fetishes and no permit, they are fined
for possession.  If they're caught using it then that's additional penalties.
Remember: just because you cast a spell/broke in astrally/used your x-ray
vision to look through the wall/sprouted a third arm doesn't mean that you're
any less guilty. In fact, it's automatically considered "premeditated" because
it requires concentration and intent to use magic. You could get proven guilty
that much easier.
