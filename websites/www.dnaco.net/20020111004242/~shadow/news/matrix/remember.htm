      <p>1. When you load programs or files, on the cdhelp it says <b>&lt;program 
        or file&gt;</b>, please use program if its a program or file if its a 
        file.<br>
        <br>
        2. THE MATRIX IS IC, which means if your in the matrix and something<br>
        happens I don't want to hear I'm just checking it out.<br>
        <br>
        3. There are also some system commands that will need a judge present. 
        If you need to do one of these commands, check the +staff and see if there 
        is a MJudge ON duty, if so use the mjudge call, if not please @mail your 
        request to *MatrixRP.<br>
        <br>
        4. There is a deck command now for MAGLAND and SHADOWLAND. check it out. 
        And don't forget about the public database called SeaSource where the 
        online email database is at.<br>
        <br>
        5. Please the computers have 2 DELETE commands: <b>DELETE &lt;filename&gt;</b> 
        for text files, and <b>+DELETE PROGRAM FILE</b>, for program. If you use 
        the <b>DELETE &lt;filename&gt;</b> for program being programed, it will 
        mess up your storage memory.<br>
        <br>
        6. You will also see on the status <b>Program&lt;#&gt;_0</b>, just ignore 
        that _0 it's just that source code doesn't have a rating.<br>
        <br>
        7.Two Types of TASK bonuses:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Task Pool- </b>is a pool of dice like a combat pool, this pool is used 
        to<br>
        increase your chance at doing something technical. Encephalon and Math 
        SPU effects this, which effects how many dice you will roll to see if 
        you can program the program or hardware and how long it will take.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Task Bonus-</b> is a bonus to when you programing on how long it actually 
        will take you per hour. So if you task bonus is 3 it means every hour 
        you work, you're actually doing 4 because of the hardware you're using.<br>
        <br>
        8. File Finding Commands<br>
        <br>
        Ok, a reminder:<b> scan_file </b>is used to check for files placed on 
        the host, <b>locate_file </b>is used for TP runs and such where the info 
        is not actually typed out on the host. And to retrieve files found through 
        a <b>locate_file,</b> you would use the <b>file subsystem test</b> command, 
        not the <b>read_file</b>.<br>
        <br>
        9.To contact a judge or admin of the matrix staff you have 3 choices.<br>
        <br>
        1. <b>@mail MJudge</b>, This will add you in the matrix judge queue so 
        only one matrix admin gets it. Please send TP runs and such here.<br>
        <br>
        2. <b>@mail *MatrixRP</b>, This is used to inform all the matrix admins 
        about something going on in the matrix or around the matrix. Please don't 
        send TP's here unless you think every matrix admin needs to know.<br>
        <br>
        3. And to call a MJudge you can use the <b>+mjudge &lt;message&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        10. And lastly The mjudges can not see your OOC messages in the matrix,<br>
        we are not in the same object as you so we will never see it.<br>
        <br>
        11. From now on you must wait at least 15 seconds before doing<br>
        commands. As there is now a 10 second wait in the command that checks 
        the ICE and alerts. If you do the commands too fast you may trigger more 
        then one piece at you and it could be even worse for you.<br>
        <br>
        To <b>SEE </b>how to post files with audio and other effects check this 
        out:<br>
        <br>
        <b>&lt;&lt;DISPLAY SMILE&gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;ENTER NAME&lt;&lt;</b><br>
        <br>
        Those are correct version of input and output. Not, <b>*display smile* 
        </b>or anything such the like.<br>
        <br>
        Now you don't just have to DISPLAY something, you could add AUDIO?<br>
        MOVIE?<br>
        <br>
        Hence, <b>&lt;&lt;AUDIO: (LISP) Opiate, Tool&gt;&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        AUDIO being the routine sent to your deck, kinda like modern day Java. 
        LISP being the sound language. Now that is not totally right, since I 
        have no idea what the AUDIO language is for modern day decks but nothing 
        like bullshitting ehh? ;) Opiate being the song, and Tool being the group. 
        Now, that group doesn't exist in 2056, but that is just an example.<br>
        <br>
        Ever think of corrupting your Text? Example: <b>&lt;&lt;DATA CORRUPTED: 
        .05Mps&gt;&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        Those are pretty cool too.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SIDE NOTE </b>- when adding returns and tabs in your messages please<br>
        remember to add 2 percents not one percent thanks allot.<br>
        <br>
        <b>*****Combat Posing*****<br>
        </b><br>
        1. When you pose your attack, make sure it includes what your attack program 
        looks like, and try to make it as detailed as possible.<br>
        <br>
        2. Then do the attack command, check out +cdhelp combat for the correct 
        command.<br>
        <br>
        3. Now, at this point the mjudge will tell you what happens and they may 
        or may not ask you to pose the miss or hit.<br>
        <br>
        <b>****Program Posing*****</b>
      <p>Every time you do a system command you MUST pose what your icon and program 
        if loaded would look like as you're doing the command. And remember -- 
        in general, your program will act the same way, just may look different 
        depending on the host's theme.<br>
        <br>
        <b>****MATRIX SPEED REMINDER****</b><br>
        <br>
        Just a reminder, when you go into a matrix host, don't zip along commands 
        like nobody's business. 
      <p>1) You could trigger something. MJudges can get in there and unlock your 
        deck and get things set up without you even knowing you triggered, but 
        if you slam off commands left and right, the mjudges<br>
        can't do that. 
      <p>2) Sometimes a judge will be following you. MJudges will follow you from 
        place to place, and then spring surprises on you when you're least expecting 
        it. However, if you hop into one host, then into the<br>
        next, you might trigger something and miss it.<br>
        <br>
        So, when you hop into a host make sure you take time to read the<br>
        description, and pose your system commands as well. Always pose. A good 
        10 to 15 second wait after a command can't hurt and it'll increase RP 
        potential. 
      <p><b>NOTE: </b>you must make a pose for EVERY system command you do. If 
        you are masking/hiding you can use <b>|&lt;your persona emit&gt;</b>. 
        This will<br>
        emit to any Immortals in the room, not other deckers.<br>
        <br>
        <b>ROLEPLAYING LOGS<br>
        </b><br>
        If you have any MATRIX RELATED Roleplaying logs, feel free to send them 
        to me. Also, any roleplay logs of selling programs or programed source 
        coded MUST have MJudge approval and a log must be sent to Rubik. This 
        doesn't mean if you're sitting in a bar and a friend asks you for the 
        address to SHADOWLAND and that's it, you should send it. Nope, this is 
        actual drawn out RP. And if it's IN The matrix, more kudos to you. 
      <p>So, send them in to : <b><a href="mailto:ccdsf@dnaco.net">ccdsf@dnaco.net</a> 
        </b>with &quot;Matrix RP Log&quot; in the subject, and I'll see what I 
        can do for you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>LONG FILE REMINDER</b><br>
        <br>
        Okay, just a little reminder. If you see a post in SHADOWLAND or MAGLAND, 
        or anywhere for that matter, that looks long, do us a favor and don't 
        add on to it. Start another file, named <b>Blah2 </b>or something like 
        that --just reply in another file. If you make one file too large, you'll 
        start cutting out the end (you can see that on a couple of old posts). 
        Just a<br>
        helpful reminder to keep us all fully informed. :) 
      <p><b>Computer Memory and Storage</b><br>
        <br>
        Do not forget when you purchase a computer, it comes standard with 75 
        MP of memory. You purchase the computer with online storage, not ACTIVE. 
        Program1ming Memory uses Active Memory, not Storage/Online, so you may 
        need to upgrade that to active at some point.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Reporting Bugs<br>
        </b><br>
        This will be your only warning, if you come across a bug and don't report<br>
        it, Dixon does not ask question you will be nuked. Sorry, he doesn't play<br>
        games. So make sure those bugs are reported to him through @mail.
