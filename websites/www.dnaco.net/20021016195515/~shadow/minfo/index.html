<h5>What is Shadowrun: Seattle?</h5>
Shadowrun: Seattle is a Multi User Shared Hallucination, otherwise know as MUSH. It's an online game played by multiple people across the world online interactively and simultaneously playing the Shadowrun game system made by FASA Interactive and now owned by WizKids LCC. A MUSH is very similar to other text based online games, such as MUDs or DIKUs or MUXs. There are some large differences however. First, there are no automated monsters to kill, or quests to run. The atmosphere is what you make it, it is a role-playing environment which depends on mature, honest, imaginative people to function. The MUSH is hosted by Dnaco.net and the graciousness of it's employees and controlers that allow us to quietly spin on an unused server.

To help you get the best understanding of what a MUSH is, how to navigate and generally how to play on one, we've scrounged together an excellent set of resources. Some of this we received permission to utilize by a defunct game, some of it we've written from scratch and some of it we've put together from research over the years.
