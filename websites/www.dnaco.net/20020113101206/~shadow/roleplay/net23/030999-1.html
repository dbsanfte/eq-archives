<P><I>The scene opens up as if you were staring down unto a paper, a pair of arms in a fine quality suit rest, as he opens the newspaper widely, imediately the words 'Business Upfront' are shown. Then a quick list of sprawl sheets. Slowly names begin to flow along, as it opens with the Boston Stock Exchange. The words of an obviously English man begin to fill the frequency, a small window popping along the bottom left corner, the background black, as he wears simple clothing, only a butterfly collared shirt and slacks. Middle aged, and human.</I></P> 

<P>        "The market has never felt such a day since the Crash of '29, with the sorrowful lost of one of the Markets wisest Commander's and Chiefs of the Market, Tadamako Shibanokuji, of the imperial nation of Japan, his presence will be missed sincerely in the world of business." The man pauses, clearing his throat slightly, as slowly prices continue to flow along, Ares Arms on the rise once more it seems with there introduction of Smart Focusing systems.</P>

<P>        " In the Boston Market, prices are on the uprise, as the entire market rises on an average of 5.2 points, with the exception of the spotlights of the day, Ares Macrotechnology's Ares Arms, and the Yamatetsu Corporation." The screen splits once more the listings still keeping the majority of the screen, but a smaller window, which slowly develops clarity and focus of sound, begins to show a picture of the familiar Ares Macrotechnology HQ in the too close Metroplex of Detroit.</P>
<P>        A new voice begins, that of an Ork with the slurs within his speech: " Aris Ahms has announced th' foundin' o' a simpler imaging system o' th' spectrum of there Smartlink systems...." the Ork continues to drone on and on about the electronical pinnacles for nearly a minute, before a suddenly flash to Kyoto, Japan is shown, the HQ of Yamatetsu slowly imaging in the ideal Urban home, the computer crafted image oh so familiar from PR releases.</P>

<P>"The prices of the Yamatetsu have never felt such a hard hit in its existence." a voice begins, that of a Japanese woman, human. "With the death of Chairman of the Board Tadamako Shibanokuji, and the release of the benevant of his last will and testament, Yuri Shibanokuji, his son. Gaining all control of his father's stock, as well as his immense fortune in the believed value of 1.5 billion NuYen."  She pauses, as the image slowly circulates to that of the now familiar Ork face of Yuri.</P>

<P>"With the transfer of majority shareholder moving from the skilled father to the apprenticing prodigal son, the value of the stock has dropped an astonishing 350 points in a single day along the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with the Boston and Geneva showing similar traits, but less extreme, at 150 and 250 respectively, of all Yamatetsu owned Subsidaries.</P>
<P>        The little known company's expertise in the fields of cybertechnology, electronics and Heavy Industries, is a small known one due to the fact that they do not register there name with all the subsidaries they own, preferring to allow them to make there own name, this is another factor in the amazing drop of the Mother-Ship corporations stock. Will this be the end of Yamatetsu? Unlikely, for they still have the seasoned shareholder Saru Iwano, the CEO of the corporation to this date. Never doubt a tier triple-A corp, even when it shows weakness..." are the last words she mutters, before it returns to the paper only, as the stock listing continue for 5 minutes. Then the normal routine begins once more. </P>
