Hulk wanders up the sidewalk, towards the Banshee. 

You pull back on the steel door, entering the Banshee. 

Banshee - Entrance Foyer 
Obvious exits: 

Front Bar &lt;FB&gt; Street &lt;S&gt; 

Hulk hands over his SMG to the ork, then steps through the cage door. 

Marko pats you down for weapons and buzzes you through, and the door is 
  opened from the other side.

Deck of Cards 
Obvious exits: 

Entrance Hallway &lt;O&gt; The Sandbox &lt;SB&gt; Wooden Door &lt;WD&gt; Office Door &lt;OD&gt; 
  Storage &lt;S&gt; 

Hulk steps through the cage door, smiling to himself. He briefly glances 
  around the room before heading for the counter. 
Hulk nods to Winter as he passes. 

Tanya stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 

Hulk smiles. "Hola, Tanya!" 

Tanya says "I've got to run for a bit though. See you around?" 

Kristin is sitting at the bar sipping a beer, speaking with Tanya." 
Kristin nods. "Stay Chill." 

Hulk nods. "Sure thing, hon. Later..." 

Winter looks up to Hulk and smiles softly, then looks away as he calls 
  to Tanya. 

You sit down at the Wooden bar. 

Tanya waves at Hulk. "Bad timing muscles." 
Tanya grins. 

Hulk chuckles. "Story of my life..." 

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Tanya just looked you over&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 

Tanya smiles and pats him on the cheek. "I bet. Seeya." 

You say "And I put my jacket on special for ya..." 

Hulk grins. "See you around soon, I hope..." 

Tanya grins. "Bah, any team that plays for a dragon deserves to lose." 
Tanya heads out the front. 

Kristin watches the interaction a moment, scanning the rest of the bar. 

Tanya waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the steel 
  cage before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Tanya has left. 

Hulk laughs as he turns back to the bar. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk waves to Sharon. "Usual, Shar, please?" 
At the wooden bar, Sharon places an opened beer bottle and a large bowl 
  of pretzels in front of the large man. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk smiles and pays her as he takes his first 
  swallow of the beer. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk swivels round on his stool, looking more closely 
  at the patrons of the bar. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin eyes Hulk openly a moment, making rings on 
  the bar with her mug. 

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Kristin just looked you over&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 

At the wooden bar, Hulk nods politely, still smiling, to the unknown 
  woman, then continues his scan around. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin hmms to herself, taking a shallow sip of her 
  drink. 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige nods to Hulk as Hulk's eyes fall on him. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk begins to feed pretzels into his mouth, but 
  continues to glance at Kristin from the corner of his eye now and 
  again. 

Dr. Jon Nash steps through the front door. 
Dr. Jon Nash enters on his cane. 
Dr. Jon Nash has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin seems content to sip her drink, eyelids half 
  closed as she stares off 
At the wooden bar, Hulk shakes his head and turns to face Kristin, 
  grinning. "Hell, I'm sorry. I have a bad habit of admiring attractive 
  women. The name's Hulk, although my friends call me Leo." He extends a 
  hand. 

Dr. Jon Nash heads to the bar. 
Dr. Jon Nash sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Dr. Jon Nash joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin quirks an eyebrow, leaning in to shake the 
  offered hand. "Kris. Pleasure tameetya." 

Dr. Jon Nash sits near Kristin. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk nods. "Likewise." He sits back and leans against 
  the bar after acknowledging Dr. Nash's arrival. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin flicks her gaze over Nash, nodding. "Rere." 
At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash nods to the bar in general. "Evenin' 
  all." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk raises his bottle in greeting, then takes 
  another swig. 

Cara steps through the front door. 
Cara has arrived. 
Cara steps through the cage, stopping briefly and looking around the 
  bar. 

Kristin sits at the bar, sipping a beer, looking decidedly bored 

At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash says "A slow night I see." 

Lord Saige is sitting at the far end of the bar sipping a barely touched 
  drink. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin says "It gets much slower, time will stand 
  still." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin sighs, gesturing for a refill. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk grunts in amusement. "Well, nobody's started any 
  brawls since I arrived..." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin perks, "A brawl would be good." 
At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash says "Perhaps you should start one." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin looks around for any likely combatants. 

Winter stands and leaves the Table in front of the bar. 

Cara walks over towards the bar, easily making her way through the light 
  evening crowd. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk grins at Nash. "But then I'd have to leave my 
  nice, comfortable spot here at the bar, and go into the SandBox, neh?" 
At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash twists his back and cracks his back. 

Winter stands up with a small yawn, stretching her arms a bit, then 
  heads toward the bar. 

At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash says "I'm thinking you would." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Be better'n sittin' round, tho, eh?" 

Winter sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Winter joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk eyes Kristin speculatively, with a broad grin. 
  "Why, you offerin'?" 

Cara shrugs off her jacket on the way to the bar, dropping it and her 
  bag on a stool before sitting down. 
Cara sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Cara joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin chuckles. "D'nno, yer a big 'un." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Course, depends on the odds I'd get." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk shrugs as he chuckles. "That's why it's so damn' 
  hard to get practice in. I keep having to go over to the gym in the ED 
  and beat up keeblers..." 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige nods to each of the newer arrivals as the 
  sit. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk glances sideways and nods. "Hola, Casey..." 
At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash says "That good are you...?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin snorts. "And THAT'S practice? 
At the wooden bar, Cara nods a bit, looking over at Sharon, pointedly. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk winks at Kristin. "Well, occasionally I haveta 
  make it look good..." 
At the wooden bar, Dr. Jon Nash smiles as Cara sits. "Evenin' Case..." 
At the wooden bar, Sharon frowns at Cara, and makes her wait a full 
  minute before walking over. "Whacha want?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Ahhh. Welp, I ain' much good, but I 
  suppose I could tussle with ya. Course, I JUST got my nails done..."" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin grins, tone sarcastic 
At the wooden bar, Cara looks over at Nash and smiles a bit, "Evenin'." 
At the wooden bar, Cara looks at Sharon, "Usual." she says quietly. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk grins as he slides off his stool. "Well...only 
  if yer sure...I mean, I wouldn't want you to break one..." 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige frowns slightly as Sharon ignores Cara for 
  alomst a full minute. 
At the wooden bar, Sharon looks derisively at Cara, "And _that_ is...?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin eyes her nails, hmming. "Eh, sure. Why not." 
At the wooden bar, Cara sighs a bit, looking back to Sharon, "Triple 
  cognac, on the rocks." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk smiles and bows slightly, waving an arm towards 
  the Sandbox door. "Be my guest..." 

You stand and leave the Wooden bar. 

Hulk leaves the area of the bar and walks smoothly across the room 
  towards the indicated door. 

Kristin slips off her stool, taking her beer mug with her. 

Leaphorn steps through the front door. 
Leaphorn has arrived. 

Kristin stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 
Kristin whistles merrily, heading towards the door for the Sandbox. 

You head into the Sandbox Room. 

Banshee - The Sandbox Room 
Obvious exits: 

Front Bar &lt;FB&gt; 

Kristin enters the Sandbox Room from the front bar. 
Kristin has arrived. 

Hulk wanders across to the Sandbox itself, apparently humming to himself 
  with the music. 

You sit down at the The Sandbox. 

Kristin whistles to herself, wandering by a table and setting her beer 
  down. 
Kristin sits down at the Small standing-table near sandbox. 
Kristin stands and leaves the Small standing-table near sandbox. 
Kristin sits down at the The Sandbox. 
Kristin joins you. 

Hulk watches Kristin. "So, what rules you wanna play by? Armor, just 
  guards, or nothing?" 

Kristin wanders into the Sandbox, pulling her jacket off, tossing it to 
  one side. She starts unbuckling her gunrig, shrugging it off, and the 
  question. "Don't rightly matter to me." 

Hulk shrugs as he removes his jacket. 
Hulk removes his heavy jacket. 

Dr. Jon Nash enters the Sandbox Room from the front bar. 
Dr. Jon Nash enters on his cane. 
Dr. Jon Nash has arrived. 

Cara enters the Sandbox Room from the front bar. 
Cara has arrived. 

Kristin takes off the heavy belt as well, a second pistol visible on it 
  as she sets that next to the gunrig on her jacket. 

Dr. Jon Nash heads to the booth in the near corner. 

Cara walks in behind Dr. Jon Nash, looking the box over and wincing at 
  the blaring noise. 

Hulk watches Kristin as she removes her guards. "You sure about this? I 
  don't mind if you want to keep the armor and/or the guards on..." 

Kristin pulls off her ball cap, tossing it onto her jacket, pulling a 
  scrunchy out of a pocket, quickly and efficently tying her hair down, 
  pulling it into a tight bun on her head. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks to Kristin. "Do you really want to do this?" 

Hulk strips off his webbing belt as he speaks, and begins to unbutton 
  his shirt. 

Kristin laughs, "My sensi never allowed us armour." 

Dr. Jon Nash says "I'm sure we can find a replacement." 

Hulk shrugs and removes his shirt, then his Armaguards. 

Hawkins walks in and looks around the room. He picks a good vantage 
  point and leans up against the wall. 

Winter slides into the nearest booth as she enters the room, crossing 
  her legs and holding her beer close to her chest, having a few 
  occasional sips as she watches the box. 

Hulk is stretching slowly as he watches Kristin. He nods, "Yeah, I know 
  what it's like to get out of practice. Lemme rephrase this, then. Have 
  you ever done any pitfighting, or are you just a theory student?" 

Winter sits down at the Booth against back wall. 

Kristin smiles a bit to Hulk, "I've done more than a little fighting." 

Leaphorn follows Winter, sitting next to her. As he takes his seat, he 
  leans in, saying something quietly. 
Leaphorn sits down at the Booth against back wall. 

Cara smiles a bit at that, sipping her cognac and looking at the seated 
  Nash. 

Kristin twists again, then rises to her feet. 

Winter nods to Leaphorn and whispers something back. 

Cara mutters to Dr. Jon Nash, "... be iteresting, to... the least." 

In the Sandbox, Hulk nods with satisfaction. "Good." He too straightens, 
  and gives a little bow in the direction of his opponent. 

Kristin bends, still standing, bringing her head down to knees, holding 
  that position a few seconds, then straightens. She bows, eyes on Hulk. 

Hulk moves into a casual but competent-looking, generic martial arts 
  ready stance. 

Kristin drops back, in a neutral stance, watching and waiting, hands at 
  her sides. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Slight pause - I conned an admin into judging this... 
  ;)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Kristin says, "We got an Admin." 

Kristin sinks into a crouch, watching, then rises. 

Rae has arrived. 

Hulk and Kristin face each other in the Sandbox itself, both in ready 
  stances. 

Cara drops into a seat at the booth, next to her stuff. 
Cara sits down at the Booth in the near corner. 

Rae sits down at the The Sandbox. 
Rae joins you. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks up and around, "Anyone want to put some some 
  money...?" 

Hulk takes a quick step back at the mention of money and without moving 
  his attention, says, "Money? Who you betting on, amigo?" 

Kristin straightens, breaking stance and looks over, ammused. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "I don't bet, _amigo_. I just take the bets." 
Dr. Jon Nash says "Losing bet plays a ten percent vig...." 

Hulk laughs. "Except that I know almost everyone here, and I'd trust 'em 
  to pay up..." 

You say "Seems a mite silly for them to pay an extra ten percent..." 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Vig has nothing to do with not paying." 
Dr. Jon Nash says "It's how we cover losses." 

Lynx enters the Sandbox Room from the front bar. 
Lynx has arrived. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Losing bet always plays ten percent." 
Dr. Jon Nash shakes his head as he speaks with Cara. 

Hulk shrugs. "Well, anyone want to bet against me, talk to me now..." 

Kristin takes this break to stretch out more 

Cara mutters to Dr. Jon Nash, "I'll put a kay... the chica. " 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Are you trying to take my business, friend...?" 

You say "Ah, sorry, misunderstood yer system. Bit different down in 
  Denver. Well, I'm happy to put a couple of thou on myself..." 

Dr. Jon Nash watches Hulk. 
Dr. Jon Nash says "Done." 

Winter is sitting in the booth nearest the door, watching the soon-to-be 
  fighters, looking a bit bored. She looks up as Lynx enters, smiles 
  politely to the woman, then looks back, glancing to Leaphorn for a 
  second. 

Kristin pops her jaw a few times, then her knuckles, watching the 
  patrons bet. 

Leaphorn steps back in from the bathroom, coat swaying slightly with his 
  movements. Smoothly, he moves across the room, towards the booth 
  against the back wall. In a solid voice, expression still deadpan, 
  seeming somewhat tired, he looks to Nash. "People bettin', Jon?" 

Hulk nods. "Okay, two thousand it is." He then shuts up and steps 
  forward again, into his ready stance. 

Hawkins nods. "I'll put a thousand on....hmm....the lady." 

Lynx leans up against a blank spanse of wall, observing. In one hand, 
  she holds some sort of cream based drink. A little of it traces upon 
  her upper lip in a rakish 'stash. 

Leaphorn slides into a seat, speaking as he relaxes into a seat, leaning 
  back, crossing his right ankle over his left knee. "Five thousand on 
  Hulk." 
Leaphorn says "To whoever wants to take the bet." 
Leaphorn then stretches, folding his arms casually across his chest. 

Kristin listens to a few bets, then grins at Hulk, "Seems I am the 
  definate underdog, eh?" 

Dr. Jon Nash says "I think I'll limit the bets to five thousand this 
  evening." 

A few other patrons place bets, most running towards the man, a few on 
  the woman. 

Hulk winks back. "They know me, they don't know you..." 

Kristin says "Yeah, that figures...hell of a way to kill an evening, 
  taking on the bar champ."" 

Leaphorn shrugs lightly. "Whatever y'decide on." He unfolds his arms, 
  picking up his mug of beer lightly in one leather-wrapped hand. "He 
  ain't the bar champ." 
Leaphorn smiles slightly. "Just close to it." 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Bets are closing. Shall we begin?" 

Leaphorn winks, and raises the mug to his lips to his lips, then his 
  smile fades, returning to its previous lack of expression. He takes a 
  small sip. 

Hulk shakes his head slightly. "I ain't champ. There's someone better 
  then me...but, far as I know, he's the only one..." He grins again, 
  enjoying the banter. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk thwaps Leaphorn for stealing his lines... 

&lt;&lt;OOC&gt;&gt; Leaphorn grins. 

Winter looks up to Hulk, "I was having a bad day.. next time.", she 
  winks playfully. 

Kristin takes a breath, watching hulk, and goes back to her neutral 
  stance, nodding a bit. "Welp, Semper Fi and all that wiz stuff." 

Leaphorn sits down at the Booth against back wall. 

Lynx watches the proceedings, her eyes tracing over the female 
  contender. She licks her lips and then moves towards a seat to watch. 
  Her gait is dancerlike, measured. She seems to be unaware of herself, 
  though. She nods to a few people as she sits, copper eyes going from 
  face to face in contemplation. 

Hawkins takes a drink from his beer and yells, "Kick his butt....In a 
  friendly, competitive way, but still....Take him down." He grins. 

Timestop has arrived. 

Rae dropped Timestop. 
Rae has dropped a Timestop. All participants in the scene that Rae is 
  running should IMMEDIATELY be quiet, stop typing and wait for 
  instructions from the judge. If you are not a participant, please do 
  not enter the Timestop nor ask to to join just to watch. DO NOT ENTER 
  THE TIMESTOP UNLESS TOLD TO BY THE JUDGE. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Rae says, "ignore this, it's for inits" 

Winter leans closer to Leaphorn, whispering to him. 

Leaphorn moves around a bit in his seat, getting comfortable. He quirks 
  an eyebrow at Winter. 

Winter nods to Leaphorn. 

Cara turns, putting a foot up on the booth across from her, watching the 
  pit. 

Winter stands and leaves the Booth against back wall. 
Winter stands and walks away from Leaphorn, not glancing back as she 
  heads into the main bar. 
Winter leaves the Sandbox, shutting the soundproofed door behind her. 
Winter has left. 

The Cellphone #44593 rings with an incoming audio-only call. 

Leaphorn nods slightly towards Winter, then leans back in his booth, 
  alone now. Watching the two in the pit idly, his eyes track their 
  forms, sizing them both up from head to toe. 

Hulk's FlipFone beeps insistently several times. He begins to look 
  embarrassed. 

Kristin giggles, glancing at the phone. 

Cara laughs quietly. 

Kristin says "That'll kill the mood, eh?" 

Hawkins swallows just in time to avoid embarrassment as he laughs. 

Kristin stands quietly, watching and waiting. 

Leaphorn shakes his head, a barely visible, amused smile twitching at 
  the corner of his upper lip. 

Lynx gets up and decides to sit on top of her booth table so she can see 
  better. She isn't very tall. Her eyes watch the two for a moment, but 
  then they wander to the crowd. She takes another sip of her toddy with 
  a quiet simper for the jest. 

Rae has cleared the +inits for this round. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks about. 
Dr. Jon Nash smiles as he nods at a couple of people. 

Hulk ignores the bleeping band on his wrist as his whole body seems to 
  tremble almost imperceptibly in readiness. 

Leaphorn leans out of his booth a bit, raising two fingers to catch the 
  attention of a passing waitress. "Slide me another beer here, hon. 
  Thanks." He pulls out his wallet, handing her a few crisp bills. 

Kristin's expression clears, and she takes a step forward, both hands 
  held open, eyes on Hulk's midsection, watching, waiting, body alert. 

You roll for initiative: 3d6 + 12 - 0 - 0 = 19 

Kristin quirks a smile, scooting forward another foot or so. 

Lynx puts her drink down on the table beside her, sitting a little 
  forwards as if she were into the game as well. 

Leaphorn's eyes scan to Lynx for a moment, and he raises an eyebrow, 
  watching her for a few seconds. Then, he chuckles dryly, shaking his 
  head to himself, leaning back in his seat again. 

Leaphorn exhales audibly, closing his eyes and rubbing his temples with 
  one hand. 

Hawkins leans against the wall, eyes watching the two closely. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks back at the SandBox. "Let's go. I have breakfast to 
  eat in the morning..." 

Kristin steps forward, snapping a quick set of punches towards Hulk, 
  neither falling near him. She drops to the ground, looking to take his 
  legs out with a quick sweep. 

You +proll 17 dice for Rae: 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 8 11 

Cara blinsk a bit, leaning forward in her seat, seemingly surprised as 
  the sudden turn of events. 

Lynx shifts again, looking to her right, eyes lidded. Her lips curl in a 
  self mocking expression and she ducks to her drink, again licking her 
  lips. 

Leaphorn doesn't change his expression in the least, watching the pair 
  with no emotion at all, scanning up and down the forms now and then. 

Hawkins opens his eyes wide, beer frozen halfway to his mouth, forgotten 
  now. 

Lord Saige enters the Sandbox Room from the front bar. 
Lord Saige has arrived. 
Lord Saige steps through the door:steps through the door, a half 
  finished glass in his hand. He steps to the side, leaning against the 
  wall to casualy observe. 

Hulk ignores the punch feints, his eyes following Kristin as she drops 
  down. He jumps up just far enough to clear the sweeping leg, then 
  lands and collapses to one knee, delivering a lightning-fast chop to 
  the extended knee joint of Kristin's leg. 

Lynx hums a melody with more enthusiasm than the content warrents. Those 
  who are fond of music might recognize "The lady is a tramp." She 
  winces for Kristen, but her expression smooths out and the music 
  continues, 

Leaphorn uncrosses his legs, sliding to the edge of the seat in the 
  booth, sitting so he's facing the pit, rather than the table. His 
  expression, however, doesn't change yet, still of an appraising 
  nature. 

Kristin continues the spin, taking the blow to the thigh instead of the 
  knee joint, rolling to one side and tumbling to the side, rising to 
  her feet, hissing a bit as she rises. 

Lord Saige takes a sip as he observes the action in the pit. He's 
  momentarily distracted by the sound of hummin, looking towards the 
  hummer. 

Leaphorn looks over at the hummer, then back at the pit. Stoic 
  expression cracking a bit, a faint smile flickers across his features. 
  He seems slightly amused. 

Kristin murmurs to herself, "ooookay..." 

Hulk gives her no time to recover, and rises in a swift, sure motion, 
  taking two steps towards Kristin before launching a kick directly for 
  her temple. However, as her hands begins to rise, his foot stamps back 
  down to the ground, and Hulk's hands deliver a blurred series of liver 
  kites into his opponent's torso, ending with a vicious palm stike 
  towards the point of her chin. 

Lynx seems to be enjoying herself, her voice cracking over the higher 
  riffs, but easily handling the lows. Her shoulders move liquidly with 
  the beat. She certainly doesn't seem to notice the attention. 

Cara winces a bit at the strikes, actually seeming unhappy with the 
  sudden attack. 

Leaphorn cocks his head, seeming either impressed, or pleased with the 
  sudden attack, exactly the opposite of Cara. 

You +proll 17 dice for Rae: 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 9 

Hawkins seems to engrossed in trying to follow the moves to notice much 
  else. 

Lynx shakes her head, the exact middle of Cara and Leaphorn. Her eyes 
  watch the moves with interest, the rest of her is unchanged as the 
  tides of the 'battle' flow. 

Kristin swears, executing a pair of quick blocks, but the strike to the 
  chin catches her flush, slamming her head over heels. She lands a good 
  meter or so from where she was, and spits blood. Raising a hand, she 
  says, "Ok, Bruiser, that's enough for me." 

Hulk nods quickly, and bows again before extending a hand towards 
  Kristin, offering to pull her up. 

Cara frowns a bit from her seat. 

Kristin takes the offered hand, rising to her feet, hobbling slightly on 
  her bum leg. "Well, that was ammusing." 

Lord Saige frowns noticably. He sips from his drink. 

Leaphorn lets a more visible smile slip over his features. 

Kristin spits blood again, sucking on her bottom lip. 

Cara stands, walking over towards the sandbox, leaving her bag and 
  jacket at the booth. 

Hulk glances towards Dr. Nash. "Unless you insist on fighting to 
  knockout?" 

Cara stands and leaves the Booth in the near corner. 

Kristin eyes Nash, then glances at Hulk, releasing his hand. 

Leaphorn clears his throat, nodding, speaking in a clear voice that 
  projects through the room. "Not a bad show from either of you. Good 
  moves." 

Dr. Jon Nash shrugs. 
Dr. Jon Nash says "The lady has had enough." 

Cara shakes her head negatively. "It's over." 

Timestop: Dropped by Rae on Sun Aug 30 20:49:09 1998 has left. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Perhaps next time you should take on someone your own 
  size..." 
Dr. Jon Nash smiles. 

The frown on Saiges face is replaced as the fight ends. He turns and 
  leaves back into the bar. 

Hulk shrugs. "Hey, she almost insisted...not my fault she was bored." 

Kristin snorts. "Welp, you find me one of them, and I will." 

Hawkins blinks a couple of times, as if to say Over All Ready, Damn. He 
  groans, disappointed...then shrugs. Yous pays your money, you takes 
  your chances. 

Hulk turns back to Kristin and speaks quietly to her. 

Kristin says "Least I still have a head."" 

Dr. Jon Nash nods. 

Lord Saige leaves the Sandbox, shutting the soundproofed door behind 
  him. 
Lord Saige has left. 

Kristin pops her jaw, sucking on her teeth. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "That you do ma'am." 

Cara stops at the edge of the sandbox, "Barely." she says quietly. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Do you need some medical attention?" 

In the Sandbox, Hulk says "You aren't bad, just need to loosen up the 
  old instincts, I guess. And more practise wouldn't hurt...if you want 
  any lessons, let me know, huh?" 

Kristin wipes her mouth on the back of her hand, "A beer?" 

In the Sandbox, Kristin nods. "Been out of practice a while. My own 
  damned fault really. Good job there, caught me right on the money." 

Lynx stops her humming with a grin for the pair. She leans back and 
  empties the rest of her glass into her throat, then sets it down on 
  the table beside her. 

Dr. Jon Nash smiles. 
Dr. Jon Nash says "Indeed..." 

Hulk chuckles. "Now that's the response of a true combatant..." 

Rae goes home. 
Rae has left. 

Cara looks over at Hulk, frowning slightly, before looking over to 
  Kristin. "On me." she says quietly. 

Dr. Jon Nash says "Tell Sharon it's on my tab..." 

Leaphorn stands and leaves the Booth against back wall. 

Kristin chuckles, heading over towards her gear, and starts pulling on 
  her guards and sweatshirt. 

Leaphorn slides out of his stool, standing to his full height. 

Hawkins shrugs. "Looks like you get to drink for free tonight." 

Dr. Jon Nash says "But I believe Casey beat me to the matter." 

Hulk turns to his side of the pit, collecting his own gear and dressing 
  himself once again. 

Leaphorn nods towards Hulk. "And your drink's on me, Hulkster." 

Dr. Jon Nash makes the payouts... 

Lynx hops off of her table and onto her seat, no stretch attached. Move 
  with the crowd. Baa. 

Leaphorn says "Ain't seen y'fight since you've started practicin' more 
  heavily. It's a pretty nice improvement." 

Hulk laughs louder. "Hey, I like having an audience." 

Kristin adjusts her sweatshirt, pulling on her gunrig and belt. 

Leaphorn takes a stack of cash from Nash, nodding his head. "Thanks." 
Leaphorn slips it within his jacket, then scans the room with his eyes 
  once again. 

Hulk nods and smiles as he receives his winnings. "Appreciated, 
  amigo..." 

Leaphorn moves towards the hummer, speaking to her in a somewhat lower 
  voice. 

Hawkins reaches into his jacket, revealing a glimpse of a shoulder rig, 
  and pulls out a small fold of bills. 

Cara steps back over to the booth, picking up her bag and jacket in one 
  hand, draining the cognac. 

Dr. Jon Nash gives you 2000 Nuyen. 

Lynx yawns cutely, shutting her eyes before she finishes the yawn. She 
  doesn't see Leap 

Kristin pulls her hair free, snagging her cap and jacket. She pulls on 
  the cap, pulling hair through the pack and slides the scrunchy into a 
  pocket. The longcoat she shrugs on, wincing a moment as she rests 
  weight on her leg, then spits one last time. 

Leaphorn clears his throat before speaking. 

Dr. Jon Nash takes out his wad and pulls out a few crisp hundred dollar 
  bills and tosses them to Hulk. 

Leaphorn mutters to Lynx, "... new... here?... sorta... t'my..." 
Leaphorn mutters to Lynx, "... tend t'know... the... here.... curious." 

Dr. Jon Nash stands and leaves the Booth in the near corner. 
Dr. Jon Nash says "Shall we Casey?" 

Lynx looks over to Leaphorn and quirks a smile. "You might say that I've 
  been here before." She looks down a moment and then offers her hand to 
  Leaphorn. "I go by Lynx." 

Hulk shrugs into his heavy jacket. 

You stand and leave the The Sandbox. 

Cara frowns a bit, looking back over towards Kristen, "Let's wait up a 
  sec, eh?" 

Leaphorn inclines his head. "Good t'meet you." He shakes the hand 
  lightly. "Folks call me Leap." 

Hawkins counts out 1000 in new and used 100 newyen bills in mixed corp 
  script. He reaches into another pocket and coutns out an additional 
  100 in various bills. "Here you go." 

Hulk steps out of the pit and rolls his neck a couple of times before 
  standing, apparently waiting for Kristin. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks over his shoulder. "Of course.." 

Leaphorn says "Prob'ly jus' saw you in passin', s'why you looked a 
  little familiar. Never mind. My curiosity's too intense sometimes, 
  s'all." 

Dr. Jon Nash nods at Hawkins. 

Kristin heads towards the exit from the pit, adjusting a few pouches and 
  buckles, limping slightly 
Kristin stands and leaves the The Sandbox. 

Hulk follows after his erstwhile opponent, watching her limp. "Should be 
  okay, hon - you made me hit the meat instead of the bone. You're gonna 
  have a doozy of a bruise, though..." 

Kristin chuckles. "Didn't want you to break your hand." 

You say "Just keep usin' the limb, or it'll stiffen up for a few days." 

Kristin nods, whistling quietly as she heads towards the throng near the 
  door. 

Dr. Jon Nash steps aside to let Kristin and Cara exit. 

Lynx smirks a bit. "You're the first and only who did recognize me. Been 
  keepin' it frosty, Leap?" She seems to be a little deflated, although 
  there is no apparent reason. 

Hulk grins as he strides smoothly after her. "But I like your style, and 
  I like your attitude. Welcome to Redmond..." 

Dr. Jon Nash holds the door open for them. 

Kristin laughs, voice tinkling like bells, "Gracias." 
Kristin leaves the Sandbox, shutting the soundproofed door behind her. 
Kristin has left. 

You leave the Sandbox for the Front Bar.

Kristin hobbles out of the Sandbox, whistling quietly 

Cara comes in from the Sandbox, letting in a brief burst of sound before 
  the soundproofed door closes behind her. 
Cara has arrived. 

Dr. Jon Nash comes in from the Sandbox, letting in a brief burst of 
  sound before the soundproofed door closes behind him. 
Dr. Jon Nash enters on his cane. 
Dr. Jon Nash has arrived. 

Cara walks out behind Hulk and Kris, nodding in thanks to Jon as he 
  holds the door open. 

Dr. Jon Nash looks to Cara and Kristin. "Ladies if you will pardon me. I 
  have an appointment I need to get to. 

Kristin nods to Nash, making her way through the crowd towards the bar. 

Cara nods a bit and smiles at Jon, "Take care of yourself." 

Hulk walks over to the bar, the mass of his body creating a straight 
  path through the scattered patrons. 

Dr. Jon Nash smiles and pats Cara affectionately on the shoulder. 

You sit down at the Wooden bar. 

Dr. Jon Nash heads outwards. 

Kristin sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Kristin joins you. 
Kristin clambours onto a barstool, still whistling. 

Hawkins comes in from the Sandbox, letting in a brief burst of sound 
  before the soundproofed door closes behind him. 
Hawkins has arrived. 

Cara follows Kristin over to the bar, sitting down a stool away and 
  dropping her things on the empty stool opposite. 
Cara sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Cara joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin grins. "Welp, that killed some time....and 
  not too few braincells." 

Dr. Jon Nash waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the 
  steel cage before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Dr. Jon Nash has left. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk grins at Sharon. "Well, Leap's buyin' me a beer, 
  and Casey's buying Kris'. So set 'em up, hon..." 

Lord Saige is sitting at the bar once more. 

Hawkins heads towards the bar, grinning. 

At the wooden bar, Sharon pops another bottle and places it in front of 
  Hulk, then looks curiously towards Kristin. "What's your poison?" 
At the wooden bar, Cara looks over at Kris, "You'll haveta 'scuse the 
  question--but what the hell possessed you to fight 'em?" she asks, a 
  bit amazed. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Beer's good." 

Karen steps through the front door. 
Karen has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin grins at Cara, "Welp...I was bored, he was 
  bored, and I figgered it would be as good as time as any to get myself 
  back into the habit of fighting. Been getting fat and lazy." 

Karen walks in through the entrnace of the Banshee, stopping once to 
  scan the room with cold, gray eyes before heading towards the bar. 

At the wooden bar, Sharon nods and digs out another bottle of the 
  imported beer, snapping off the metal top and placing it in front of 
  the woman. 

Hawkins sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Hawkins joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk chuckles. "Metaphorically speaking, I assume. 
  You look anything _but_ fat to me, Kris..." 

Karen sits down at the bar, not facing out at the room, as she doesn't 
  seem to be on shift tonight. 
Karen sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Karen joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Cara smiles a bit and nods, looking over at Sharon 
  with a frown, as she doesn't procure a drink for her. 

Leaphorn comes in from the Sandbox, letting in a brief burst of sound 
  before the soundproofed door closes behind him. 
Leaphorn has arrived. 

Lynx comes in from the Sandbox, letting in a brief burst of sound before 
  the soundproofed door closes behind her. 
Lynx has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin snorts. "Been drinking too much beer, I mean 
  look at this," she pinches a scant quarter inch on her waist, "Fat I 
  tell you." 

Karen sits at the bar, in the process of ordering a drink from Sharon. 

At the wooden bar, Cara smiles a bit, "S'easier to work it off then get 
  it beat outta ya." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "True, but hardly as exciting." 
At the wooden bar, Cara laughs a bit, and nods. 
At the wooden bar, Karen grunts as she sits down, muttering a sour toned 
  order to Sharon, then looking down the bar. 

Hawkins orders a double scotch, passing a couple of bills. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk rubs his stomach absently as it rumbles audibly. 
  "Sometimes, I wish I could put a bit on - soften the cut of my muscles 
  a little. Some people think it's too aggressive." He frowns slightly. 

Lynx follows Leap out of the sandbox, arms crossing over her chest as 
  she considers his back with intensely curious eyes. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin nods to Hulk. "Eat nothing but sweets for a 
  bit." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Gobs of em." 

Leaphorn heads towards the bar smoothly, faint dark circles under his 
  eyes, seeming slightly tired. He scratches a slightly stubbled chin, 
  and slides onto a stool. "Yo, Sharon. Dunno if Hulk's already got one, 
  but if he doesn't, pass him a beer." 

At the wooden bar, Hulk sighs. "Well, it might work. Pizza sure as hell 
  doesn't..." 

Leaphorn sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Leaphorn joins you. 

Winter steps through the front door. 
Winter has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk holds up his bottle. "Got it thanks, amigo..." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin takes a swallow from her bottle, hissing as 
  the beer hits her cut lip. She mutters a string of profanity, digging 
  a compact out of her purse. 
At the wooden bar, Karen looks over at Leap as he sits down. "Hey 
  handsom. How are ya?" 

Lynx sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Lynx joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Cara looks over at Sharon, kinda vaguely watching the 
  bartender ignore her. 

Karen sits at the bar. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn grunts. "Damn, there goes my good deed for 
  the night. Now I've gotta find somethin' else nice t'do." 

Winter yawns softly as she enters the room, stretching her arms a bit, 
  then she walks through the crowd to the bar, sitting down at one end. 
Winter sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Winter joins you. 

Hawkins laughs. "Eat MRE's. 3600 colories a pop." 

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Winter just looked you over&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 

Tanya steps through the front door. 
Tanya has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Lynx slides into a seat, waiting to get Sharon's 
  attention as well. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn nods towards Karen. "Doin' alright here, 
  chica. Same as usual, y'know." 
At the wooden bar, Sharon notices the frown. Eventually. She sighs, and 
  produces a bottle of cognac, pouring a triple measure into a glass. 
  With ice. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn says "Keepin' the peace here tonight?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin pulls her bottom lip down, looking at it in 
  the little mirror. 

Tanya wanders into the bar, then proceeds towards the counter. 

At the wooden bar, Karen cocks her head as she looks at Leaphorn. "Do I 
  -look- like I'm dressed for work?" 
At the wooden bar, Sharon slides the drink down to Cara and stands, 
  waiting for the payment. 
At the wooden bar, Cara smiles slightly, unfolding a wad of bills from 
  her pocket, dropping a couple on the bar. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks over, a slight smile tugging at the 
  corner of his upper lip. "Hm. Okay, maybe not. Never mind." He holds 
  the same mug of beer he was drinking in the sandbox, not finished with 
  it yet, and he takes a small sip. 

Tanya sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Tanya joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Karen chuckles a bit. "You're kinda cute when you're 
  tired... ya know that?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin lets go of her bottom lip, tossing the 
  compact into a pouch. 

Hawkins takes a drink from his scotch. He nods towards Winter. 

At the wooden bar, Tanya waves to Kristin, then Karen, and Winter. And 
  Hulk. "Hoi all." Oops, Cara too. 
At the wooden bar, Lynx orders a glass of milk from Sharon, looking up 
  and down the bar with interest. 
At the wooden bar, Sharon takes the bills, then glares at Cara. "_And_ 
  the beer..." She nods towards Kris' drink. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks through the crowded room, and at the 
  packed bar, where there are hardly any empty seats left. "Jesus, this 
  place fills up fast." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn smirks. "Well, I'm lucky I hardly get any 
  sleep then, I guess." 
At the wooden bar, Karen leans into Leap, whispering to him. 

Richter steps through the front door. 
Richter has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Winter glances up to Sharon. "Would you -please- stop 
  being so nasty to Casey?", she shakes her head in disbelief, then 
  smiles softly to Tanya. "Hi." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk says "You want me to take a look at that, Kris?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin waves to Tanya, taking another sip of her 
  beer. 
At the wooden bar, Cara frowns, "Kinna nasty there, Kris?" she says, 
  looking back to Sharon, then seperates the bills on the table, "Christ 
  on a fuckin' crutch, Sharon. At least take a minute to look at what I 
  paid, eh?" she says, looking pointedly at the twenty. 

Richter moves quietly into the bar, flicking his cigarette to the floor 
  as he moves, head swivelling from side to side as he weaves his way 
  through the evening crowd. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks over as he sees Winter, and he lifts a 
  hand towards her. "Hey, you're back. Y'missed the whole thing." He 
  then looks back at Karen, shrugging when he responds. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin shakes her head to Hulk. "Na, its chill. Just 
  bit my lip when I fell. Tis what I get for running my mouth." 
At the wooden bar, Karen shakes her head. "Sharon... care to see me in 
  my office?" 
At the wooden bar, Hulk snorts, a wide grin on his face. "Yeah, well, 
  it's better than biting the tip of yer tongue off, neh?" 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "Missed everything?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Aye. Then I'd talk all funny." 

Richter seats himself quietly on an unoccupied stool, tossing down two 
  folded Ares singles to pay for the beer he requests from Sharon. 

At the wooden bar, Lynx's eyes are drawn to Winter. She fidgits with a 
  napkin that made it within her reach. 

Richter sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Richter joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin nods to Tanya. "Me and the rather large chap 
  there took a run around the Sandbox." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks over at the black woman sitting 
  relatively near him. "Didn't ask y'before. How long y'been gone for, 
  anyway?" 
At the wooden bar, Sharon looks at Karen, her mouth drawn to a line. She 
  shakes her head, and puts up her usual mask of polite indifference. 
At the wooden bar, Winter smiles and nods to Lynx as she notices the 
  woman looking, then leans across and offers her a friendly hand. "Hi.. 
  I'm Sara." 
At the wooden bar, Cara sips her cognac, attempting to hige a smug grin. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya sighs. "Damn. I have bad timing." 
At the wooden bar, Sharon walks over to Karen, then leans over the bar, 
  whispering to her. 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige smirks as he takes a drink. 
At the wooden bar, Lynx mutters under her breath, then raises her voice. 
  "Couple of months. Not too long, but you know how time passes." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin chuckles. "Didn't miss much. Think it lasted 
  about 2 hits. Most of the time was taken up getting bets." 
At the wooden bar, Tanya smiles. "Hulk? He has a fatal weakness." 
At the wooden bar, Cara twists it into a wry grin, "Don' forget to check 
  your messages there, Hulk." 
At the wooden bar, Lynx smiles to Winter. "Heya. Lynx." She grips the 
  whities hand firmly in greetng. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn inclines his head. "Coupla months? Yeah, in 
  this area, that's like an eternity. But some things should be the 
  same, you'll be back in the swing of things before y'know it." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk swallows visibly at Tanya's remark, listening. 
At the wooden bar, Karen looks down to Leap. "Hey, handsom... you 
  forgetting something?" 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn swivels in his stool, then, leaning back 
  against the counter. Lifting the mug to his lips again, he takes 
  another sip. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "He wouldn't know what to do if you 
  cheated." 
At the wooden bar, Hawkins laughs. "Tell you what. I'll get out there 
  sometime and show you how its done." He pauses. "Everything I 
  do....Don't do it. It'll get ya killed." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Fatal weakness?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin grins 
At the wooden bar, Winter gives Lynxs hand a friendly shake, then sits 
  back again. "Nice to meet you.", she says softly, then looks up to the 
  bartender, waiting to be served. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk looks round, narrowing his eyes in mock anger, 
  but can't keep it up. He chuckles. "Hey, Tanya, just cuz you ain't 
  ever _seen_ me cheat, don't mean I don't know _how_ to..." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin sips from her bottle, making small rings of 
  condensation. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks to Karen. "Am I? Um..." He thinks for 
  a moment. "Dunno. Took a shower this mornin', washed behind my 
  ears...." 
At the wooden bar, Karen cocks her head. "Well, if you -don't- know, 
  then I sure as hell aint gunna tell ya." 
At the wooden bar, Lynx smiles. "Likewise." Her eyes drift and she 
  chuckles bitterly as the milk arrives. She pays Sharon, saying softly, 
  "Thanks." 
At the wooden bar, Karen thinks for a moment. "Shower?.... hmmm... 
  that's what I forgot..." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk winks. "You might just be surprised what you can 
  learn from a youth in the gangs, and a career in pitfighting. Not 
  counting the Brawl fights, o' course..." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn smirks. "Chica games. Gotta love 'em." He 
  leans over, giving her a kiss on the cheek. "So how come y'ain't 
  workin' tonight?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin sputters beer, wiping the back of her mouth. 
  "CAREER in pitfighting? Ah bugger me." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin looks heavenward. 
At the wooden bar, Winter hands Sharon a few nuyen in exchange for a 
  cold bottle of beer, which she opens as she turns to face Lynx, 
  crossing her legs and resting the bottle on her knee as she picks idly 
  at the label on the front. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya grins. "You didn't know?" 
At the wooden bar, Karen smiles as Leap kisses her. "Trained well", she 
  mutters. "I don't feel like sitting here all night, waiting to knock 
  out morons with too much attitude." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk shrugs. "Sorry, did I forget to mention that? 
  Oops..." 
At the wooden bar, Cara smiles a bit, "Ya Coulda had 'em, Kris." 

Karen hops up suddenly, heading for the Bathroom. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin rubs the bridge of her nose. "No, didn't 
  know." She laughs to Cara, "Yeah, if he held still and I had a 
  baseball bat." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn frowns visibly, quirking an eyebrow. 
  "Trained? Alright, I'm broken of that habit now." 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "A thick one." 
At the wooden bar, Cara smiles a bit and shakes her head. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn grunts, shaking his head, obviously 
  displeased about something. He looks out to the rest of the room, eyes 
  scanning the crowd once again. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk laughs again, seemingly relaxed as he pulls a 
  bowl of pretzels over to himself. 
At the wooden bar, Lynx loses herself in her milk, eyes glassing over. 
  She lowers the glass to the bartop and spins it around between lithe 
  fingers. Again the tune wells in her throat, this time the words slip 
  out in a whisper.. "The lady... is a ... tramp." She shakes her head 
  again and glances at Sara, cutting her music off. "So, how's things?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin downs another swallow of beer, shaking her 
  head, the ponytail swaying. "Course, shoulda guessed on my own. Ah 
  well, I must be getting old." 
At the wooden bar, Tanya nods. "A terrifying idea." 
At the wooden bar, Winter wrinkles her nose, which looks kinda cute, and 
  shrugs one shoulder, "I've been better.. And you?", she tilts her 
  head, "I don't remember ever seeing you before." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk says "Naw, hon. If you were old, you'd have 
  known how to disable me before I knew what was happnin'. It's called 
  experience..."" 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "I'll keep my youth, thank you very much." 
At the wooden bar, Cara smiles sadly, "Everybody in this biz is either 
  too old or too young. The yougin's die from lack of experiance and the 
  oldsters die from lack of enthusiasm." she says almost to herself. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks over at Lynx, cocking his head. 
  Chuckling quietly, "Interestin' song. Better watch it, though, some 
  joygirl 'round here'll think you're referrin' t'her, an' try t'start 
  somethin'." He winks. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Oh KNOWING how isn't the problem...it's 
  getting the old bones to move the right way." 
At the wooden bar, Tanya smiles at Leap and Lynx. "Everybody's a 
  critic." 
At the wooden bar, Hulk seems to be thoroughly enjoying this 
  conversation. "Now when have you ever seen me unenthusiastic, Case?" 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn nods to Tanya. "Damn straight." 
At the wooden bar, Cara raises an eyebrow, and smiles a bit at Hulk. 
At the wooden bar, Lynx smiles at Sara. "Well, I've been around. Haven't 
  seen you neither, so we musta missed each other." She glances at Leap 
  with a shrug and an ironic grin. "T'sistas mostly have great senses of 
  humor, unless they attached to someone who they don't like, y'know?" 
  She chuckles dryly at Tanya's comment. 
At the wooden bar, Cara frowns a bit at Lynx's comment. 

Kristin senses "Hulk grins cheekily. "So, you new to town, or have ya 
  just been hiding from me all this time?" 

At the wooden bar, Hulk mutters to Kristin. 
At the wooden bar, Winter nods to Lynx, "I guess so..", she slips 
  silently out of her seat and sneaks along the seats, creeping up 
  behind Richter and wrapping her arms around him from behind, poking 
  her head under his arm and looking up to him with a grin, "Hi!" 

Delta steps through the front door. 
Delta has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn looks over at Winter and Richter and smiles 
  faintly, then he shakes his head, looking back at the people sitting 
  around him. 

Delta moves slowly around the edge of the room, still getting pushed 
  around some, trying to avoid contact with others as much as possible. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin murmurs to Hulk 

Kristin whispers "Oh, I've been around a week or so now." 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn stretches, cracking his knuckles. "So what 
  made y'jam from our beautiful settin', anyway, Ms. Lynx?" 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "Nice eyes." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn says "Y'know, the sights, the sounds, the 
  smells... dunno why anyone'd wanna leave this place." 

The gangly ork in robes shuffles toward an empty table in front of the 
  bar, finally settling into a seat there. 

At the wooden bar, Richter almost chokes on his beer as Winter wraps and 
  pokes, lifting his arm and glancing down, surprised expression 
  breaking out into a grin, "Hey there. This is a new one." He carefully 
  disengages her from under his arm, still grinning. 

Lord Saige steps out of the public restroom headin back towards the bar. 

Delta sits down at the Table in front of the bar. 

Lord Saige sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Lord Saige joins you. 

Cara shifts slightly on her stool, sipping at her cognac as the bar 
  suddenly goes quiet. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin glances down the bar a moment, watching 
  Richter and Winter. She hmms and stares at her beer bottle a long 
  moment. 

Kristin senses "Hulk nods. "I don't intend to pry, just curious. From 
  anywhere originally?"" 

At the wooden bar, Hulk nods. He mutters to Kristin, "... From..." 

Delta bows his head, looking down at the table surface in front of him, 
  his hands splayed out flat there before him. 

At the wooden bar, Lynx shrugs a little. "Family business. Took a little 
  longer than I thought." She takes another long pull on her milk before 
  she adds, "This place is better than some, y'know." 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn nods, then blinks, looking back at Lynx. 
  "Family business?" 

Pitbull steps through the front door. 
Pitbull has arrived. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn seems a bit upset by that, for some unknown 
  reason. 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige slides back onto his tool. He raises his 
  glass towards Sharon calling for a refill. 
At the wooden bar, Winter tickles Richters stomach and nibbles on his 
  side while her head is still under his arm, looking very silly but not 
  caring at all as she giggles quietly to herself. A few moments later 
  she slips out again, moving around to stand in front of him, resting 
  her back against the bar. "You were too quiet." 

[Streetwise] Lone Star undercover agent nods. "Yeah, that's what the 
  Captain wants... says he hears there is some sort of big thing 
  happening at some Barrens place and wants to know what." He sighs. "I 
  always get the dangerous jobs. Stupid pension." 

Pitbull slides through the door and heads to the bar..slipping through 
  the crowd as best he can..looking for an open seat. A lopsided, 
  sideways smug, smile sits on his face as his tongue plays with the 
  ever-present tuskpick 

Kristin mutters to Hulk, "... from... few places.... the last."" 
Kristin whispers " "Oh, I've been from a few places. New York is one of 
  the last."" 

Pitbull sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Pitbull joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Tanya grins. "She doesn't look mafia." 
At the wooden bar, Richter lifts a shoulder in a mild shrug, offering 
  his beer bottle over, "Yeah, well...you were already involved in a 
  conversation, and I didn't want to interrupt. 'sides...not much to 
  say." He casts a glance down the bar in Leaphorn's general direction, 
  then returns attention to Winter. 

Delta coughs into a balled up hand, returning to his idle mode position. 

Kristin senses "Hulk sucks on his lower lip, then takes a sip of his 
  beer. "Uh huh. Never been there - I'm from down Denver way myself..."" 

At the wooden bar, Hulk sucks on his lower lip, then takes a sip of his 
  beer. He mutters to Kristin, "... myself..." 

Pitbull hops..and perches on a stool...litterally perches as his feet 
  are where his butt should be. He seems comfortable, if not looking 
  like some oversized gargoly..he tries to flag down the bartender. 

At the wooden bar, Lynx nods. "Yeah. Taken care of now." The details she 
  offers are sooo enlightening. She looks up at Leaphorn for a long 
  moment, face expressionless until that comment about the mafia at 
  which she looks away, somehow paler. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin nods to Hulk, sipping her beer a moment, 
  casting another glance down the bar. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn slowly lifts his beer, but it only makes it 
  halfway to his face, usually steady hand trembling. He looks down at 
  it, and notices, setting the beer down on the counter so abruptly, 
  about a quarter of it spills all over the counter. 

Hawkins takes a sip from his drink, watching and enjoying the local 
  happenings. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn speaks a few words in another language, 
  looking as if he's just seen a ghost. He says "**** *********" in 
  Apache. 
At the wooden bar, Sharon sighs, and flaps her towel towards a stool 
  near the end of the bar. You notice the 6' high, thickly reinforced 
  metal seat. "_That's_ the troll stool!" 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "Hm. Problems there hon?" 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn shakes his head quickly. "No, no problems." 
At the wooden bar, Tanya says "Yeah." 
At the wooden bar, Richter leans down, whispering something to Winter. 
At the wooden bar, Cara looks around briefly, frowning. 
At the wooden bar, Pitbull rolls the tuskpick over and just shrugs..."I 
  only plays a trog on the trid...I'm jus' an overgrown tusk..now..how 
  bouts a beer?" 
At the wooden bar, Winter takes the beer from Richter, has a sip, then 
  offers it back. "You could have said..", she blinks and stops, 
  glancing over to Leaphorn, then to Lynx, seeming to understand 
  something as she looks back to Leaphorn, speaking in a different 
  language. 
At the wooden bar, Pitbull rises his grin some. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn draws in a deep breath, and shakes his head 
  again, closing his eyes for a moment. He opens them again, then looks 
  to Lynx. "Lynx is a kind of cat, ain't it?" 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige takes a sip and glances around briefly 
  with passing interest. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin watches down the bar a long moment, then hmms 
  to herself. 
At the wooden bar, Winter says "******* **** **** ********* **** ***** 
  ****** *** ** ****" in Apache. 
At the wooden bar, Sharon frowns. "Well sit on the furniture instead of 
  squatting!" She puts her hands on her hips, looking pissed. 
At the wooden bar, Leaphorn holds his right hand tightly within his 
  left, as if he's attempting to force it to be steady. 

A hesitant looking waitress approaches the skinny ork sitting at the 
  table near the bar. She appears to be trying to take his order, but 
  unable to hear him. She gets progressively closer until she finally 
  stands up and nods at him, turning rapidly and making her way to the 
  back. 

At the wooden bar, Pitbull again offers a shrug.."sorry chicka..jus' 
  habit"..he hops again and places his hands on the bar..floating his 
  but down into the seat.."Now"..the grin again.."Hows 'bou' tha' beer?" 
At the wooden bar, Winter looks back to Lynx, staring at the woman 
  intently for a few moments, a thoughtful frown creasing her brow. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya smiles. "What a time for a chinese fire drill." 
At the wooden bar, Lord Saige observes Leaphorn, his facial expressions 
  largely unreadable. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin grins, nodding. "Ya. Course, it'd be a 
  clusterfuck in here, but might be ammusing." 
At the wooden bar, Lynx watches dully as drops of beer get into her 
  milk, the liquid curdling. She pushes the glass away gently. She nods 
  to Leaphorn. "It is." Her eyes do not lift from the bartop. 
At the wooden bar, Sharon grumbles quietly to herself as she pours a 
  beer from the tap into a glass and pushes it over to Pitbull. 
At the wooden bar, Winter's eyes stop on the boots Lynx is wearing, her 
  eyes widening a bit before she looks back to the womans face, studying 
  it a while longer. 

Cara stands from teh counter, picking up her jacket and shrugging it on 
  carefully. She smiles briefly at the bar, picking up her bag and 
  sligning it, before walking towards the door, pushing throught he 
  crowd. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk glances briefly at Winter. 

Cara stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 
Cara has departed. 

At the wooden bar, Leaphorn doesn't respond to Winter, shaking his head 
  a few times. "Oh, fuck, I..." He opens his mouth, then closes it 
  again. Again, "Shit, I've gotta..." A shaky breath is expelled from 
  his lungs, cutting off his own sentence, then he stands from the 
  stool. "Go... mind's playin' trick's on me..." 

Leaphorn stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 
Leaphorn has departed. 

At the wooden bar, Pitbull flips a few pieces of scrip from his hand, 
  onto the bar..he hoists the mug, inclines it towards Sharon..and then 
  sets it down again.. 

Kristin waves to Casey. "Hey, thanks for the beer!" 

Delta gets something out of the sash around his waist, holding it in his 
  hand until the waitress returns, paying for some water with some form 
  of paper currency. 

Cara turns around, still walking towards the door-only now backwards for 
  a few steps, "No problem." she says quietly. 

Leaphorn nearly trips as he stands abruptly, looking almost drugged, or 
  drunk, as if the world is reeling for him. He stumbles through the 
  crowd, one hand to his head, barreling through people without really 
  seeming to notice. 

Cara turns around, continuing to move through the crowd, stepping aside 
  as Leap stumbles past.. 

Lord Saige raises his glass in fairwell to Cara as she leaves. 

Delta follows Leaphorn's staggering progress, his head turning slowly 
  and finally twisting around in his chair. 

At the wooden bar, Winter stares at Lynx, silent for a while, before 
  asking. She says "*** *** ******* *****" in Apache. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin watches Leaphorn run off, quirking an eyebrow 
  a moment. "Hm. Beer will do that to ya. drink too much, yer stomache 
  just gives up the Ghost." 

Leaphorn waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the steel 
  cage before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Leaphorn has left. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin appends, "Or your bladder." 

Cara waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the steel cage 
  before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Cara has left. 

Delta turns slowly back to his emotionless tablestaring. 

At the wooden bar, Richter gives Winter a curious stare, opening his 
  mouth as if to say something, instead taking a sip of beer and 
  shrugging to himself. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya nods to Kris. "Maybe something is adjusted 
  wrong. Looks like the wire-shakes to me." 
At the wooden bar, Lynx hums lowly to herself, watching the large man go 
  in the mirror before her. The particularly curious would notice a 
  glassing over of her eyes. She glances down the bar at Sara with a 
  mild expression. "I don't know anymore. Excuse me." She slips off of 
  her stool and into the crowd. Not really hurrying. 

Lynx stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 
Lynx has departed. 

Garrett steps through the front door. 
Garrett has arrived. 

Hulk follows Lynx with his eyes. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Could be. Course, we are listening to 
  the Native American Radio station here, so mebbe the Great Sky Fathers 
  recalled him for a 24,000 kilometer checkout."" 

Garrett trundles in slowly and looks about. 

Lynx 

This young human woman looks lovely, her skin glowing a healthy mahogany 
  brown. Her hair is kinked and braided close to her head in a series of 
  cornrows, tied off with pieces of black synth-cord. Clasped in her ear 
  are a number of metallic copper alloy rings and about her neck is a 
  black cord, set in with a single ivory tooth. It looks real. She looks 
  strong but wirey, and the enthusiasm of her feminine curves appears 
  irrepressable, despite her standoffish mannerisms. Her cybereyes are 
  golden and appear to be modeled after that of a cat's, with vertical 
  slits. Her nose and features are regular and well-proportioned, free 
  of flaws or scars. 


Lynx is currently dressed in a set of worn black biker togs. In places 
  they are riddled with wear marks and holes, proof that this woman 
  spends too much time in the treacherous elements of today's world. 
  Some of the places are patched, others have been left to worsen. Her 
  pants cling close over her legs, and her thin top is sleeveless, 
  allowing her shapely, muscled arms to show. Her right upper arm has a 
  tight leather band clasped about it, decorated with the visage of a 
  prowling feline in paint, accented with shell beading. Over this is 
  drawn a simple black synthleather vest. Her feet are protected by a 
  pair of boots which are surprisingly simple. They have no heels and 
  seem to be inspired by the mocasin-boots prefered by the Amerinds of 
  the middle US. 

Carrying: 

Duffle Bag 

At the wooden bar, Kristin smirks, taking a gulp of beer. 

Delta sits staring at the table in front of him, motionless. 

Lynx waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the steel cage 
  before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Lynx has left. 

Winter blinks in surprise, watching Lynx dumbfounded for a few moments, 
  then she shakes her head and pushes away from the bar, moving very 
  quickly through the room toward the exit. 
Winter stands and leaves the Wooden bar. 
Winter has departed. 
Winter waits for the bouncer to lift the steel bar and open the steel 
  cage before walking into the tight, dark hallway beyond. 
Winter has left. 

Garrett steps to the side quickly so he doesn't get run over. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin mutters, "A friggin soap opera, every time I 
  come out here." 
At the wooden bar, Richter watches the trio leave, shaking his head 
  slightly and cupping his hand over his mouth, checking his breath 
  before taking another sip of beer, expression still registering mild 
  confusion. 
At the wooden bar, Tanya smirks and nods at Kristin. "Amen." 
At the wooden bar, Pitbull laughs at that..and replies to himself.."amen 
  sis.." 

Garrett looks around once more, and determining it's safe, heads for the 
  bar for a seat. 

At the wooden bar, Lord Saige regards the glass in his hand 
  contemplativly. He takes another drink, nearly finishing it. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk seems distracted as he stares after the 
  departing woman. 

Garrett sits down at the Wooden bar. 
Garrett joins you. 

At the wooden bar, Kristin says "Friggin pathetic. Every bloody time, 
  there is some lovers spat. I swear, maybe in the bars uptown I expect 
  the Prom queens and what not to do that...but out here? I THOUGHT this 
  was where the pros hung out...or did I miss the bar?" 
At the wooden bar, Kristin frowns darkly, taking a hurried gulp of beer. 
At the wooden bar, Hulk shakes his head once, then pauses, looking 
  thoughtful. He scowls and says, "Aw frag! Excuse me a moment, Kris, 
  there's something I gotta check here..." 
At the wooden bar, Garrett blinks once at the comment made and looks 
  around. 
At the wooden bar, Kristin nods to Hulk, "A'ight. Take care." 

You whisper "That wasn't a spat, I don't think..." to Kristin. 

At the wooden bar, Hulk mutters to Kristin, "... a spat,... don't 
  think..." 
At the wooden bar, Tanya continues to nod. "Well, this is the new 
  Redmond." 
At the wooden bar, Pitbull smiles in smug satisfaction as he fingers the 
  rim of the glass. he adds softly..'pro's don' fall in love an' fight 
  when they gets hurt?" 

Hulk puts his bottle onto the counter as he slips off his stool and 
  heads for the door, following the path WInter took a short time 
  before. 

You stand and leave the Wooden bar. 

The bouncer lifts the steel bar, opening the steel cage. You walk past 
  the bouncer and into the tight, dark hallway. 

Banshee - Entrance Foyer

Hulk collects his SMG from Marko and heads on out. 

You push open the heavy steel door, stepping under the doorway to the 
  street.

Cara looks briefly over at Rose. 

Hulk pushes out of the Banshee, one hand tucking something away down his 
  left side, under his jacket. 

Rose looks annoyed and distressed. "Leo!" 

Lynx takes something out of her neckline and looks at it, waiting for a 
  moment before slipping it back into her shirt. 

Hulk nods over at Rose. "Hola. Whazzup?" He looks up and down the 
  street, seemingly slightly puzzled. 

Leaphorn comes out of the parking area. 
Leaphorn has arrived. 

Rose turns and looks at Leap. 

Leaphorn steps back out of the lot again, and moves to the west, shaking 
  his head to himself, not noticing anyone around him. 

Cara walks over to her bike. 

Rose takes a step toward Leap, her brow furrowed. She pauses, her hand 
  almost reaching for him. She watches him, obviously unsure of what to 
  do. 

Winter comes out of the parking area. 
Winter has arrived. 

Hulk leans back against the wall by the Banshee, eyes flicking over to 
  Leaphorn before they return to an appraising look towards Lynx. 

Leaphorn shakes his head. "Alright, fine. I'll stay here, but I'm 
  thinkin'. Y'all can go wherever, I ain't gonna say much until I gather 
  my thoughts. Thanks for the concern." He leans against a wall, placing 
  a hand to his temple, closing his eyes, and falling silent. 

Rose looks at Winter. "What the fuck?" 

Winter follows Leaphorn back out of the lot, looking frustrated, waving 
  a hand toward Rose, "Would you leave him alone? Go and play with your 
  husband or something.", she shakes her head, walking over to Leaphorn 
  and standing in front of him, taking both his hands and leaning 
  forward, standing on tiptoe to whisper to him. 

Cara frowns, sitting down sideways on her bike. 

Lynx is not very interested in being noticed, loitering a couple of 
  storefronts down the way. She hasn't left, which is something. 

Rose stiffens and glares at Winter. She looks the pale woman up and 
  down, contemptuously. "Who the hell are you?" 

Hulk mutters to himself. 

You sense "Hulk looks back to the arguing women. "That's what I'd like 
  to know..."" 

Winter ignores Rose, as if shes not even there, her attention fixed on 
  Leaphorn. 

Rose watches Winter, suspiciously. 

Hulk looks almost comical as his head swings from side to side, trying 
  to keep everyone in sight. 

[Streetwise] A Banshee regular shakes his head, muttering among friends, 
  "Egos is swelling again, chumskis. Everyone's strokin' themselves up 
  in here. 'Well, I'm the pro-est of the pros!' Makes me sick. What's 
  that saying? If you have to tell someone you're a pro, you aren't. 
  Somethin' like that..." 

Lynx rubs her open palms against her thighs, stretching downwards 
  towards the pavement. 

[Streetwise] A squatter coughs in front of the Banshee. He looks up to 
  make sure no one is looking before standing up a little straight. His 
  voice is a bit more clearer than usual as he mutters into hidden in 
  his rags. 

Rose glares at Winter. She takes a small card from her pocket and slips 
  it into Leap's jacket pocket. She walks away, expecting him to ignore 
  her. She nods to Hulk. "I'm going inside to down a mickey of tequila. 
  Wanna come, and cart my shattered remains home at the end of the 
  night?" 

Hulk's head freezes as something grabs his attention. Strangely enough, 
  he isn't looking at any of the gathered patrons from out of the bar... 

Hulk looks round, as though trying to pinpoint something that is 
  annoying him. 

Delta comes out from behind the heavy steel door that is the entrance to 
  the Banshee. 
Delta has arrived. 

Hulk seems slightly jumpy, and twitches as the 'Shee door slams open. 

Delta shuffles out of the venerable Barrens bar, leaning heavily on a 
  makeshift cane, turning directly toward the parking lot, watching the 
  ground in front of him carefully. 

Rose sighs as Hulk doesn't answer. "Fine. I'll call a tow-truck, then. 
  There's a purple elephant shitting on your shoe." she mentions, 
  casually, as she heads for the door to the Banshee, looking seriously 
  pissed off. 

Leaphorn opens his eyes again, looking around. 

Delta goes into the Banshee parking area. 
Delta has left. 

Hulk seems distracted. "Hm? Okay hon, just gimme a minute here..." 

Garrett comes out from behind the heavy steel door that is the entrance 
  to the Banshee. 
Garrett has arrived. 

[Streetwise] Another Banshee regular says, "See that halfer there? He 
  keeps talking like he's a cop or something. Better steer clear." 

Garrett wanders out quietly. 

Hulk looks round. "Rose!" 

Rose stops and turns on her heel, her jaw tight. "What?" 

Hulk beckons. "C'mon, I need to talk to you. Please?" 

Leaphorn grunts. "What the hell is this, a party?" 

Rose lets out a slow breath and walks back to Hulk, stiffly. 

Hulk sets off down the asphalyt, towards the parking lot. 

Rose shakes her head. 

Leaphorn pushes off from the wall, looking directly at Lynx. "Scuse 
  me... could I... talk with you for a moment?" 

Rose mutters to herself, "... I... with... men!" 

Hulk pauses and looks back, his expression pleading. "Please?" 

Rose says "Yaya." 

Winter pulls Leaphorn close for a brief moment, whispering to him. 

Garrett listens to the comments a moment, then shakes his head quietly 
  and starts to head out slowly so as not to intrude on folk. He offers 
  a nod in greeting to Winter.

From the street, Rose goes into the Banshee parking area. 
From the street, Rose has left. 

Rose comes into the parking area. 
Rose has arrived. 
Rose says "What is is, Leo?" 

From the street, Leaphorn nods absently to Winter. "Yeah, I'll... I'll 
  figure somethin' out. I guess." 
From the street, Lynx is half crouched, a ways down the street. She nods 
  silently, pausing as the white woman intervenes. Her face is 
  expressionless, her stance less than casual. 
From the street, Leaphorn has forced himself into a much calmer state by 
  now, or at least it appears to be that way on the exterior. 

Hulk mutters to Rose, "Drek,... forgot... here.... yours here? I... -... 
  up, the neighborhood... right.... we... a..." 

You whisper "Drek, I forgot - my bike ain't here. You got yours here? I 
  gotta bad feeling - sumthin's up, the neighborhood don't feel right. I 
  think we should go somewhere else for a drink. Fast." to Rose. 

Rose lifts her chin, scowling. "What are you talking about?" 

From the street, Winter nods to Leaphorn, "-We- will..", she stands on 
  tiptoe to give Leaphorn a kiss on the cheek, then she walks over to 
  the entrance of the Banshee, nodding to Garrett before leaning against 
  the wall, watching. 
From the street, Leaphorn walks towards the west, saying something 
  quietly to Lynx on his way. 

Hulk mutters to Rose. 

Rose senses "Hulk looks around, nervously. "There's something wrong. 
  Don't know what - the street don't feel right, scan? Somethin's goin' 
  down..."" 

From the street, Leaphorn wanders west. 
From the street, Leaphorn has left.

Rose shrugs, exasperated. She heads to a Scorpion with vanity plates 
  that read "SARGE". 

From the street, Cara is sitting quietly on her bike under the awning of 
  Unknown Pleasures. 
From the street, Winter watches Leaphorn walking off down the street and 
  barely contains her frustration, then spotting Lynx go the other way, 
  she shakes her head in amazement and pushes away from the wall, 
  heading west. 
From the street, Winter wanders west. 
From the street, Winter has left. 
From the street, Tanya waves across to Cara on her way to the parking

You say "Well, I wanted to get out of the Banshee. Other than that, I

Hulk hugs your middle and mutters in your ear, sounding amused. 

Rose growls. 

You say "But probly safest not to go _too_ far on this thing." 

Hulk chuckles. "You can growl all you like - my job is to cheer you 
  up..." 

Rose curses and swerves to the left, bumping over the sidewalk as she 
  pulls a U-turn. 

Hulk gulps loudly and hangs on for dear life. "Shiiit!" 

Rose swerves to miss a blue Americar, which honks, loudly, and almost 
  smashes into an 18-wheeler. She shouts at the driver in Gaelic and

Rose says "Shut. Up. Leo. And. Let. Me. Drive." 
Rose pulls over. She twists around on the seat and starts smacking your 
  arm. 

Hulk grabs Rose by the wrists and stares into her eyes. "What the _frag_ 
  is wrong, hon?" 

Rose glares at you. "I didn't want to leave the Banshee. I came all the 
  way over from downtown to go to the Banshee. I left because I thought 
  there was something _wrong_, not because you just didn't feel like 
  being there. I'm in a lousy rotten mood, and that albino slitch _has_ 
  to die, and I'm worried sick about Leap, and I don't know what's 
  wrong, and you made me _leave!_"

  carrying anything that might get you sent to jail? Because I am! And

Hulk shrugs. "Fine. You go back. If nothing happens, I'll apologize. 
  Otherwise, I'll try to come see you during visiting hours..." 

Rose says "What do you think is going to happen? What's going on???" 
Rose says "I feel like the entire world is determined to not let me in 
  on it, today, whatever IT is." 

Hulk shrugs again. "I'm not sure. There was something odd about 
  the...that's it! One of the squatters - there was something not right 
  about him. He was...clean! The slot was clean! And I had my doubts 
  about one of the customers inside. He smelt of pork as well..."
