      <p> Hi there gang. Seems like they wanna get more people using the matrix....of 
        course we do :) More fun. I wrote this little tutorial up, but I'd like 
        to know what you guys thin. This is for beginners doing minor functions. 
        Since you guys trix everyday (we hope) I want you to look over this and 
        tell me mistakes, suggestions, or whatever via @mail. Thanks :) Much appreciated. 
      <p>Lots of people think that running the matrix is difficult. Well, yes, 
        it is. Deckers have to memorize LOTS of commands to do all the things 
        they need to do. However, that doesn't mean the matrix is off limits to 
        everyone else. Yes, even someone without a datajack, but with a desktop 
        computer, can manage to get in there and look around.
      <p>A desktop computer (available from vendors at a number of stores around 
        town) will grant someone access to the Matrix. With a few commands, you 
        can be up and on your way, AND not have to worry about ICE or anything 
        like that (unless, of course, you want to face it, but I wouldn't recommend 
        that on a desktop...) 
      <p>Steps to getting Online 
      <p>1) Persona Name and Description: You have to give your persona a name. 
        Simple command: <b>name &lt;what you want to be called&gt;<what you want yourself to be called></b>
      <p> Then you have to get a description. That's just as easy with : <b>desc 
        <deck> &lt;deck&gt; &lt;what you want your deck to look like -- remember, 
        this must be computerlike&gt;</b>
      <p> <deck> <your description, remember, keep it computer like.> Once those 
        two steps are done, you're ready to jack in. 
      <p>2)Going OOC: To make sure that you can make it through without triggering 
        and having to wait for a MJudge type: 
      <p>+deck set OOC 
      <p>Nice command...but you're limited to moving, reading and writing, and 
        RPing.
      <p>3)Jacking in: First, make sure there are jack in points. +scan ports 
        If you see ports, you're in luck. The command with a desktop is: computer 
        jack in <port name> Page a matrix admin if you think there should be a 
        port in your area.
      <p>4) Communications: Once you're jacked in, you'll notice some things are 
        different. Like...talking and looking. Here's the commands below: 
      <p> Talking: <b>'blah</b><br>
        <br>
        Looking: <b>v</b> or <b>v &lt;object&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        Posing: <b>.wave</b>
      <p>5) Moving around: Moving in the matrix is different as well. In the matrix<br>
        there are three different types of nodes: Regional Telecommunications<br>
        Grids - RTG (like a country code), Local Telecommunications Grid - LTG<br>
        (like an area code), and Hosts, which are systems you can go into. It 
        runs<br>
        RTG--&gt;LTGs--&gt;Hosts. To move you need to know these commands:<br>
        <b><br>
        sclogon RTG &lt;hacking pool or 0 for none&gt; &lt;RTG four number address&gt;<br>
        <br>
        sclogon LTG &lt;hacking pool or 0 for none&gt; &lt;LTG four number address&gt;<br>
        <br>
        sclogon HOST &lt;hacking pool or 0 for none&gt; &lt;HOST four number address&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        Some experience and time in the 'trix will tell you which command will 
        be<br>
        needed where.<br>
        <br>
        By the way, you'll note that LTGs are not listed from the RTG. The Seattle<br>
        RTG lists the site of SeaSource, a public host system, but the rest, you<br>
        have to find. Ask your friendly decker for a host address that might be 
        fun<br>
        (like SHADOWLAND and MAGLAND)<br>
        <br>
        6) Files and Information: Ah, information, one of the most important<br>
        reasons for visiting the matrix. Files are put up in the Matrix almost 
        like a<br>
        bulletin board...well, cuz they are in a since. You only need to know 
        a few<br>
        commands to manipulate these information databases.<br>
        <br>
        <b>scscan file &lt;hacking pool&gt;</b> - Lets you find files in the system. 
        Good one to start out with.<br>
        <br>
        <b>scread file &lt;hacking pool&gt; &lt;file name&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>screply file &lt;hacking pool&gt; &lt;file name&gt;=&lt;Message&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>scwrite file &lt;hacking pool&gt; &lt;file name&gt;=&lt;Message&gt;</b><br>
        <br>
        7) Logging Off: When you are all finished, there is one simple command.<br>
        <br>
        Graceful Logoff<br>
        <br>
        Running the Matrix isn't necessarily left up to just deckers. In the<br>
        numerous books by FASA in which deckers post, you'll see remarks from<br>
        Mages, Street Sammies, and even the average citizen. What you have here<br>
        (+deck set OOC) will allow anyone to do it. Sure, finding SHADOWLAND or<br>
        MAGLAND may be difficult, but if you REALLY want to find it, you will.<br>
        Either ask...or learn from word on the street. Be patient, and you'll 
        learn.<br>
        Just remember that you can always join MatrixGeneral and ask a question<br>
        or use the ever friendly online help manual... <b>+cdhelp</b>
