      <p> One of the key elements to any character is the background you put in 
        after character creation. Often, people ask us as Admins for certain perks 
        based on their backgrounds, and attempt to write themselves into powerful 
        positions, cyberware, et. alia. While we applaud the initiative and do 
        indeed occasionally award such perks, for the most part, the information 
        you read as a guest and in other news files is indeed accurate: this MUSH 
        is largely centered around the concept/idea of beginning characters in 
        their respective fields. Just because you write nicely and manage to fit 
        every piece of bioware and cyberware into your background doesn't mean 
        you're going to get it--and no, you cannot be a Dragon. </p>
      <p>Tips on good backgrounds: First, try to have at least one living relative 
        who you like, preferably several, or don't mention them at all. The number 
        ONE pet peeve of the RPAdmins is the background that goes as follows: 
        "My (sibling/parent/family pet) worked for (Organized Crime Group/Corporation/Shadowrunning 
        Team/Terrorist Ballet Squad) when (Don/Oyabun/CEO/Prima Ballerina) decided 
        that (parent/sibling/pet) was a (liability/traitor/racist pig/poor dresser) 
        and killed them (with a rusty butter knife/with lots of APDS ammunition/by 
        drowning them in Cheez Whiz). I intend to hunt them down and KILL THEM 
        ALL!!!!MUAHAHAHAAHAHA!!!!". This background or variations on the revenge 
        theme are so incredibly common that they're boring and are almost always 
        rejected. </p>
      <p>Second, don't be exmilitary or excorp without a really good story. Vying 
        for the number ONE pet peeve background is the one that goes, "I werked 
        for (AAA megacorp/Street Doc/Stuffer Shack) for a few yearz as sekurity 
        and they gave me (Move-by-Wire System 4/Boosted Reflexes 3/Cybernetic 
        Arm With NERPS!(tm) dispensor attachment) but I dint like them so I left 
        an day forgot about me, so now I got dis wiz cyberwarez but dey want to 
        kill me." We don't like these backgrounds because they suck. </p>
      <p>Third, be as defined as possible, as long as you want it to be. Write 
        it in interesting forms, if you want--some good backgrounds include a 
        recorded confession while on the run, or a dossier completely stolen from 
        the Matrix by someone, or their criminal record with annotated notes. 
      </p>
      <p>Fourth, be inventive. Create personalities for the people in your backgrounds, 
        refer to them in your RP even if they never are going to exist as PCs 
        or NPCs. The more background you have, the more fun you will have playing 
        here. </p>
      <p>Fifth, Make us want to read it. Try to be creative--and even if you don't 
        like using a dictionary to RP with and your spelling isn't so great, do 
        so with your background, at least. </p>
      <p>Sixth, don't be too derivative. In other words, steer away from blatantly 
        ripping off popular fiction or shadowrun fiction, or pop culture. Don't 
        try to be characters from the Shadowrun books/fiction/et. alia without 
        checking with us first, and don't use names like "Case", "Wintermute", 
        "Hiro Protagonist", etc. Be original. </p>
      <p>These are all tips on how to make a good background. </p>
