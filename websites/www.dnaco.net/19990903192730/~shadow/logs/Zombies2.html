Hulk finishes reloading his gun as he peers around. "Mierde! How many of 
  these fraggers _are_ there?" 

Red stands up from his half-sitting position against the wall, he rubs 
  the back of his head, frowning, "There's going to be a helluva lump 
  the later." He lifts his gun to check his ammo. 

Damien shakes his head, falling back agaisnt the wall and dropping the 
  huge pistol back into the it's holster, his breathing unsteady "I had 
  better get the full fifty for this" swalling for a moment, he pulls 
  the huge military shotgun from under his shoulders, taking a quick 
  glance around "stay away from that drek leakin from em" 

[Streetwise] A disgruntled squatter at the Shelter talks to the other 
  squatters, says, "Our type have been disappearing for WEEKS now! And 
  what does the Star do? NOTHING! How much longer are we going to take 
  having our husbands, wifes, and children disappearing and nobody 
  caring?"" 

Damien looks at his other two teammates, sighing "mano, I would hate to 
  have to clean this place up" 

Hulk peers down at the corpses by his feet. "Drek? Leaking? Where?" 

Damien points to the green goo. 

Red looks around, "Frag clearing this place....We need to get out of 
  here now. Then we ask for more money to clear this joint and bring 
  more artillary." He looks down, noticing the goo for the first time, 
  "What the frag is that?" 

There is a greenish goo coming out of the bullet holes in the bodies.. 
  pooling on the floor beneath them.. 

Hulk examines the gouge on his arm carefully, then stuffs a small piece 
  of rag over the wound, which seems to be scabbing over without 
  difficulty. 

[Streetwise] A junkie on BTLs laughs as he watches another Star vehicle 
  grab two squatters for loiter, "Hehehehe... look! There goes another 
  one, and another.. and the Star is taking another one there.. and one 
  there.. and that one.. This is better than that Macgregor porn beetle 
  I had the other day..." He giggles insanely. 

Damien shakes his head "I dunno" taking a deep breath and a quick look 
  around, his hand tightening on the grip of the rifle "where too?" 

Hulk says "Ewww! That's gross. I tell ya, if this is anything to do with 
  Fed-Boeing, I hope they get their asses well and truly chewed for it!" 

Red looks down the hallway, in the direction they have yet to explore. 
  He seems to have taken control of himself, recovering from the fear 
  and excitement of their earlier encounter. 

There are still 3 unexplored, unopened doors in this hallway.. 

Hulk looks at the other two. "Well, it's up to you guys. You okay to 
  carry on? It's fine by me, if you think you're up to it..." 

Far off in the distance.. It sounds like its coming from somewhere 
  upstairs.. you start to hear a distant sound.. as you listen you 
  realize its sounds like music.. but nothing you've ever heard 
  before... "Every breath you take.. every step you take.. I'll be 
  watching you" is the only lyric you can really understand.. 

Red looks from Hulk to Damien, "Let's take stock of the 
  situation....Somebody had to MAKE these things, right?" He looks down 
  at the bodies, "Does he have to be close to them? If so, what happens 
  if we get the guy?" 

Hulk grins. "We get lots of cred from someone?" 

Damien looks back, "ok guys" he points to the three doors "do we wanna 
  eenie meenie minie moe this, cuz I just want to find the fraggin 
  stairs and get the frag outta this dump" he looks back the way he 
  came, sighing a bit and looking forwards once again. 

Red chuckles quietly, but with little humor, "Well, I mean, do we stop 
  these things by killing the creator?" 

Damien shrugs "who knows" he bites his lip softly "there is only one way 
  to find out, neh?" 

Hulk hefts his SMG. "Well, it's either that or we can go ask Ares if we 
  can borrow their nuke..." 

Red nods slwoly, then raises his Colt Cobra to a ready position, 
  resisting the urge to check it once more. 

Damien nods to Hulk, a faint chuckle escaping his lips "guys, spare 
  redmond, we got this warehouse....." 

Hulk says "Same as before? Closest door, one opens it, one covers the 
  doorway, one covers the other side of the hall. Okay?" 

Red nods, "Let's just stick to the same positions, I have the hallway." 

Damien nods his head "ok" he moves towards the door, shotgun braced 
  against his shoulder, the gas vent sticking out "I will open the door" 

Hulk moves a couple of paces behind Damien, gun at the ready and 
  pointing at the doorway. 

Red moves a few steps down the hall, kneeling down and pointing his 
  weapon down in the unknown direction. He is against the wall on the 
  opposite side of the door they are opening, but not directly across 
  from it, a little further down the hall from it. 

Damien tucks his foot back, kicking the door open, lowering the rifle 
  and looking into the room, his customed fuchi cybereyes constantly 
  switching mode from lowling to thermo. 

The roof overhead starts to creak.. sounding like someone is walking on 
  the floor above.. the sound slowly trails off.. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "low light" 

The room is dusty except for a path that leads from the door to an 
  opening in the wall.. the opening goes out into what looks like a 
  giant pipe.. a rank smell coming through the opening.. 

Red glances up at the dust drifting down from the ceiling, he quickly 
  returns his attention to the hallway, a scowl on his face. 

Hulk studies the pipe. "That look like an entry to the sewers to you?" 

Red scans the hallway, not in a position to see what they are talking 
  about. 

A small amount of water trickles down the pipe.. but you do notice that 
  there are foot prints in the dirt and crude.. alot of them.. 

Hulk says "I tell ya - that's how they are getting into the fraggin' 
  sewers and around town. Damn. Don't s'pose anyone has any C-12 on 
  them?" 

Damien shakes his head "Sorry, left it in my other suit" 

Red pipes in from the hallway, "I have a couple of grenades in my 
  truck." 

Shinto added into your monitor list. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Which ICly is outside. ;P" 

Hulk shakes his head. "Not good enough. Only other thing I can think of 
  is to ring this houngan I mentioned. He might want to help us out, 
  although I don't reckon these are voodoo zombies. 
Hulk says "I'm pretty sure that he could flatten the pipe. Permanently." 

Damien steps back away from the room, looking down the hallway towards 
  on of the other two opened doors "ever get the feeling we were straigh 
  lied to" he pauses "I mean I get the feeling this place is some 
  fucking twisted lab straigh outta frangenstien" 
Damien looks to Hulk for a moment "hell, this thing will do some damage 
  to that pipe, I just don't know if thats gonna make more problems or 
  less" 

Red doesn't say anything in response, he continues to focus his 
  attention down the hallway. 

Hulk nods. "Well, we can sort that out as and when we find the way out. 
  Two choices - head into the sewersand find a manhole, or look for the 
  stairs. 

Damien nods "I am pro this lookin for the stairs Idea myself" 

Red speaks up again, "Well, we know there are more of those upstairs. 
  Does it look like there are more in the tunnel? I'd say stairs. We 
  don't know how far to the nearest manhole. Once we get upstairs, we 
  can break a window or something." 

Hulk nods. "Sounds okay. I take it we don't wanna try to take the 
  upstairs out right now unless we have to?" 

Damien nods "unless it's absolutely nessecary, homeboy can pay my happy 
  ass to come back when I am packin some serious damage" 

Red nods in agreement, "In the meantime, we have a nice amount of nuyen 
  coming to us." 

Hulk says "Agreed. Okay, let's check the room...you go high, I'll go 
  low. On three." 
Hulk says "One." 

Red says "And I don't have any bad feelings towards trying to get more." 

Hulk says "Two." 

Damien nods "lets do it" stepping to the door. 

Hulk says "THREE" 

Damien moves into the room, rifle butted up against his shoulder as he 
  looks around. 

Hulk dives into the room, rolling through the doorway and waving his 
  gunbarrel in an arc at knee-height. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "This the same sewer room?" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "I _always_ wanted to do that! :))" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Yes, the pipe room." 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "The room that opened to the pipes.. or the 
  pipes?" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Room that opens to the pipes." 

Announcement: Rae shouts "+nom's will be tallied in ten minutes." 

Red sits tight at his position, crouched low with his weapon pointed 
  down the hall. 

The room is empty except for the floor which is littered with sleeping 
  bags.. and cardboard little puptents of sorts.. The walls and stuff on 
  the floor are also splattered with blood.. and there is even a body 
  part or two... 

Damien stands, rifle butted against his shoulder, taking the high route 
  here. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk the karma slut whines, "Any remaining +noms for the week will 
  be gratefully accepted." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "I'm out sorry" 

Hulk swallows as he looks at the carnage. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Maybe we can +nom these zombies, in exchange for safe 
  passage. ;P" 

Damien peers around the room for a moment, taking a deep breath and 
  shaking his head "damn, looks like some old men went to town with some 
  girl scouts here" he grimaces a bit, turning and heading back out the 
  door. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk grimaces. "What about Shane running you, Damien? We'll RP 
  you, he can fight for you? (We are trying to avoid fighting on the way 
  out, after all...) 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "no, I am out of +noms" 

Hulk backs slowly out of the room after Damien, closing the door behind 
  him. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "I am not going anywhere for about an hour and a 
  half" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk giggles. "Phew! That's a relief - my brain, sorry. Duh!" 

You +proll 5 dice for Shane: 2 4 4 4 7 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Guess the zombies will starve if they try to munch on 
  your grey matter. ;P" 

&gt;From afar, Damien snickers "You roll 6 dice: 1 1 3 3 17 19" 

[Streetwise] Down Town Squatter says, "Yah, it was purdy fragged up. A 
  few stils were kicking th' drek outa dis breedah woman 'round here da 
  other day. Some other breedahs came 'long and fired at dem tusks. 
  Naturally, dey got geeked and were dying on the street. But fer some 
  reason th' hoomans took 'em into dere car and drove onto da high way. 
  Probably gonna sell their organs for cash er somethin'." 

Damien stops and looks back "these zombies look like squatters guys" 
  swallowing "and anyone notice, we got lotsa blood and no boddies?" he 
  looks back curiously. "I mean this place looks like a squat" 

Red glances up at the two leaving the room, raising an eyebrow in 
  confusion, "What are you guys talking about?" 

Damien points to a fallen zombie "look at his clothes omae, look at 
  HIM!!! that is a fucking bum" 

Hulk nods slowly. "Well, I'd already figured that the missing squatters 
  were turning into zombies. But just how many of these fraggers _are_ 
  there? Roger told me he geeked about thirty last week alone!" 

Damien shakes his head "great, a fraggin epidemic" a faint chuckle 
  escapes his lips "I knew something was up when he said he came to us 
  cuz we were the best" 

Red chuckles and looks out over the hallway, "I AM the best. Just that 
  this isn't exactly my area of expertise." 

Hulk shakes his head ruefully. "That's what you get from Johnsons. Heh." 

Damien shrugs "lets go see how many more of these fraggers we gotta deal 
  wit" he moves out of the room, approaching the next unopened door, 
  rifle planted against his shoulder. 

Hulk follows in formation. "Y'know, we _ought_ to tell someone about all 
  this. I mean, if we fraggin' don't get out, someone else should 
  know..." 

Red says "I have a headphone, Hulk." 
Red rises and moves further down the hall, keeping his weapon trained 
  down the hallway. 

Damien shakes his head "lessee we have geeked six of these fraggers, 
  theres close to fourty sleeping bags in there, I think we are gonna 
  have some problems leaving" sighing deeply. 

Hulk grins. "And I have a Fuchi Flipfone. So? Who we gonna call?" 

Damien shrugs amd smiles "ghostbusters?" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "sorry, had to :)" 

Hulk says "Naah, with any luck, amigo, most of 'em gonna be down the 
  sewers." 

Red cackles, "You call that luck, chummer?" 

Damien smirks "do we look like we got luck on our side" bringing his 
  foot back and looking over "we ready to see whats behind door number 
  three?" 

You hear a sound from the floor above.. sounds like an intercom system 
  or something.. "All you lil Zombies.. dinner is now being served in 
  the basement.. come and get it while its hot.." 

Hulk nods, gun at the ready. He looks up at the voice. "Aw frag. Shall 
  we hurry this up?" 

Damien looks back, his tone lowering for a moment "oh fuck" 

Red drops to one knee, scanning the halway and moving his Cobra 
  whereever his eyes are trained, "I think we found the leader-guy." 

The sound of shuffling can be heard in the building now..and the sound 
  of furniture being thrown out of the way.. 

Hulk says "Yeah. So it's 'find the way out quick' or 'find the leader 
  guy quick'." 
Hulk says "Open the damn' door!" 

Damien nods and brings his foot back, kicking the door with all his 
  force, dropping down with the assault shotgun braced against his 
  shoulder. Head panning around the room. 

Red looks around the room for any sign of surveillance devices, while 
  maintaing a vigil on the end of the hallway. 

As you open the door a huge cloud of greenish smoke comes plumming out.. 
  covering over you... (everyone roll quickness) 

You +proll 7 dice for Shane: 1 3 4 5 5 9 11 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "You all manage to hold your breath.." 

The cloud disperses quickly.. in the room you notice two things... 
  another 30-40 sleeping bags and shit.. all with people inside of them 
  though.. the people look like they are all asleep.. they don't look 
  zombiefied either... there is a small canister in the middle of them 
  though.. about half a meter tall.. and cylindrical.. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien looks at 1/86 "woohoo" 

Hulk curses softly. "I'll get the canister. This is proof..." 

Red's eyes widen when the cloud billows from the room. His weapon wavers 
  as he quickly suck in a breath of fresh air. 

Hulk says "Cover me." 

Red recovers and starts to scan down the hallway again. 

Damien lowers his head, shaking off the cloud and narrowing his eyes on 
  the people and the bags, focusing for a moment, a faint sight escapes 
  his lips as he looks at the people in the bags. "you covered" he 
  begins to drift his rifle around hulks movements. 

Hulk takes a deep breath, then slips into the room. He steps carefully, 
  yet smoothly, over the bodies on the floor, heading for the canister. 

As soon as Hulk reaches the canister... stuff starts to move inside the 
  room.. people start to slowly clamber and get up... down the hallway 
  where Red is guarding.. the door at the end of it opens.. and standing 
  in it is the giant form of a large zombified troll.. his lips having 
  burned away or something.. his teeth show in a ugly grin.. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Everyone TS :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Tiny Sex!?!?!? :P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "He means we're all fucked..." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "with these guys??!!??" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "hahahaha i mean.. INIT" 

Shane has cleared the +inits for this round. 

Damien has left. 

&gt;From the TimeStop, Damien has arrived. 

Damien has entered the timestop. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane has no clue where TS came into this.. umm sure.. do that 
  too 

You roll for initiative: 3d6 + 6 - 0 - 0 = 18 

&gt;From the TimeStop, Damien has left. 

Damien has arrived. 
Damien has left the timestop. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "+init?" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Yes" 

Hulk grabs at the canister, but it doesn't move! He curses softly, then 
  turns and makes a very hasty beeline back towards the corridor 
  door...his feet are a blur as he dodges around the slowly stirring 
  'corpses', and he has to jump to avoid one particularly fast hand 
  which attempts to grab his ankle. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Damien is standing in the doorway right?" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Um. Yeah. :(" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "One of the misc laws of physics I learned and 
  forget.. had something to do with momentum... and the fact.. it takes 
  time/distance to stop.. based on the mass and speed of the object.." 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Good thing you forgot it, huh. :)" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Damien and Hulk.. +jroll body" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "with CP?" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "sure.. Its a dodge.. you can roll CP Damien :)" 

You roll 6 dice: 1 3 3 3 4 4 

Hulk cannons into Damien, who can't get out of the way in time. Hulk 
  bounces off, into the corridor, just in time to see the appearance of 
  the troll... 

Damien fires a three round burst from his Franchi SPAS-22 at Shane. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Shane topples over and the zombies run amuck....Unable 
  to make combat rolls, the team is quickly overcome and consumed by the 
  inhuman beats." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "ROFLMAO!" 

Damien falls back a bit, his body turning towards the troll as he pulls 
  up the huge gas vented shotgun, taking aim for a brief moment, the 
  loud boom from the shotgun echoing off the walls. Lighting up the 
  halls with a bright flash. 

The first zombie goes flying backwards into the doorway he came 
  through... landing he reveals a stairwell.. but the stairwell is full 
  of zombies coming down the stairs... 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "gotta love the franchi spas 22 :)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "I ordered one. ;)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "smart man :)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Well, I figure since luck seems to only give me one 
  action in a turn, I might as well knock something down that one 
  action." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien nods "yep the franchi would be the best way to do that, 
  ultimate twink gun, 2 bursts per action, die die die!" =) 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Hulk, now might be a good time to go green." 

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane. 
You roll 8 dice: 1 2 2 4 4 5 5 10 

Hulk begins slowly to back down the hallway. He takes a shot at the lead 
  zombie coming donw the stairs, saying, "Um, guys? How about boosting 
  ourselves back out the way we came in?" 

You show your Ingram Smartgun to shane. 

The human zombie grunts as it gets pushed back slightly by the bullets.. 
  parts of its body flying off.. It topples over forwards.. landing at 
  the foot of the stairs.. a green goo starts to come out of it... 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "I'll bb in 5 min.. I'm _STARVED_ (was actually 
  having a shower when you paged me.. and my stomach is empty.. sooo 
  I'll bbs! :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red nods, "This is of course, a calculated effort to leave us in 
  suspense and create anxiety." :P 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "no, it's a smoke break :)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk lights up. And wishes he had something illegal to smoke. 
  *sigh* 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "It's 5 more minutes of life. :P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk debates about amphetamines. _Anything_ to speed him up even 
  more... *giggle* 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "I think I'm buying some more cyber with the money 
  gathered here. ;P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "Lilith here I come :P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk wants bio. From Lilith. :P 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "HelloooooOOOooooooo. ;)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Shhh!" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Oh yeah, don't wanna cause the zombies any stress." 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "family sucks :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Dunno, my nearest family is six hours away." 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "ESPECIALLY when they forget to do the shopping so 
  you gotta go buy food ;P" 
&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "especially when your walking like a cripple" 

Damien moves backwards his eyes still focused on the door, pulling the 
  huge assault shotgun up to his shoulder and squeezing the trigger, the 
  huge rifle sliding up to his shoulder, brusting loudly twice in 
  succession. 
Damien fires a three round burst from his Franchi SPAS-22 at Shane. 

Both bursts go wide.. sending bits of the wall flying.. but not hitting 
  any badguys.. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Ain't recoil a _bitch_ with those things? :) Don't 
  forget, it's x2 uncompensated recoil for a shotgun..." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "it's gas vented IV, no recoil" 

The zombies inside the room are at there feet.. and making there way 
  towards the door way.. the room is filled with zombies.. a large ork 
  almost getting to the doorway... his arms stretched towards Damien... 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "The people in the room didn't look like zombies 
  when Hulk went in.. but when you look back towards them.. they look in 
  the early stages.. skin starting to shrivel and peel.." 

Red fires a three round burst from his Colt Cobra TZ-118 at Shane. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "show/roll/pose" 
&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "that was meant for Red ;P" 

Red rises to a low croucha and starts to step back, he leans into his 
  Cobra and pulls the trigger, letting off a three-round burst in the 
  direction of the zombie in the stairwell. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Am I still here?" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "Phew! Thought I'd locked up..." 

Red's shots are rushed as he shuffles back. His rounds crack loudly into 
  the doorframe, missing the zombie entirely. 

CRACKCRACKCRACK!!! 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "I need to go do some shit.. : but.. I assume you 
  guys just want to retreat.. out through th e sewer to a manhole cover? 
  collect your 50K and leave an offer to help?" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "yep!" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk nodnods. 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red grins, "Um, heh, sure." Looks around suspiciously. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Everyone unlock" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Well Red.. were you planning on fighting your way 
  up the stairwell while the zombies from teh room get you from behind? 
  :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "No, just don't trust a generous admin in the middle of 
  a timestop. :P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red grins. 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien cackles 

Shane gave you Certified Credstick #470. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Never trust a dragon, but they forgot to add something 
  else, rule 4) Watch out for generous admins. :P" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Although you might note I'm unlocked already. :P" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien giggles 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "I'm only generous because life is calling me.." 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien whews! 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Everyone feel like rolling body for your damage? 
  :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "_We_ appreciate it, Shane... ;)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "Hmmm, Liiiii-ooof? Leeeeeefff? What's that word again? 
  Sounds foriegn." 
&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "with CP?" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "With or without CP? *snigger*" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Ummm.. no.. :)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Red grins. 

You roll 6 dice: 1 2 2 4 16 17 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "are we allowing rerolls? :)" 
&lt;OOC&gt; Hulk says, "GOOD point!" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "No" 

You are disentigrated and then promptly recoalesced on the mortal plane, 
  grateful to have been returned unharmed from the heavens. 

Private Room 

This room has been refitted from an office into a bedroom. The walls 
  have no windows, but cool air blows constantly in from a purification 
  system in the four corners, recycling and renewing the air. The walls 
  are covered with a dark wine colored tapestry, covering the concrete 
  walls. The floor has been carpetted, with a plush, thick crimson 
  colored rug. The center of the room is a queen sized bed, with a 
  matching crimson comforter, the pillows slightly darker. The tapestry 
  behind the bed has a painting of a watercolor, a hand, from what looks 
  like an ork, trailing purples and reds, as if it had been severed and 
  placed on a black velvet tablecloth. A door off to the side leads to a 
  small lavatory. The only thing besides the bed, is a small vanity, 
  locked and secured tightly.
