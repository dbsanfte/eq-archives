Hulk(#13827PXUc) 

He is wearing an expensive-looking three piece suit, in charcoal grey. 
  Highly polished, black Armani patent shoes appear from underneath the 
  neatly-pressed turnups of his trousers, and a pastel blue silk shirt 
  can be seen beneath his jacket and vest, complemented by a navy blue 
  tie sporting the Dunkelzahn Enterprises logo. Whilst the cut of the 
  clothing is obviously expensive, and very possibly hand-tailored, it 
  still fails to completely disguise the bulky shape of his body.

  Purgatory table and sits down.

At your table, Hulk nods politely. "I'm Hulk."

Red enters Limbo from the Vestibule. 
Red has arrived. 

Damien walks into the club and looks around, heading towards the 
  Purgatory Gray table. 

Red walks into the room, glancing around, obviously unfamiliar with the 
  place. 

Damien walks up to the table and looks at the two occupants, "may I 
  sit?" a curious look on his face. 

Hoth looks up at Damien and says "I would not have called you here is I 
  didn't want you to sit." he says with a smile. 

Damien smiles and slides into a seat. 
Damien sits down at the Purgatory Gray Table. 
Damien joins you. 

At your table, Hulk looks at Damien as he sits, and nods once. "D" 

Red walks a slow circle around the room and spots the table he's looking 
  for, he heads for the purgatory grey table, skirting any other patrons 
  in the club. 

At your table, Damien tips his head back at Hulk "hoi omae" his gaze 
  drifting around the club for a bit, then back to Hoth "greetings, I 
  don't believe we've met" 
At your table, Hoth smiles, "Hoi there, I am Hoth. 

Red arrives at the table and looks at the three gathered there, he 
  raises an arched eyebrow in a questionng manner. 

At your table, Damien nods his head, extending his hand "Damien, 
  streetname Razor" 
At your table, Hoth takes Damien's Hand and shakes it vigorusly.

Red sits down at the Purgatory Gray Table. 
Red joins you. 

At your table, Red glances at the occupants of the booth, "Forgive me, 
  but I didn't realize this was going to be a conference." 
At your table, Damien looks att Red and nods his head, a thin smile 
  across his asian lips "greets" 
At your table, Hulk nods also. The flicker of a smile passes across his 
  lips. 
At your table, Hoth says "Yes, no one knew it was going to be a 
  confernece, it was easier that way, now for the reason I called you 
  here." 
At your table, Damien leans back in his seat, eyes focused intently on 
  Hoth. 
At your table, Red looks at Hoth, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. 
At your table, Hoth says "Ok, I have been hired to get you all together, 
  A certain Mr. J wants it that way, he says you are the best of the 
  best, now....This Mr. J wants to hire you 3 for a recon run, the pay 
  will be 20K per person, 5K of it I will give you right now." 
At your table, Red raises his eyebrow again and glances at the other two 
  at the table, sizing them up. 
At your table, Damien looks around the table and shrugs his shoulders, 
  the statement obviously catching him off guard. 
At your table, Hulk adjusts his position slightly, apparently waiting 
  for more information. 
At your table, Hoth says "Are you guys Game?" 
At your table, Red says "I'm interested, but I would prefer to know a 
  bit more before I commit to anything. I prefer to err on the side of 
  caution." 
At your table, Hulk nods once. "Given a few more details. I do not 
  believe in going on a run totally blind. It's hard enough with new 
  team mates..." 
At your table, Damien nods his head a few times, a thoughtful look on 
  his face "ok, I can do this, but I would like a little more 
  information before I commit to anything" 
At your table, Red chuckles quietly when all the responses are nearly 
  identical. 
At your table, Hoth smiles 
At your table, Hoth says "Thats all I know of the run, you will be 
  getting more info when you go to the location I give you, that is 
  after you accept the retainer fee of 5K that I will give you when you 
  accept." 
At your table, Hulk squints and looks thoughtful, then glances at the 
  other two, one eyebrow raised. 
At your table, Red leans back and crosses his arms, he looks down at the 
  table for a moment, then turns and looks at the other two, raising his 
  eyebrow once again, "What do you think?" 
At your table, Damien purses his lips in thought and carefully looks 
  over the the other two in the group, his gaze drifting back to Hoth 
  "well, I figure I am in good hands" he pauses "I'm in" 
At your table, Hulk looks doubtful. "You got a good group together here. 
  But I don't like accepting a job knowing nothing. Not at all." 

Jenny enters Limbo from the Vestibule. 
Jenny has arrived. 

At your table, Red looks at Hulk for a moment then turns to Hoth again, 
  "One thing first, what does Mr. Johnson think we can offer to 
  this...recon...And why is he remaining anonymous? 

Jenny enters the club and heads for the bar taking the first avaliable 
  stool 
Jenny sits down at the Long Curved Bar. 

At your table, Hoth says "I understand that, I am just here to get you 
  guys together, once I give you the k, you go talk to the Mr. J, and if 
  you don't like the job, you can walk away, no obligations." 
At your table, Red smiles, "And the 5K?" 
At your table, Hulk relaxes. "Those terms are acceptable to me." 
At your table, Damien nods his head "wiz" 
At your table, Hoth says "The 5K I will give you right now." 
At your table, Red says "That is more than generous. I'm in as well." 
At your table, Red glances at the credstick and places it into his pants 
  pocket. 

Hoth gave you Certified Credstick #39108. 

At your table, Hulk slips his into his jacket. 
At your table, Damien slides the stick into his jacket pocket and folds 
  his hands in front of him on the table. 
At your table, Hoth says "Ok, there is the 5K, now you need to go to 
  100N Alaskan way, that is 1 block south of Denny, and the Mr. J will 
  meet you there, and if you need anything else, like guns, come to me, 
  I know alot of people who can get that kinda thing." 
At your table, Red smiles again, "How do we identify Mr. Johnson?" 
At your table, Damien nods his head slowly "you got a number or should I 
  use smoke signals?" 
At your table, Damien smiles thinly 
At your table, Hulk grins at Damien's question. 
At your table, Hoth says "Smoke signals might work" He says with a smile 
  "or you can call LTG2107-84649."" 
At your table, Hoth says "When you get to the meeting point, the Mr. J 
  will be there waiting, he will be with 2 trolls." 
At your table, Damien shrugs "yeah, cept I dunno how to do em, as soon 
  as I learn tho" he pauses, a thin smile rests on his face. 
At your table, Red nods and looks at the other two, "Do you want to 
  drive seperately?" 
At your table, Damien nods to Red "yeah, I wanna cruise by my pad and 
  grab some stuff." 
At your table, Hulk nods. "Gotta nip back, get my gear - I don't carry 
  it downtown as a rule..." 
At your table, Damien nods to Hulk "I hear you there hombre" 
At your table, Red nods and looks at Hulk, "Okay, we should meet 
  somewhere so that we arrive at the same time." 
At your table, Hulk says "Union and Alaskan?" 
At your table, Red smiles, "Sounds good." 
At your table, Damien nods "I'm on it" 
At your table, Hulk says "I'll be there in...fifteen to twenty." 

Red turns to Hoth and nods, "A pleasure doing business with you. I'll 
  see you another time." 

At your table, Hulk rises smoothly to his feet and also nods to Hoth 
  respectfully. "Nice doin' business." 
At your table, Hoth says "I will see you all again, I am sure you will 
  need something one day."

  other again"

  he heads towards the exit.

Red steps out and pushs the door shut. 

Infront of the warehouse is a black expensive car.. A troll opens the 
  door as the three men show up.. and out steps a human.. dressed in a 
  fairly nice suit. 

The huge man dressed in black walks towards the car. 

Damien walks towards the car, his gaze drifting to the troll then to the 
  ariving human, folding his arms across his chest and waiting 
  patiently. 

Red joins the other two, watching the man with reserved interst, only 
  glancing at the troll briefly. 

The man watches the three men.. his face emotionless.. his hands 
  passively at his sides. The troll watches a little more intently.. 
  eyeing all three men.. he looks fairly tense.. but is trying to 
  relax.. 

Hulk stops a couple of paces short of the man and nods. "Mr. J." 

The human speaks.. "And you would be my recon team? 
The man chuckles.. "Yes I guess that would be my name.. wouldn't it?" 

Red smiles and glances at the other two and then back at the man, saying 
  nothing, but watching him with interest. 

Hulk says "We are here to listen to your proposal." 

Damien nods his head slowly, looking at the human "that would indeed be 
  us" he looks around at the rest of his crew. 

The human turns and points at a warehouse (OOC: not the Warehouse &lt;WH&gt; 
  but another one).. The building looks fairly old and very abandoned... 
  some windows are broken.. some are boarded up.. the front door is 
  boarded up. "I wish to buy that property.. but.. there are rumors.. of 
  things inside... I'm assuming it may just be ghouls.. but.. thats why 
  I need you three.. to go in there.. find out whats there.. I will pay 
  you each 15K.. 25K if any serious combat comes out.. and another 50K 
  if you clear whatever is in there out..." 
The building is 4 stories tall... and seems to be fairly large.. You 
  figure it will take you a few hours to inspect every room in it.. 

Red raises an arched eyebrow, glancing at the building. 

Hulk looks the building over, then glances at the other two. 

Damien looks over to the other two in the group, drifting his gaze to 
  the building. 

Hulk nods almost imperceptibly. 

"I know 15K is ALOT for a simple look around.. but I NEED that 
  property.. and I need it soon.. If I am to get the permits and what 
  not for my buisness." 

Red turns back to the man, "Okay, it sounds good. What specific rumors 
  have you heard?" 

&gt;&gt;Announcement&lt;&lt; Archon says, "Everyone who is in Downtown Seattle can 
  see two very large Black Helo Gunships moving through the area." 

Damien rubs his chin for a moment, "ok, so whats the story? why you 
  choosin runners and not parahunters?" 

The man shrugs.. looking at red.. "Creatures.. of some type.. that scare 
  people off..." he turns to Damien.. "Because honestly.. I'm not sure 
  who is in there.. it might be a paracritter.. it might be nothing... 
  hiring a parahunter would also bring some official requests for 
  information and what not.. I wish to keep this all under the table." 

&gt;&gt;Announcement&lt;&lt; Archon says, "YES! These look like the same kind of 
  Aztech Gunships that blew the hell out of the Barrens and made the 
  news." 

Damien smiles "I scan ya, so anyone else ventured in or are we gonna be 
  the first?" 

Hulk nods, then glances at the sky as he hears a buzz of helos not far 
  away. 

The Mr J frowns at the sound.. "I wonder whats up..." he shrugs.. 

Red's head quirks a few moments before the helicopters are easily 
  audible. 

Damien shakes his head and looks up with curiousity. Sighing a bit he 
  looks back at the J, waiting for a response. 

"Anyway.. I haven't sent anyone in yet.. I was going to send my 
  bodyguard here.." he points at the Troll.. "But he seems to have a 
  fear of Ghosts.. and hes afraid thats what might be in there.." The 
  man shakes his head.. "Rubish of course.." 

Hulk takes a deep breath. "I'd be happier with mojo support, but I am 
  prepared to accept the offer." He raises an eyebrow at the other 
  members of the team. 

Damien nods his head slowly and sceptically. "ok" he exhales slowly "you 
  got a floor plan of the place?" 

The troll stands stonically.. his eyes sweeping and the area.. not 
  paying much attention to the runners. 

Red nods to Hulk's words, "I'm in as well." 

The man shakes his head.. "I had 2 sets.. one I left in a safe.. the 
  other I had to give to my property developer." 

Damien bites his lower lip for a moment and looks at the rest of the 
  team "I'm in" 

Red seems to drop into thought. 

The man smiles.. "Good good.. I have buisness to attend to.. but I will 
  be leaving one of my bodyguards here with your payment.. once you come 
  out with your report.. he'll pay you.." at this point another car 
  pulls up... fairly nice sports car... and a large Troll gets out.. 
  scanning the area.. he nods at the troll next to the human. 

Hulk politely nods to the suit. "Nice to do business with you." 

The human reaches up... running his hand through a small bit of stubble 
  on his cheeks.. "I guess I should shave too before I head down to my 
  buisness meetings." He motions over to the troll by the sports car. 
  "He will be the one that will pay you once this is all done." 

Red looks up again, he blinks his eyes and looks to Hulk and Damien. 

Damien takes a step back, pushing his electric blue bangs clear of his 
  eyes. Eyes drifting over the builiding once again. 

Red smiles, "Gentlemen.." He gestures to his landrover, "Can we step 
  into my office and talk for a moment?" 

The building has an old.. ominous horror flick look to it... it looks 
  like nobody has been in it for awhile now.. the wood looking fairly 
  old.. the walls have been vandalized.. but none of the spray painting 
  looks to new.. 

Hulk moves silently over towards the Rover. 

Damien nods his head a few times to red. 

Red nods to the Johnson once more and turns, walking towards his 
  landrover. 

Damien walks up behind the group, his eyes drifting back and forth from 
  the building to the team 

BMW Blitzen 2050 (SE3-1CRP) arrives from the south. 
BMW Blitzen 2050 (SE3-1CRP) cruises along the road into this area. 
BMW Blitzen 2050 (SE3-1CRP) has arrived. 

The primer grey Blitzen roars along the fog shrouded waterfront. The 
  roar of custom exhaust is muffled by the fog as the rider guides the 
  bike easily through much slower traffic. 

Red takes the keys out of his pocket and unlocks the door on the 
  Landrover Model 2046 (VCSFAPV). 
Red has left. 
Red opens one of the doors on Landrover Model 2046 (VCSFAPV) and gets 
  in.

Outside the truck, BMW Blitzen 2050 (SE3-1CRP) has left. 
Red says "Okay, I expect this to be a 25k job, or he would have sent his 
  troll in." 
Hulk nods. "I agree. Still not a problem - we all look competent, I 
  think." 
Red nods, "What do you two have for firepower?" 
Damien looks at Red "I got my Franchi and my Pred, you?" 
Hulk says "Long as we cover each other, should be frosty. I got an 
  Ingram smartgun with EX and a Savalette with EXEX. Oh, and a taser." 
Damien nods "question 2, can everyone here see in the dark?" 
Red says "I have a Colt Cobra with explosive rounds and a Pred 2. I have 
  some other goodies in this vehicle as well in the lockbox." 
Hulk says "Total dark, no, but I got low-light amps." 
Red turns to Damien, smiling with humor, "I'm an Elf." 
Hulk looks at Red. "Don't suppose you got a flashlight in here?" 
Hulk says "Just in case?" 
Red says "Okay, lets not prolong this. I have 4 M22A2's in the lockbox." 
Red says "If either of you would like to borrow one, then you may. And I 
  have a couple of smartguns in the" 
Damien nods "ok, I am set, lets do this, if need be I will smoke the 
  whole time and lead, I have thermos" 
Red says "In the foorlocker." 
Hulk shakes his head. "Prefer my smartgun cuz of the link. But thanks." 
Damien shakes his head "I got a franchi spas-22 (uber twink gun) I am 
  set" 
Hulk says "It's customized." 
Red digs in his glove compartment, "I have a little light in here. But 
  it should be good in a jam." 
Red hands Hulk the small light (The equivilant of a mini-mag light) 
Red reaches for the doorhandle, "Well, shall we start moving?" 
Hulk nods his thanks. "OK, let's rock!"

  North &lt;N&gt; South &lt;S&gt; 

You open the door and climb out of the Model 2046. 

The doors on the Landrover Model 2046 (VCSFAPV) lock with a soft click. 

One of the doors on Landrover Model 2046 (VCSFAPV) opens, and Red gets 
  out. 

Red steps out, letting the door close. 

Damien has arrived. 

One of the doors on Landrover Model 2046 (VCSFAPV) opens, and Damien 
  gets out. 

You get Ingram Smartgun from Webbing Belt. 

Webbing Belt dropped Ingram Smartgun. 

The man checks his watch as the 3 exit.. "So.. I assume this means you 
  will be taking the job?" 

You get Defiance Super Shock from Webbing Belt. 

Webbing Belt dropped Defiance Super Shock. 

Damien steps from the landroverm taking one more look over the building 
  before looking at the J and nodding his head. 

Red pulls his coat open and pulls his Cobra sling out into a ready 
  position. 

Hulk nods. "Just confirming that we are all comfortable about it. Nul 
  sheen." 

Red takes out his Colt Cobra TZ-118 from the folds of his clothing. 

Damien takes out his Franchi SPAS-22 from the folds of his clothing. 

Red works the action on his weapon, running a function check on it. 

The man nods.. glancing at the building.. "Will there be anything else 
  gentlemen? And please.. try not to destroy the place.. that would 
  definitly screw up my plans.." 

Damien pulls the large combat shotgun from under his jacket and exhales 
  slowly. Checking the clip for ammo and tossing the strap over his 
  shoulder "lets do this" he says in a serious tone. 

Red glances at the man blankly, "No, nothing else, Mr. Johnson." 

Hulk smiles slightly. "We'll do our best. I think we are set." He checks 
  with the other two and heads for the warehouse. 

The man nods.. and gets back into his vehicle.. 

Red follos Hulk, cradling his weapon. 

Damien walks towards the warehouse, eyes focused intently on the front 
  door. Shoulders tensing up a bit as he gets closer. 

The window opens a slight bit.. "Good luck.. and fair well gentlemen" 
  and then the vehicle pulls off..

Obvious exits: 

Out &lt;O&gt; 

Red has arrived. 

Damien has arrived. 

The building stands infront of you.. the main doors are boarded up and 
  all the windows on the main floor are also boarded up. 

Hulk studies the entrance. "We gonna see if there's an entrance _not_ 
  boarded up?" 

Its a fairly windy night.. the wind kicks up alot of dust and 
  everything.. some of it gets into your eyes.. the street lights 
  providing some sight.. 

Damien looks at the door and shakes his head from side to side "I don't 
  like the front door" his gaze drifting to the windows "I like the 
  windows, usually less supprises" 

Red looks from the door to Hulk, "Let's just make out own entrance eher, 
  we may want to be able to get out of there quickly." 

Hulk points to the window at one corner. "Start at a corner and work 
  round. Fewer surprises from behind, then." 

Ramsey has arrived. 

Damien nods his head "yeah, what I wouldn't give for a rigger right now" 
  he mutters softly, looking around the building. 

Hulk nods. "Or a mage." He walks swiftly over to the corner of the 
  building and checks the fastenings on the boards visually. 

Red glances at Damien quizically, but moves cautiously towards the 
  corner of the building. 

Off on the street.. one of the lights flickers out... reducing your 
  visibility even more.. The wind picks up even more.. starting to push 
  you around a little.. once your around the side of the building though 
  it provides cover.. 

Hulk mutters to himself, "... not be... elemental. Drek." 

You mutter to yourself, "Fraggin' weather. Better not be a fraggin' 
  elemental. Drek." 

Red keeps a watch on the side of the building, which the haven't 
  explored yet, His weapon is ready, but not pointed at anything in 
  particular. 

Hulk finds a board that looks loose, and gives an experimental tug. 
  "Cover me whilst I do this..." He pulls on the board slowly, but 
  exerting firm pressure, attempting to lever it off its nails. 

The board rips out.. the nails fairly old and rusty.. it flys out of 
  Hulks hands as a bit of wind comes along the side of the building and 
  lands on the ground with a thud thats way to loud for your liking.. 

Damien looks around as hulk pulls on the board, sliding his predator II 
  from his holster. 
Damien takes out his Ares Predator II from the folds of his clothing. 

Hulk peers in through the gap. 
Hulk mumbles something and pulls the mini-maglite out. Holding the 
  flashlight in his left hand, and his Ingram in his right, he points 
  the beam into the room. 

Red twitches as the board hits, swinging his weapon to bear on it. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "the bottom of the window is just even with your 
  head Hulk.." 

Hulk lifts the torch to shine a beam through the gap in the boards. He 
  looks in, then shakes his head. "Looks empty...who's first?" 

Red looks up, "I'll go." 

Hulk puts the torch on his harness, and rips enough boards away to make 
  a man-sized gap. 

Damien steps forwards "I have thermos" 

Hulk nods to Damien. "Gotta agree with ya. OK, you first, then me, then 
  Red - I can pull him up easier than he could pull me..." 
Hulk makes a cradle of his hands to boost Damien up with. 

Damien walks up looks over at the two, pulling slightly on the wall and 
  yanking himself in with ease. 

Hulk indicates to Red to boost him up. 

Red nods, he lets his weapon hang loose from it's rig and clasps his 
  hands kneels, offering his leg as a step. 

Damien looks aroudn the room and takes a few step forwards, whispering 
  back at the window "looks clean" 

Hulk steps up onto Red's leg and grabs the windowframe, pulling himself 
  inside. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "okie.. hold on" 

As Hulk gets into room and steps on the floor.. there is a giant 
  crack... &lt;OOC: hold on&gt; 

There is the sound of stuff crashing from inside the room.. boxes 
  clattering.. and smashing and what not.. Red is looking in.. and sees 
  Hulk and Damien suddenly disappear.. 
There is a muffled yell and curse. 

a loud crumbling his heard as Damien screams "frag" 

Red grabs the windowsill and pulls himself up, scanning the room. 

Damien exhales deeply and looks around "Gabriel, careful there is a 
  fraggin whole" he dusts himself off looking around. 

There is a series of muffled cough-like noises. 

Red speaks in a quiet voice, "How far down?" 

A light flickers on inside and some of the dust settles... 

Red is leaning over the window sill, his feet not touching the ground 
  outside. 

Hulk looks round. "Frag, there goes the 'don't destroy the building' 
  bonus..." 

Damien chuckles "better us that mr. j, no?" 

Red pulls himself up so he is crouching on the sill, he lowers his legs 
  and lets himself drop through the hole in the floor. 

Damien looks at Hulk and shakes his head "so much for being quiet" 

Hulk looks up in alarm, then studies the floor. "Hope there ain't a 
  basement..." 

Red stirs up a little more dust as he lands nicely.. 

Damien looks around the room, inspecting the floor and walls as closely 
  as he can without moving from his position. 

Hulk continues, "or a sub-basement..." 

Red remains in the crouched positions he landed in and looks around at 
  his surroundings. 

Damien says "or just another hole to fall in" 

Hulk flashes the light on the door. "Shall we?" 

Damien nods his head, looking at the door with a curious look "hope this 
  place isn't full of supprises like this one" 

Red eases himself up in a smooth motion and smiles, "Certainly." 

Your standing in a small room.. it looks like it was probably used for 
  storage or something.. there is a single door out of here. 

Damien walks towards the door, holding the handle and looking back at 
  the group for a second, then opening it cautiously. 

Red raises his weapon again, holding it in a relaxed ready position. 

Hulk points the maglite through the doorway and into the darkness 
  beyond. 

The door opens with a loud CREAK from the hinges.. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "for my info: where is everyone standing in 
  relation to this door (it opens inwards)" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien is at the door 
&lt;OOC&gt; Red says, "I'm still standing where I landed, facing the door." 

As the door opens about 1/3... suddenly its shoved open.. (Everyone 
  +jroll Reaction please) 

You roll 11 dice: 1 1 1 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 10 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "gimmie a sec" 

You roll 9 dice: 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 9 10 
You roll 11 dice: 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 5 5 7 14 

Suddenly a humanoid form comes running through the door straight for 
  Hulk... his gun already prepared.. he pulls the muzzle up a little and 
  presses on the trigger.. sending a burst into the chest of whatever it 
  is... it keeps on running at him tho... trying to smash him with its 
  fist.. Hulk grabs the arm and throws the creature into a wall.. it 
  goes flying into the wall with a resounding *THUD* stays there for a 
  few seconds.. then falls on its back... laying there unconcious. 

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane. 

Hulk stands, gun hanging by its strap, as he pants, looking at the 
  creature. "Frag!" 

Red's weapon is pointed at the body on the floor, he looks at it trying 
  to see what it is, "Is that thing a ghoul?" His voice is hushed and he 
  seems more than a bit spooked, in overdrive. 

Hulk steps quickly over to the unconscious creature and raises his foot, 
  then brings it crashing down on the back of its neck. There is a 
  *crack*, and the heads lolls sideways. 

The body dosen't look like a ghoul.. the decay is alot more... and you 
  notice its missing its left eye.. as soon as Hulk snaps the neck.. the 
  body starts to wither a little bit more.. looking very old suddenly. 

Hulk looks at Damien. "Watch the door a sec, amigo..." 
Hulk hunkers down by the creature, without touching it. He studies it 
  carefully... 

Damien looks at Hulk and arches an eyebrow, looking impressed but 
  turning his gaze back to the door staring intently. 

Hulk straightens. "My guess is zombie. Keep a good eye out, there could 
  be fraggin' voodoun around here..." 

Red shakes his head and mutters something under his breath, he turns his 
  weapon back towards the doorway. 

As Hulk is hunkered down over it.. the body suddenly puffs out a large 
  amount of dust.. covering Hulk... 

Damien nods his head, looking at the dust on Hulk "now I really wish we 
  had some mojo" exhaling softly and waiting for people to continue. 

Hulk stumbles backwards away from the corpse, wiping crap off his face 
  with an alarmed expression. 

Damien looks at Hulk, a concerned look on his face "we need to get you 
  washed off" he kicks on the thermos and cautiosly looks out the door. 

Hulk mutters to himself. 

You mutter to yourself, "Where the frag is Roger when I need him?" 

Red jerks his weapon back towards the motions Hulk is making, his eyes 
  are wide. 

Hulk says "I'll manage until we can get out. I know a houngan - I'll get 
  him to check me over, tell me what the frag that was..." 

Damien takes a step back into the room and nods, kicking the lowlights 
  back on "all seems clean" he slowly advances out. 

Hulk scowls and nods towards the door. "Shall we?" 
Hulk follows Damien, looking pissed. 

Red straightens up again, he nods and follws behind Hulk. Weapon raised 
  and very ready. 

Damien dances his fingers across the handle of his pistol, eyes darting 
  around cautiously. 

Outside the door is a long hallway.. the area is full of dust and 
  cobwebs.. tho there are tracks in the floor.. lots of them.. there are 
  doors up and down the hallway.. no stairway that you can see. 

Hulk holds a finger to his lips. 
Hulk points to the nearest door, then to Damien, miming a pulling 
  motion. He indicates Red and himself and points with his gun. 

Red folds out the stock on his weapon in a smooth motion and braces it 
  against his shoulder, aiming it at the doorway. 

Damien swallows for a brief second and pushes the door open, taking a 
  quick step back, pistol redied. 

Hulk is ducked down, and maintains his aim...but on the door across the 
  hallway. 

Teh door opens to a empty office.. there is a desk... cobwebs all 
  over... the room looks fairly empty.. 

Damien looks down at the rest of the team "seems clean" 

Hulk whispers. "Check behind the desk..." 

Damien nods his head and slowly progresses into the room. 

Hulk duck-walks after him, keeping him covered. He points Red to keep 
  the other doors covered. 

You hear an echo'ing sound far off.. sounds like its upstairs... a 
  shuffling foot sound... its directly overhead... 

Red duck-walks closer to the doorway. 

Damien walks in and looks around, taking a few steps to the sidewall and 
  circling around, eyes focused behind the desk, switch constanty from 
  lowlight to thermos 

Hulk glances up at the ceiling. 

Red nods to Hulk and backs up against the wall, facing the hallway. 

You hear some more shufflin upstairs. It seems to be moving away from 
  you. 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "rooms clean?" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "seems to be..." 

As the room is confirmed clear, Hulk walks back into the hallway and 
  prepares to repeat the procedure across the hall. 

Damien walks out of the room advances towards the next nearest door. 

There is a creaking sound from outside in the hallway... 

Red reaches out and taps Hulks leg as he walks out and points his 
  weapons down the hallway. 

Hulk jerks his head round in a blur, half-crouching. 

After a split-second, he sidles to the other side of the hallway and 
  motions Damien out. 

Damien jumps over the desk and hurries out the door, eyes focused 
  intently down the hall thermos kicking on 

There is an eerie quiet in the hallway.. nothing moves.. you can hear 
  the sound of the wind outside far off.. but even the shuffling above 
  you has stopped.. 

Hulk grimaces, then motions Red forwards with his shotgun, followed by 
  Damien and Hulk side-by-side, the flashlight held steady on the 
  doorway. 

The door way is about 2 doors down.. 

Red frowns and twitches a bit nervously, he stands and starts to walk 
  slowly along the wall. 

You get about two steps.. when you see motion.. as something steps out 
  of the room.. 

Hulk taps Damien on the arm and points to his eyes, and then the 
  intervening doors. 
Hulk stops gesticulating as... 

You watch.. as a giant troll comes walking out of the room.. Hes 
  carrying a very large meat cleaver in his left hand... his face looks 
  damaged.. like someone kicked it.. his jaw way out of aligntment.. 
  there is a small hole in his chest.. 

Damien stares intently forwards, taking a few steps ahead of the team to 
  get a better look. Switching from thermos to lowlight every few 
  seconds. 

There is a quiet gulp. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "everyone +init" 

Damien takes a step back, pistol held out for a second. shaking his head 
  he advances fowards. 

You roll for initiative: 3d6 + 11 - 0 - 0 = 27 

Hulk's gun comes up once again in a blur, and his finger squeezes the 
  trigger. A long tongue of orange flame blossoms from the barrel as the 
  submachine gun barks out a short burst, quickly followed by another. 

You roll 9 dice: 1 2 3 3 3 4 5 8 9

You show your Ingram Smartgun to shane. 

The monster growls as the rounds impact it... the first chunk hits him 
  in the gut... setting him off balance a little.. as he starts walking 
  again.. the 2nd burst hitting him in the stomach... he growls.. and 
  keeps on walking towards the group of men.. 

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane. 

Damien shoots forwards with lightening speeds, the pistol at his side 
  rising with the motions of a trained killer. His eyes focusing in the 
  target as the other hand rises to brace for the shot, Two rounds 
  spitting from the large firearm and teh tremendous booms echoing 

The two rounds impact in the monsters face.. one of them blowing away 
  half of his head.. sending fragments everywhere.. hte other one 
  hitting it in the shoulder.. it grunts.. stopping for a moment.. then 
  keeps on walking forwards. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "fire twice into me" 

Hulk blinks, then squeezes the trigger of his Ingram again, once more 
  causing the hallway to be filled with the stammering sound of 
  automatic fire. As the sound dies, there is a quiet little tinkle of 
  brass shell casings skittering across the floor. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Its ok.. :) +jroll and fire into me" 

You roll 9 dice: 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 7

Damien fires his Ares Predator II at Shane. 

The first burst mostly misses the Zombie.. hitting his empty hand... 
  putting a large hole in it.. The 2nd hits it a little more squarly in 
  the knee.. he falls over forwards... landing on his front... 

Damien fires his Ares Predator II at Shane. 
Damien shoots forwards with lightening speeds, the pistol at his side 
  rising with the motions of a trained killer. His eyes focusing in the

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "I am having serious packet loss problems" 

Damien fires his Ares Predator II at Shane. 

The two rounds hit into the creature... it grunts a little.. laying 
  there.. but dosen't move anymore.. 

Damien steps back from the initial shot, squeezing the trigger again. 
  his eyes darting at the thing at thing moving towards him. 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "actually Damien.. its on the ground ;)" 
&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Hold:" 

&lt;OOC&gt; Damien says, "Ok I missed it hitting the ground, my bad :)" 

&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Shane says, "Hulk and Damien.. you hear the sound of Red being 
  attacked behind you" 

Damien spins around, pistol still held out. 

Red gets grabbed from behind.. and gets thrown backwards.. landing on 
  his back.. his head gets slammed into a wall.. 

Another Zombie attacks Hulk from behind... 

You roll 7 dice: 1 1 1 3 3 5 5 

Eric has arrived. 

You roll 5 dice: 1 1 4 4 5 

Hulk feels something behind him and reacts with his accustomed speed, 
  ramming his left elbow back as hard as he can. He takes a step forward 
  and smoothly swivels on his left foot, bringing his right boot round 
  to smash into the zombie's jaw as he sees it for the first time. 

The Zombie moves back a little.. looking lightly stunned. 
The monster grunts.. being pushed back against the wall... a small hole 
  in his chest.. He growls at Red.. 

Another Zombie comes stumbling out of the room the Troll came out of... 
  walking down the hallway.. he makes it up to where the Troll is.. and 
  starts to shuffle around his body.. 

Red fires a three round burst from his Colt Cobra TZ-118 at Shane. 

Another Zombie comes out of the door way where you originally came out 
  of... moaning (in a bad way..) as he launches himself at Hulk.. 

You roll 7 dice: 2 2 2 2 8 10 13 

Red looks at the zombie he just shot, his eyes widening. 

Hulk whirls smoothly into another martial arts form, letting his SMG 
  hang by its strap as he clasps both hands together and brings them up 
  to smash into the side of the zombie's head with a dull *thud*. 

The Zombie goes flying through the riin across.. goes flying into the 
  room.. landing with a thud as he hits the desk.. 

There are currently 5 Zombies you can see. One laying on the ground 
  looking dead. Another one is standing over that one.. another is in 
  the 2nd room.. one is standing in the doorway to the room you 
  originally came through.. looking at Red.. and another one is umm 
  laying on the ground next to Hulk.. 

You roll 9 dice: 1 1 4 5 8 9 10 10 11 

Hulk continues his spin, gracefully grabbing his SMG again and letting a 
  short burst off straight at the head of the zombie behind him.

  burst... the head goes flying.. landing somewhere.. the headless body 
  landing with a loud *THUD* 

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane.

  shoulder... 

You roll 6 dice: 2 2 2 3 4 4 
You roll 6 dice: 1 1 2 2 7 11

The blade hits Hulk.. glancing off him for the most part.. and ending up 
  imbedded in the wall next to him. 

Another Zombie comes out of the room at the the Troll came out of... he 
  moves fairly quick (comapared to his buds) but stumbles over the two 
  dead zombies.. falling on his face.. but in hte process getting past 
  his 'friends' 

Hulk ducks, but too late. The rusty blade of the cleaver slices through 
  the armor of his jacket and lays open Hulk's arm, which begins to 
  trickle blood down his sleeve. 

Damien fires his Ares Predator II at Shane. 
Damien jerks his body, towards red, the smartgun link imediatly pulling 
  the pistol away from red and towards the target. His eyes narrowing 
  for a brief second as he taps the trigger, two rounds sounding out and 
  streaking through the night air. 

Both bullets shoot true into the Zombies head.. exploding it... the 
  zombie falls to the side... unmoving

Hulk moves into the cleaver-armed zombie as it tugs vainly at the 
  weapon, trying to free it from the wall. He places the barrel of his 
  Ingram under its chin and pulls the trigger, then swivels the gun back 
  down to fire a burst into the head of the zombie on the floor next to 
  him.

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane. 

The first zombie groans as the burst hits him in the gut.. he goes 
  flying back against the wall behind him... landing on the 2nd 
  zombie... and stops moving.. the 2nd zombie growls and looks into 
  Hulks eyes.. as his head explodes from Hulks burst.. 

Hulk steps a pace forward to peer into the other office, then raises his 
  gun and fires a three-round burst at something within the room.

Hulk curses imaginatively. 

You fire a three round burst from your Ingram Smartgun at Shane. 

Damien spins around with the pistol held up, looking at his buddy in the 
  office and smirking slightly, the finger tapping the trigger twice and 
  liting the room with a yellow strobe. 

There are grunts heard from inside the room as the bullets strike the 
  creature in the back.. It turns around.. grabbing a chair it throws it 
  at Damien... 

The chair flys through the air... smashing Damien in the face... (giving 
  him a bleeding nose in the process). It might be old.. but it dosen't 
  shatter when it smashes into his face.. rolling and landing back in 
  the room.. 

Red lowers the barrel of his weapon and squeezes the trigger, firing a 
  burst at the head of the zombie on the ground. His mouth tightens into 
  a straight line and sweat drips off his face. 

The monster grunts as it takes most of the burst into its head.... a 
  large chunk flying off.. it rolls towards Red.. landing at his feet.. 
  as the monster starts to crawl towards Red... just getting close 
  enough to grab ahold of Reds foot.. 
The Zombie inside the room.. rushes at Damien.. trying to bite at him... 
The monster throws itself on Damien... slamming him to the ground.. it 
  hits him once in the gut with its hand... and its thick skull slams 
  into his nose...

Hulk goes to one knee and raises his SMG, aiming very carefully at the 
  head of the zombie lying on Damien. He pulls the trigger, but the gun 
  only spits two bullets. 
Hulk curses again, and grabs a fresh clip from his belt, smoothly 
  replacing the old one with a practised motion. 

Damien falls back against the wall, his face looking more than a little 
  annoyed as he looks at the ammo counter on the back of his pistol "how 
  many of these fuckers are there" sliding the pistol into it's holster 
  and drawing large military showtgun, his hand slipping away to clear 
  some blood from his eyes. 

You go full out with your Ingram Smartgun at shane, firing 2 rounds! 
You reload your Ingram Smartgun. 

The other Zombie dies.. blah blah blah.. splatters parts on Damien.. 
  some magots and stuff land on him... 

Red fires a three round burst from his Colt Cobra TZ-118 at Shane.
