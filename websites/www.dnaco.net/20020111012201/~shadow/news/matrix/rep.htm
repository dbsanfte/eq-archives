      <p> Deckmeister A comes up to me and says, "I'd like to place an order from 
        Decker Bob. A MPCP 6." 
      <p>Me: "Bob? Kewl guy, seen him around a lot. Okay, it'll be two weeks before 
        you get that gear." 
      <p>Deckmeister A comes up to me an hour later. "Got another order for you, 
        Another MPCP 6 from Decker Charlie." 
      <p>Me: "Charlie? Hrm, who's...oh, I know him. Been in the trix once or twice. 
        Okay. It will be four weeks before you get that." 
      <p>Could the availability times of MPCPs have changed from two weeks to 
        four weeks in the matter of one hour? Nope. Still the same old piece from 
        the same old people. So why does it take two weeks longer for Charlie 
        to get his? Simple: Charlie was not well known. Charlie spent more time 
        out of the trix then inside of it. He doesn't go out and explore the matrix 
        systems, figuring out the insides and outs of each. And he rarely triggers, 
        not from skill, but from lack of time.
      <p>Bob on the other hand spends at least some time in the trix every time 
        he logs on, whether it is simply cruising the shadowlands or actually 
        exploring. He makes himself known, in the matrix ways, and is someone 
        who triggers, not from lack of skill, but excess time in there (it happens). 
      <p>Is it wrong of me to favor people who have been in the trix more then 
        others? No. Why? The deckers who are well known and actually WORK for 
        a living will receive bonuses. Deckmeisters will be able to grease palms, 
        "Hey, the guy who wants this btw...he's Bob." "Oh? I'll see what I can 
        do to help you out." 
      <p>So how does a newbie decker get up there? Get into the trix. Word gets 
        around, whether you see it or not. Rumors can do wonders amongst the deckers. 
        POST IN SHADOWLAND AND MAGLAND. Plus, if you aren't IN the trix, sometimes 
        those SHADOWLAND posts that talk about jobs might interest you. Yes, there 
        are jobs there, and elsewhere. And no deckmeister will go hunting someone 
        he/she has never heard of. 
      <p>Rep and experience carry a lot of weight out there in Matrix land, and 
        don't think I forget it. Those of you who haven't been in the trix much 
        or are not posting in the Lands are down, believe it or not, in my ratings 
        (although I still love ya all :b). There is absolutely no reason you can 
        not explore. 
      <p>So get out there and hack, cuz it may come back to haunt you. 
      <p>Another factor that will tell your rep will be through the census rating. 
        Your census rating MAY effect how much a given job will pay. If your rating 
        is higher then others your pay should/may be more depending on the situation.
