NEWS ADMIN APPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a position in the administrative staff is open on Shadowrun MUSH, we
will post job openings on the General bboard with instructions on how
to apply, and who to apply to.
 
As a general guideline, in addition to other qualifications, potential 
staffers must have a minimum of three months' experience as a player on
Shadowrun MUSH.
 
If there is no opening posted, and you still want to help, you'll want to
contact the appropriate director (in 'news admin directors') and inquire 
if they need any help.
 
Also, something to note, that MIGHT discourage some of you:  
 
ROLEPLAYING STAFF CANNOT PLAY PLAYER CHARACTERS!
 
It is advisable to speak with the Directors personally before applying.

&admin directors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS ADMIN DIRECTORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is some additional info on our Directors...
   
MORRIS:     Bosscat and Site Dude since 9/94.  Shadowrun MUSH hardcode

MATT:       Director, Roleplaying.  Admin since 12/94, originally
            a member of PHStaff but has bounced about, doing the PHA/Judge

JASON:      Director, Player Help. Admin since ca. 3/94. Softcoder and 
            question answerer, scholar, gentleman, and really huge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
&admin chiefs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS ADMIN CHIEFS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is some additional info on our Chiefs...
  
LYAM:       Plots Chief, Roleplaying. The guy to talk to about Shadowruns,
            sorting out teams and getting jobs from Mr J. Known to be a 
            storytelling freak and to dislike excessive dice-rolling. 
            Sarcastic English bastard, grammar freak. Loves good RPers,
            milk and cookies and Cricket. Hates twinks, Sunny Delight
            and Beavis and Butthead. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&admin structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS ADMIN STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
At the very top of the administrative structure here is Morris (aka 
"Bosscat"). He is the gentleman responsible for the site 
(http://www.dnaco.net for more information on this company). As the 
Head Wizard, Morris is Where The Buck Stops.
 
Underneath Morris, there are three major administrative departments on 
the MUSH: Building/Coding, Player Help, and Roleplaying.  Each has one 
Director, and the Roleplaying staff further divides its leadership 
amongst three Chiefs.  There are also a large number of admins who form
the majority of the volunteer staff which makes Shadowrun MUSH the great 
place that it is.
 
BUILDING/CODING staff is headed up by Dan. It is the 
department responsible for everything which is created on the MUSH 
code-wise, in addition to being the group that all Builders deal with
regularly.  This department is what created the very ground you are 
walking on. Virtually, at least.
 
Continued in NEWS ADMIN STRUCTURE2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&admin structure2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYER HELP is the "public relations" group of the MUSH and so much 
more.  Responsible for everything from screening backgrounds and 
assisting newbies to maintaining communications paths throughout the 
staff and fielding complaints and questions, without this department 
the MUSH would collapse under its own weight.  At its head is Jason, 
with Scott backing him up.
 
ROLEPLAYING is the department responsible for all aspects of the MUSH 
which revolve around the Shadowrun universe and roleplaying issues within
it. Because the world is so diverse and complex, this department is 
broken down into several divisions.

&building astral
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING ASTRAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When creating auras for Rooms and Objects there are a few simple things
to remember:
  1) Astral space is made of moods, emotions, textures and tones. It is
     perfectly alright to include feelings in your astral descriptions.
     For example:
        A person on the astral plane looking at a letter or sign would see
        the emotional content of the item, not the actual words.
  2) Manmade objects show up on the astral plane. They are generally shadows
     of the real thing, with magical influences showing up.
  3) Background count is important. A Room can have a general emotional feel
     to it based on past events that have influenced the etheric space.
     However, permanent background count is very rare.  Please consult a
     magic admin prior to placing a permanent background count on a room.
 
Well thought out astral descriptions will add to overall quality of the MUSH,
and you never know when you'll want to play a magician.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&building costs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING COSTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Having a building built for you by a construction company on the MUSH
(there are two, find them) costs the following amount in IC funds: 
 
LOW LIFESTYLE AREAS:
 
 Simple, one-story structure is 50,000 =Y=
         Rooms for buildings are approximately 20x20x12' and are 1,500 =Y=
         each
         Additional stories are 10,000 =Y= per floor.
 
 If a building already exists, adding to it has a 10,000 =Y= charge, plus
room costs, etc. 
 
 RENTAL
 Rental costs are ten percent of the building's total cost PLUS any IC
security a player wishes. 
 
 EXAMPLE:
Joe wants to build a two-story house with four rooms.
 50,000 for the building
 10,000 for the second story
  6,000 for the four rooms
 
 Total is 66,000 PLUS any security costs. Rent for this building would be
6,600 nuyen per month plus any security. 
 
 This is for LOW LIFESTYLE CONSTRUCTION. The following are price increases
for other lifestyle areas. 
         MIDDLE - LOW cost + 40 percent
         HIGH - LOW cost + 80 percent
         LUXURY - LOW + 160 percent.
 
 Please remember that the staff of the MUSH will work with you on prices,
and financing is available.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&building exits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING EXITS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All Exits MUST HAVE:
                    @Desc, @Succ, @Osucc, @Odrop, &AURA.
 
If an exit is lockable no matter what the reason, it must also have:
                    @Fail, @Ofail, and &Lock-Rating.
 
If an exit is to blocked against Astral Movement, it MUST have:
                    &Barrier.
 
Hidden Exits must be justified, and clues should exist in the room for 
PCs to find the exit.
 
Lock rating is the rating of the maglock or other system.  Please put a
note in the &SECURITY of the rooms on either side of it, or in an
attribute called &NOTES on the exit, details on the lock or system. 
 
No One-Way Exits. Exits should not be aliased to the letters H or L (which
are used for help and look). Exits that lead a person out of the building,
should all be aliased to out;ou;o.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&building inspections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING INSPECTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ask for an inspection of a building, @mail Inspection. As the subject
of the mail, list the name of the exit leading into the building as it
appears in your nexus. In the body of the text, give a short explanation
of what the building is, what its purpose in the game will be, and list
any special information about the place. Be sure to list any dark exits,
and YOU MUST mention who assigned or approved the project. Also, be sure
to list the specific IC location you wish for the building by Dbref# (if
you have a place in mind) or let us know that you have no preference. 
 
A Building Staff member will then inspect the building, to be sure it has
all the required attribues, and that your spelling and grammar are okay.
If there are no problems, it will be linked, and you will be notified. If
there are problems, you will get a @mail, detailing what alterations need
to be made to bring the building up to standard for linking. 
 
Buildings will be chowned to City_Builder after being linked.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&building master rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING MASTER ROOMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the attributes in 'news building rooms' can be a pain in the butt
to set for every room you own in a building.  Luckily, TinyMUSH has an
easy way around this. 
 
Rooms can be @parented to other objects/rooms.  The room will share every
attribute of the parent object, so it is possible to create a single
object with default attributes on it, so you don't have to enter all of
the required attributes in every room.  Just create an object, put the
attributes like &Security_rating, &Where_zone, etc. on it, and @parent the
rooms in your building to it. 
 
Two attributes--&AURA and &SECURITY--must be added to every room (same
with @descs, but you know that already).  One way of coding security
easily is to set the &SECURITY on every room to, "type securitylist". 
Then, on your parent/master room, you can code something along the lines
of a menu system: &securitylist master=$securitylist:@pemit %#=this is a
list of all the rooms and the security in them and stuff about the NPC
security guards. 
 
For more detailed information, contact a Building Staffer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&building policy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING POLICY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All building is to be done by special Builder characters. Player
Characters may not own ANYTHING. All Builders must append their name with
the letters BLDR. 
 
Builders may NOT build residences for their PCs, or other PCs without
direct permission from the Head Building Wizard. Builders may not make
personalized items, nor may they create restricted items, such as guns,
armor, credsticks, vehicles, etc. 
 
Construction is by assignment ONLY. If you have a good idea, contact a
member of the Building Staff, to see if the idea is workable. 
 
All building will be done off of the Building Nexus. No JUMP_OK or
Floating rooms are allowed. PERIOD. 
 
Before becoming linked, all locations will be inspected by a member of the
Building Staff. If the building meets standards, it will be linked. If not
the Builder will be given a list of corrections that need to be made in
order to have the building linked. Linked buildings may not be altered
without permission of the Building Staff.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&building rooms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS BUILDING ROOMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All rooms MUST have:
                     @Desc
                     &Aura
                     &Security
                     &Security_Rating
                     &Where_Place
                     &Where_Zone
 
Descs should be clear, concise (less than one full 24x80 screen including
all exit info) and fall within the ShadowRun genre.  Use a dictionary, and
watch your grammar, please. 
 
Auras should be clear, concise, and give an accurate idea of the emotional
content of the room. Remember Aura IS the ONLY Desc an astral person sees,
so make the main features of the room clear for them as well. 
 
Security is a listing for the Judges that explains in relative detail the 
security and other features of the room.  Considering that Shadowrun is a 
violent world, this attribute is useful in the event combat or other 
nastiness occurs in your room.  Statistics should be cleared with the 
appropriate RPAdmin.  Remember, the more detailed you are, the better the 
chance of the Judge handling the call as you believe your building's 
personnel would.
 
Security_Rating pertains to the Lone Star response time and Docwagon time 
of the room.  General levels of security (rated from AA to Z) can be 
denoted within buildings by using the "Z" as a preface for this 
THREE-LETTER attribute.  I.E., a high-security building would be ZAA.
 
Where_place and Where_zone delineate for the admins at a glance where 
exactly you are.  Where_place should be the name of the building you are 
in (i.e., one Bedroom looks much like any other on the +who.  If you are 
building, say, a bedroom in Joe Blow's office, the where_place attribute 
should read, Joe Blow's Office). Where_Zone should delineate where you 
are in Seattle--i.e., Downtown, Elven District, Barrens, etc. 
 
No rooms may be set JUMP_OK, under any circumstances.

NEWS CORP EXTRATERRITORIALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Keep in mind that the Law in Seattle depends on where exactly you are.
After the Shiawase Decision, major megacorporations and any PUBLIC 
subsidiaries they own--that is, sub-companies that are publically owned
and operated by a megacorporation--enjoy the benefits of 
extraterritoriality and are governed by the laws of the CORPORATION, not
UCAS law or Seattle law.
 
  Lone Star and DocWagon will NOT respond to calls made in these areas,
UNLESS the controlling organization gives them special permissions to.  
A list of corporations which are extraterritorial includes the "Big 8" 
AAA megacorps: (Aztechnology, Ares, Shiawase, Saeder-Krupp, Yamatetsu, 
Fuchi, MCT, and Renraku); Zeiss Corporation; Lytton-Burke Industrial
Technologies; Lone Star Security Services (a special case); and, of 
course, Council Island and other diplomatic venues are considered 
extraterritorial and are bound by their nations' laws.
 
  Areas which are NOT extraterritorial include: Network23, Silhouettes, 
DocWagon, and just about any other corporation or building which is NOT 
specifically and publically known to be owned by a major megacorporation 
which is extraterritorial.  See Corporate Shadowfiles for more details.

NEWS MATRIX HISTORY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Matrix History
 
        In the year 2018, Dr. Hosato Hikata of ESP Systems, Inc., created the
first ASIST interface. ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction System) technology
allowed electronic devices to stimulate the areas of the brain which
controlled the senses. The entertainment industry went wild with the new
"simsense" technology, but other researchers saw it as a key to the
containment of the information explosion.
        In 2026, the first cyberspace travelers were taking halting steps
into what we now call the Matrix. The first cyberterminal was a room-sized
isolation chamber with multi-contact point jacks and multiple hook-ups for
the operator. These were designed for military intelligence applications. The
first volunteers went mad.

        In 2027, a great refinement in cyberterminals was made. As computer
systems became increasingly complex during the late twentieth century, many
programs replaced lengthy strings of commands with simple pictures, or icons,
that symbolized specific commands or programs. The user picked the icon
wanted, and the computer would do whatever the picture meant. By the late
1990s, a typical user was dealing with so many thousands of icons that
data-processing systems were breaking down under their own complexity.
        By 2029, Sony Cybersystems, Fuchi Industrial Electronics, and
RCA-Unisys had all developed prototype cyberterminals that allowed the user
to interface with the world data network via his or her nervous system, which
translated the data and issued the commands. Instead of typing in commands or
clicking a mouse at an icon, operations were carried out literally at the
speed of thought. These early cyberterminals were massive, requiring that the
user be in a sensory deprivation tank. Largely funded by various intelligence
agencies, the goal of the research was to allow agents to raid data systems,
creating strike teams of "super hackers."

        In the United States, the CIA, NSA, and IRS pooled their resources to
exploit this development. Under the code name of "Echo Mirage", they
recruited and trained a team of "cyber-commandos." Fighting bulky equipment
and psychoses induced by the overwhelming sensory signals generated by the
primitive cyberterminals, Echo Mirage was advancing toward a workable
technology when international disaster struck.
        On February 8, 2029, computer systems across the world were attacked
apparently at random, by a virus program of unprecedented power. Systems
crashed, their data was wiped clean and even their hardware was burned out by
the effects of the virus. As the killer program spread, governments toppled
and the world economy neared collapse.
        During the first quarter of the year, the virus shattered the Grid,
the data network that held the world together. By presidential order, Echo
Mirage was activated to counteract the virus, but the "straight-arrow" agents
of Echo Mirage were overwhelmed by the psychological demands of
psycho-physiological combat in cyberspace.

        Echo Mirage's masters responded by recruiting the most brilliant, if
erratic, data-processing mavericks from the industry and the universities.
Their choices were drafted under a presidential emergency order and rammed
through a brutal training program. A cadre of 32 men and women graduated with
their sanity intact.
        It was not until August 2029, however, that the new cadre, armed with
improved cybertechnology, could mount a coordinated attack on the killer
program.
        Eighteen minutes after engaging the virus, four members of Echo
Mirage were dead. When the data logs were analyzed, two things became
apparent. First, the virus program could induce lethal biofeedback in humans
accessing the Matrix. Second, no existing computer security could even slow
down someone using a cyberterminal.
        The corporations involved in the effort were horrified at the ease
with which Echo mirage penetrated their most secure data systems. In
reaction, secret corporate research was begun to develop new security
software that could repel intruders using a Matrix interface. This included
research to duplicate the lethal effects generated by the virus. The
resulting software was the first generation of intrusion countermeasures, or
IC, now known worldwide as "ice."

        Echo Mirage learned techniques to isolate and contain the virus.
Equipped with new combat programs and beefed up cyberterminals, they began
the lengthy task of purging the Grid of infection. By late 2031, they had
wiped out the last known concentration of virus code.
        These second-generation terminals used desk-sized hardware and needed
no sensory deprivation tank. Shortly after the final purge of the virus, four
of the surviving seven members of Echo Mirage decamped into the private
sector, taking with the secrets of the new technology.
        In May 2034, Matrix Systems of Boston came out with the first
"gray-market" cyberterminal. Six weeks later, Matrix Systems' main computer
crashed and its two founders died in apparently unrelated accident.
        From the perspective of the military-industrial complex, the damage
had already been done. Matrix technology was loose. Fuchi Industrial was the
first major corporation to break ranks against the invasion of the deckers
when, in 2036, it marketed its own third-generation cyberdeck, the desktop
CDT-100.

        The majority of cyberdecks sold today are licensed machines that
inject a unique signature into the logs of any systems they access, thus
recording all legitimate activity in the Matrix. For years, however, pirate
users, or deckers, have been acquiring decks and modifying them. Deckers
suppress their system's signature and add capabilities that are of little use
to an honest cyberterminal operator. That's the way of the world in the 2050's.

NEWS MATRIX CURRENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Current State of the Matrix
 
        The human mind cannot directly comprehend the flow of data in the
Matrix. If users were restricted to old-tech tools--command lines, file
names, programs in clumsy procedural languages--the system would be
unmanageable. After the Crash of 2029, ASIST technology opened up the
possibilities of actual DNI (Direct Neural Interface) access to computers,
and the Matrix was born. Now, the user takes a microsecond trip through a
computer-generated landscape in order to find a file. If the user is
validated to see a file, he finds it right where he expected. The interface
routines he uses may look like clerical workers, or a huge library, or simply
appear as dazzling patterns of energy. The user sees the file, touches it,
and the data downloads into his cyberterminal.
        Users do not need to remember codes, command sets, or file names. If
they want something, they go get it. If they want to program a process for
the laboratory or an assembly line, they mentally perform the motions
involved or build a model using virtual components, and the computer learns
from them. Modern chemists, for example, build molecules according to
formulae as if they were using children's building blocks. The computer then
translates these actions into a program that will operate the process in the
real world.
        Legitimate users have registered cyberterminals that identify
themselves to the Matrix at every step. But, the cyberdecks of deckers have
no Matrix identifiers. Deckers remain anonymous, and when everything goes
right, they can dance through the secrets of the Matrix, laughing at the
security measures. Of course, when things go wrong, they can die in the
Matrix as well.

                                Icons
 
        Every object that the user sees in the Matrix is an icon. The persona
programs and utilities running on the cyberdeck are master copies of the
software that makes decking possible. When a decker logs on to a grid or
host, the cyberdeck loads versions of those programs onto the Matrix system
using the deck's active memory. In a nutshell, deckers deal with two sets of
programs: the front-end programs on the deck, which convert the decker's
neural impulses into computer command transactions; and the server programs
in the Matrix, called utility programs, which convert those commands into
programming commands that influence what the system does.

        The words grid and Matrix are often used interchangeably, but the
grid is actually the telecommunications net which makes up the web of the
Matrix. There are three types of grids that exist in the Matrix:
 
        RTG  | Regional Telecommunications Grid (owned and maintained by
             |   a monopoly vendor)
             |
        LTG  | Local Telecommunications Grid (analogous to area codes of

in the 2050's do not have to be single computers. In fact, many of them are
linked series of massive parallel processors in smaller configurations. There
are four kinds of hosts in the modern Matrix:
 
        Blue Hosts   | Most public service databases or small companies
                     | too poor to afford powerful security.
                     |
        Green Hosts  | Average level systems that have the capability
                     | for powerful security, but seldom use it.
                     |
        Orange Hosts | Secure systems that hold information important
                     | enough for the system owners to take great precautions
                     | in protecting it.
                     |
        Red Hosts    | Contain top secret level data that is so important that

manipulations by a decker.
 
        Access  | The access rating measures a system's resistance to
                | unauthorized access.
                |

                | unauthorized administrative commands.
                |
        Index   | The index rating measures a system's resistance to

                |
        Files   | Deckers use the files rating when they try to illegally
                | access and manipulate any file on a system.
                |

NEWS MATRIX SKILLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Matrix Attributes and Skills
 
        The mental attributes are the most necessary ones for deckers.
Intelligence is crucial to maintaining a high Hacking Pool. New ICCM
technology allows for deckers to use Willpower instead of Body to resist
attacks by black IC. Quickness should be high enough for a decent Reaction,
but deckers usually rely on their decks for their reaction speed. Deckers
usually spend so much time improving their Willpower and Intelligence that
they have no time to increase their Charisma, but this reflects the
time-honored tradition of anti-social computer nerds.
        The Computer Skill is absolutely essential for deckers. It has a
Software Concentration and a Decking Specialization, but beginning deckers
will suffer if they increase skill in Decking at the expense of programming
ability. 
        The Computer Theory Skill is a must if you want to do any programing.
The maximum rating of the programs that characters can design equals
the rating of their Computer Theory, Software, for software code, Hardware,
for hardware source code. NOTE this is a custom rule on this MUSH. The
ratings of character-designed MPCP and frame cores cannot exceed the
character's computer theory skill multiplied by 1.5.
        Computer B/R is the skill used for building and repairing decks.
        The Matrix Etiquette skill governs searches for equipment, software
sources, local access to Shadowland, and other goods and services. This skill
also keeps the decker current on the latest major players are in cyberspace
and lets him pick up the latest rumors in the global gossip of the Matrix.

Decker Bob. A MPCP 6."
 
     Me: "Bob? Kewl guy, seen him around a lot. Okay, it'll be two weeks
before you get that gear."

     Could the availability times of MPCPs have changed from two weeks to
four weeks in the matter of one hour? Nope. Still the same old piece from
the same old people. So why does it take two weeks longer for Charlie to

of the trix then inside of it. He doesn't go out and explore the matrix
systems, figuring out the insides and outs of each. And he rarely triggers,
not from skill, but from lack of time.

     Bob on the other hand spends at least some time in the trix every time
he logs on, whether it is simply cruising the shadowlands or actually
exploring. He makes himself known, in the matrix ways, and is someone
who triggers, not from lack of skill, but excess time in there (it happens).
 
     Is it wrong of me to favor people who have been in the trix more then
others? No. Why? The deckers who are well known and actually WORK for a
living will receive bonuses. Deckmeisters will be able to grease palms,
"Hey, the guy who wants this btw...he's Bob." "Oh? I'll see what I can do to
help you out."
 
     So how does a newbie decker get up there? Get into the trix. Word gets
around, whether you see it or not. Rumors can do wonders amongst the
deckers. POST IN SHADOWLAND AND MAGLAND. Plus, if you aren't IN the
trix, sometimes those SHADOWLAND posts that talk about jobs might
interest you. Yes, there are jobs there, and elsewhere. And no deckmeister
will go hunting someone he/she has never heard of.

     Rep and experience carry a lot of weight out there in Matrix land, and
don't think I forget it. Those of you who haven't been in the trix much or
are not posting in the Lands are down, believe it or not, in my ratings
(although I still love ya all :b). There is absolutely no reason you can not
explore.
 
      So get out there and hack, cuz it may come back to haunt you.
 
     Another factor that will tell your rep will be through the census 
rating.  Your census rating MAY effect how much a given job will pay. If your
rating is higher then others your pay should/may be more depending on the
situation.

1. To see the help check out +cdhelp for decks, I strongly suggest you read
it all and if possible copy them down. If you own a computer you should
read the +lhelp PC, and make sure you set your computer OOC.
 
2. Next the admin staff would like you all to help us out. We need you to
add yourself into our database. To do this just type +add me decker
 
****Warning **** if you have your deck and computer on and in same
room you must NOT log onto the computer. As this command will setup 2
database entries. And you really make the matrix stuff upset.
 
After you get all your matrix equipment it is VERY smart to type say
num(<object name>) and store all your objects DB#'s on yourself by typing
&var_objects me=<list of DB#'s>.  It comes in handy when something
happens and your objects can't be found,  it makes it so much easier to
track them down.

What are Matrix Terminals? 
	In the late 20th century offices would often use 'Dummy Terminals', 
these were merely computer screens and keyboards that were wired via a 
network to allow people access to files, without the massive expense of a 
full setup.  Matrix Terminals are merely the 2060s version of those, enhanced 
slightly to allow them to handle the complex imagery.  These low powered, 
small optical drive machines (typically 5-10 MP) allow users to access the 
Matrix in a userfriendly fashion, without worrying about all the gimics of 
high tech devices.
 
How can I get a Matrix Terminal?
	Simple, go to your friendly electronics store and buy a Desktop 
computer with 5-10 MP of memory, it should only cost you about 100-200 nuyen.  
If you live in a nice enough place (Middle or higher lifestyle area) you can 
get reimbursed as well.  That's all there is to it.

How do I use a Matrix Terminal?
Ah...the real meat and bones of the whole concept.  This is a multiple step 
process, which I shall attempt to describe below....
 
-=Preparation=-
Locations: You can go to 6 different locations, 3 'public' and 3 not so public.
 
**SeaSource**: Seattle Source, a corporate sponsored area that you can go to 
for basic information regarding the city (sorry boys and girls, nothing 
illegal).
**CARL**: Computer Aided Research Library. Think of this as a huge 
neighborhood library which connections to libraries around the world.
**Opposition**: A virtual bar, a nice, private place to get together and 
have those chats. Now you can _virtually_ pose: Players sips his drink.! 
(hehehehe)
**Shadowland**: Often thought of as only a rumor, Shadowland is a data haven 
for rumors and information about the shadowy underworld of Seattle.  
**Hiring Hall**: In connection with Shadowland, Hiring Hall is a place where 
those not so legal activities can be advertised discreetly.
**Magland**: Similar to Shadowland, but this caters to those magically active 
and magically curious.  As 'illegal' as it seems notable professors and world 
leaders on magical causes have been known to post there.
 
The first three locations will be automatically set when you jack into the 
system, the last three you will have to do some work for.  Shadowland/Hiring 
Hall and Magland are 'secret' locations, which change often and can be found 
via one of two ways.
 
+data havens roll <'ml' for magland, 'sl' for Shadowland/Hiring Hall>.
Or contact an MJudge.
 
Either way you'll (hopefully) get a four-digit number back.  When you get 
that address you have to set it with a simple command:
 
+set (shadowland/magland) address * : where * is the address. If you enter 
shadowland, it will also set Hiring Halls address.
 
Viola, preperations are complete, now let's go in.

NEWS MATRIX TERMINALS 4
--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
-=Going Places=-
(NOTE: If this is your first time using the computer, make sure you log in 
with 'login <password>' (The default password is 'password')
 
1) type 'terminal *' to jack in.  In place of the * put your Persona name. 
This is a one-word name which will be used within the Matrix (IE: Frog, 
Goober, Fastjack, The_Neon_Samurai). Yes, you will note that with this 
command it's possible to change your name often.
 
2) After a few moments you will be jacked into the Matrix, sitting in either 
the Seattle RTG or a local host (depending on where you are at).  Take a 
moment to look around and enjoy the sights. When you're done, you're ready 
to move.  The key method to moving about in the matrix to these six mentioned 
locations is the 'SCGO' command.  It is extremely easy to use.
 
'scgo Seasource/Opposition/Carl/Shadowland/Magland/HiringHall'  
(pick one of the names, ie 'scgo seasource').
  
*Zap* you're there. Gotta love those high speed connections.:)
 
-=Using those Places=-
When you get to these places, you can finally use their resources.  The 
primary method of information exchange is via a message board located on 
these matrix systems.  Using these is just as simple, with the commands 
setup like the familiar BBroads.  The commands are as follows:
 
bbscan - This shows a listing of all the files in the host.
bbread <FILE> - This will display the contents of <FILE>
bbpost <FILE>=<TEXT> This will Post <FILE> with the message of <TEXT>
bbreply <FILE>=<TEXT> This will reply to <FILE> with the message of <TEXT>
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: ALL <FILE> names MUST be one word.
 
-=Leaving the Matrix=-
And leaving the matrix is just as easy.
	'turn off terminal'
 
That's it!  All you needed to know about using the major resources of the 
Matrix are right there.  Any more information in this NEWS is simply advanced 
information that is not necessary for you to have for the basic usage.

***COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT COMPUTERS IS IN +CDHELP***
 
?What if I happen to see another person within the Matrix?
This will happen on occasions, two or more people will appear in the same 
matrix host at the same time.  Treat it just like you would any other 
role-playing scene, except you have to use a few different communications 
commands.
 
Make yourself visible to others: '+unhide persona'
Looking at someone: 'v <name>'
Talking to someone: '' <blah>' (That is a Single Quote ' mark)
Posing: .pose
 
?I don't like the Default UMS Description for my persona, how can I change that?
'desc <enter description here>'
 
?What if I don't want to keep typing in my name?
This is simple, but will require a different command to log in.
To set your name type: 'name <your_person_aname>
After you do this, to login you must type: 'computer jack in telecom'
 
!I had the Shadowland/HiringHall and/or Magland Address, but now it doesn't 
work!
Shadowland/HiringHall and Magland change locations about every five or six 
days, you will need to do another data havens roll to find their location 
and reset the address.
 
?What if I wanna do X?
For more information that's beyond the scope of this news file, look at 
+cdhelp, that'll give you a LOT of information. In addition, the channel 
MatrixGeneral (addcom mg=MatrixGeneral) is an OOC channel for any sort of 
Decker or Matrix related questions.

Terminology:
Persona: An 'icon' or represention of a computer user within the trix.
UMS: Universal Matrix Standards, these are almost completely gone these days 
as corporations have switched to using customized graphical interfaces, but 
some UMS icons (such as a default persona) remain. These are 'generic' models.
Host: A 'room' or place within the matrix that hosts something.
File: A message on the boards.
MatrixJudge: See God.
Coder: God's Savior.

Hi there gang. Seems like they wanna get more people using the matrix....of
course we do :) More fun. I wrote this little tutorial up, but I'd like to
know what you guys thin. This is for beginners doing minor functions.
Since you guys trix everyday (we hope) I want you to look over this and
tell me mistakes, suggestions, or whatever via @mail. Thanks :) Much
appreciated.
 
Lots of people think that running the matrix is difficult. Well, yes, it is.
Deckers have to memorize LOTS of commands to do all the things they
need to do. However, that doesn't mean the matrix is off limits to
everyone else. Yes, even someone without a datajack, but with a desktop
computer, can manage to get in there and look around.

A desktop computer (available from vendors at a number of stores around
town) will grant someone access to the Matrix. With a few commands, you
can be up and on your way, AND not have to worry about ICE or anything
like that (unless, of course, you want to face it, but I wouldn't recommend
that on a desktop...)
 
Steps to getting Online
 
1) Persona Name and Description: You have to give your persona a name.
Simple command:
 
     name <what you want yourself to be called>
 
Then you have to get a description. That's just as easy with :
 
     desc <deck> <your description, remember, keep it computer like.>
 
Once those two steps are done, you're ready to jack in.

2)Going OOC: To make sure that you can make it through without triggering
and having to wait for a MJudge type:
 
     +deck set OOC
 
Nice command...but you're limited to moving, reading and writing, and
RPing.
  
3)Jacking in: First, make sure there are jack in points.
 
     +scan ports
 
If you see ports, you're in luck. The command with a desktop is:
 
     computer jack in <port name>
 
Page a matrix admin if you think there should be a port in your area.

4) Communications: Once you're jacked in, you'll notice some things are
different.
 
Like...talking and looking. Here's the commands below:
 
     Talking: 'blah
 
     Looking: v or v <object>
 
     Posing: .wave

5) Moving around: Moving in the matrix is different as well. In the matrix
there are three different types of nodes: Regional Telecommunications
Grids - RTG (like a country code), Local Telecommunications Grid - LTG
(like an area code), and Hosts, which are systems you can go into. It runs
RTG-->LTGs-->Hosts. To move you need to know these commands:
 
     sclogon RTG <hacking pool or 0 for none> <RTG four number address>
  
     sclogon LTG <hacking pool or 0 for none> <LTG four number address>
 
     sclogon HOST <hacking pool or 0 for none> <HOST four number address>
 
Some experience and time in the 'trix will tell you which command will be
needed where.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
By the way, you'll note that LTGs are not listed from the RTG. The Seattle
RTG lists the site of SeaSource, a public host system, but the rest, you
have to find. Ask your friendly decker for a host address that might be fun
(like SHADOWLAND and MAGLAND)
 
6) Files and Information: Ah, information, one of the most important
reasons for visiting the matrix. Files are put up in the Matrix almost like a
bulletin board...well, cuz they are in a since. You only need to know a few
commands to manipulate these information databases.
  
     scscan file <hacking pool> - Let's you find files in the
 
system. Good one to start out with.
 
scread file <hacking pool> <file name>
 
screply file <hacking pool> <file name>=<Message>
 
scwrite file <hacking pool> <file name>=<Message>

7) Logging Off: When you are all finished, there is one simple command.
 
     Graceful Logoff
  
     Running the Matrix isn't necessarily left up to just deckers. In the
numerous books by FASA in which deckers post, you'll see remarks from
Mages, Street Sammies, and even the average citizen. What you have here
(+deck set OOC) will allow anyone to do it. Sure, finding SHADOWLAND or
MAGLAND may be difficult, but if you REALLY want to find it, you will.
Either ask...or learn from word on the street. Be patient, and you'll learn.
Just remember that you can always join MatrixGeneral and ask a question
or use the ever friendly online help manual....+cdhelp

DO NOT DECK FROM HOME
  
Okay, so you got your house all set up. Your computer chips nearby, a
comfortable chair, your buddy to pull you out in case of trouble, etc etc.
You jack in to the trix to do some serious deck punching. What's wrong?
  
You're decking from home.
  
People, PLEASE! Use your head. If your hacking a system and get traced,
you're as good as dead. Go some place like Hojo's and rent a coffin, deck
from there. Might not be as comfy, but a hell of a lot safer.
  
DO NOT FORGET POSING
  
First off MJudges are sick of seeing none of you deckers RPing within the
trix. If anything you'd be RPing twice as hard. This is what you do. This is
your whole purpose on the MUSH. If  anyone caught not RPing within the trix
while in a IC situation, they will be force dumped, giving them a nice
shock.

DECK IN CONTAINER
 
 Do not put a deck in any bags or containers. If you do put it in a larger
container like a locker or such MAKE SURE YOU DROP IT before you try and
use it. For smaller bags and cases a deck will not fit in those, you must
use the deck conceal command instead.
 
MORE THEN ONE PROGRAM/FILE ALIAS
 
 If you have a desktop computer do not try and load a program that has the
same alias as a SOURCE code file you have designed.  DO NOT put the same
program or file in the same storage object <chipcases and chips I'm
talking about> that have the same alias or you will erase one of the copies.
 
MORE THAN ONE CHIPCASE
 
DO NOT ASK FOR a second chipcase, 1 chipcase per person, there is too
much of chance you will mess up the chipcases as they will both want to
do the same code and it could really mess things up.

SAME PARENTS
 
Also remember desktop computers and decks have the same parents and do
not keep both in the same room or on you. If you must have both on you, DO
NOT logon to the computer.
 
MOVING PROGRAMS AND FILES
 
PLEASE when loading chips on your chipcase DO IT SLOW otherwise you
will loss information and mess up the chipcase. Also when moving a files
off decks DO THAT REALLY SLOW, there is a wait while it creates the chip
if you start another before the first is done it will really mess up both
files. Make sure the chip is on you before you to the next command.
 
SOURCE CODE ON OFFLINE
 
This is going to be the only warning, DO NOT put source files on offline
storage units, if your caught doing this you not going to like what happens.

TRADING PROGRAMS
 
Ok this is a reminder, if you do not own the program chip, you better not
have it loaded on your PC or deck. This is your only warning, IF YOU DO NOT
HAVE A CHIP FOR A PROGRAM, remove it from your storage. A few of you
are using copies of each others software to the point where your decks are
mirror images of each other. It has already happened that a decker made
the mistake of saying he hacked a place he hadn't. Unfortunately, he
unknowingly said it to the live security for that place. The security person
took the decker in for it, too. When the deck was scanned, lo and behold,
there was all the software they'd seen on the icon. The icon was different
though... but that's easy to reprogram. So what happened? Sad story... he'll
more than likely die for it. All the crying in the world about this being un-
IC will change nothing. You run the risk of this happening to yourself if you
are going to mirror your deck off of someone else's...
 
You may sell a program to another player but you must send the RP log of
the scene to Rubik. Otherwise it will be considered a trade and the
program will have to be removed.
 
PAYDATA IN CHIPCASES
 
DO NOT DO-- I strongly suggest if you want to keep your paydata files, DO
not put the paydata chips into the chipcases, seems for some weird reason
its not getting the info.

1. When you load programs or files, on the cdhelp it says <program or file>,
please use program if its a program or file if its a file.
 
2.  THE MATRIX IS IC, which means if your in the matrix and something
happens I don't want to hear I'm just checking it out.
 
3. There are also some system commands that will need a judge present. If
you need to do one of these commands, check the +staff and see if there is
a MJudge ON duty, if so use the mjudge call, if not please @mail your
request to *MatrixRP.
 
4. There is a deck command now for MAGLAND and SHADOWLAND. check it
out. And don't forget about the public database called SeaSource where the
online email database is at.

5. Please the computers have 2 DELETE commands DELETE <filename> for
text files, and +DELETE PROGRAM FILE, for program. If you use the DELETE
<filename> for program being programed, it will mess up your storage
memory.
 
6. You will also see on the status Program<#>_0, just ignore that _0 its
just that source code doesn't have a rating.
 
7.Two Types of TASK bonuses:
 
Task Pool- is a pool of dice like a combat pool, this pool is used to
increase your chance at doing something technical. Encephelon and Math
SPU effects this, which effects how many dice you will roll to see if you
can program the program or hardware and how long it will take.
 
Task Bonus- is a bonus to when you programing on how long it actually
will take you per hour. So if you task bonus is 3 it means every hour you
work your actually doing 4 because of the hardware your using.

8. File Finding Commands
 
Ok a reminder scan_file is used to check for files placed on the host,
locate_file is used for TP runs and such where the info is not actually
typed out on the host. And to retrieve files found through a locate_file you
would use the file subsystem test command not the read_file.
 
9.To contact a judge or admin of the matrix staff you have 3 choices.
 
1. @mail MJudge, This will add you in the matrix judge queue so only one
matrix admin gets it. Please send TP runs and such here.
 
2. @mail *MatrixRP, This is used to inform all the matrix admins about
something going on in the matrix or around the matrix. Please don't send
TP's here unless you think every matrix admin needs to know.

10. And lastly The mjudges can not see your OOC messages in the matrix,
we are not in the same object as you so we will never see it.
 
11. From now on you must wait at least 15 seconds before doing
commands. As there is now a 10 second wait in the command that checks
the ICE and alerts. If you do the commands too fast you may trigger more
then one piece at you and it could be even worse for you.

Now you don't just have to DISPLAY something, you could add AUDIO?
MOVIE?
 
Hence, <<AUDIO: (LISP) Opiate, Tool>>
 
AUDIO being the routine sent to your deck, kinda like modern day Java.
LISP being the sound language. Now that is not totally right, since I have
no idea what the AUDIO language is for modern day decks but nothing like
bullshitting ehh? ;) Opiate being the song, and Tool being the group. Now
that group doesn't exist in 2056, but that is just an example.

*****Combat Posing*****
 
1. You would pose your attack, make sure it includes what your attack
program looks like and try to make it as detailed as possible.
 
2. Then do the attack command, check out +cdhelp combat for the correct
command.
 
3. Now at this point the mjudge will tell you what happens and they may or
may not ask you to pose the miss or hit.
 
****Program Posing*****%Every time you do a system command you
MUST pose what your icon and program if loaded would look like as your
doing the command.  And remember in general your program will act the
same way just may look different depending on the hosts theme.

****MATRIX SPEED REMINDER****
 
Just a reminder, when you go into a matrix host, don't zip along commands
like nobody's business. 1) You could trigger something. MJudges can get in
there and unlock your deck and get things set up without you even knowing
you triggered, but if you slam off commands left and right, the mjudges
can't do that. 2) Sometimes a judge will be following you. MJudges will
follow you from place to place, and then spring surprises on you when
you're least expecting it. However, if you hop into one host, then into the
next, you might trigger something and miss it.
 
So, when you hop into a host make sure you take time to read the
description, and pose your system commands as well. Always pose. A good
10 to 15 second wait after a command can't hurt and it'll increase RP
potential. NOTE you must make a pose for EVERY system command you do.
If you are masking/hiding you can use |<your persona emit>. This will
emit to any Immortals in the room, not other deckers.

ROLEPLAYING LOGS
 
If you have any MATRIX RELATED Roleplaying logs, feel free to send them
to me. Also any roleplay logs of selling programs or programed source
coded MUST have MJudge approval and a log must be sent to Rubik. This
doesn't mean if you're sitting in a bar and a friend asks you for the
address to SHADOWLAND and that's it, you should send it. Nope, this is
actual drawn out RP. And if it's IN The matrix, more kudos to you. So, send

Okay, just a little reminder. If you see a post in SHADOWLAND or
MAGLAND, or anywhere for that matter, that looks long, do us a favor and
don't add on to it. Start another file, named Blah2 or something like that,
just reply  in another file. If you make one file too large, you'll start
cutting out the end (you can see that on a couple of old posts). Just a
helpful reminder to keep us all fully informed:)

Ok small change in the way bandwidth work on this MUSH.
 
You icon bandwidth will = <your active memory used>/ <your jackpoints
bandwidth> then divide that by 2. Also redirect datatrails can lower your
chance to be traced so do not forget to do those on important runs. This
icon bandwidth will be used when a trace ICE is activated and is trying to
locate your jackpoint. Also remember if you adjust your IO bandwidth with
a refrain it will also effect the trace bandwidth rating, so be careful
raising that, only do that when you know its clear. And I/O bandwidths
will only be used during downloading load files. You will only be able to
download the decks I/O rating <plus more if you refrain> of a file per
phase<turn>.

Combat Maneuvers
 
Ok we are not using the parry or position attack maneuvers, but we are
using the evade detection.
 
Ok so you want to know how that works, its simple. You can evade ICE or
another decker if they spot you. To evade ICE you will roll your evasion
rating, TN#= security rating - cloak program, against the hosts security
rating against your evasion. Or if you evade another decker, you roll
evasion against there sensors - your cloak program + there lockon
program. And they will roll sensors vrs your evasion.
 
Now if your successful in evading the other decker, they will have to do a
sclocate decker command to find you. And the ICE will locate you again in
a number of combat turns equal to the number of successes you got when
you evaded them. Now if you increase your security tally during this time,
the amount changed will reduce the evading time.

Programing Times
 
We have some very custom rules on how programing will work on here.
 
FIRST, NO you will not be able to see your time left to program or how
long you have worked.
 
Now I was nice and added something a bit more IC......
 
During the time you program you will get a few pemits at different stages
telling you, you failed or getting closer to finishing.
 
And of course at the end you will be told. And if your offline and still
programing when one of these stages are hit, you will be told first thing
when you connect the next time.
 
Also remember that the computer theory skill is used for your program
tests, not computer on this site.

Ok this is how the programing time will be calculated
 
1. Programs- calculate normally as in VRII and then convert it to hours
<times book value by 24>.  Then divide the total hours by 4, and you got
your base time.
 
Which means squaring its rating and multiplying by its program modifier
as shown on page 101 in VRII. You would times that by 2 and convert it to
hours <times by 24>. Then you take that time and divide that by 4. And that
is your base time.
 
2. Hardware- calculate normally as in VRII and then convert it to hours
<times book value by 24>.  Then divide the total hours by 2, and you got
your base time.
 
3. Upgrading - You would use the rules above to find the difference
between the two source files and that will give you your base time.
 
4. After you have completed a source file <program or program part of
hardware> you will be able to make 3 copies of the completed program but
you not make ANY copies of hardware source. After the program part of
hardware is completed you will have to cook the source which can be done
with a computer if you have encoder added onto the computer. If you do not
have an encoder you will not be able to cook it.

4. If you move the deck around there is a 10 percent chance the deck will
not work the next time you jack in. As there are a allot of large and
delicate parts including lose wires and connections. To repair the deck you
will need to make a computer B/R test, TN# of 4 base time will be 4 hours
and you must have Micro Kit.

Ok here is the deal on paydata......
 
Paydata works like this, you do a locate_paydata command in a host, what
this command does is figure out how many paydata files are found and
what type. Yes it will give you a basic idea what the file is, giving you a
better chance of RPing selling the file. All paydata files found but
SHADOWFILES are considered filed with OOC info it's just there for RPing
the selling ,not for actually gaining info. Now shadowfiles are different,
if you get this one you must contact a MJudges before selling it and they
will tell you specifics on what the file is, this will be a good way to spur
Tps around you guys. Also some PC fixers out there have VRII datapads
which will allow them to also purchase your paydata giving you more
chances to sell these files besides with only Deckmeisters. And a side
note, these Paydata files are now Rated, NON SHADOWFILES are 0 through
10, and SHADOWFILES rate from 0 to 20.
 
Now if a file is rating 0, it means that file is worth nothing and you will
not be able to sell it :-), consider it someone else already got the file and
sold it making your file worth shit.

We have had problems with people finding shadowfiles in hosts that would
never actually have anything we can work with or would not have shadow
type info. So if you pick one up and a MJudge thinks its not a good spot for
a shadow file we will consider it a normal file. This is because the matrix
is really large and we can not keep up with every host and their
shadowfiles.  And remember shadowfiles actually don't give you more
money, they are only there to stimulate TPs for the future for you.
 
When you go to sell them, the buyer will check to see how much the
MJudges will give them as a price for the paydata. NOW be warned when he
checks the price your stuck, the chip will be destroyed and he and you will
be given a round number where the two of you can talk about the price.
 
Now base price is 2000 give or take .25 to -.25 percent depending on the
rating which effects the price also. At this time there is no time
penalties, but if the file is older then 5 days it will be worthless and he
will not give you drek for it.

Random System- its called '+system search'. What is this, its a new
system where you can hear about systems that might be interesting. Yes
some of these systems may be big time for some wannbe you over hear but
you will not know till you check them out.
 
Ok so you ask where can I do this, that is simple go to the online hacker
lounge called The_Opposition, <ill even give you the address for free,
4042>. Go to the first host and type that command and you might find a
system.
 
Ok way it works, once a week you can go there and run the command, it
uses your Matrix Etiquette skill against a TN# of 5, the number of success
you get is the number of systems you can hear about for that week. Now
you can only hear about one system a day, and every day after that first
day, for that week, you try and hear about a new system but you will have
to roll Matrix Etiquette again but only against a simple TN#2, if you fail
the guy didn't like you and told you to beat it, if you pass you get a new
system address.

--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--==++==--
Yes we now have a OOC census, which lists anyone with a decker attr and
rates them and displays how much time they actual spent in the matrix
since the system went in. Check it out and remember all info there is OOC.
On the player side this info is considered VERY OOC, you can brag and tease
the others if there online time sucks but DO NOT that info IC unless you
find out IC. The census command will also be used by the some RPA's to
rank you and adjust the pay level for your rep.
 
The census command takes into account you computer skill, karma gained,
and online time. Do not ask what the math is as its a secret.

SKILL RAISES RULE <thanks Ziggy>
 
Aside from the karma cost, raising you computer skill also requires
another achievement. You must spend a certain amount of time on the
matrix. The requirements are as follows:
 
Upgrade 1: 50 hours of matrix time.
 
Upgrade 2: 150 hours of matrix time.
 
Upgrade 3: 350 hours of matrix time.
 
Upgrade 4: 500 hours of matrix time.
 
Upgrade 5: 800 hours of matrix time.
 
Upgrade 6: 1000 hours of matrix time.
 
Going beyond this is not necessary at this point in time. Thanks for
listening.

Deckers may hack SINs Depending on the rating of the SIN they wish to create
 they will need to lay various levels of footwork. This hacking represents the
laying of supporting data for the SIN. Showing the flow of money, travel,
health, and other records needed to indicate an individual's existence in
modern society. Lists of systems required for hacking are below. Please note
that a SIN also needs a list of attributes and background not just hacking. An
admin is going to want to know where the identity exists, what it does, age
and other vital factors. Little things like age, weight, peculiatirites that
would show up in records or buying patterns, etc.
 
A hack is considered successful if the system's accounting or main record
subsystem is successfully validated unles specified otherwise. If a main
record subsystem or accounting host does not exist in that particular system
its most secure point will be considered valid. These are for levels 1-6.
leaving 7-10 for other methods (for now)

MJudge present.
  
And lastly the order of commands in the systems:
  
1. Locate File <something along the lines of looking for Sin information

2. Download File
  
3. Then lastly Edit Log File, to validate your entry.
  
Are you adding a fake SIN for someone? Well, we'd like to see you all
finding a new way to handle these. Nothing major but we'd just like a
little bit of information on every fake SIN you make. (IE, we're gonna make
you actually work ;)). Before you make a Fake SIN you will need to @mail
*MatrixRP with the following information on the person who you are going
to make a fake sin for:
  
PC Name, the name on the SIN, the Occupation of the SINner, Date of birth
and place of Birth, education, medical history, and Licenses and permits

Ok well we finally started working on getting frames up and running. Now
we are going to be using custom rules for Smart frames <yes we do not
have DUMB ones yet>. Smart frame will only be used to do general searches
and info gathering, they can not be controlled by you and they can not be
set up as combat frames. This will explain how it will work, first you will
have to buy or program frames. After you got a frame loaded on your
computer you jack in, and use the +send frame <frame alias> <HP>=<what
your sending your frame to look for>.  Note, be as specific as possible and
as detailed as you can, it will make your base TN# lower. At this point it
will Log your search, rolls, and program modifiers <see more latter in
post>, and the MJudge will determine your base TN# and base time and will
get back to you with the info within 3 days. Also note you get only get 1
search a day unless you in a IC host with a MJudge.
 
Program Modifiers: The stats of the frame and what programs will effect
how well it can handle info searches.

If your frame has these programs they will help find the info by making it
easier to get the info. You take the programs rating and divided the rating
by this modifier Cloak|3 Sleaze|1 Evaluate|.5 Analyze|3 Readwrite|2
Browse|2 Deception|3 Validate|4 Relocate|4. Now add these number up then
subtract these 2 modifiers if your frame doesn't have a Masking of 2
subtract 1 and/or if the frame doesn't have a Browse then subtract
another 1. That total will give you the program modifier of your frame.
 
Haaaa another note, you don't have to actually spend time coding it like
programs. Its just a base time and in that time you can run the +program
frame complete command.
 
Now to see the help on how to program a frame check out +lhelp PC
frames.

        Cyberware has dramatically improved the power of human mind when it
is applied to decking. Though conventional cyberware such as wired reflexes
are of no use the Matrix, new mental improvements are now almost a necessity.
 
Headware Memory
---------------
        Allows a user to store data in storage chips in their cranium.
 
Datajack
--------
        Necessary for decking. Allows data to be sent to and processed by the
brain.
 
Encephalon
----------
        A combination microcomputer and expert system that allows the
brain to access all internal memory stores and functions. Allows mental
multiitasking. Available in levels ranging from one to four. The level one
and two encephalons give a point of intelligence bonus, and the level two
encephalon gives a task pool bonus. Level three and four encephalons give a
two point intelligence bonus and give two and three task bonuses respectively.
Just a reminder, intelligence directly affects Hacking Pool.
 
Math SPU
--------
        A math subprocessor in the brain that allows the user to mentally
complete very complex mathematic equations. The Math SPU functions as a bouns
to the mathematics skill and it adds half its rating to technical, technical
build-repair, and science skills. This means that it increases the Hacking
Pool by half its level, which ranges from one to four.

                           Matrix Programs
 
        Theoretically, a sufficiently godlike decker could command the Matrix
with nothing but his bare persona and skill alone. Less divine netheads,
however, must supplement their puny skills with utility programs. Utilities
come in four flavors: operational, special, defensive, and offensive.
Operational utilities apply to a decker's System Tests. These prove
especially useful when performing system operations, hence the name
operational utilities. Special utilities perform specific tasks in the
Matrix. Offensive utilities are used to damage opposing deckers, IC, and so
on. Defensive utilities are designed to prevent damage taken in cybercombat.

NEWS MATRIX PROGRAMS OPERATIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Operational Utilities
 
        Operational utilities increase the chance of a system operation
working correctly. They do this by lowering the effective security rating of
the host by the rating of the utility when doing a system command. For
example, an Analyze 4 program run on a host with a control subsystem 10 would
have a target number of 6 rather than 10. The operational utilities and the
system operations they affect are:
 
Analyze    | Analyze Host, Analyze IC, Analyze Icon, Analyze Security, Locate IC
Browse     | Locate Access Node, Locate File, Locate Slave
Crash      | Crash Application, Crash Host
Defuse     | Increases chance of defusing data bombs
Deception  | Graceful Logoff, Logon to (RTG, LTG, or Host)
Decrypt    | Decrypt Access, Decrypt File, Decrypt Slave
Disinfect  | Disinfect
Evaluate   | Locate Paydata
Mirrors    | Decoy
Read/Write | All system commands affecting files on a host
Relocate   | Allows for relocation of entry point to confuse trace IC

NEWS MATRIX PROGRAMS OFFENSIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Offensive Utilities
 
Attack
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames, IC
Options: Area, chaser, one-shot, optimization, penetration, stealth, targeting
        An offensive program designed to inflict damage on online icons by
introducing memory faults into the algorithms of the opposing icon.
 
Black Hammer
------------
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The black hammer utility is a black IC program that targets the
decker, not the deck. It can kill a decker without knocking his cyberdeck
offline, making the connection traceable. The maximum rating of the black
hammer utility is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up.
 
Hog
---
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The hog program crashes running utilities on another decker's deck.
 
Killjoy
-------
Targets: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The killjoy utility is like black hammer, but it inflicts stun damage
instead of physical damage. The maximum program rating for a killjoy utility
is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up.
 
Poison
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The poison utility attacks the Bod Rating of targeted personas and
behaves like Acid IC.
 
Restrict
--------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The restrict program attacks the Evasion Rating of targeted personas.
 
Reveal
------
Targets: Deckers, Frames
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The reveal program attacks the Masking Rating of targeted personas.
 
Slow
----
Targets: IC
Options: Area, one-shot, optimization, targeting
        The slow utility reduces the execution speed of proactive IC. Note
that temporarily disabling IC in this manner prevents the IC from raising the
decker's security tally. However, suppressing the IC requires 1 point of
Masking. Trace IC is only vulnerable to the slow utility during it's hunting
cycle.
 
Steamroller
-----------
Targets: Tar Baby, Tar Pits
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
        The steamrolling utility is a specific type of attack program
intended to target tar IC programs. It inflicts (Rating)D damage on the tar
IC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS MATRIX PROGRAMS DEFENSIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Defensive Utilities
 
Armor
-----
Options: Optimization
        The armor utility reduces the power of damage inflicted on a decker's
icon by the rating of the armor program. The armor program only works on the
decker's icon, not their meatbody. The armor utility loses 1 rating point
every time the decker takes damage, or in other words, whenever the armor
utility does not absorb ALL of the damage, it loses a rating point.
 
Camo
----
Options: One-shot, optimization
        The camo utility rating is added to the trace factor, which impedes
the attempts of trace IC to follow a deck's datatrail.
 
Cloak
-----
Options: One-shot, optimization
        The cloak utility makes evasion during combat easier.
 
Lock-On
-------
Options: One-shot. optimization
        The lock-on utility makes sensing an opposing decker easier during
cybercombat.
 
Medic
-----
Options: Optimization
        This program heals damage takes by the decker's online icon. It loses
one rating point for every point of damage it heals. Deckers can perform a
Swap Memory operation to restore the medic utility to its full rating.
 
Restore
-------
Options: One-shot, optimization
        This program restores deck attributes that have been damaged by an
attack. The program cannot repair damage to actual persona chips caused by
gray or black IC.
 
Shield
------
Options: Optimization
        Shield enables a decker to parry attacks in cybercombat. The shield
utility loses 1 Rating Point every time it is used, whether the operation
succeeds or not. Deckers may load fresh copies of the utility by performing
Swap Memory operations.

memory equal to or greater than the size of the program being created. If the
personal computer has double the amount of memory needed in confers a one
point task bonus. Programmers can also install programming suites or shops to
make programming easier and faster. Using a mainframe instead of a personal
computer also adds a bonus to all programming tasks. However, the mainframe's
Security Value must be at least half the rating of the program being created.
Mainframe time can be purchased at Security Value x 100 nuyen per day.
Programming suites can also be purchased for mainframes. Mainframes running
programming suites cost twice as much as a normal mainframe.
        Programming and deck construction are both tasks that take a specific
amount of time depending on the difficulty of the task. Various equipment
furnishes the programmer or deck constructor with task bonuses. Task bonuses
significantly decrease the time necessary to complete a task. This equipment
includes shops, kits, facilities, programming suites, and mainframe computer

        Options are special additions to programs that alter their function.
Program options require a greater amount of memory to program a utility and
run it. Some options reduce the size of a program while increasing the amount
of memory needed to program it. Changes in a program's rating due to option
addition do not count against the maximum rating that a programmer can
design. These options are the only ones implemented on Shadowrun MUSH:
 
Area         | Allows a program to engage multiple targets on the host
Chaser       | Negates the penalty against attacking shifting IC (may
             | not exist with Penetration)
One-Shot     | Turns the utility into a single-shot program and
             | reduces its size in memory
Optimization | Reduces the size of a program in memory by 50

constructs are combinations of IC programs. Frames can be smart or dumb. Dumb
frames exist only as long as the decker can control them and is active on the
host. Smart frames are capable of independent existence in the Matrix,
whether their creator is logged on or not. Smart frames must be equipped with
DINAB, which makes them act like a decker would. Smart frames have their own

other deckers. The frames work like friendly deckers in the host, attacking
whatever you tell them to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                White
 
        White IC affects only the decker's online icon. It affects the icon's
ratings, but not the cyberdeck's permanent ratings or utilities.
 
Cripplers | Cripplers are proactive white IC programs that each
          | attack one of the decker's icon's attributes. Acid cripplers
          | attack an icon's Bod rating. Binder cripplers attack an
          | icon's Evasion rating. Jammer cripplers attack the Sensor
          | rating, and marker cripplers attack the Masking rating. Armor
          | and Hardening do not protect against cripplers.
          |
Killer    | Killer is proactive IC that causes damage directly to
          | the icon in cybercombat. The damage level of the killer IC is
          | determined by the security code of the host that runs it.
          | Killer IC on Blue or Green hosts does medium damage. Killer IC
          | on Orange or Red systems does serious damage.
          |
Data Bomb | A data bomb is reactive IC that acts as a booby trap
          | attached to a specific datafile or remote device under the
          | Slave subsystem. It will explode if the decker attempt to
          | access the file that it is protecting. Data bombs can be
          | defused with a systems test on the subsystem controlling it.
          | The defuse utility helps this process considerably.
          |
Probe     | Probe is a reactive IC that interrogates the decker and
          | tries to detect unauthorized programs. The probe program
          | increases the decker's security tally for every successful
          | interrogation it performs.
          |
Scramble  | Scramble is reactive white IC that protects elements
          | of a host's Access, Files, or Slave subsystems. Scramble comes
          | in two varieties: exploding and poison. Exploding IC works
          | like a data bomb and explodes if a decker tries to access a
          | protected subsystem. Poison IC destroys the data under its
          | protection if unauthorized access it attempted. Often times,
          | this data is backed up in another system off the Matrix.
          |
Tar Baby  | Tar baby is a reactive IC that attempt to crash a
          | decker's utility programs, specifically operational
          | utilities. When a tar baby successfully attacks the decker,
          | it crashes both itself and an operational utility in active
          | memory. A decker can perform a Swap Memory operation to
          | restore a lost program.

NEWS MATRIX IC GRAY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Gray
 
        Gray IC programs attack a decker's cyberdeck and utilities directly.
Any damage caused by a gray IC attack permenantly affects the deck's ratings.
Damaged chips and other components must be replaced to restore the deck's
original ratings.
 
Blaster   | Blaster IC is proactive IC that attacks just like the
          | Killer IC, but if the decker's icon crashes, the blaster IC
          | will do damage to the MPCP. Hardening reduces the probability
          | of damage being done by blaster after a crash.
          |
Rippers   | Rippers are gray cripplers that attack and damage
          | persona chips. Hardening reduces the effect of ripper IC.
          | Ripper IC is separated into different categories and is named
          | just like crippler IC.
          |
Sparky    | Sparky IC attacks just like blaster IC, but if the
          | decker's icon crashes, it will send a jolt of electricity to
          | the MPCP and the decker's brain. The jolt can range anywhere
          | from a little electroshock therapy to a killing blast of
          | power. Hardening reduces the power of the damage.
          |
Tar Pit   | The reactive IC known as Tar Pit works in the same way
          | as its less powerful counterpart, Tar Baby. If a tar pit
          | crashes a utility, it injects a virus that corrupts all
          | copies of the program in memory. Unless a copy has been
          | stored in offline memory, the decker has lost it for good. If
          | the copy has been stored in offline memory, the decker cannot
          | retrieve it until the end for the run.
          |
Worms     | Worms are reactive IC programs that are used to booby
          | trap subsystems. Deckers can remove worms with the disinfect
          | system command. But, the worm can infect the deck through that
          | command as well. Hardening helps defend against worm infection.
          |
          |       Dataworms logs information about deckers and report it to
          |           their owners next time the decker logs onto the Matrix.
          |       Deathworms make cybercombat much more difficult.
          |       Tapeworms erase files that are downloaded onto a deck.

Lethal Black IC
        Lethal black IC fights like killer IC  with one important difference,
black IC attacks cause damage to a decker and his icon, rather than just the
icon. The damage code for the IC depends on the security code of the host
which runs it. Blue and Green hosts run moderate damage IC, and Orange and
Red hosts run serious damage IC. Deadly wounds caused by black IC may produce
permanent aftereffects such as memory lapses, hallucinations, tremors,
phantom pain, migraines, or similar conditions.
 
Non-Lethal Psychotropic Black IC
        Non-lethal black IC causes mental, not physical damage. Deckers
resist such damage with their Willpower. Non-lethal IC can cause anything
from profound fear of the Matrix to a maniacal state of rage.

NEWS MATRIX IC TRACE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Trace
 
        Trace IC is a hybrid of white and gray IC programs. Basically, trace
IC works in two distinct stages: the hunt cycle and the location cycle.
During the hunt cycle, the IC tries to get a fix on the decker's datatrail.
The location cycle is the process of tracing the datatrail back to its
origin. The trace factor is the level of difficulty a trace will have in
locating a decker. This can be influenced by the choice of jackpoint, the
rating of any running camo program, or the number of datatrail redirects
done. Trace IC that has found the decker's jackpoint can make it much easier
for IC to lock on to the decker. Trace IC also has the tendancy to make it
more difficult for the decker to jack out.

        When a decker crashes an IC, the rating of the IC is added to the
decker's security tally. The stealth option on a program can reduce the
amount by which the security tally rises when an IC is crashed. A decker can
also choose to suppress IC with a point of his detection factor. The decker
can choose to release the suppressed IC in order to regain detection factor,
but when the IC is released, its rating will be added to the security tally.

        The Master Persona Control Program, or MPCP, runs on a grouping of
optical chips at the heart of the cyberdeck. It contains the master operating
system that integrates the deck's programs. It translates Grid signals into
images that the user can see, hear, and smell. It also turns the decker's
neural signals into computer instructions that manipulate the Matrix. If the
MPCP crashes, the decker is immediately dumped.
 
        The MPCP's principal duty is maintaining the cohesive integration of
all the deck's components and active programs into what is known as the
persona. Visually, the persona appears as anything the decker wants, but
technically it is the decker's body while in the Matrix. The persona's
attributes are a combination of the MPCP and four programs, called persona

        Bod     | Bod is the persona's Body attribute. It is what

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            ASIST Levels
 
        The ASIST interface component controls the simsense experience of
cyberspace and the decker's DNI (direct neural interface) connection to the
Matrix, as routed through the interpretive software coded into the MPCP. The
interface also has a control program of its own to handle the data exchange.
        This is not a home sim entertainment unit. The typical signal
strength on a full-bore cyberdeck is not too far below the brainkicking
current a wirehead gets from a Better Than Life chip. That gives the best
interface to the Matrix, and when a deck is running at that intensity, it is
called a "hot" deck.
        However, a decker can deliberately reduce the intensity of the ASIST
signal, down to about the level of legal simsense. This is called a "cool"
deck. Cool decks reduce the persona's speed in cyberspace, but black IC
cannot inflict lethal damage over a cool interface. Psychotropic black IC,
however, works over both levels of interface.
        Tortoises are cyberdecks without ASIST interfaces. They use low-end

interface. Tortoises have a severe penalty to Matrix access speed and

                               Deck Modes
 
        Cyberdecks are always in one of five modes: Standard, Bod, Evasion,
Masking, or Sensor.
 
        Standard Mode | All deck ratings remain at their base values.
                      |
        Bod Mode      | Bod increases 50 percent, all other personas decrease
                      | by 50 percent, and bandwidth drops by 50 percent.
                      |
        Evasion Mode  | Evasion increases 50 percent, all other
                      | personas decrease by 50 percent, and bandwidth drops
                      | by 50 percent.
                      |
        Masking Mode  | Masking increases 50 percent, all others drop.
                      | Bandwidth is not affected.
                      |
        Sensor Mode   | Sensor mode increases sensor by 50 percent and
                      | all other personas drop. Bandwidth is unaffected.

                      Unimplemented Options in VRII
 
        There are certain things that Shadowrun MUSH has not implemented
because they are either too difficult to code for the result they give or
because they do not work well with other aspects of the MUSH. The following
options from VRII have not been implemented in our code:
 
     Reality Filters, DINAB, Squeeze, Cascading IC,
    Make Comcall, Tap Comcall, SOTA, and the Icon Bandwidth options

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS MATRIX DECKING SHOCK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Dump Shock and Simsense Overload
 
Dump Shock        | When a decker is crashed off the Matrix or jacks out
                  | without making a Graceful Logoff, he risks Stun damage
                  | from dump shock. The stun level ranges from Light stun
                  | on Blue hosts to Deadly stun on Red hosts. Running a cool
                  | deck or ICCM reduces the effect of dump shock.
                  |
Simsense Overload | Whenever a decker's icon takes damage from white or gray,
                  | the decker's physical body may suffer Stun damage through
                  | the resonance effect through the ASIST interface. Cool
                  | decks and tortoises are immune to simsense overload.
                  | ICCM can reduce the effect of simsense overload.

NEWS MATRIX DECKING BANDWIDTH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             I/O Bandwidth
 
        I/O Bandwidth handles uploads and downloads. I/O bandwidth allows the
decker to do multiplexing, or allocating different portions of his bandwidth
to the transfer of different files. A decker can also use the retrain system
operation to increase or decrease his bandwidth. When a decker increases the
bandwidth above the rating of the jackpoint they are using, it is easier for
trace IC to locate them.

NEWS MATRIX DECKING SATELLITE UPLINKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Satellite Uplinks
 
        When a decker taps directly into a communications satellite to enter
the Matrix, he trades higher Access target numbers for partial immunity to
trace IC. Signal lag over the satellite also reduces the decker's reaction by
2. A deck must be equipped with satlink hardware and software in order to use
a communications satellite. Satellite transponders must be located before
they can be used, and it usually takes about three minutes to do so.
Satellites function as LTGs once they are hacked into, but they are usually
much tighter with their security than the average LTG.

NEWS MATRIX DECKING ALERTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Alert Levels
 
        There are three levels of alert in the host systems on the Matrix.
 
No Alert
--------
   Generally activate trace IC and reactive IC upon detection of intruder. If
intrusion becomes more obvious, passive alert is activated.
 
Passive Alert
-------------
   The presence of an intruder is likely, but not certain. The system will
activate proactive white or gray IC. All subsystem ratings in the
host also raise by 2 under this alert status.
 
Active Alert
------------
   The presence of an intruder has been verified. In active alert,
retaliation is barred only by the power of the computer, though it hardly
ever reaches that level before the decker is killed. The host will activate
proactive white, gray, and black IC in addition to calling in law-enforcement
deckers to protect the system. After this point, leaving the system and
returning becomes much more difficult. The host may, if threatened to a
considerable degree, shut itself down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Initative
 
        The initiative of a decker is determined by the reaction attribute of
the decker's persona. An unenhanced persona has a reaction of 1D6. Reaction
increases and running in hot mode increase a decker's reaction in the Matrix.
Wired reflexes, magical augmentation, and vehicle control rigs do not affect
the persona's reaction in the Matrix.

        There are three kinds of actions in cybercombat. An icon can take on
free action and either two simple actions or one complex action during a
combat phase.
 
             Free actions: Delay Action, Speak a Word, Terminate

NEWS MATRIX CYBERCOMBAT MANEUVERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Combat Maneuvers
 
Evade Detection
---------------
        An icon can perform an evade detection maneuver to evade an opposing
icon that has detected it. If an IC program has evaded the decker, he must
use the Analyze Icon operation to relocate it.
 
Parry Attack
------------
        The parry-attack maneuver makes it more difficult for an opposing
icon to hit the decker. The maneuver lasts until the next attack by an icon.
 
Position Attack
---------------
        The position attack maneuver allows the icon to position itself for
an attack on an opponent. If it fails, though, position attack makes it
easier for the opposing icon to hit the decker.

        This allows a decker to write an attack program "on the fly" as a
Simple Action. Attack programs made in this fashion are one-shot utilities.
The decker allocated points from his Evasion and/or Bod attributes to the
program, and they remain used until the program is executed. Attack programs
made in this fashion cannot exceed the rating of the MPCP.

experience, may not often then not, you have to know exactly what your doing.
This not NOT for the faint of heart. Being a decker is easily the most
difficult character on the MUSH. If you want to be decker we, the admins,

immediately, for example, when you are in the matrix and want to complete a
task, you can use the +mjudge command. Type +mjudge <brief description of

&matrix sota
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS MATRIX SOTA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Starting April 1, 1998, with the @daily command, SOTA will be implemented. 
If you're a Decker and/or own a Cyberdeck, the SOTA machine will do the dice
rolls, then @mail you with what you have. All you have to do is 
@mail *MatrixRP or contact a Mjudge with how you are going to pay. 
 
NOTE: The SOTA will be decided April 1, then you have the whole month to pay 
it off....
 
To recap here are the rules. Most are book, but there are some changes:
 
**Each PC will receive a different SOTA. They'll contact a Mjudge and get it
taken care of. 
 
Rules for calculating SOTA: These are going to be basically the same as the
book, but I'm going to simplify it here.
 Calculating SOTA Factor:
       MPCP: SOTA Factor = MPCP x 2
       Persona Programs; SOTA Factor = Rating of BEMS totaled together.
       Utility Programs: SOTA Factor = Add all ratings of programs the PC 
        has and divide by 2, round down. 
 
Custom rules: Smart frames and Source codes wont be counted. We're giving 
the PCs a break on the Program portion. Programs/hardware currently being 
made are not affected by SOTA.
 
Paying off SOTA:
Factors; Lifestyle: A High lifestyle will reduce the SOTA factor by 25%.
A luxury lifestyle will reduce is by 33%. Round down.
 
Step One: Have the PC roll Computer (MPCP) Test. Use the appropriate
concentrations for whatever their SOTA is. Each success lowers the SOTA 
factor by an amount equal to the skill used for the test.
 
Step Two: Paying off the rest can be done in 2 ways:
A) Karma: 1 good karma point will reduce the SOTA factor by an amount equal
   to the PCs Computer skill (and concentration if possible).
B) Money: 500 nuyen will pay off one SOTA factor point.
 
Failure to pay: 
   MPCP: Divide the points not paid (round up) and lower the MPCP by that many
    points.
   Persona Programs: Take the number of points not paid and reduce the BEMS
    ratings accordingly, the player can choose which ones to lower.
   Utility programs: Take the number of points remaining and lower Programs
    accordingly, player choice. (Note: I'm not sure if we can do this just
    offhand. Might have to make a command or a brand new optical chip for them.
 
Discounts: Deckers who demonstrate good skills, or spend a lot of time in the
Matrix are eligible for "discounts" (instead of playing 12 SOTA, maybe they only
pay 10). This will be up to the judge to decide (when we get a item coded, we'll
have Admin "noms" for Deckers.
 
Any questions? @mail or page Matrix Staff.
 
Oh, yeah. Desktops are nOt Affected.

 NEWS MAGIC PERCEIVING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Players of mages, astral travellers, astral assensers, and so on should
send @mail to the Magic RPC so that they may give you
the special abilities of your class.
 
The commands for astral perception are "+perceive on" and "+perceive off". 
We did not hardcode into these an @emit, so people couldn't immediately
tell by a system message that you were doing so.  HOWEVER, we expect ALL
mages to roleplay when they are astrally perceiving.  It is very obvious
that the person is not totally within "this world" if they're wandering
around (things just don't look the same), and if they're being closely
scrutinized, the eyes can glaze over, etcetera.  Don't walk around
constantly perceiving and keep in mind that when you are perceiving, you
are an astral target, drop hints to those around you when you are
perceiving, and everything should be just fine.

        SHADOWRUN MAGIC ADMINS- Our Role and Responsibilities
  
        Many players (and even some admin) are confused as to what the
Magic Admins are supposed to do here on Shadowrun MUSH. Some people rave
about the terrific job that we are doing, while others choose to complain
that we don't do our jobs enough or (in extreme cases) we do nothing at
all. This is a brief mission statement to inform all those curious as to
the nature of our position. 
        1) We are charged with overseeing the level of magically active
charac- ters in relation to the rest of the MUSH. because of the delicate
nature of Magically Active characters and their potential effect on the
tone of the 'cyberpunk' world, it is our duty to maintain a level of magic
that does not overpower the shadowy, technopunk flavor that drew most of
us to this gaming world. As our duty, we reserve the right to accept or
reject magic applications due to the mage percentages of the overall
population. We also reserve the right to limit magically active NPC's if
it becomes necessary to do so due to excessive use by the admin. 
        2) We are responsible for the maintenance of magical groups in
terms of consistency and contribution to the Shadowrun MUSH Universe. In
performing this duty, we reserve the right to accept or reject
applications for the formulation of magic groups based on necessity,
purpose or appropriateness. A list of guidelines for "What Makes a
Successful Magic Group?" can be found in NEWS MAGIC GROUPS..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        3) We are responsible for providing magically active characters with 
the means of obtaining supplies necessary for their practiced art. In doing 
so, we reserve the right to place talismongers as we deem appropriate, or 
refuse so, we reserve the right to place talismongers as we deem appropriate, 
or refuse the application of a talismonger based on necessity. We are also 
responsible for coding the various artifacts, relics, foci, fetishes, and 
ritual materials made available to the players
        4) Finally, we are responsible for providing interesting TinyPlots for 
the players dealing with the realm of magic. This includes: provisions made 
for astral quests, intriguing magical related mysteries and/or threats, and 
offering aid to other admin that seek advice on magically related occurances.
  
         Above all else, we seek to maintain a high level of honesty and
integrity in dealing with players and fellow admin. If there is ever a
problem that you believe needs to be discussed, do not hesitate to contact
the Magic RPC immediately. They will either try to come to a
mutual solution, or if this is impossible, a solid explanation for their
reasons will be made available to you to the best of their abilities.

NEWS MAGIC FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
(1) How do I get a Magic character?  
 
Magic characters are a unique character type that is not accepted on a
regular basis.  For the majority of your time on the MUSH, you will find
that Magic applications are not being accepted.  However, when they -are-
accepted, you will know by an announcement made on the 'general' BBoard. 
The number of 'magic slots' being filled will be posted as well as the
types of characters we are looking for.  This does not mean that other
more original applications will not be accepted--but rather gives an idea
of the type of characters that are being sought after.  Experienced
players will be given preference, so please be sure to include previous
characters played in the application.  Directions of where to send the
application and the deadline will be posted as well, so keep your eye
constantly on the General BBoard.:)
 
(2) Can I apply for a magic character, when magic characters are not
being accepted, if I have a really cool great idea?
 
No.  In fact, this will serve to do nothing more than annoy the Magic 
admins, and that would be bad.  Your best bet would be to save the 
character concept for when the General Board announcement is made.  
 
Continued in NEWS MAGIC FAQ2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&magic faq2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) I just killed a mage, my friend retired his magic character, my friend 
just killed his magic character, I just retired my magic character. Can I 
have that magic slot?
 
Again, no.  MAGE CHARACTERS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE.  
We fill the magic slots on a bulk basis.  The magic slot that you are 
coveting will be filled with the rest when the General Bboard 
announcement is made. 
 
(4) Ok, I have a magic character, but I want to initiate (increase magical 
prowess).  How do I do that?
 
Initiate grades are earned ICly through hard study, training, time, and 
experience.  OOCly, there is a cost involved with achieving each grade 
(No drek, neh?).  Karmaic costs depend on whether you initiate alone or 
as part of a magic group (magic groups are discussed below), and whether 
you wish to take on an ordeal (a test or quest).  The actual cost is 
figured out using a base cost (6+desired grade), multiplied by another 
number.  
                        Self-Initiation         Base Costx3
                        Group Initiation        Base Costx2
                        Self-Init+Ordeal        Base Costx2
                        Group init+Ordeal       Base Costx1.5
 
These is also a time cost associated with the initiate grade increases 
that governs the time between initiations.  Grade 0 (the first initiate 
grade) can be acheieved at anytime as long as the Karma can be paid for 
by the mage.  After that, the time cost timetable is as listed in NEWS 
RULES MAGIC INITIATION.

(5) Hey! A group of my mage buddies and I want to start a magic group.  
Where do we start?
 
See NEWS MAGIC GROUPS.
 
(6) I need magic supplies, but I don't know where to get them!
 
There is always at least one active Talismonger in the game.  You'll need 
to do a little IC legwork to find them, but they exist.

&magic groups
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS MAGIC GROUPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
What Makes A Good Magical Group:
 
 1. Groups Must Add Something To The MUSH.
 
        What we mean by this is that the magic groups presence and purpose
should add to the RP of MUSH. It should bring something new to the MUSH
to further en hance RP for all PC's, by striving to include others not a
part of the group, or even non-mages for that matter, in group related TP's.
The key to this is getting other PC's involved without truly 'getting them
involved'. A few examples would be hiring others to do their work for
them, trying to convert others to their cause, or using stealth and
manipulation of the PC populace to achieve their desired goals. The list
could go on and on. Be creative. 
 
2. Be Original.
 
        Anyone can come up with a 'down with the corps' or 'hunt down the
vile toxics' as a basis for their group, but if you want the reduced
karma costs your gonna have to a _lot_ better then that. We expect to see
new and fresh ideas, anything less is a waste of time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&magic groups2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
3. Tiny Plots
 
        The groups background and mission should be well thought out, as
to provide a jumping off point for TP's. Both for the group itself, and
also for the majority of PC's on the MUSH. 
 
4. Some Final Thoughts...
 
        Any group that is the equivalent of a magical shadowrunning team
with a cause, _will_ be turned down. The reason for this is that mages are
the most powerful class in Shadowrun and on this MUSH. Other classes would
not be able to compete, and it would throw off the balance of power on
this MUSH. By keeping these things in mind, I have the utmost faith that
you will indeed blow our minds with your creative and well thought out
ideas.

We of the Shadowrun MUSH avoid "advertising" our system on other MU*'s,
be it in @doings, objects, bbposts, and the like.  We feel that this leads
to "player stealing", and other assorted causes of bad feelings.
 
As a result, we ask that unless you receive special dispensation from our

NEWS POLICY DISCIPLINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
We are aware that Shadowrun is a game, and it is here for the fun of the 
greatest number.  Unfortunately, it has become neccessary in the past to 
exclude players from the game due to overtly disruptive activities.  It 
is the responsibility of the administration to maintain a fun and 
playable environment for the large number of players who enjoy Shadowrun 
MUSH.
 
The MUSH has several different levels of punishment applied at different 
levels of offense.  It also has an administrative justice system.  These 
are laid out in NEWS POLICY DISCIPLINE2.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&POLICY DISCIPLINE2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
"Offenses":
The following are all offenses meriting disciplinary action by the 
staff.  This list is by no means exclusive, however, it represents those 
actions which we have encountered so far:
 
* Harassment (sexual or otherise--see NEWS POLICY HARASSMENT)
* Personal insults directed towards another participant--Player OR Admin
* Multi-playing (see NEWS POLICY ONE)
* Cheating (this loosely-defined term includes any intentional action to
   circumvent any of the rules of the Shadowrun game or the MUSH) This 
   specifically includes so-called anti-idling code.
* OOC knowledge crossover (see NEWS POLICY OOC)
* Damaging the MUSH's database
* Hacking other players' passwords (unless it's IC ;))
* Malicious interference with the operation of the MUSH or its staff
* Falsely accusing anyone of any of the above.
 
(Continued in "NEWS POLICY DISCIPLINE3")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
&policy discipline3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
"Punishments":
 
Punishment options for the administration of Shadowrun MUSH in dealing 
with offenses by players and administrators include (but are not limited to):
 
* @booting: terminating the connection of the offender.  You are allowed
  back on.
* Karma docking:  Deducting karma from the PC.  (NEWS RULES KARMA DOCKING).
* SLAVE flag:  Allows the player to logon, but the player cannot affect
  the database in any way until the flag is removed.  Usually a means of
  gagging a player and enforcing non-logon punishment.
* @nuking:  Deletion of a character from the database.
* Newpasswording:  Changing a character's password for any amount of time.
* Sitebanning:  Disallowing all connections to the MUSH from a player's site.
 
"Justice System":
 
  While Shadowrun MUSH is in no way a democracy, we have in place an 
administrative staff to provide checks and balances so that no one is 
unduly or unfairly punished.  As per NEWS ADMIN STRUCTURE, you may appeal 
any decision made "up the chain" of command--but keep in mind, when doing 
so, that we talk to one another.  Rarely will any punitive action be 
taken without an agreement among admins and Directors--and players will 
_never_ be @nuked, set SLAVE, or Sitebanned without more than one 
Director's approval.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&policy harassment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY HARASSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This is a game.  This is not a place to insult, cajole, harass, or
otherwise get into arguments with *PLAYERS* or *ADMINS*. 
 
   DO NOT PESTER OR HARASS *ANYONE* WITH OOC PAGES OR COMMENTS.
 
 This is unacceptable, rude, and extremely childish.  IC roleplaying is
another thing - your character may be cruising for a bruising, but it's
OK.  Pages, OOC chatter, @mail and the like constitute communication
between players, and therefore you are harassing the PERSON.
 
  What is harassment?  Harassment is continuing to page, @mail, or 
chatter OOCly with someone who has indicated offense at your tone, 
content, or statements  after they have asked you to cease and desist.
 
 In a legal sense, what you do could be construed as harassment, and
even though there is a whole Internet between players, one could still
be charged with a criminal offence.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY ONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This MUSH has a policy of one PC per player.  
 
If you are caught running a second PC, you will lose both characters
permanently. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&policy ownership
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS POLICY OWNERSHIP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
All code and buildings created on Shadowrun MUSH are the property of
Shadowrun MUSH as a whole unless such ownership conflicts with other
existing copyrights or trademarks (such as in the case of FASA). 
 
Code may *NOT* be removed from this MUSH once it has been created or
ported here, EVEN BY ITS CREATOR.  Once you make a piece of code or build
a building for Shadowrun MUSH, the MUSH is now the owner of the version of
that building and/or code. 
 
What this basically means is that if you decide to leave Shadowrun MUSH
for whatever reason, the code that you have created for the MUSH may not
be deleted, dested, or removed.  It becomes the MUSH's property. 
 
We make no claims on other versions of your code or buildings, and don't
really mind if you move them to other locations or MUSHes.  We are simply
concerned with the work you have done for us. 
 
We will not give permission to others to move, steal, or base their code
off of yours without your permission.  Please do not copy other people's
code or modify it without their permission.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy ooc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY OOC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadowrun MUSH has one cardinal sin:  using OOC knowledge ICly.
Don't do it.
 
OOC knowledge means, simply, out of character knowledge.  The term
refers to any information of any kind you, the player, gain, that your
character doesn't know.  Using OOC knowledge IC refers to the practice
of having your character make decisions on the basis of things that
you, the player, know about and your character does not.
 
It's impossible to forbid people to find out about things OOC, and we
don't try to.  We understand that you talk to your friends about the
game, and such.  We merely ask that you not take unfair advantage of
others.  We also feel that using OOC knowledge IC makes the game less
fun for everyone, yourself included.
 
For examples of what's not allowed, see 'news policy OOC examples'.  For
the consequences of using OOC knowledge IC, see 'news policy OOC
consequences'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&policy ooc examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY OOC EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A classic example of OOC knowledge abuse is giving an OOC friend
preferential treatment.  Let's say that your character is a netrunner
who's about to go on a good run with a big payoff, and you mention this
to a friend of yours in real life over lunch.  The friend points out
that her character will suffer if the run is successful, and asks you
to keep your character from going on it.
 
Your character should, of course, still make the run.  There's no
reason why your character, as opposed to you, should change his mind.
Hopefully your friend won't be too mad at you; you didn't really have
much choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy OOC consequences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY OOC CONSEQUENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone can accuse anyone else of using OOC knowledge IC.  We'll take all
complaints seriously.  We will not merely accept the accusation as truth;
there is no place on this MUSH for witch hunts.  We will also, since we
take the accusation seriously, be up set if it turns out to be false. 
Know that you can accuse people, but don't treat this ability lightly. 
 
If the Directors and staff find that you've used OOC knowledge IC, we'll
give you a warning.  If you do it again, we'll remove your character from
the database.  This makes nobody very happy; you don't have a character
anymore, and everyone else has to de al with someone suddenly vanishing. 
 
All in all, it's much better to talk about the possible problem with
the person you want to accuse first.  If you can resolve matters
without going to us, so much the better.  Accusations should be a last
resort.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy privacy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY PRIVACY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 As stated in the Player Start room, and on the login banner, privacy
on this system is not complete or inviolate, and will be invaded under
some circumstances.  This includes such drastic measures as reading
@mail, eavesdropping on pages, and the like.
 
 However, there is no reason for concern.  The policy about such things 
amongst the staff members is clear and resolute.  There are only four 
individuals authorized to undertake such an invasion of privacy -- the 
three Directors and Morris. There are specific circumstances which must 
occur before such an action is taken, such as a clear and present danger 
to the codebase of the MUSH, or a clear and present suspicion of OOC 
cheating, crossover, or an intent to harm, slander, or otherwise interfere 
with the operations of the MUSH or its staff. 
 
Continued in NEWS POLICY PRIVACY2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy privacy2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY PRIVACY2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Further, _any_ time such an action is taken, it must be cleared with 
the other Directors, or wizard-level staffers who are available at the 
time, so that a checks and balances system is in place to provide the 
maximal protection for a player's right to privacy which is handled 
as gently as possible. There won't be a case of one man acting alone 
in a vaccuum in any such situation, and it is only done to preserve 
the continuance of the MUSH as a viable entity, not only in code abuse 
situations but in situations where administrative harassment or OOC 
crossover is occurring and we have reason to suspect that such an action 
is warranted or would be beneficial in solveing a problem which occurs. 
 
 At no point is such a violation of privacy used for personal gain or 
out of nosiness or in any other offensive manner.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy shadowing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY SHADOWING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 'shadowed' command is a command that you create (usually upon yourself)
that 'catches' another command's input.  An example of this is creating a 
'$tt *' command on yourself, so you can spy on tabletalk.
 
THIS IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL!  Such an infraction will result in the nuking of
your character.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&policy stealing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS POLICY STEALING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  If, for *ANY* reason, your character picks up something that is NOT
yours by purchase, you *MUST* get in contact with a judge AT THAT TIME
so the judge may decide if it was In Character for you to have been
able to steal things.
 
  If you do NOT use a judge to aid in your nefarious activities, and you
get caught, you will probably meet an ignominous (bad thing, chummers!)
fate and be nuked.
 
  Some players may be familiar with MUDs, where anything not nailed down
is up for grabs.  Shadowrun MUSH is not such a place.  Often, items which
are left lying about or rooms which are unlocked are that way because of
(perhaps) code oversights or the si mple fact that the obviousness of not
being able to steal from the place or enter it to begin with is in the
description of the room.  We rely on players to use common sense in
entering areas which are unlocked but whose descs indicate that they are
high security, we do not code "mobs" to guard everywhere.

NEWS PRIMERS TABLETOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The environment your character lives in on Shadowrun MUSH is fundamentally
different then the 'table top' version of the game.  Understanding this 
distinction and its advantages and limitations is key to an enjoyable 
and (hopefully) long life for your character.
    In a traditional 'table top' game of Shadowrun, a relatively small number
of players and a single gamemaster get together and play through a 
specific 'adventure' plot line.  Adventure plots typically have a hook 
to involve the player characters, a goal for them to achieve, and 
gamemaster controlled non-player characters (NPCs) scattered along the 
way as opponents, helpers, or even distractions for the player 
characters.  The focus of the table top game is usually to achieve the 
goal of the adventure and reap whatever rewards are available at the 
conclusion.  The amount of 'action'(usually combat) is relatively high.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS TABLETOP2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers tabletop2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The MUSH operates on a completely different scale.  There are hundreds of
player characters, and there is no full time gamemaster devoted to your 
 particular character.  In the table top game your character is one of 
relatively few 'stars' of the story, but on the MUSH your character is 
one of many, many, others who make up the game world.  Thus the focus 
of play on the MUSH is different then that of the table top game -- the 
MUSH is  geared towards roleplaying your character's life and 
interacting with the other characters (player and non-player) rather 
then attempting to provide you an on-line version of a traditional 
table top game.
 
o DON'T expect to be the 'star' on the MUSH, or to have a gamemaster waiting
  to provide you with adventures.
 
o DO expect to get a chance to do lots and lots of roleplaying.
 
There _are_ adventures and plots on the MUSH.  However, unlike the 
table top game, you will have to do the roleplaying to learn of them 
and get your character involved.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS CREATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    When making a character, consider how you're going to roleplay 
him/her/it as much as what skills or abilities the character will have. 
 As noted above, its the roleplay that will get you involved in the 
MUSH world, and not your 'Firearms 6' skill.  Try to think of a 
character who would have a reason to interact with others - roleplaying 
a hermit or other recluse is probably going to get boring very quickly. 
 Remember, not all characters on the MUSH are Shadowrunners -- think 
about what your character will do for a living and try and come up with 
something that will involve them in RP with others.  Consider joining 
an organization.  Being a member of a corp, gang, or organized crime 
syndicate is a great way to insure you have a group of other characters 
to roleplay with (and probably some plots to get involved in as well).

NEWS PRIMERS ACTIVITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Alright, you have your character and you're out on the streets of 
Seattle.  Now what?  Well, hopefully you've given your character enough 
life and background to have some goals of his or her own.  If so, think 
 about them and how to achieve them, and then go out and look for the 
people who are going to be able to help you reach those goals.  Go to 
places your character would realistically hang out and meet people.
    Remember, this isn't the table top game, so any other characters 
you meet will probably have their own agenda, or at least a purpose of 
their own besides being there to entertain you.  Don't expect other 
characters to offer you assistance or jobs, or even talk freely with 
your character if they're strangers.  Making contacts and friends takes 
some time and effort, and in most circles, attitude is as important as 
ability.  If you make yourself seem valuable, useful, and/or 
interesting to someone, they will probably give you a lot more 
attention then if you just pester them or ask for favors.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS ACTIVITIES2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers activities2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Keep in mind the Shadowrun setting and the nature of the MUSH 
environment when you do find something to do.  Characters you meet are 
not always there to advance _your_ part of the story.  Player and 
non-player characters may deliberately (or even accidently) mislead 
your character.  Don't do something just because it sounds like your 
character is 'supposed' to take that action to advance a plot.  Be 
cautious, investigate the possibility and consider the consequences.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers judging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS JUDGING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Eventually you're bound to encounter a situation where you need a 
gamemaster to apply the game mechanics.  The first thing to do is think 
about it and see if its something you can resolve among the 
participants without a staff judge.  If everyone agrees to a particular 
outcome (like Diane manages to lift the credstick from Trollface 
without him noticing), then you can proceed with your roleplaying 
without interruption.  If its something that you can't handle amongst 
the players in a reasonable way (like combat, or breaking into a locked 
room), then you'll need a staff member to act as a judge.  Use the 
+judge command to ask for assistance and be sure to include a short, 
concise reason for your request (see +help judge).
    Judged scenes (especially combat) often take a relatively long time 
to resolve.  Give the judge a brief explanation of the situating, then 
be  patient and wait for the judge to ask what you're doing.  Be as 
concise as you can about your actions when you explain them - "I shoot 
Bob." isn't  enough information in most cases, and the judge will have 
to ask you to  clarify.  Something along the lines of "I am firing two 
shots at Bob from my Ares Predator.  I'll put 3 combat pool dice into 
each shot." will help move the scene along alot faster.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS JUDGING2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&primers judging2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One special note about judged combat: Keep in mind that your character
is not necessarily the 'star' of the MUSH population, and that the outcome
of a judged scene applies whether it went the way you wanted or not. 
Think carefully about the possible consequences before you take some
action that requires a judge.  Life on the MUSH is not 'fair', and it is
not slanted towards the player characters to the same extent it is in the
table top game.  No matter how skilled your character may be, or how
lethal, there is always someone better out there.  If you're willing to
accept a short life span for your character, then go ahead and rush into
combat.  If you prefer a little more longevity, then do what people do in
real life: Avoid combat whenever possible, and if forced to fight, do
everything you can before, during, and after the fight to increase your
odds of survival. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers improving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS IMPROVING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Since actual 'adventures' are much less common on the MUSH, the 
most common way to improve your character is via your roleplay.  Not 
only does roleplaying with other characters build up your contacts and 
get you involved in plots, it can also garner you advancements in 
money, equipment, fame, or other areas not specifically related to the 
Shadowrun game mechanics.  There are also several ways you can earn 
karma for your roleplaying: Being nominated as a good roleplayer by 
your fellow players, being monitored by a judge during exceptional 
roleplaying, or even sending in logs of great roleplaying scenes.
    Nominations are done with the +nom command (see help +nom).  If 
your character is someone who meets and mingles with lots of other 
characters and you're able to impress them with your roleplaying then 
you can earn some karma from then.  Note that the use of +noms is 
monitored by staff, so think twice if you're tempted to abuse the +nom 
system to get free karma.

&primers improving2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With a few hundred diverse characters interacting on the MUSH, the 
staff members will occasionally eavesdrop on the characters to keep 
track of what the heck is going on out there (If you're concerned about 
being eavesdropped on for OOC reasons, see +help eavesdrop for a way to 
 check).  If a staff member witnesses some quality roleplaying, they 
may (at their discretion) reward it with a point or two of karma.
    Since the staff members can't be everywhere at once, you may want 
to make a log of particularly good scenes to send to the roleplaying 
alias. If you feel some of the participants deserved karma for the 
scene, @mail the log to the roleplaying alias along with the a 
description of the context and why you feel the person(s) deserve a 
karma reward.  This won't always result in a karma reward, but it's a 
good way to bring exceptional roleplaying to the staff members' attention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS SHADOWRUNNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following are a few specific tips for those of you who want to 
try to run the shadows of Seattle:
    Getting a run is a skill in itself.  To start with, you're going to 
have to do some leg work, roleplaying with other characters to find out 
who does the hiring and making yourself known to them.  Fixers, 
corporate 'troubleshooters', and organized crime members are the most 
likely sources of employment.  Try to be subtle and professional, and 
don't expect them to offer you the big jobs (or any job for that 
matter) right away.  Although it is possible to page an on-duty judge 
with a request for a simple run (be prepared to except a 'no' if and 
when you do this, as the judges are usually quite busy), it will pay 
off much more in the long run to build up a network of contacts and a 
reputation as a professional who can get the job done.  Remember, even 
the best runners will rarely get more than one or two runs a month, so 
don't expect to have a job awaiting you each time you log on.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS SHADOWRUNNING2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers shadowrunning2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Organization is the key to a successful run.  Keep your team small 
and try to have all the 'bases' covered (magic, matrix, and mundane).  
Check out the situation carefully before you decide how to tackle the 
job -- scan the matrix, check with contacts, and/or make an astral 
recon of the target.  Once you've gotten as much information as you can 
get on the target, make a plan of action.  Although shooting everyone 
in sight may let you accomplish your goal for the run, it's the runners 
that can pull off a run _without_ firing a shot that attract the big 
league employers.  Don't walk into a run loaded down with LMGs, avoid 
unnecessary killing, and don't stop to loot -- these will only earn you 
a reputation as a gutter-punk and wanna-be runner.  If you do find 
yourself in combat, end it as quickly as decisively as possible and get 
away from the scene before the authorities show up.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS SHADOWRUNNING3...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers shadowrunning3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After the run's finished, your best bet is to hide out for a while 
and, more importantly, keep your mouth shut.  Don't tell anyone what 
you did for any reason.  It may be fun to brag, but doing so is asking 
for trouble.  When word gets back to your latest 'victim' about who 
burned them, you can be sure they will be happy to come make an example 
out of you.

NEWS PRIMERS INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Those of you who have been a part of the mailing list (see news 
internet) for a while may remember something called the "Serrin's Streets 
RP Primer" which I mailed to the list some time ago.  It was a pretty 
good piece of work, judging from the commentary I got back on it, and now 
that the MUSH--and I--have both grown a lot since then, I felt that it 
might be more useful to have the Primers available as online news files.
  What is this huge series of files?  In its most basic form, it is a 
collection of observations that I have gleaned over the past 13 years 
I've been playing roleplaying games (the last five or so, concentrating 
on the SR genre).  It's a smattering of what I consider do's and don'ts, 
a loose guideline as to how to play a variety of characters in a variety 
of situations.  It is not "rules", it is not "dictation", and I would 
not go so far as to even call it "wisdom"--that is for you to decide. I 
will say that the players whom I have, as a judge, given out the most 
karma to are those who tend to follow these guidelines when they are playing.
  Read on, and I hope you enjoy it.

NEWS PRIMERS STYLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  R. Talsorian's _Cyberpunk_ game has a lot of problems IMHO, but, one of 
the things they include in their maxims for the game is the simple 
phrase, "STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE".  I feel that this basically captures a 
great deal of the outward essence of the Cyberpunk/Shadowrun genre.  In 
this world, appearance means a lot.  I don't mean just being beautiful.  
I mean, basically, your entire _PRESENCE_ can make or break a situation.  
Whether or not you can back up what you say or act like means little 
compared to the fact that you _LOOK_ like you can. Nowhere is this more 
present than in the standard Mr. Johnson in the ShadowRun realm.  In a 
recent adventure, after it was all over, I had the real Mr. Johnson show 
up to meet the runners, who had before that time been dealing through a 
fixer.  His name was Lars. Where the players had felt free to 
argue, discuss, and bicker terms with the fixer, when Lars cut them 
down with a mere glance, they shut up and sat down.  He wasn't nothin' 
but a normal guy who worked for a corp, but he exuded power like it was 
nobody's business, and I did my best to portray that style in his speech 
and mannerisms.  The same thing applies to your character, too.

  Some of the best characters I've had the pleasure of seeing played or 
role-played are those whose style is innocuous, and they can convince you 
of that with a great deal of ease.  To be frank, this is a refreshing 
change from the standard "I-eat-people-like-you-for-breakfast" attitude.  
That latter attitude has gotten, and still gets, people killed.  A lot of 
people like to believe that, just because they think they've all gone 
through the same chargen, they can get away with this sort of brass-balls 
attitude because they figure their opponent is on the same level.  Just 
ain't true.  Some characters, both PC as well as NPC, are more powerful 
than you, and you can't see their character sheets, chummer.  The 
characters that are innocuous (and some are even what they appear to be) 
are fun to play with.  Walking into a room filled with attitude isn't as 
fun as RPing with a college student at UWash, or a nurse at Seattle 
General, sometimes.

  By the same token, attitude and style also mean a sense of timing, 
tact, and location.  Timing means, the REAL non-posers don't have to 
always be in your face about it.  They're not cocky and they're not 
easily upset--they're cool.  The posers tend to be the ones who feel they 
have something to prove, and will try to provoke you all the time.    
Tact means the decision as to when to judiciously apply your presence.  
Intimidating people like a Mr. Johnson isn't something you should do 
right off the bat.  This ties in with location.  All of those of you who 
pose outrageously in Silhouettes--think about where you ARE.  This is not 
only the poshest, hippest nightspot in town, it's also a major 
shadowrunner/corporator meeting place.  And if you walk in there wearing 
a pair of torn jeans, and a lousy t-shirt, you'll get thrown out.  If you're
well dressed and come off with an attitude in a place where the Mr. Johnsons 
frequent, you'll wind up not getting hired.  You never know who it is you 
might need to impress.

  As I mentioned earlier, "style" does not mean that you are beautiful.  
One of my biggest pet peeves in the game is that characters tend to be 
described as perfectly as possible.  They move fluidly, they have large 
breasts, or huge muscles, they're sexy, enticing, alluring, handsome,
what-have-you.  This is fine to a degree, but it gets old after a while.  
Even worse, in my opinion, are the players who don't play their Charisma 
or social skills worth a damn.  The Charisma statistic might not directly 
be interpretable as physical beauty--I believe it is about a half and 
half mix, actually--but that argument washes thin when I see beautiful 
people with 2 Charismas who justify themselves by saying Charisma is not 
appearance doing their best to appear seductive, witty, amusing, and 
possessed of all the social graces for whatever situation they are in.
  Further, social skills _are_ important, though there is no really 
simple way to integrate them into PC-PC interaction.  If a player tells 
you, "I have X skill, and am trying to get you to think Y", or somesuch 
like that, give them the benefit of the doubt.  There's an interesting 
dichotomy here.  On the one hand, we don't want to see people thinking 
that if they have Negotiation 6, they can sell shoes to a snake with no 
roleplaying skill whatsoever; but on the other hand, having bought that 
skill SHOULD mean something, especially if the player's "opponent" in the 
social situation is resisting all attempts to simply roleplay it out.  
Try to work things out ICly with the person you are dealing with, and if 
you feel you need to use a skill, talk to the player first, then call a 
judge.

&primers nuances

NEWS PRIMERS NUANCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It's the little things that bring a character to life. Blink sometimes. 
Sneeze.  Smile.  Talk too loud intentionally at your table as a player but
not as a character, and let some TINY TIDBIT slip. Eat food sometimes. 
Step off to the bathroom.  Take showers.  Walk around the city, don't type
home all the time (NOTE: Typing 'home' is BLATANTLY OOC.  You just should
NOT use this command except in case of emergency.) Don't spend all your
time in bars, go out and do things that normal people do.  Visit a pizza
shop instead of a posh restaurant for a few slices. When you take the cab,
don't assume just because it's coded to be instantaneous, it is
instantaneous to drive across downtown Seattle. 
  Get drunk.  Get unruly.  Babble sometimes.  Cry, laugh, emote.  Be a
racist.  Make ribald comments to members of the opposite sex that are
cute.  Interact and comment on the "assumed NPCs".  Some of the best RPing
I've seen has been around NPCs that "aren't there".  The players are free
to (as long as they keep things in character and inform roleplaying of any
MAJOR occurances they do) roleplay Joe Clubber or Bob Pedestrian or Jane
Nurse, as much as they want.  Use these things to add color to the world
and your character.  Have your character's boy/girlfriend or
employer/employee get an email or phone call from an NPC in your
background that the Judges don't play accusing him or her of having some
venereal disease, warning him or her away from you because you are a
philanderer, starting an argument, or something like that.  ADD COLOR TO
YOURSELF AND THE WORLD THIS WAY! You can only enhance the universe and
your own character if you do this well.

  Another point that should be addressed as far as nuances are concerned 
is spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  It's a common point on the 
Internet that most people should be able to convey their ideas well via 
writing--the medium is entirely text-based, after all.  I know that there 
are those of you out there who cannot spell--some of them are on staff, 
and they're good staffers--but for your OWN sake and the sake of the 
RPers out there who (like me) sometimes can't stand to RP with someone 
who doesn't capitalize or punctuate, who says everything like this: "i 
went to aztechnology and killed the dragon and got the cool stuff 
chummer", put some time into learning how to convey yourself properly.  
Your experience here will be all the better for it.

&primers information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  This simple phrase is probably the most important one you will ever need
to remember as a player.  INFORMATION IS POWER.  Be careful who you trust,
a lot more careful than most everyone I've ever seen on the MUSH has been 
in the past.
  The situation is usually exacerbated by the perception that there is
'nothing to do'.  Characters sit in bars, and make conversation, and make
friends, and wind up confessing their entire life's history to someone
they know next to nothing about, or to someone who is telling them the
same thing.  And when something INTERESTING happens to any one of these
people, immediately they tell it to everyone else.  This can and has
gotten people killed and, as well, for the most part, those of you who play
the hardcase runner should know better than to trust people like that. 
  INFORMATION IS POWER.  This is key.  The more you know, the better off 
you are, and the power of that information and knowledge is degraded and 
diluted the more you disseminate it.  As well, information is MONEY, 
too.  You can sell something only you know to a fixer, but if everyone 
knows about it and doesn't hold it dearly, then the information is worth 
nothing.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS INFO2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers info2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is also related to OOC/IC information, the bane of any MUSH's
existance.  People that are half-informed OOCly spread it further OOCly,
and it turns into a big game of (you guessed it) telephone.  Not only
that, OOC discussions frequently cross over to IC even in the hands of the
best players who "never ever would cross over that information cross my
heart and hope to die".  One entire series of player deaths, a total of I
believe it was six, and one NPC death, once occurred as the direct result
of such a crossover--someone whose roommate was on the MUSH told them
something, OOCly, and the player inadvertantly believed that this was IC
information, which set into motion a chain of events that inexorably led
to the deaths of six PCs.  The people involved (for the most part) don't
know who they are or the truth of the matter because it's highly
embarassing situation.  But this is an example of how even the
best-intentioned players can wind up ruining a lot because of OOC
information.  People who die come out of the DPR and talk about the
circumstances of their death, even when it's supposed to be secret; people
who die do things because they might be pissed at their killers, and let
others know OOCly what happened, and this ruins tinyplots and people's
lives.  This is not only unfair, it's stupid and childish, and it can
easily ruin the game.

harmless of cases, get people killed.  And it ruins the surprise of 
finding things out ICly.
  Since I became a Director, over half of my work time has been 
consumed tracking down a lot of OOC/IC crossover crap.  There are those 
of you out there who have asked what you can do to help the MUSH become

&primers magic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS MAGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Magic is just as important to the feel of the ShadowRun Universe as the
corporations and the cyberpunk atmosphere.  Roleplaying wise, doubly so. 
One of the largest RP problems I have seen is that those players who know
the game, who play mundanes, have mundanes that toss off information about
esoteric points of magical theory or identify spells/spirits/what-have-you
as if they know it all already as well as a mage.  Magic in the ShadowRun
universe is uncommon.  Nine out of ten shadowrunners who are not mages,
even if they have worked with one or seen one in the past, know little to
nothing about the way that magic works in the slightest aside from the
thousands of publications that have been written trying to explain
it-usually inaccurately.  Yet everyone, it seems, tends to be an expert on
everything that they see, because the player knows the game system and can
come up with some way to rationalize their character understanding Magic
in all its forms in their background.  Try roleplaying that you don't
know, it can be fun. One of the best characters on the MUSH used to seek
out mages just to ask them questions about how X spell or Y spirit worked,
or what a totem was, or something along those lines, and both he and the
mage involved had a lot of fun doing it. 
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS MAGIC2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers magic2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Magic is both powerful and difficult to handle because it tends to be a 
mysterious force even to those who use it.  One of the RP things that 
makes this so is the fact that Mages are the targets for an entire WORLD of 
astral baddies that the average mundane will never see or even have to 
consider the existance of.  Have a quickened spell or a spell lock 
sometime, and become a ground for a fireball from an astral mage; or, try 
a metaplanar quest; or, try summoning a spirit in a toxic domain and see 
what you might accidentally wake up; or any one of a number of things.  
At least for mundanes, their enemies are usually definately 
comprehensible, and they tend to be (meta)human--this can not be said to 
hold true for mages.
  Mages can be any one of a number of different personality types, but for
the most part they are mysterious people who are on the same sort of
incomprehensible level personality-wise as are the cybered-out samurais
with less than 1 essence who are barely human:  so completely out of the
normal ken that they are fun and interesting to play.  Add some of this to
your mage and you will find that the players will have more fun and, by
the same token, if you are mundane, playing that you don't know everything
you the player know from reading the rules can make things a LOT more fun.

&primers tinyplots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS TINYPLOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  TinyPlots (TPs, as they are largely referred to by most veteran MUSHers 
out there) are the largest part of any MUSH's livelihood and usually the 
ultimate goal or motivator of all activity on the MUSH.  In short, a 
TinyPlot is to a MUSH what a module is to an RPG, but it's a lot 
different in its execution as well as its permutations.
  First let's take a look at TinyPlots in general.  The usual TP, no 
matter what the originator is, is founded on a basic premise:  present a 
problem or puzzle, outline the obstacles to solving it briefly, and 
that's it.  Unlike modules for RPGs, there is rarely any single solution 
provided to a problem or puzzle on a MUSH largely because the dynamic 
nature of a MUSH and the fact that a lot of the obstacles to solving your 
problem will involve PCs and NPCs and organizations, and one can never 
tell or predict how a PC or NPC will work (well, NPCs are pretty easy to 
predict, in a general sense, when you run them--but there's no telling 
what methods the players might use to solve things that might cause the 
NPC to do other things than your carefully-laid plans.) Almost every TP 
that I have seen follows this basic format, regardless of its origins.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS TP2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers tp2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Now, on to the different types of TPs and how to integrate them into the
ShadowRun MUSH genre best, or how to get involved with them.  First we'll
take player TPs.  Player TinyPlots are _not_ TP ideas suggested to an
admin, which eventually become admin-run TPs (discussed later), but
rather, TPs revolving around the players themselves.  Examples include,
but are not limited to:  Your PC's approved background contains a mentor
who beat him or her up at one point, and you want to seek him out; your PC
is part of the Mafia and you want to find out more about your enemies the
Yakuza; your cat is lost and you miss it; you want to be initiated into a
gang; you've just discovered that your lover works for the corporation
that killed your parents.  These don't even really require admin
intervention or GM intervention for the most part, unless of course they
involve NPCs that the GMs need to run or create for the plot (the mentor
is one example), or an object that needs to be hidden even from you (your
missing cat). So if you want to run these things, be my guest.  
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS TP3...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers tp3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The purpose of the organizations on the MUSH is to do just this (cf. the
above item about the Mafia and the Yakuza), they are funded so that they
can provide cash to purchase the temporary assets (read: shadowrunners) to
discover this sort of thing or to buy the information they need, or the
equipment they might need, to effect these tinyplots.  When you do,
however, run a complex tinyplot that might affect some large organization
or business or something fundamental outside of yourself and a few other
PCs, that's when you should contact a Plot RPAdmin who can tell you
whether or not the idea is feasible based on the information these admins
have collected on a lot of other tinyplots.  They coordinate things that
way. Player TinyPlots are key to the MUSH.  One complaint that we get a
lot is the lack of karma for roleplaying.  Personally, I've got no
objections when a player @mails me or pages me (POLITELY) saying, "I just
did X and Y and Z, and this other guy/gal figured out Z and AA, so I would
like to submit a request for a karma award if you feel it warrants it." 
That's the proper way to go about it.  The improper way to go about it is,
"I did this and I should get karma!  Why don't we get karma?  This
sucks!".  And you shouldn't make plots just to get karma, nor should you
totally go overboard with karma requests based on every little thing--if
it's significant, and you can objectively say that you think it might
warrant karma in a reasonable shadowrun game, then suggest that a karma
award is warranted. 
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS TP4...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers tp4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A little side note: NEVER EVER BUG A JUDGE AFTER A SCENE ABOUT KARMA 
AWARDS.  We know all about karma.  We will award it as neccessary.  Of 
the 30 or so times I've judged a scene and had players page me, "Will we 
get karma for this?" or "When will you award karma?", only ONCE was it 
warranted insofar as I had forgotten, the other 29 times, either no karma 
was awarded or I was too busy with the denoument of the scene and was 
planning on awarding karma later.  If a few days pass after a scene and 
you still haven't gotten any karma, a polite reminder is appropriate.  
Other than that, though, please--don't disturb the judges.
  Admin TinyPlots.  There are people who have said that these are not
neccessary, which makes me laugh slightly.  Why do we have them? Because
no one usually wants to play the villain, or the bad guy. Admin tinyplots
are usually MUSH-wide, and they are usually open to anyone who is keeping
their eyes open and is in a certain place at a certain time, or takes it
upon themselves to investigate things.  The plot hooks are out there, and
many is the time I have worked with various organizational PCs to get them
to start a TP, or fed information out over streetwise channel or
***Network 23*** or Shadowland that relates to a TP, or fed info to a
fixer.  Watch these sources, and more.  There's a lot of CRAP out there
information-wise--if there weren't, the plots would be obvious--but by the
same token, you can find plot hints just about everywhere if you look hard
enough.  And sometimes we take people's backgrounds and play with
something from in there until it's a TP.  How do you get involved in one
of these TPs, you might ask?  Get involved with the MUSH and its PCs and
eventually you will brush up against one of these things.  Stay in
character and impress people, and you will be noticed--and I don't mean
totally go out of your way to impress them, but impress them by being a
good character.  The more you RP and the more your RPing enhances and
spurs other people to react and RP with you, the greater your odds of
being "in on things" when their characters get involved in a TP thread.

   MegaPlots are not-so-tiny tinyplots.  Things like this include the 
ongoing Mafia-Yakuza rivalry, the Barrens Race Riots, and those 
PERSISTING rumors that the Ancients are tied to the Tir.  Not 
specifically involving an attainable goal, or at least an easily 
attainable one, these are plots that provide roleplaying opportunities in 
an environment reacting to a situation.  Anyone can at any time get 
involved in things like this depending on the character and, while 
they're not usually karma-heavy, they're usually a lot of fun to be in.  
And they can certainly be karma-heavy at the end.  Let's say there's a 
coordinated effort by a corporate PC or even a shadowrunner to bring 
Shiawase Corporation down to AA status from AAA megacorporate status.  
God knows this will take forever, if it's at all attainable, and is a 
MegaPlot.  It will probably have as its components several partial 
tinyplots included in it.  Take the ongoing rivalry between Ares 
Macrotech's Knight Errant and Lone Star corporation for the contract for 
Seattle.  Those of you who have been around forever have seen bits and 
pieces of this in the news (and there's a lot that's not in the news, 
chummers).  This is an ongoing MegaPlot.  There have been (and will be) 
many plots based around the political situation, damaging Lone Star by KE 
or LS damaging KE, and everything else.  The obstacles are myriad, and 
the goal is clear, and who knows if it's ever attainable?  It all depends 
on what happens, now, doesn't it?
  These are my examples of the way that TinyPlots work, and at least how 
I've seen them work on ShadowRun MUSH.  There's a lot out there--if you 
know how to look, and, if you can't find it--do it yourself!

NEWS PRIMERS DEATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Death.  In ShadowRun, or, in fact, in most RPGs, it's a fact of life.  
Sooner or later, every character will meet their doom, some in more 
grisly ways than others.  Some die in a blaze of glory (Kash's little 
bike sacrifice?), some die with a big splash (John's drug-crazed assault, 
while blind, on the Alabaster Maiden) and some die stupidly (Kash's 
little bike sacrifice? :)), but, regardless of who you are, you stand a 
very real chance of dying in this world.
  How to avoid it is pretty hard to quantify.  Just about everything in 
this Primer is intended to give you tips on how to play a character that 
won't be so easy to kill, all the time, but this is probably the closest 
I can come to tips on how to avoid such a fate directly.
  FIRST: DON'T GO UNPREPARED TO CERTAIN PLACES. 
   If you're an elf or a human, going to certain parts of the Ork 
Underground is taking your life in your own hands.  If you're an Ork or a 
Troll, getting harassed by the cops in DownTown can be a fact of life.  
Think of the blacks in southern U.S. during the 50's and 60's for a 
comparison.  Don't walk into Sylvan Shadows and curse out elves.  By the 
same token, social strata are very real, and the Barrens is not a fun 
place for well-dressed people.  At all.  Even if that tuxedo is armored.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS DEATH2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers death2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SECOND: AVOID COMBAT. 
  Combat is not something that should be sought out as the solution to all
your problems.  Of course, there are some characters whose lives revolve
around the brutal facts of life and death (gangers for one), but, for the
most part, you are safer all the time if you can negotiate your way out of
situations.  Sometimes, attitude is all it takes.  Other times, you have
to remember (unless you're a Yakuza :) ) that your life is PROBABLY more
valuable to you than your pride.  Someone once mentioned that Halo Jones
defused a volatile situation with five Hell Hounds with nothing but
herself and a single friend.  This was attitude.  Other times she's been
near dying if she said the wrong word to a certain Yakuza member.  This
was sacrificing pride for a greater goal. 
  THIRD: BE CONVINCED OF YOUR OWN MORTALITY.
  Powergaming is worth a lot maybe in the minds of number crunchers.  But 
I've seen the best go down to the worst.  I've seen characters who have 
been amped get taken down by people right out of chargen.  Even when you 
have the chrome and the skill, that doesn't mean you're immortal or 
invincible.  Numbers frequently lie, and you never know what your 
opponent is capable of.  And people so frequently underestimate their 
opponents and act like they're King Doodie, it's not funny.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS DEATH3...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers death3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FOURTH: BE PREPARED.
  Never fight your enemies' battle.  Force him (or her) to fight your 
battle.  Ninety percent of combats are won not by stats, but by planning 
and superior strategy.  Pick your battlefield.  Piss off your opponent so 
they aren't thinking straight.  Use your abilities to your best 
advantage, and put them at a disadvantage.
  FIFTH:  CONSIDER YOUR VENUE CAREFULLY.
  A combat once occured--RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE AZTECHNOLOGY PYRAMID.  How
STUPID was this?  No matter WHAT my reasons for fighting were, if it were
ANY of my characters--INCLUDING Dunkelzahn himself--I would have RUN
rather than fight in such a STUPID place.  Even if I win I'm probably dead
meat.  The Downtown area is not the best place (though there are places
that you could go there to fight) to get into a scuffle. People seem to 
like taking their fights outside of Silhouettes, not realizing that 
Alaskan Way IS a AAA-priority law enforcement zone. Lone Star is
everywhere.  The Barrens is not the best place to get into a scuffle. 
Gangs are everywhere, and most of the pedestrians are armed--no telling
what they'll do.  Ask the Judge for all the details of what you see before
you consider pulling a gun.  Use those street etiquette rolls to get a
basic clue about your area (if you have that skill) and what the
permutations of fighting in it might just be, if you can't deduce these
yourself.

NEWS PRIMERS STREETS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  One of the most prevalent mistakes present in the players I've seen on 
ShadowRun MUSH (and perhaps one of the most easy to make) is the lack of 
attention to setting and the logical extensions thereof to your 
roleplaying.  By this I mean being unaware of where, exactly, you are, 
even if it's not described in the @desc or noted on the BBoard or in a 
handy OOC poster that tells you how to act or what's going on.  A lot of 
things that should be common sense aren't (further going to prove the old 
maxim that "common sense is rarely either.")
  Two examples of this glare out at me.  First one is what occurs in my 
own nightclub creation, Silhouettes.  The @succ for the door says, "You 
pass the troll bouncer's inspecting gaze and are waved into the club."  
This is to simulate not a search for weapons, but a fashion check.  If 
you look at the exit (look SI from Pier 42--all exits have descriptions, 
by the way; if they don't, that is a building error and should be 
reported), you will note it describes a line of people waiting to get 
in.  I don't suppose it's quite fair of me to expect that every player on 
the MUSH has been to a posh nightclub, but I am here to tell you that, in 
a place like Manhattan's Limelight or any one of a number of clubs, if 
you don't look the part, you don't get in. This is also described several 
times in relation to Dante's Inferno in the book "Nosferatu", and can be 
witnessed basically at any major nightclub.  Yet, when I tell my security 
staff to enforce this, they yell at me because the players don't listen. 
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS STREETS2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers streets2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Furthermore, as our time frees up, and we get more judges, you will find 
that your @desc means a lot more in a lot of situations.  Imagine a 
roving LS patrol down Alaskan Way sights a few squatters moving around 
with "bulges in their clothes".  What do you think is going to happen? 
HOW YOU LOOK IS IMPORTANT.  Silhouettes might be the shadowrunning 
hotspot, but it's a nightclub.  It's for the shadowrunning elite, a la 
Club Penumbra (in fact, there IS no Club Penumbra on the MUSH.  
Silhouettes was designed to replace it).  Hundreds of people 
walk in and out of there, if you're dressed like a squatter, or even if 
you're totally DRAB--if you have no FLASH--you wouldn't have been allowed 
in in the first place.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS STREETS3...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers streets3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By the same token, there are problems with RPing IN clubs like
Silhouettes.  Just the other night I was at a club in Manhattan and I
realized a lot of things happen in Silhouettes' Main Cave which are
blatantly impossible in real nightclubs' dance areas.  Same thing with the
Alabaster Maiden and every other club in the game world.  In the CLUB
areas, there are so many people, such loud music, such bright and dancing
lights that produce a visual cornucopia, that when someone walks in, odds
are, you won't notice them immediately.  And as far as HEARING them, well,
that's near impossible over the music unless they're shouting, or inside
the same SoundShield as you are.  So saying something to the whole room is
not going to be heard. The Alabaster Maiden has the balcony, if you just
want to chat, the music ain't so loud up there; Silhouettes has the
soundshielded tables and bar and the Caverns for quiet meetings.  But you
won't get noticed in the Main Cave as soon as you walk in, nor will you be
heard over the music. Now that the mutter code is in, this becomes more 
realistic--but there are times when people don't USE it, which is 
annoying.  +help places and +help mutter are two of the best RP commands 
you could use, so read them.

  Now we come to the other part of the MUSH that suffers the most abuse
and misconceptions as to how to roleplay within it, that being: The
Barrens.  For simplicity's sake on the MUSH the Barrens are both Puyallup
and Redmond and neither; while we call it Redmond, we usually just make
Redmond an amalgamam of both places.  Lone Star Enforcement Rating there
is pretty low.  What enforcement there is is sporadic at best.  The cops
have agreements with the gangers, the organized crime influences, etc.
alia. there.  Basically, if it's something less than a major war that
would disrupt other portions of the city, or unless the Mayor's on one of
his annoying let's clean the barrens up kicks, you're SOL in terms of Lone
Star getting involved. If you're not street scum or a criminal, THIS IS
PROBABLY NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR YOU TO BE.  By the same token, if you ARE
street scum or a criminal, whether or not it's a good place for you to be
depends on exactly where you ARE.  If you're a ganger in the wrong side of
town, wearing your colors on someone else's turf, be prepared to be meat. 
If you're not a ganger, and you're just out for a night at the Banshee or
at Dox's Arcade, you had best not be an agressive sort, and you'd best
learn your place in a location where the gangs rule, and not start
anything funny--or you're meat for the machine.

  Even the Mafia and Yakuza watch their asses out in the Barrens.  Why? 
Because, sure, they might have the cash to cover things and the men and
women to do it--but the Barrens runs by its own rules, and gangers might
individually be no match for your Joe Chromed Shadowrunner/Yakuza
Goon/Mafia Enforcer, but they travel IN PACKS.  And numbers can KILL
better than any chrome ever could.  Wired 2 might make you move twice
before the ten of them do, but the odds are against you ever surviving the
four you can't kill in those two actions--not to mention the heavy
resistance you'll meet when word spreads even if you DO survive. And you
know, since Lone Star doesn't mind a few busts in the area and gangs don't
have that much illegal chrome, it could be as simple as Bob Ganger making
an anonymous tip to LS about Joe Chromeboy who he figures must have some
nice little illegal chrome under that skin to get you busted in the
Barrens, presuming the gangs don't deal with you themselves. 
  What you act like means more in the Barrens than it does in Downtown.  
It can mean the difference between living and dying, for the most part.  
This isn't to say that the gangs will kill you for any imagined slight, 
but they can sure as shit beat the crap out of you for that same slight.  
Intergang politics are as labrynthine and confusing as any megacorporate 
politics ever were, and usually more bloody in the end.  If you're a 
ganger, your leaders will have been briefed on the basics concerning 
other gangs--talk to them about how to handle things. And never be stupid 
in the Barrens.

  In conclusion, I suppose the one thing that I'm saying when it comes to 
location is that there are things that are IMPLIED by the area that are 
not DESCRIBED.  We can't describe every pedestrian, every nuance of 
atmosphere, in every description.  We rely on a little creativity from 
our players to fill in things based on context.  I recall one combat that 
occurred a long time ago where three gangers chased another ganger out of 
Live 'Till Dusk and through contested turf territory (LTD is primarily a 
border-turf area).  The gangers chased the guy and shot at him through a 
crowd, and one of them hit a pedestrian.  Two pedestrians opened up with 
weapons of their own, and a third one wasn't taking no shit from the 
human ganger who told him to keep his head down or die (this one was a 
large Ork shadowrunner) and HE opened up on the three gangers.   I didn't 
get any complaints for this judge call, but just to let you know--this is 
what might happen.  And sometimes with less than what you might consider 
warning.
  STAY ALERT--TRUST NO ONE--KEEP YOUR WEAPON HANDY (thank you, Paranoia!).

NEWS PRIMERS RESPECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  Some characters on the MUSH are, or at least should be, considered 
larger-than-life.  One unfortunate RP trend that I see happening all the 
time is that the players refuse to treat the organizations and 
corporations around them with the respect due to them, which is always a 
no-no.  A recent example involves the Mafia.  One player felt that he was 
tough enough to get away with acting as a maverick within Mafia 
territory.  He had the presence of mind and the good RP skill to change 
his identity entirely, but even this can turn out wrong--as it did--when 
magic proved to be his undoing.  When the Mafia caught up to him months 
later and interrogated him, there was not a whit of respect nor obiesance 
in the character's demeanor, no apologies, or anything of the sort.  He 
felt that with two grenades in his pocket he could stare down the Don of 
the Mafia and get away with, well, just about anything he wanted.  This 
was a poor tactic and resulted in his death, although I knew beforehand 
that the Mafia players really didn't want to have to kill him, they just 
wanted the respect due to them.  They didn't--they got a threat 
instead--and he died.

  When you are caught by someone bigger than you, when you have an 
organization on your back who knows what you have done, the answer is 
probably not to fight.  It just doesn't work out, most of the time.  
Running and hiding is one option (but you had better be very good at 
it).  Another option is to make reparations to the organization you have 
offended.  Making contacts in the Mafia, Yakuza, Triads, et. alia. is 
always a good idea; paying these individuals respect is something that 
will go a long way towards ensuring your survival, and God forbid you 
should piss them off, apologize immediately and offer reparations if you 
can.  Such a resolution is, nine times out of ten, not only possible but 
desireable, even if most players don't seem to get the idea that 
sometimes it's okay to acknowledge that you are not the coolest person in 
the world, and there are people out there tougher than you are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The same thing applies (although in a less deadly sense, for the most 
part) to the corporations.  A little schmoozing with, say, the PR head of 
a corp (provided you can), or a reporter, working to make a contact, even 
dealing with people whom your character really doesn't personally like, 
can prove extremely rewarding to you in terms of future payoffs and RP 
opportunities.  I've found that some players tend to be very lazy.  They 
don't want to work for their friends, they don't want to really RP 
anything hard, they want the administration to toss TPs in their laps and 
they want PCs around them to just spill everything about themselves or it 
isn't worth it to them to pursue that friendship or relationship.  Such a 
thing is a sad way to RP, in my opinion.  There's no challenge in it and 
it ruins the texture of the game.  The most successful RPers on the MUSH 
work to make friends of enemies, don't reveal too much about themselves, 
and as a general rule, tend to work really hard to develop their 
characters' personalities.

  Another element here is that there are some people whom you should make
a bigger stink over.  When the Mayor enters your location--treat him with
respect.  When a simsense star sits at your table, display the appropriate
amount of awe.  If a Great Western Dragon hangs out at your bar, keep in
mind just who you are dealing with.  Other characters (names reserved for
anonymity's sake :)) are the hottest shadowrunners on the MUSH with the
reputations to prove it.  Act that way around them.  I'm not going to say
that people should immediately kiss these characters' butts or go out of
your way to court their favor, nor will I tell you exactly how to
react--beyond saying, AT ALL TIMES, keep in mind exactly who it is you're
dealing with.  These people are news, they are powerful individuals
(ESPECIALLY when you see, say, Samantha Villiers out for a night on the
town). Talk to them as such, and if you can have them as friends--more
power to you. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers backgrounds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS PRIMERS BACKGROUNDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  One of the key elements to any character is the background you put in 
after character creation.  Often, people ask us as Admins for certain 
perks based on their backgrounds, and attempt to write themselves into 
powerful positions, cyberware, et. alia.  While we applaud the initiative 
and do indeed occasionally award such perks, for the most part, the 
information you read as a guest and in other news files is indeed 
accurate:  this MUSH is largely centered around the concept/idea of 
beginning characters in their respective fields.  Just because you write 
nicely and manage to fit every piece of bioware and cyberware into your 
background doesn't mean you're going to get it--and no, you cannot be a 
Dragon.
  Tips on good backgrounds:  First, try to have at least one living
relative who you like, preferably several, or don't mention them at all. 
The number ONE pet peeve of the RPAdmins is the background that goes as
follows:  "My (sibling/parent/family pet) worked for (Organized Crime
Group/Corporation/Shadowrunning Team/Terrorist Ballet Squad) when
(Don/Oyabun/CEO/Prima Ballerina) decided that (parent/sibling/pet)
was a (liability/traitor/racist pig/poor dresser) and killed them (with a
rusty butter knife/with lots of APDS ammunition/by drowning them in Cheez
Whiz).  I intend to hunt them down and KILL THEM
ALL!!!!MUAHAHAHAAHAHA!!!!".  This background or variations on the revenge
theme are so incredibly common that they're boring and are almost always
rejected. 
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS BACKGROUNDS2...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers backgrounds2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Second, don't be exmilitary or excorp without a really good story. 
Vying for the number ONE pet peeve background is the one that goes, "I
werked for (AAA megacorp/Street Doc/Stuffer Shack) for a few yearz as
sekurity and they gave me (Move-by-Wire System 4/Boosted Reflexes
3/Cybernetic Arm With NERPS!(tm) dispensor attachment) but I dint like
them so I left an day forgot about me, so now I got dis wiz cyberwarez but
dey want to kill me." We don't like these backgrounds because they suck.
  Third, be as defined as possible, as long as you want it to be.  Write
it in interesting forms, if you want--some good backgrounds include a
recorded confession while on the run, or a dossier completely stolen from
the Matrix by someone, or their criminal record with annotated notes. 
  Fourth, be inventive.  Create personalities for the people in your 
backgrounds, refer to them in your RP even if they never are going to 
exist as PCs or NPCs.  The more background you have, the more fun you 
will have playing here.
 
Continued in NEWS PRIMERS BACKGROUNDS3...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&primers backgrounds3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Fifth, Make us want to read it.  Try to be creative--and even if you 
don't like using a dictionary to RP with and your spelling isn't so 
great, do so with your background, at least.
  Sixth, don't be too derivative.  In other words, steer away from 
blatantly ripping off popular fiction or shadowrun fiction, or pop 
culture.  Don't try to be characters from the Shadowrun books/fiction/et. 
alia without checking with us first, and don't use names like "Case", 
"Wintermute", "Hiro Protagonist", etc.  Be original.
 
These are all tips on how to make a good background.

&rp wounds 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP WOUNDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been some concern about physical wound levels and what they mean
and what you can do while wounded at X level. This ruling is intended to
clarify wounds and the actions associated with them.
 
Deadly: This is when you take a wound that would kill you if not stabilized
by a trauma patch, vat, or a competent doctor or mage working very hard. 
At this point you are considered unconscious and unable to move. Ie, no 
phone calls, no decking, no walking around, you are where you are unless 
moved by someone else. You must be brought to a medical facility to live.
A trauma patch or first aid will sustain you until you get there. If you 
are taken out such, by another PC or group and you are caught running 
around the MUSH you will be dead. When in doubt, +judge.
AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A HOSPITALIZED LIFESTYLE (500=Y=
Per day plus doctor's fees) WHEN AT THE DEADLY WOUND LEVEL. If you don't keep
Up this kind of lifestyle, you won't heal and in fact might just die from
complications. You are effectively unconscious until you heal to SERIOUS.
 
Note: For Serious, Moderate and Light Wounds, you may or may not require
Medical attention, as noted by the rules on wounds in SR2.
 
Serious: You are conscious but hurting severely. You can move about but you 
Are very aware of the pain. You can move around, walk, talk, drive, etc, but 
doing anything other than lying still probably means you are in constant pain.
AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A HIGH LIFESTYLE (300=Y=/day) WHEN
AT THE SERIOUS WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for this kind 
of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into a DEADLY wound
level from complications.
 
Moderate: This is a medium wound. You can walk around, travel, deck, you just
do so with a moderately uncomfortable level of pain. 
AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A MIDDLE LIFESTYLE (150=Y=/day) WHEN
AT THE MODERATE WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for this kind 
of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into a SERIOUS wound
level from complications. 
 
 
Light: This is like stitches healing, black eye, scab...you can pretty much do
anything you want, with minor discomfort. 
AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A LOW LIFESTYLE (30=Y=/day) WHEN
AT THE LIGHT WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for this kind 
of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into a MODERATE
wound level from complications. 
 
Basically, with all kinds of wounds, if you don't REST, you don't get better.
Period. If you are caught schlepping all around Seattle with a SERIOUS wound,
then you will not heal until you relax and maintain the rest and medication
provided by the equivalent of a HIGH lifestyle for the proscribed period.

&rp conflicts 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP CONFLICTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conflict is to be expected at every turn of ShadowrunMUSH.  Hopefully, only
a small portion of it will need 'divine' intervention. 
 
On this MUSH, we have a number of Judges to fill the position that a
tabletop GM would provide.  Here, you will call a Judge to resolve just
about any sort of conflict you experience.  Players may not judge combats
or similar circumstances themselves.  Fo r a list of judges online, type
+staff and look for "Judge" in the positions area. 
 
Situation:
 
You are trying to shoot someone, trying to pick a lock, repair a broken
weapon, make a run on a nearby business, or even try to concoct a brand
new virus that affects only dogs, or somesuch. 
 
Q: How do I call a judge?
A: Type: +help judge.
 
Q: When should I not call a judge?
A: You shouldn't call a judge as a FIRST measure.  It should be a last ditch
   method for resolving a conflict.  First, try to resolve it with the involved
   parties (Obviously, if its picking a lock, or robbing a non-occupied hotel
   room, there is no other party involved).  Page each other, try to resolve it
   without calling a judge.  If both sides cannot agree, then call a judge, and
   then BOTH parties will have to abide by the decision.
 
*WHAT THE JUDGE SAYS GOES!*  Period.  If you do not agree with the decision,
you may write @mail (DO NOT PAGE) to the roleplaying @mail alias.

&rp equality
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP EQUALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To begin with...
       
                 ALL PLAYERS _ARE NOT_ CREATED EQUAL!
  
Sometimes, people don't think that its fair that your character has to
start from scratch where other characters are coming in with enhanced
cyber, magic or contacts. 
  
Fairness is a fallacy, in real life and in Shadowrun.  There is nothing
fair about this gaming world, so get used to it.  But, you, as our
players, do deserve some sort of justification.  So read closely, and
perhaps you'll understand why such a thing is happening.
  
Some characters are NPCs for short and long-term plots.  You WILL NOT know
the difference between an NPC and a PC.  That is for the roleplaying staff
to know.  Some of these characters might be more powerful than the mass of
the populace.  Some might be l ess powerful as well.  Some may even be
characters that CANNOT be made through standard character generation. 
  
Some characters are PC's with a background element that we particularly
like, or are of a type of character which we wish to encourage more of. 
This means that they may come into the game with some sort of 'boost'. 
This boost could take the form of cybe rware, more spells, more money,
better contacts, or even a basis in RP in the city, as if they had been
there all along.  Some PC's might even be Vampires, Free Spirits or
Dracoforms.  Anything is possible.

 NEWS RP EQUALITY2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How can I be one of these 'enhanced' characters? 
A: Depends.  If your background is truly excellent, you might receive 
   benefits (be 'amped', short for 'amplified', in our current jargon).  
   Other times, you might be approached by a staff member and asked to 
   play a certain specific type of character.  And occasionally, manna 
   from the heavens falls upon thee and you are risen above your peers in 
   a blinding flash of light to become an amped character completely 
   spontaneously.  (Well, no.  But it _could_ happen.)
 
Q: So, you're telling me that a character can come in, today, and be more
   powerful/influential than the character I've had after 6 months of hard
   work?
A: Yes.  Doesn't that happen in reality as well?  Come to grips with the fact
   that things are not always fair in your eyes, but may be in someone
   else's, or could be important for game balance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP LOOKING INTRO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The individual player has several means of "perception" available to him
or her. Some are hardcoded, others softcoded. This NEWS section is intended
to define the generally accepted definitions of what they mean, and
what they refer to.
 
Veteran roleplayers typically find that some of the most annoying and/or
frustrating mistakes and or misperceptions made by newer players stem
from these commands and information. This should help with all that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rp looking emits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP LOOKING EMITS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
"X has arrived."   "X says "blah"."   "X poses Y".   
"X mutters "test...testtest...test"." "X says something in <language>."
"X sits down at table Y."
 
All of these are *NOT* immediately noticable to other players, *ICly*.
They _usually_ are, however--but it all depends on the situation. If 
you're in a single room by yourself--that is to say, a room with NEITHER 
PC *NOR* "assumed NPCs", and it is a small enough room that you would 
notice it, you'll probably ICly see Fred walking in, talking, etcetera.
 
If, on the other hand, You are in an auditorium or a large room like the
Alabaster Maiden club floor--EVEN IF you're the only PC in the room--it 
is safe to assume that there is a large crowd of people around you, and 
even though the message "Fred has arrived." appears on your screen, that
you won't necessarily _notice_ Fred arriving. The same applies to his 
speech, mutters, etcetera--the PC has the responsibility to pose his 
position upon arriving, others in the room may or may not reply in kind,
and we trust you all to figure out what (and who) you'll see when you do
such a thing.
 
Related to this is conversing in crowded or noisy places and or through
Fuchi Soundshields or White Noise Generators. Don't be a schlep. Pay 
attention to the desc of the room you're in. If the desc says that there
ar 10,000 screaming people in a room, you CAN'T call over to someone 50 
feet away and expect that they'll hear you.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&rp looking scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP LOOKING SCAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The +scan command shows a brief listing and short-desc of all the PC 
objects in the room. It is safe to assume that the same rules as above 
apply--even though they are in the +scan, or in a look of the room, in a 
crowded room _you may not notice them_. In fact, you probably won't. Now,
the _problem_ which exists with this is that it's hard enough to find 
people to RP with much less without being able to see them in the room 
with you if you're in the same room, and we understand that, so we don't
_usually_ care. On the _other_ hand, two usual problems occur with this:
First, people tend to be more _paranoid_ about PCs than they would in a 
room without PCs in it (i.e., they'll flick on a White NOise Generator via
pose if they see a PC coming in the room, but not if there is no PCs in 
the room), and similar problems; Secondly, some PCs _thrive_ on being
"unnoticable" and "blending into the crowd and appearing nondescript" 
(this _IS_ Shadowrun after all). The judges request that you roleplay this
accordingly--balance the need for "PC T-Shirts" so you can have people to
RP with with a modicum of (virtual)-reality-awareness.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
&rp looking look
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP LOOKING LOOK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The hardcoded look command implies that you are actually passing your gaze
(usually quickly) over a person and taking in their appearance. One of the
things which we tend to find bothersome about this command is how often it
so quickly follows an arrival (when Fred has arrived. appears, everyone in
the room types a look Fred). This isn't so bad in a non-crowded (NPCwise)
room, but in a crowded room like a bar or a club, it isn't very realistic.
Most especially for people involved in a conversation with other PCs. 
Again, we know you wanna talk to other PCs and have no desire to quench 
that, but we'd appreciate it if you'd keep in mind the dichotomy.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
&rp looking pluslook
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP LOOKING PLUSLOOK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
+look
This represents a _perception test directed at a specific person or 
object_. While it is not exactly surreptitious, it _also_ is not _always_
immediately visible. The fact is, with a +look, you could be positioned 
behind a person and staring at them, etcetera. Also, you could be scoping 
out someone with a nice set of muscles/legs/breasts/etcetera etcetera; 
you could be gaping at them in fear, you could merely be checkin' em out,
etcetera. It is NOT neccessary to pat someone down. Just +looking at 
someone should rarely be a reason for a challenge; it's merely an 
assessment of another character by the acting character, visually. Those 
of you familiar with the command should keep in mind that it _is_ a coded
command; it basically performs perception tests pitting Intelligence vs.
concealability, and often will NOT reveal much information "something 
barely visible" should be a phrase you are intimately familiar with by 
now. :)
 
Often, people overreact to the use of this command; they immediately assume
it is obvious to them. We put up the emit NOT NECCESSARILY to alert the 
person being looked at, but that people might have a _chance_ to notice 
that Fred is staring at Bob. other people can notice what Bob does not. 
 
Generally, the better roleplayers will pose or @pemit the manner in which 
they are +look-ing if it is relevant. This is just good roleplaying and 
common courtesy. There was a recent situation in which a recipient of a 
+look immediately reacted as if it was a lustful stare at his groin and 
began to harass the +looker. This was very uncool, and the overreaction
underscored the lack of courtesy and roleplaying awareness of the player.

Video Link (SS, p.84):  Needed for those of you who wish to have
        cybernetic eye cameras.  Without the high-res media-level
        cyberoptic camera (read: Eyecrafters) this will only allow 
        your baseline cybereye to produce low-res, unfit for media
        video and pictures.

 NEWS RP OOC VS IC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A character is ALWAYS considered to be IC (In-Character) if they are ANYWHERE
on the MUSH, OTHER than the OOC room (+help ooc, for more info).  If you want
to explore the MUSH, do it ICly, or somehow clear it with a roleplaying admin.
Else you are considered to be In-Character and 'fair game' for whatever IC
happenings occur.

  In the modern world of 2055, a prepared citizen is a living citizen. Yes, 
this is a dangerous world and in these dangerous times, sometimes the only 
way to survive is through superior firepower.
  That's why Fichetti offers the finest in Executive Action pistols for your 
self-defense needs. Never worry about being shot in the streets again...
 
  So reads an ad for one of the most popular pistols on the market today. 
If you have a SIN and a reason for having a weapon, you do not need to go
to a fixer to obtain one. Simply @mail equiprequest with what you want and
why you want it, within reason (news rp seattle has a list of gun laws,
under news seattle permits. Don't ask for assault rifles, use common
sense. We use legality rules from the back of ShadowTech for the most
part). 
 
  You will be issued a registered weapon and a permit if your request is 
legal and nifty.

&rp player plots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RP PLAYER PLOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 First, write down your plot idea and send it to @mail roleplaying. This
allows us all to have a look at it and discuss what, if anything, might
need adjusting. Simple concepts are sometimes looked over by a lot of
people. For instance, a lot of people have sent in backgrounds in their
Character Apps looking to be people who goblinized into elves when they
were whatever age. This is a misconception. Elves did not goblinize. They
were born elves. So, naturally, any plot dealing with this point would
have to be adjusted. 
 
Next, after you've worked it out with the Roleplaying Staff, have fun! You
might send periodic updates to whomever it was that seemed to be the
controlling Admin. Also, you should definitely send any major updates
along to the Roleplaying staff so that th e right notes can be added to
the right places (we keep detailed notes on every character and their
major actions!) Based on these notes, we WILL award Karma... but you also 
have to remember to use +nom. This is your power to cite those you think 
are doing great in your plot directly.
 
 That's it. There's nothing too difficult here. The only limitations are 
on how major the effects of the plot might be allowed to be. However, if 
they do get too major, a Roleplaying Admin might jump in to moderate the 
thing and you'll still have all your involvement and see your plot run, 
anyway. It's a Win/Win situation.
 
See NEWS RP PLOT ELEMENTS for a general outline of how to write the plot
for maximum chance of acceptance.

NEWS RP PLOT ELEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Things to have in a Plot:
 
 I. Backstory (Why the plot came about)
 II. Goals of the Plot (Why do this?)
 III. Steps and Encounters (What the players must do, in what order and 
       how it relates.)
 IV. Cast of Characters (Those neccesary to the plot)
 V. Items and Objects of Importance (This includes key locations)
 
A general example of a plot:
 
I. My mother sent me to the store for Milk. 
II. a)Gallant: return a quart of milk to my mother Sister: Take the milk 
    from Gallant and give it to mother. 
III. Step One: Mom tells me to get the milk, (location: apartment)
     Step Two: Venture onto the streets for the quart of milk. (location: 
      Alaskan to Broadway and Yesler) Random Encounter 2d6 Gangers, if I am a
      metahuman, possibly Humanis members. 
     Step Three: Arrive at the Store for
      the milk (location: Grocery Store on Yesler.) How do I get the milk, 
      do I pay for it or steal it? Negotiate with the store owner.

Step Four: Return home to Alaskan with the Milk. (location: Broadway 
      and Yesler to Alaskan) Renegotiate the street, at this point, if my 
      sister has learned I was sent to get the milk, she could be waiting 
      for me.  Negotiate Sister. 
     Step Five: Return the milk to my mother, if I still possess it, if 
      my sister has taken the milk and I am still alive, I will have to 
      recover it or die at my mothers hand. 
     Step Six: Conclusion if I safely return the milk to my mother, or I 
      die trying. 
End of Plot.
 
IV. 
  Gallant: A little boy. 
  Mom: My mother, she is a housewife. The real tyranical kind, would kill 
        me if I did not return the milk quickly. She is a made member of the 
        family.
  Sister: the slitch who would kill me to get on my mothers good side. She is 
        fast, sneaky and rutheless, word is she wants to grow up and be a 
        Hitwoman for Renraku Corp. 
  Shop Owner: A clueless dolt who would do anything for money, even cheat a 
        little boy like me. He is attentive and carries a Ruger Super Warhawk, 
        with pearled handles, his real pride and joy. He spends time bragging 
        after he closes his store in Silhouettes.

&rp racism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP RACISM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about racism, and the Humanis
Policlub in particular, on this MUSH.  This should help to clarify a great
deal of misconceptions. 
 
 The Humanis Policlub is not a 'human gang' as the Ancients are an 'elven
gang'. The Policlub is very different from the Ancients. It is much more
organized is an extremely powerful organization.  It has powerful allies
(such as Alamos 20K, a large terrorist orginization, or perhaps the
Yakuza). It is not composed of a bunch of dullard racists that drink beer
all day and go and burn crosses by night. No, the Humanis Policlub is much
different than that. 
 
 First, you must realize that MOST people in Seattle are in some way
racist towards metahumans. They've all had bad experiences with meta's
and they don't forget it. Seattle is *NOT* in the politically correct 
world of today. No, most people (including all of you humans out there)
have some sort of racist tendencies in one way or another. So do high
 
(Continued in NEWS RP RACISM2)

&rp racism2

level corp executives, as well as lowly street squatters. The Humanis
Policlub is comprised of all different types of people.
 
 Think of all the contacts you could make. Think of all the powerful
backing behind the group. Think of all the power. Now, there are worries
that the same things that happened to the old Policlub members are going
to happen to the new ones. Don't worry, you don't have to act blatantly
racist towards metas.  You can just ignore them, imply derogatory remarks
every once in a while, or maybe even interact with them (as your character
realizes that they may once in a while have to speak with them). In fact,
you can almost act like everyone else. 
 
  By and large, the Humanis Policlub is more like the Christian Coalition
or the National Rifle Association of today.  These are groups that do not
hold terribly universally popular opinions--and in fact, their opinions
are reprehensible to a lot of peopl e--but they have a lot of political
clout. 
 
 Joining the Policlub could reap great RP awards as well involvement with
many TP's.  Joining the Policlub doesn't mean you have to act like Aries
(a legendary punk who hates all metas--very loudly and vociferously) or
you're an instant target. No, it means fun. :) Racism is always fun (but
only in ROLEPLAYING!!!) This is just a MUSH, and acting like a racist here
isn't going to mean you are in RL. It's just all part of the RPing
experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&rp sins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP SIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A SIN stands for: System Identification Number.
 
Most people are given one at birth.  It is analogous to a Social Security
number in modern standards.  Someplace there is a file on every person 
with a SIN.  In it is contained such information as DNA pattern, 
fingerprints, retinal scan, blood type, facial pictures at various stages 
of development, etc...  A full dossier is not uncommon.
 
Some shadowrunners don't have SIN's.  How did they lose it?  Some never 
got one, being born on the street, or into an overcrowded hospital. 
Some 'lost' theirs through serious decking, and hacking into the SIN
files, to alter or completely remove the data.  Either way, almost all
shadowrunners don't have a SIN, for one big reason.  Having a SIN means
you're traceable. 
 
If you've got a SIN and you're still currently using it, all your personal
information is stored someplace. If you do a run, and leave even a drop of 
blood, they'll know who you are, and come after you.  And, as we all know, 
getting caught is bad. OTOH, if you don't USE your real SIN for anything,
the old records are going to be less useful to the authorities.
 
But, having a SIN has its benefits too.  It means you are a full citizen of 
some country or corporation.  It means you have rights.  It means you pull 
in a legal salary.  It means you get get permits and other paperwork for 
various legal and quasi-legal technologies.  It means that you exist in the 
eyes of the system.  Those without SIN's have NO RIGHTS, and we mean 
absolutely no rights. They are less than pondscum in the eyes of the corps 
and countries, remember that.

&rp skillsofts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RP SKILLSOFTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Skillsofts are available on the MUSH for those of you who can use them. 
These 'skills on chip' are useful through a Chipjack (or other
cyber/bioware which allows you to use skillsofts).  Keep in mind that you
must have Skillwires to use Active skillsofts.  Rules for them are in the
SR II guide, as are costs. Mostly, they are legally available to anyone,
but it depends on the skill involved. See your local fixer for details, or
@mail equiprequest if you think it's easy to get the chip legally.

&rp tinyplots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP TINYPLOTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  A 'TinyPlot' is analogous to the modules and adventures we all know
from playing Shaowrun with our buddies.  Basically, they are a series of
events that give the characters something to do and justifies why you
spend hour upon hour on the MUSH. =)
 
  TinyPlots come from two sources.  The first source is our RP Staff, the
other is from you, the player. (See NEWS RP PLAYER PLOTS.)
 
  Our staff spends many fevered, demented hours locked up in isolation
cells, not being allowed to leave until they come up with something good
for the players, but unfortunately, we only have so much Thorazine and
straightjackets to go around... while the diseased minds of the RPStaff
are fairly prolific, they can't always keep up with the demand.
 
Continued in NEWS RP TINYPLOTS2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rp tinyplots2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RP TINYPLOTS2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  This is where,  you, the player, can add to the mayhem!  One of the
easiest is to set your PC up as a bad guy when you set your background.
Another is to send @mail with TinyPlot ideas to roleplaying, but make
sure they're well worked out - while 'I'd like to see something with
the Orc Underground' may express your feelings, it doesn't really help
the process along much.
 
  PCs can run TP's as well!  The only times you will need to involve
Admins are:
        1) You need an NPC - only Admins can run NPC's.
        2) You want karma for it.  If you do a really wizbang job of
           coming up with an intelligent TP that fits into the SR theme,
           karma is a possibility, but only if an Admin has been
           kept up to speed during the entire TP.
        3) You want to integrate it with the other TP's that are 
           going on - this is what the Plot Admins help with.

  It has been pointed out that we are similar to a tabletop RPG, but not
quite the same.  Whe admins are here to coordinate all the things that
are happening, provide motivation and some direction, reward proper RP,
and keep things running smoothly behind the scenes.
 
  We have PC corporate heads, underworld leaders, entertainers, bar
owners, fixers, yaks, mafioso, gangers, and runners.  Mix this with
some motivation, and we've got a good mix for adventure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES DEATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A PC dying while offline has *always* been possible. It is not a new thing
at all. It is very rarely allowed, but it can happen. As Jason once said,
approximately, "Once you are in Seattle, you are IC, period." That means 
you are potentially vulnerable at all times. 
 
That said, we are not going to start allowing everyone who wants to kill 
someone to do it when the PC is offline. It is a rare event, simply because
it is extremely hard to determine just where a PC is ICly when offline and
what they are doing. In *very* rare circumstances, when it is unarguable as
to where the PC is and what the result of the agressor's actions will be,
we will allow it, but only after *very* careful consideration of possible
outcomes. Just because someone is logged off in a certain locale doesn't 
mean that ICly they stay there the whole time they are offline, and we 
recognize that. No one is so predictable that we can assume anything. We 
as Judges must be unshakably sure of all factors before we decide to go 
through with it, and you as PCs have to trust that it's not going to happen
often at all and that we do our best to be fair and reasonable. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules player killing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES PLAYER KILLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
In response to several complaints to Roleplaying regarding the questionable
motives behind certain Pkillings, the RP staff have gotten together to 
discuss possible ways to track these unfortunate events. As a disclaimer,
RPStaff does not condone PKilling in any way, and more often than not, 
frowns upon it--This being said, we realize that there are some situations
where PKilling is unavoidable if responding to a scenario in an IC manner.
 
So, this in mind, we require that at any time the death of a PC is ordered,
requested, or discussed (with intent to carry out), a request be filed via
a @mail to Roleplaying, outlining the scenario and reasons behind the Pkill
of the PC. Org members may file the request with their Org Admins. If there
are any problems with the request, an admin will get in touch with you to
discuss the facts governing the scenario. Please keep in mind that this 
policy is, in effect, a protection for ALL players--and that you just may 
be the target of an unfair or unreasonable bounty that could be avoided via
a policy such as this one.

&rules bodyguards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES BODYGUARDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PCs may have other PCs as bodyguards, even when these PCs are offline.

These PCs ***MUST*** arrange with a GM to note the character who is being
bodyguarded with a LIST of SPECIFIC actions they would take if they are 
with the protected person and they are offline.
 
THESE PCS MAY NOT BE ROLEPLAYED BY THE PERSON THEY ARE BODYGUARDING WHILE
OFFLINE, PERIOD. Save for minimal "They follow me into the room and look
 around" or whatever.
 
The RPstaff MAY at its discretion issue objects to represent such 
bodyguards in a room. This is wholly at our discretion.
 
NOTE: EVERYONE MUST SLEEP SOMETIME! You can't have a bodyguard PC with 
you 24/7 unless you are sleeping with them, too.
 
PC BODYGUARDS WHO DIE WHILE OFFLINE ARE DEAD, PERIOD. NO APPEALS UNLESS 
THE TIMESTOP HAS OTHER ERRORS--AND IN NO CASE CAN AN APPEAL BE INITIATED
BY THE BODYGUARD CHARACTER.
 
 NPC bodyguards are assigned by the RPStaff as appropriate (and paid for).

If you are wearing concealed armor, you'd better have a description that

Judges will ignore the fact that you have the armor, if a combat occurs.
If you have dermal plating, its also obvious, unless you're wearing

NEWS RULES CHARGEN ROCKERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the most part, MUSH rules parallel the rules in the Shadowbeat
supplement. There are a few differences of course. 
 
Composition is pretty irrelevant aside from being a neccezssary skill for
rockers, unless you are planning on witing songs without selling them.
Interms of how it's handled here, when you perform a song, a judge will
determine the quality of the material rated between 1-10 (or the whole
performance rating if it's a 1-time thing). It can be assumed you are
practicing when you're not around. There is no training skill point
reduction for musical skills buying; it is assumed you are practicing
(unless someone sets up a musical school, which I doubt). Should you be
involved in something big like a concert tour or an album recording,
you'll have to spend a lot of time practicing for that and I expect the
player to RP that accordingly, but for general club bookings et. al. it's
safe to assume you are practicing when you are not on. For performances
and bookings: We do not use booking tests. You RP with the people involved
who run the club or, alternatively, if you wish to perform in a club with
a non-played NPC manager (like Renraku's Blue Room) you will have to
contact a judge to RP that. Staff is to rp these people realistically,
I'm sure you all know how. :)

As for the actual songs, you are expected to write your own songs. One
method of doing so is via files on your local UNIX account and tinyfugue.
Create a song file by using a text editor and put it line-by-line complete
with the music. Then use /quote -w< worldname> -# @emit '"<filename>", for
example: Halo Jones singing Hanging Out With Halo Jones on a 6 second
delay between lines: /quote -whj -6 @emit '"hangin".

Tailored Pheromones interact with the social pool as follows:
Tailored Pheromones add their rating to the Charisma of the character, but
NOT for the purposes of the social pool, instead; A character's social pool
is calculated by taking base charisma of the character, adding intelligence,
dividing by two and THEN adding the tailored pheromones rating to that pool 
in dice.

&rules chrome reflexes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES CHROME REFLEXES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is on the subject of the negative effects of cyberware, and
in particular of Wired Reflexes, Boosted Reflexes and Synaptic Accelerators.
So, all you Speeding Bullets, listen up. =)
 
Without a reflex trigger, wireds make you *very* fast, *all* the time. If 
you think of the numbers, the average man-on-the-street *doubles* his 
Initiative by installing simple Wireds 1. This does not come without a price.
It makes you jumpy, and since your reflexes often act before your frontal 
cortex (read: Your Brain) has had time to say 'No, don't do that', this makes
you liable to do things in haste which you may and probably will regret later.
Most runners do not want to live on the adrenalin-edge of combat 24 hours a 
day 7 days a week, and this is why most of them who get Wireds also get a 
Reflex Trigger installed at the same time. Those who don't often end up 
getting dead because of an 'itchy trigger finger'. So, this is going to be 
MUSH policy from now on, and applies to all characters approved since the MUSH
changeover (All others, see below):
 
All characters who possess Wired Reflexes which are not controlled by a 
reflex trigger *must* RP being jumpy as described above. Reflex Triggers 
effectively switch off your wireds, and when they are switched off you may
function normally. The level of jumpiness increases with the rating of the
Wireds. If anyone out there has Wireds III w/o a trigger, expect to feel 
like a Speed Freak in Fast-Forward.
 
Boosted Reflexes have a similar effect, but at a much lower level, because
of the way they work, which is in part a chemical enhancement of the 
neurons. So, think of how you feel before a big game or exam, jumpy, on edge.
All the time.
 
Synaptic Accelerators have little perceived effect, mostly due to the natural
effects they stem from. There is also no pure reaction attrib gain here, it's
all initiative dice. SynAccel users might still find it fun occasionally to 
RP what happens when your reflexes get ahead of your Brain. These puppies
cost a lot more than Wired or Boosted, so this is another reason why they are
WORTH 75000 or 200000=Y=.
 
For all characters from before the MUSH/MUSH changeover, this is not compulsory,
since you did not have the oppurtunity to get a Trigger in Chargen. However, 
the staff *strongly* recommend you to go to a doc and get one installed. We 
will work with you on this, let us know. It is FASA rules that Reflex Trigger
cannot be installed after the Wireds. This does *not* apply on this MUSH. You 
can have a Trigger implanted retroactively.
 
These rules are effective immediately. They are intended primarily as a source
of RP, and to have some fun. We don't want you to shoot your friends, or get
thrown out of every bar you go into. However, we want you to think about what
it's like to move 4 times faster than a normal man.

&rules combat pools
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES COMBAT POOLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combat pools refresh ONCE at the beginning of the first combat turn in a 
combat.
 
There are several circumstances in which a player might be denied use of their
combat pool to resist damage (not including spells)
  1) In the event that a character is taken by complete surprise; such as in
     the case of a sniper rifle shot; the Judge will rule that combat pool 
     does not apply (the character must be at least slightly aware of the
     attack).
 
  2) Any number of events might arise in which a character is hampered in some
     way (consider the CP reductions from heavy armor). This is at the judge's
     discretion. 
 
  3) In the case of unarmed/armed combat--see below.
 
How does combat pool work in melee (armed and unarmed) combat?
 
In armed and unarmed combat, combat pool may be used for *EITHER* the
counterattack *OR* the Body test, *NOT* for both tests. While this is not
_explicitly_ stated in the rules, the wording of the explanations of combat
phases (cf. pgs. 102-103) for melee combat when compared to the same wording of
firearms combat explanations (pps. 90-91), where the useage of combat pool is
specifically mentioned in the various phases' texts. Using combat pool for the
body test is known as utilizing the "Full Defense" option.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules combat actions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES COMBAT ACTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are also rules clarifications which have been requested for 
using actions:
 
Delayed Actions
A character may take a Free Action to DELAY their action. They may take this
free action to delay PART of their action as well (they may, for example, take
one simple action, and then delay their second simple action until a later
phase). HOWEVER, note that the player's NEXT action occurs 10 phases AFTER 
their action is complete. For example, if a player has a 23 initiative, takes
one simple action and then delays, and chooses to finish their second simple
action on 14, their NEXT action takes place on 4, *NOT* on 13.
 
Free Actions
A player may take a free action on *ANY* phase, one per phase, after their
first init has passed. Yes, Virginia, this means that if you go on 23, you
can chatter one "Speak A Phrase" for actions 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17....etc.
unless, of course, you use your free action for something else (like DELAYING
your other actions, see above).
 
Simultaneous Actions.
In a situation where initiative is thoroughly tied (both modified and natural
reactions are the same for both characters), these characters will be assumed
to gain the benefits of their full combat and karma pools (at the time of the
resolution) for both their action and other participants' actions, to preserve
game balance during simultaneous resolution which might be otherwise disturbed
by the choice of the judge as to who goes first. That is to say, if two
opponents have the same init, same reaction; and each has 5 combat pool and 2
karma pool, they will receive these pools IN FULL for both their action and
their opponent's action, regardless of which one the GM decides to resolve
first.

 NEWS RULES COMBAT REACH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reach Bonus Explained
The reach modifier to be applied in any given melee attack is equal to the 
net difference in reaches between the two opponents, rather than seperately.
 
That is to say, if a troll with a combat axe (reach 3) is attacking an ork 
with a combat axe (reach 2), the attack tests for the characters are at 
+1 TN for the ork, -1 TN for the troll, not +3/-3 for the troll and +2/-2 
for the Ork.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES COMBAT DEADLY

Deadly Over-Damage
As per Fields of Fire,
This MUSH uses the Deadlier Over-Damage Rule: that is to say, that if a 
character is struck by an attack that has a power greater than 1.5 times 
his Body (pre-armor-reduction), each 2 successes above those neccessary to
stage the damage up to D add 1 additional Damage Point, to be applied to 
the target's Condition Monitor as Body Overflow (if physical damage) or as
Physical Damage (if STUN damage was the type of damage being dealt).
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules combat targets
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES COMBAT TARGETS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are also rules clarifications which have been requested for 
combat targets:
 
Multiple Targets 
The Multiple Targets rule in melee combat (p. 102, second column) applies as
normal. The use of this rule for multiple strikes on the same target is 
under review and until a decision is made, will be considered voided. We
will use the plain vanilla SR2 rules until and unless we reinstate this
house rule.

NEWS RULES KARMA DOCKING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Staff reserves the right to dock karma as a penalty for non-IC action, 
blatantly incompetent action, or as a punishment for OOC offenses that do 
not warrant a stronger punishment (see NEWS POLICY DISCIPLINE).
 
  The most common use for karma docking is to penalize OOC/IC information 
crossover offenses, but it may occur for other offenses.
 
  It is possible to have a negative karma total due to karma docking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES KARMA GETTING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone always wants to know how to get karma for their character.
 
There are several ways players here get karma.  The first way is via 
+noms (type +help nom).  Players get two +noms (short for +nominate) each 
week to select the person(s) they feel have earned karma awards for good 
roleplaying.  At the end of each week (roughly), we tally the +noms, give 
out one karma point for every two noms a person has, and post the nom 
winners on one of the bulletin boards.  Don't abuse this by trading noms 
constantly with a pal of yours--we spot that and punish harshly.
 
Players also receive karma for online time. The formula for this is a 
secret, do not ask us to divulge it.  Play a lot and you will get a small 
amount of karma.
 
Staff also awards karma for roleplaying.  We MAY award it for combats 
and timestops AT OUR DISCRETION--just simply killing other players does 
not guarantee you karma.  Combat is not a way to get karma here, it is a 
means to an end.  
 
Another good way to earn karma is by contributing to the MUSH in some fashion.
For instance, donating a section for the MUSH Webpage or offering a really great
suggestion that gets used by the staff.  In sum, being a valuable member of 
the MUSH community.

The best way to get karma is to be a good roleplayer.  NEWS PRIMERS 
offers tips from staffers and players on the how to best roleplay in a 
MUSH environment.
 
A sure way NOT to get karma is to pester RPAdmins about awards for 
timestops or roleplaying or whatever.  It is, however, acceptable to 
@mail roleplaying with deeds and/or events that you believe warrant karma 
for OTHERS.  Just don't overdo it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES MAGIC INITIATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is simple and to the point. To advance as an initiate, you need to do
more than suck air. Wazzat, you say? Here are the "guidelines" as I see 
them. Folks not meeting the requirements won't be allowed to advance in 
grade. Period. Have a nice day.

(*)Magic Theory: I expect you to have a Magic Theory rating of at least 2 
   points higher than the level of Initiate you are attempting to become.
 <EXAMPLE: Bob the Mage has Magic Theory 1 and wants to be an initiate. 
 Bob is out of luck till he drags his theory up to <Level 0 + 2= 2> Level 2>

(*)Magic Etiquette: I expect this skill to be at least within three levels 
   of your initiate grade. Magic Etiquette is worth FAR more than finding 
   Magland. Trust me, in the coming days those of you with low levels in 
   the skill will rue the day you forgot to raise it.

(*)Do Something: I am often asked "What do I have to do to go up in 
   initiation?" This is an interesting question. There is a decided lack 
   of magic groups on the MUSH, which is my next project. For the most part,
   there is a lack of folks wanting to do more than spend the karma and go
   up in power. This, sadly, is no longer to be the case. IN ADDITION to 
   any oaths, familiars and the like you choose to use to lower the karma 
   cost, I also fully intend for you to be busy designing spells, working 
   on magical books, creating that stone circle in your backyard, or 
   something that FURTHERS the cause of magic. Initiation is more than 
   gaining power for personal use, it is also <to a degree, however small>
   how you further Magic's goals. Don't fool yourself that Bear, Coyote, 
   and the like aren't guiding your path, openly or not. The same goes 
   for Hermetics, tho they dont believe it. There is something I fully 
   believe in when it comes to Magic and Initiation..."With more power 
   comes more responsibility." Initiates are more in touch with the 
   Powers That Be, and that is a two-way street.

Additionally, and keep this in mind, you need to do MORE for each level.
Jotting down that one spell might be nice for Level 0. That doesnt cut it
for Level 7.

Final note: Does this mean that if you don't meet the requirements for 
where you are that you have to get up to spec for that AS WELL AS the next
level? Yes, yes it does.

In lieu of our unique closed environment and small community, many

tracking other players and NPC's. Finding validity in some of these
complaints, I've decided to modify the target number needed for a Watcher
to find a subject. This new target number, from hence forth, will be:
15-(Intelligence rating of summoner)+(initiate grade of target). 
 
This test will only be made by a judge if the summoner can prove
reasonable familiarity with the target's aura. If no such familiarity
exists, the request will be declined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules misc fame4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exceptions:
 
Specialty Fame: A char in the previous categories are generally famous.
However, a char may be famous in a certain specialty.  Specialty fame
requires special or intimate knowledge of a specialty in order to know of
a char's work/talent. For example, a porn or sci-fi star are not famous.
No special or intimate knowledge of the porn or sci-fi industry is needed,
just rent their sim. On the other hand, knowing of one's work in Astral
Mechanics or Multi-Layer Parallel Nano-Processing is a specialty. Another
explanation is, a generally famous char works to make him/herself famous
to the general public (or specific segments, like juvies or lonely single
men.) On the other hand, specifically famed chars work for the praise of
their colleagues. They are not usually generally famous unless they win
the Nobel Peace Prize or cure VITAS. Another way to see it,
general=public, specific=field
 
Rules: Specialty fame only costs 1/4 of general fame 
Recognition is inapplicable unless the PC or NPC is related or knows of 
the char's field. Base Lifestyle is inapplicable.
 
Has Beens in NEWS RULES MISC FAME5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules misc fame5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, formerly famous chars. A char may decide to have been a former
star/novastar, etc. The rule of former stars are as follows: 
 
The star pays one level less then his former stardom. Example: A former
novastar must pay star level fame. Also, they only pay one half of the
cost of that level. Therefore, a former novastar will pay 1/2 of star
level or 25K nuyen. 
 
A formerly famous char has no base lifestyle rule.
 
A formerly famous char is subject to the recognition target +2 of his
purchased level. 
 
Example, a former novastar pays 25K for former novastardom (which is star
level), does not have to maintain a luxury lifestyle, and is subject to
recognition roll of 8 (former novastardom=star: 6 + 2)
 
Note: there can be specifically formerly famous chars, simply use the
costs given in specific, and deduct them using the former rules outlined
above. As you will note, to be a formerly famous mad scientist is fairly
inexpenive. :)
 
Summary: The rules are not designed to handicap chars, but to 'define'
fame chars who have not become famous via RP. The rules are designed not
just for famous public chars, like actors, singers, or reporters, but also
the specific rules are designed for the likes of corp scientists, artists,
even priests. They are to provide a defined 'cost' of fame for a new char
rather then forcing all chars to RP their way to fame. There are problems
(for example: how do you let people know you are famous). However, the
sheer costs of fame should keep this to a local problem and players can
probably establish between themselves the fact that one is 'famous'.

NEWS RULES MISC CARTHEFT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
IMPORTANT:  Vehicle theft is NOT PRESENTLY ALLOWED on the MUSH.  The reason 
            for this is that the vehicle code does not presently support
            theft in a /CLEAN/ manner (yes, there are ugly ones, which usually
            require cleanup afterwards).
             
In order to steal a vehicle, the prospective thief must make several rolls
and have certain tools. The thief must first have a Vehicle B/R toolkit
(which represents the tools required to steal one :).) He or she must also
make two tests: Electronics (or Electronics B/R) which is used to break
the maglock that cars and bikes have for their ignition/entrance, and
Vehicle B/R to actually hotwire the vehicle. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules misc orgmorale
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES MISC ORGMORALE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The morale rules are in effect for organized crime. Each NPC object
(carried by the PCs) deliniates the morale for each organization. Morale
effects the way that NPCs in the org are handled, how they behave
themselves, and the like. 
 
These are the 'official' categories of Morale:
Superb: -3 TN for all Leadership tests. +2 Professional Rating.
Excellent: -2 TN for all Leadership tests. +1 Professional Rating.
Good: -1 to all Leadership tests.
Normal: No change.
Slightly Shaky: +1TN to all leadership tests.
Shaky: +2TN to all Leadership Tests. -1 Professional Rating.
Horrid: +3TN to all Leadership Tests. -2 to all Professional Ratings.
 
Morale shifts at admin discretion based on IC performance. Leadership
tests are required to muster assigned NPCs to do difficult tasks, such as
combat and other things at the discretion of onscene judges. Leadership
tests can be called for at any time by the admin/judge present onscene; in
IC situations, a failed leadership test can mean that the NPCs do things
that the PC does not want them to do. Keep in mind that leadership has
some interesting defaults. :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&rules misc perception
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES MISC PERCEPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Please keep in mind (for both players and admins alike) that a single success
on a perception test DOES NOT give you full information 
  
Too often players assume or judges rule that a single perception test grants
too much information to the player or NPC.
 
It bears reiteration here as well that in general, Shadowrun rules don't 
care how high your roll on a single die is--only that it beats the target
number. Success in shadowrun is not measured by how high you roll, but how
MANY TIMES you SUCCEED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&rules misc tools
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES MISC TOOLS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kits are basic tool kits that contain enough tools and equipment to perform
basic repairs and diagnosis. They are concealable, and portable. 
 
A Shop contains enough equipment and tools to perform nearly any repair. 
It is not concealable, nor easily portable. However the contents of a shop
can be transported with a large van or small truck, but NOT used from one as 
a mobile shop. A shop used out of a vehicle shall be considered as a kit, and
may perform as a shop with significant negative modifiers. A shop cannot be
simply placed in an apartment room and used there, the landlords didn't have
that in the lease, the neighbors will complain, and some of the power and
environmental needs of a shop aren't met by an apartment. You would need to
convert the apartment significantly in order for it to be capable of housing a
shop, you are much better off finding a place that is already designed for
housing one. 
 
A facility is a place that can actually design and build new parts and complete
objects, as well as perform all the functions of a shop and kit. A facility is
not portable. 
 
A typical vehicle garage is actually a SHOP, it can almost all major repairs.
The garage might actually contain several different types of SHOPS or KITS,
electronics b/r, vehicle b/r, and computer b/r at the very least, and maybe
including gunnery b/r. A vehicle FACILITY would be capable of designing and
building a vehicle from scratch, and might need to a combination of several
types of facilities and shops.
 
For most skills listed there may be a companion B/R skill. Some skills as
described do not need an associated b/r skill, some do. If you desire to use
a kit that is not exactly linked to a skill, but might be appropriate, such
as using an electronics kit instead of a computer kit, it is possible, but
there are some penalties involved. The penalties are decided in accordance
to how closely linked the base skills are on the skill web. Since Electronics
and Computer are closely linked on the web, only a slight penalty is imposed.
A gunsmithing kit couldn't be used to substitute for an electronics kit since
they are not even linked on the skill web.

&rules skills AMBI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES SKILLS AMBIDEXTERITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Our house rule is that all references to Ambidexterity under the Off-hand
Training Rules (page 81, Fields of Fire) now only apply up until the end of
the third paragraph.
 
Shadowrun MUSH is NOT using the rules for "Second Weapon in Melee Combat".
All such rules are discarded and considered null and void. Characters may 
still emit such weapon styles if they wish but will stick to a single armed
combat roll and single damage codes to do so.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
&rules skills chipped
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES SKILLS CHIPPED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SR2 rulebook reads on pg. 248, "ActiveSofts do not provide associated Dice
Pools. For example, the user of a Computer ActiveSoft does not receive a 
Hacking Pool. Additionally, Magic Skills like Sorcery and Conjuring cannot 
be made into ActiveSofts."
 
Although there have been good arguments made for the utilization of Combat 
Pool with ActiveSofts, we believe that the spirit of this rule is to disallow
-any- use of Pools (aside from Karma Pool) with chipped active skills. This
reflects the body's lack of practice and precision with the associated skill,
 even though the knowledge behind the use of the skill exists with the user.
 
So, why would you bother to even go with ActiveSofts? Well, the benefit of 
being able to 'purchase' your skillset without expenditure of valuable 
good karma allows for a much broader skillset than available to non-
skillwired characters and allows for good karma to be placed in other 
areas such as attributes, buying successes, using karma2money, etc.

&rules skills computer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES SKILLS COMPUTER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, before any fries us, this policy was started by player suggestion.
 
It has been decided that the skill usage of Computer and Computer Theory are
going to be modified. In the past Computer has been used for decking and
programming while Computer Theory has been used only to indicate how high of
a level program one can make. Here's what we are going to change it to:
 
Computer = Used _only_ for computer decking (& basic computer use of course).
 
Computer Theory: will be used to indicate the highest level capable of
programming and will be used to program (instead of computer).
 
MAX Rating now will be Computer Theory + 2.
 
This will allow us to open up a new "type" of character, such as Programmers.
You don't have to know everything about programming to deck and vice versa.
People who specialize in the Computer Theory can now make programs for others
and the like and also gives use to a skill which has been just sitting there. 
 
This will go into eeffect immeditaly, but will not affect current programs. If
you think you're a special case ("In my BG I said I did more programming, can
I switch some points...") 
@mail *MatrixRP and we'll consider it.

NEWS RULES SKILLS LEVELS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has come to my attention that various players and even Staff on this
MUSH don't know what the various levels or concentrations of Firearms
mean. In our attempt to clarify these things, Fuchi Admin and I, both
military brats, have come up with these descriptions: 
  
1: Basic familarity. This means you know which end is the barrel,
   how to reload, and how to point at a target. Nothing about windage, or
   battlesight zero, or any of that stuff. You could probably hit a broad
   side of a barn.  
2: This is the same as a two week basic course. This would be equivilant 
   to what basic training recruits receive in the US during BRM training.  
3: This is the same as what a basic law enforcement officer receives, or 
   street cops.  
4: An experienced soldier of a several years, or an experienced cop 
   would be at this level. Instructors for soldiers are at this level. (They 
   teach BRM for the most part.) 
5: Combat vets or 20 year veteran cops would be at this level. These are 
   people who have been at it for a while. Instructors for rookie cops are 
   at this level.  
6: Rookie Special Forces soldiers or Green Berets/Marine Recon
   would be at this level. Trained to pick up any weapon and use it well. 
8: Your average Navy SEAL is going to be at this level.  This is a
   general list of where you should be. 
  
Now, if your corp character, a desk jockey, has general firearms of 4 and 
you're trying to tell me he took 'a course', you know where you stand. :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES WEAPONS STORING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This ruling has a couple of parts.
 
The first is a note to those of you who keep heavy weaponry and explosives
in middle-high class apartment buildings. While the administration cannot
possible monitor everything and while we realize it is possible to stash 
certain items in secret, or smuggle them in, keep in mind that large amounts
of guns are noticable and may be punished--randomly--when we decide that a
guard notices their presence. This especially holds true for HIGH and LUXURY
lifestyle apartments such as the Starlight Towers and La Fortuna; explosives
are doubly hard to get in there due to chemsniffers at the entrance points 
which we have not coded to any real degree yet. In other words, unless it's
legal or small, find another place for it or get an apartment more suited to
a shadowrunner
 
The second is a note about transporting firearms in bags. The average 
assault rifle is about a meter long. That's 3 feet to the metrically 
impaired. Please keep this in mind when putting that autoshotgun or Ares 
Alpha into your "knapsack" bag.

&rules weapons grips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS RULES WEAPONS GRIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Grips
Base time Custom Grips is 72 hours of work. Divide base time by the number
of successes in the B/R test for the total time required. 
 
Brace yourselves, AS PER THE FoF RULEBOOK, EVERY WEAPON CAN HAVE CUSTOM GRIPS. 
This includes melee weapons, thrown weapons, and projectile weapons.
 
This means that anything from a 30=Y= knife to your Ranger-X bow to a Panther
Cannon can be custom gripped. If it's a man-portable weapon, it's doable.
 
Custom gripping involves more than replacing the grips with a special 
rubber mold. Custom gripping represents specializing the weapon ALL around
to the single user. This means making the slide release longer for short 
thumbed people,safety action easier, trigger pull lighter or heavier,
making it easier to grip and so on.

is difficult.  You must locate a fixer and buy from them.  Fixers are

character on the MUSH to buy from, and you will be rewarded.
 
  Keep in mind that prices are by no means fixed nor are they in all 
cases identical to the prices in the books.  Things vary--as do deals.  
It's all in the art of negotiations and the laws of supply and demand.

  After a great deal of deliberation, debate, numbercrunching, conferring
with some of the biggest rules lawyers and munchkins in some of the worlds
biggest and best POWERgaming Shadowrun campaigns, it has been decided to
implement the following change for the Ares Viper Slivergun, as of 
February 2nd, 1995.
 
  In accordance with several observances regarding imbalances in the game,
and believing that FASA made an oversight, and even if they didn't, the
Ares Viper Slivergun now (just like every other pistol in the game) 
requires a COMPLEX ACTION, not a simple action, to perform BURST FIRE.
 
  Yes, this means only one burst per phase.  No, no refunds - it's still
a damned good weapon.

 NEWS RULES LIFESTYLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the lowdown on dossing down in Seattle, courtesy of Mark, the dude
what brung ya all the keen housing code.
 
MAKING THE PAYMENTS
If your character just plain doesn't have the money to keep up his/her
lifestyle payments (represented by "rent" here), then um, you're going 
broke and have to find a more trashy place to live. That's just part of 
life...can't keep a roof over your head just hanging out in bars or in 
your apartments. Get a job, you'll be okay. (Yeah, I know, there aren't 
any corporate positions so you have to be either a small biz person or a
'runner... sorry, finding people jobs isn't my department). If you can't
afford it, check out of your old place and get a less-spiffy one, or 
advertise for roommates to share the cost.
 
LINKING
The '@link me=here' bit NO LONGER WORKS on this MUSH. The ABODE flag has 
been disabled and there are only two ways you can get linked to a room: 
Be in a game-legal residence and use the +link command, or get an admin to
+link you to a non-residence. DO NOT ASK ADMINS TO DO THE SECOND ONE. If 
they have a real good reason to set your home as a place that isn't a 
normal residence, then they'll do it. Linking to non-standard rooms will
end up screwing things up as far as tracking a player's home(s) and 
getting their lifestyles set correctly.
 
COMMANDS
Please read the +lhelp in your residences for the command list and command
descriptions. Most notable is the +link command, which automatically sets
your home to that room and sets your lifestyle to reflect that particular
residence (see above). Note: If the +lhelp files are unclear, @mail housing
with the subject of '+LHELP PROBLEM.'
 
<continued in NEWS RULES LIFESTYLE2>

&rules lifestyle2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS RULES LIFESTYLE2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SHARING THE RENT
Low lifestyle apartments allow 2 people to live there. Middle allows 4,
High allows a maximum of 6. There ARE additional charges PER DAY for each
person you have living there! Formula for daily cost of an apartment:
90 percent posted price + 10 percent per person living there. Some of the
more astute of you will notice that means if NO ONE is living there, you 
don't pay the 30/day of a low lifestyle place, but just 27/day as long as
no one is +linked there. This means you people with more than one apartment
get cut a little break. What does that mean when you have like, .7 days 
left of rent? Well, me and the managers will cut you another break here and
give you until midnight that night for the fraction of a day. Doesn't matter
if you end up with .1 days left, you're still set until that midnight to 
check out. Note: This balances out the fact that if you rent a place late 
at night for only one day, the manager kicks you out THAT midnight. Sorry,
that's the nature of the MUSH clock codes and nothing I can really help 
with.

PAYING RENT
Anyone that ICly resides in an apartment (that is, has +linked there) 
and/or the original renter of the place can pay rent at the managers.
 
BROKEN HOMES
If an apartment door lock refuses to work, gather up all your stuff and 
check out of the apartment. @mail housing with the key dbref and an 
explanation, using the mail title 'HOUSING BUG'. Then, wait about a 
minute or two and rent again at the manager. This works because when 
you check out of a room it's destroyed, kaput. All the glitches should
evaporate too.
 
COMPLAINTS
When mailing the housing alias for whatever reason, *PLEASE* use the 
following subject lines for the corresponding matters: 'HOUSING BUG,'
'LHELP PROBLEM,' and 'HOUSING QUESTION.' Respectively, that's bug reports
problems with the clarity of instructions in +lhelp, and finally a 
catch-all "I don't understand ______" category. Using inappropriate 
titles will MOST LIKELY delay getting a response from me -- I try to 
answer stuff within 4 days at *most* and if the subject line in my 
'+skim unread' says something like "Quick Question" I'll prolly ignore
it in favor of the stuff that I *know* is part of my job.
 
BUGGING MARK
I am normally OFF DUTY or on CODING DUTY because, well, my job really 
isn't to answer pages -- it's to code or otherwise troubleshoot. The 
best way to get a hold of me is via @mail, I promise.

An addendum to the previous - this is a very long-standing fact, but Mark's
finding out that people still exist that want to ignore it:
 
>>>Everyone with Low Lifestyle and up _has_ to rent an apartment.<<<
 
Yes, you can ICly live somewhere else. It doesn't matter where you sleep
at night, you just need to have some apartment rented out somewhere. 
ICly live in the basement of your business, it doesn't matter ... you just
HAVE TO BE LINKED TO AN APARTMENT. If I say it any more emphatically I'll
get out the flashing highlighted yellow. 
 
Why? Because without being linked somewhere the staff have no way to track
your lifestyle payments, and you can't set your lifestyle on your own. No
exceptions will be made, and anyone that tries to skirt this rule will be
penalized by Mark.

Some other Permits/Fines that we should all know:
 
Mage Permits
 
Personal Permit: Free
This permit allows the mage to use non-damaging magic which doesn't affect
anyone else. The exception are personal spells with intent to harm others,
such as a spell which converts one's hands to razors or increased attribute
spells.
 
Basic Permit: 25K
This permit is required whenever a mage wishes to affect a willing subject 
(note that affecting a non-willing target is strictly illegal.) If a mage 
wishes to summon any spiritual entity, he or she needs this permit.
 
Healing Permit: 10K per year
In order to heal a willing subject, a mage must be a registered practitioner
of the Healing Arts. (Think of this as malpractice insurance for the 
magically active.) On the plus side, a registered Healer is allowed to work
in hospitals to heal others- a priviledge denied of mages not working for
the hospital to date.
 
Security Permit: 25K per year + insurance
In order to offer one's services as a security guard, a mage must have a
security permit. While this does not legalize murder via magic, it does 
legalize the use of lethal magic to protect the property (including the 
mage him or herself) of the employing company. Corps usually foot the 
expensive permit cost as well as the insurance, which traditionally runs
in the sixtuple digits.
 
Other notes:
Physical adepts and astral adepts require free permits unless they take
up security jobs, in which the basic and security permits are required.
Permanent magical items (foci and spell locks, specifically) have a flat
yearly permit fee of 100=Y= for spell locks, 500=Y= for all other foci. 
(This is per item: if one carries two spell locks legally, both must be
registered, for 100=Y= each.) Fetishes, conjuration materials, lodges, 
and libraries are not subject to these permit fees.
 
 
Fine for Failing to register with a SIN: 5,000 Y
PC should go to LS Downtown District and register. Should take approx 
1 Hour of IC time. LS takes fingerprints and other vitals for future use.
This is essentially a 'franchise tax' to register with the legitimate 
authorities and maintain records. You get to pay taxes, vote, the whole 
thing.

News chargen auras gives general guidelines on constructing the aura for
your new character. Once you create an aura, you're stuck with it for the
life of the character, barring magical awakening or major trauma. So make
the aura accurate, appropriate and well-designed.
  
The following topics are available to get news on.  To access any of the

&chargen aura mundane
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA MUNDANE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set your aura, simply use the format:
 
\&AURA me=(your aura)
 
This aura should include vital bits of information such as:
RACE: Human, Ork, Elf, etc...
SEX: Male/Female
GENERAL HEALTH: Perfect Health, Slight Health Problems (Cold/Flu, Allergy 
symptoms), Moderate Health Problems (Light/Moderate wounds, Chronic health
conditions), Major Health Problems (Serious/Deadly wounds, Deadly Disease, 
Cancer, Deadly Toxins)
NATURE/DEMEANOR: Angelic, Pleasant, Amiable, Bitter, Angry, Homicidal, etc
BRIGHTNESS/DIMNESS: Use your better judgement based on your character's 
essence rating where a 6 would be a Bright aura and anything less than 1 
would be faint.
COLOR: This is not necessary, but can be added for your own creativity. Or 
perhaps you have your own reasons for making you aura a specific color (What 
the frag? Make 'em wonder :)) SEE NEWS CHARGEN AURAS COLORS
 
For an example, see NEWS CHARGEN AURAS MUNDANE EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen aura mundane example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA MUNDANE EXAMPLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Aura: You astrally perceive a moderately healthy human male that 
is perhaps in his mid to late forties. His health problems seem to come 
from a constant supply of toxins which you surmise may be smoking related. 
He has an ultra-conservative nature that borderlines raucous and obnoxious. 
Apparently well aware of his unsavory nature, it appears that he uses a 
humourous demeanor to polish and coat social perceptions. This aura remains 
a bright mixture of red, white and blue, seemingly untainted by cybernetic
enhancements or prosthetics. He seems to be in an upbeat mood.
 
This aura tells all it needs to without going into pointless detail. Mundane
and magical auras alike reflect the "true self" and should be written as 
such.
 
A nice effect is to include your character's current mood in the aura.  This
can be inserted into both your description and your aura with the use of a 
bit of code.  At the end of the desc or aura, toss in a couple of hard 
carriage returns with \%R and then put \[v(D_MOOD)\]. THEN, type:
\&D_MOOD me= <current mood>
Then, whenever you alter the &mood attribute on yourself, the desc and aura 
will likewise change. This also works with the UMD (see umd help)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen aura magical
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA MAGICAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set your aura, simply use the format:
\&AURA me=(your aura)
 
This aura should include the vital bits of information listed under NEWS 
CHARGEN AURAS MUNDANE. However, because your aura will also be used to 
create your astral form, you should also describe it as an idealized self-
image of your character, from your character's point of view. This image 
is up to you as long as it complies with these guidelines:
 
1) THE IMAGE SHOULD BE CONSTANT. That is to say, what you choose now will 
remain your image for the life of your character.
 
2) THE IMAGE SHOULD REFLECT YOUR CHARACTER. A shaman viewing him/herself 
as an extension of his/her totem should include aspects of the totem in 
the description. A shamanic mask (Visage of the totem) would be ideal. For
hermetics, you might want to establish an affinity for one or two of the four
elements and incorporate that into your description. This would obviously be 
more prominent in Elemental Adepts, but can also be subtly included into full
hermetic forms. (Perhaps the form looks exactly like the PC except that there
are two flames where the eyes should be.)
 
3) BE SURE TO KEEP TRACK OF UNMASKED ACTIVE FOCI OR FETISHES. These too should 
be included into the aura as they travel with the astral form. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen aura colors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA COLORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
There is no standardized palette of colours to represent emotions. The 
reason is that every person, even in the same culture, views colors 
differently. Almost all of us will agree that red represents anger and 
violence, but to some it also represents romance, and to others passion. 
To some, green is jealousy; to others, eerieness.
 
This difference is compounded by the magically active. For example, an 
Owl shaman would view 'good' emotions as dark and 'bad' emotions as bright, 
whereas a Sun druid would see the opposite. A rural Snake shaman may 
interpret security and nostalgia as green (reminiscient of the grass he or 
she slithered through when young), whereas an urban Snake may view the same 
as mottled brown and grey, like bricks and concrete. And Prarie Dog may 
associate the same emotions with the earthy brown of the rich soil through 
which he burrows. Etc. ad nauseum. 
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN AURA COLORS2>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen aura colors2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA COLORS2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In short, there is no universal color scheme for emotions, because each 
mage will add their own interpretations to the auras they see. Feel free 
to add or keep colour in your auras, but include the emotion the colour 
represents. For example, your aura may "shimmer with crimson violence, 
punctuated with rippling Romulan green waves of envy and impulsiveness." 
An aura of "red and flicker green" provides no information, and hence 
should not be used. 
 
On a final note: Does cyberware add splotches of blackness? Do cybereyes 
leave two black holes in your head? Is a cyberarm represented by complete 
blackness? These are completely stylistic effects. You are not obligated 
to reveal what cyberware you have, but you are encouraged to personalize 
your aura as you see fit. If you have extensive cyberware, then you MUST 
detail a dimness extending throughout your aura. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen aura short-aura
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN AURA SHORT-AURA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As with the short-desc attribute, you must set a short-aura attribute on
yourself so that the astral people and spirits, etc. can see you from 
astral space. This should be, as with the short-desc, a brief outline of
what someone glancing at your character might notice. Don't go into TOO 
much detail, but if something is pretty glaringly obvious, include it.
 
The command is simply:
/&SHORT-AURA me=<insert your short-aura here>
 
Some examples:
1. Mundane male human, dim aura, strongly radiates a love of cheese.
2. Female magician, appearing as a svelte nude with cat's eyes and a tail.
And so on . . .

&chargen how-to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadowrun Seattle MUSH demands a high quality background for every type of
player.  From the lowliest ganger to the most powerful mage or the best
decker in the 'trix, everyone needs to have a good background.  We 
believe that a good background is the foundation of great roleplaying. In
order to properly roleplay your character, you need to intimately know 
the role you will be playing.
 
As such, NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO offers suggestions on the process of 
conceiving, writing and polishing a background so that it can be approved
and you can get IC and start roleplaying.  Following these guidelines will
not necessarily GUARANTEE acceptance, but they WILL help to structure your
thoughts and actions as you proceed through the design of the character 
and help you to make decisions about the character along the way.
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO2>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

&chargen how-to2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first thing you need to do is decide on a general concept or character
idea.  This might be something as simple as "a decker" or "a ganger", or
you might have something more complex in mind already like "an ork rigger
who has ties to the ORC policlub". You probably already have this idea in 
mind before logging on to SRMUSH, but if you honestly don't know what you 
want to play, check out +cgneeded, page ON DUTY admins, talk to people on
the Public channel . . . basically, you need to realize that you don't 
have to create your character in a vacuum.  Other people online are 
generally more than willing to help you become part of their Shadowrun team
or their gang or their organization. You need only ask.
 
Once you have your CONCEPT in place, you can then proceed with the adding
of detail to the character in order to flesh him or her out into something
that you can role play.
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO3>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen how-to3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One player suggests that once you have a character concept, it helps to 
just brainstorm while glancing through the sourcebooks and other material 
in order to find interesting aspects or equipment or skills to incorporate
into your character. The location sourcebooks are especially good for this.
You can leaf through the "California Free State" sourcebook, for instance,
and perhaps decide that you think Los Angeles is an interesting, if hellish
place to live in 2058 and you want your character to be from THERE.
 
At any rate, you should probably just spend some time noodling around with
different ideas and maybe a pen and paper, maybe experimenting with 
creating the character sheet you want the character to have. Try to form in
your mind "the big picture" of your character in terms of who (s)he is,
what (s)he wants and how (s)he is going to get it.
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO4>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen how-to4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have a good character outline, begin adding details.  Make sure 
you answer all the character questions found in NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS and
try to format everything in chronological order for easy reading. Begin at
the beginning and work forward. Don't do into pointless detail, but be sure
to include all the major life events that shaped the character's develop-
ment. You can write the background in whatever style you prefer, and the
more creative it is, the more fun it is to read.  HOWEVER, many backgrounds
new players write are long on narrative and short on relevant detail. A
beautifully written short story about one event in the character's life is
nice, but it doesn't function as a background. If you like, INCLUDE pieces
of narrative fiction in your background, but don't forget to include the 
important nuts-and-bolts, even if you have to add extra slots at the 
beginning or the end of your well-written narrative.
 
<BONUS ADVICE>: DON'T WRITE YOUR BACKGORUND ONLINE. WRITE IT IN A WORD 
PROCESSOR, OFFLINE, THEN PORT IT OR PASTE IT INTO YOUR BGSLOTS. NOT ONLY 
WILL YOU BE PROTECTED IN THE EVENT OF DATA LOSS ON THE MUSH OR YOUR CHARACTER 
OBJECT, BUT IT'S ALSO MUCH EASIER TO EDIT AND REVISE OFFLINE TEXT.
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO5>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

&chargen how-to5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have what you feel is a complete and well-written background, 
REVIEW WHAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN FOR GRAMMAR AND SPELLING. Most word process-
ors can do this FOR you.  Spelling and grammar are important in a text-
based medium, and it makes it a lot easier for admins reviewing your 
background when they can read and understand it. If you can't spell, use
the automated spellchecker or find someone who CAN spell to help you.
 
Once you have revised your background once, set it aside for a day or so,
then come back and re-read it.  Spend your off time trying to gain the 
best possible understanding of the Shadowrun world through additional 
reading and review of source materials.  Then edit your background with an
eye to eliminating logical inconsistencies, obvious contradictions, any
events or people that seem implausible or unlikely and so on. Basically,
go through and be your own worst critic.  

<continued in NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO6>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen how-to6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have revised your background a couple of times, and you are
satisfied that you have a high-quality background to submit, use the
'bgdata' command to put your background into slots on your character's
background object. You can use as many slots as you need when entering 
your background using the 'bgdata'. Make use of the ability to break 
up your background into meaningful sections with the Bgslots. Also learn 
how to use \%R and \%t in your background for hard carriage returns and tabs 
in the text.  Formatting your text for easy reading will speed the approval 
of your background because it is easier to read.
 
Once you have entered your background into the slots, apply to the 
background queue. A PHStaffer will grab the application and review it,
making whatever recommendations might be needed in order to make the 
background approvable for SRMUSH.  If you have followed these guidelines,
the Phstaffer will likely have very few comments and you will be 
quickly on your way to playing. Make the required changes as soon as 
possible and resubmit to the queue for approval.

As a reward for reading this far, here's some Extra Special Bonus Advice: 
In the first two slots of your background, do the following for your benefit 
and the gratitude of staff. In the first slot, provide a brief chronological 
outline of your character's life. In one paragraph, explain the character's 
life in general terms. In the second slot, include a one-paragraph 
personality synopsis. Explain WHO the character is in a psychological and 
social sense, giving a nice, accessible reference for RPadmins who would like 
to offer those "Playing in Character" Karma bonuses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
News Chargen Process outlines the steps needed in order to obtain approval
and begin play on Shadowrun MUSH.
 
1. Write and submit your background to the Background Queue (the apps 
machine is in the Character Generation: Backgrounds room. Player Help
Staff will perform the initial screening of the backgrounds and offer
advice for revision as needed. This can take as little as one day or as 
long as several days depending on the volume of applications and the
quality of your application. If few or no revisions are required in your
background, this stage should take a day or two. If there are problems with
your background or if there is a large volume of applications, this will
take longer. Please be patient. If you decide that you can't play here
because you have to wait more than a couple of hours to get approval, then
this probably isn't your kind of MUSH.

**NOTE** NEWS CHARGEN HOW-TO offers advice on how to self-critique your
background. Don't submit a half-hooped background and then simply address 
any criticisms as simply as you can. Make an honest effort to create an
IMPRESSIVE background and your efforts will be rewarded.

 NEWS CHARGEN PROCESS2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. After PHStaff approval, you proceed through numerical chargen, adding
the numbers and skills and gear to your character. 
 
3. After numerical chargen, there is another brief application process in
which the Rpadmin(s) in charge of your specific area will review your 
background before final approval.  There is an applications device in the 
Finishing Touches Room. Look at it for details on what queues are avail-
able and apply to the queue most appropriate to your character.

4. The Rpadmin may or may not request revisions to your background.  They
will work with you to revise it, and then your character object will be
completed with all the necessary code and you will be turned loose on 
Seattle. This should not take more than a day or two, perhaps longer if
there are large numbers of applications or if there are problems with 
your particular background.

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
News chargen questions is an annotated, expanded version of the famed
"20 Questions" in the Shadowrun Rulebook. To view the questions, simply 
type: 
 
news chargen questions <number>
 
There are currently 32 questions in the list and they are all important
in helping to define your character in the background you write. Take the
time to read them all and make sure that your background addresses all
these questions. Do NOT, however, attempt to submit a brief one-line answer
to all of these questions and then call that a background. We expect that
you will go to a little more effort than that in creating a background.
 
These questions are designed to provide a set of expectations regarding 
what sorts of information you should have to provide in your background.
They are by no means an exhaustive list, but many players have found them
useful in developing their background.

&chargen questions 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is your characters sex and race? 
 
<<This affects everything. Gender roles are blurred in 2058, but RPing a 
female character will be a different experience than a male.
  
There are no real race restrictions on Shadowrun MUSH. You can be human, 
elf, ork, troll or dwarf. However, certain RP considerations will come 
into play. Humans and elves generally can't get into the Ork Underground, 
for instance.

A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT RACES: One of the most common errors players make 
when designing their elf or dwarf player character is that they "changed" 
into an elf or dwarf when they were a teen. This DOESN'T happen, folks. 
Ever. Elves and dwarfs began being born to human parents in 2011.  It is 
only orks and trolls that 'goblinize' at puberty and this has not been 
common since the 2020s. If your 20-year old ork 'goblinized' when (s)he 
was 14, keep in mind that this is a VERY unusual occurrence by the 2050s. 
Quite frankly, the goblinized-as-a-teen angle is pretty much done to death. 
My advice? Say it once and say it loud! I'm trog and I'm proud! *grin*>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What is your characters physical size? 
 
<<Is he exceptionally tall/fat/short/thin? Is she average? You'd be 
surprised how many "surprisingly large" trolls we get, how many tall, 
muscular humans and how many dwarfs that are "tall for a dwarf". We need 
more 'average' sized people and we also need more people to be 
un-perfect. It would be a nice change to see a couple of homely women,
perhaps a prematurely balding samurai and even a fat troll or three.>>

3. What is the color of the characters hair, eyes, and skin? 
 
<<In the world of 2058, anything is possible, with cosmed surgery and 
implants and grafts. Be creative (without being ridiculous). If the 
character DOES have an artificially changed appearance, is it well done or 
cheaply done? Does it look GOOD, or just trashy? think about it. You may 
want to try adding some cyber-controlled animal-emulation bodyware. Or 
maybe your cybereyes have little holoprojectors that flash "Buy Fuchi!" 
What is cool and cutting-edge in fashion in 1998 is probably tacky and 
outdated in 2058. Maybe body piercing is passe but body colouring (with 
epidermal dye treatments) is the latest fad. Be original.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
4. What is the character's general appearance (i.e., How does he dress, 
etc.)? 
 
<<Not EVERYONE wears all black. Not EVERYONE wears trenchcoats all the 
time. Lord knows I've seen far too many people wearing STEREOTYPICAL 
clothes and claiming to look "striking". If you're a standout, be REALLY 
different in your desc. If you blend in, blend in, while remembering that 
black ain't the only colour. Think about the colours you wear IRL. Some 
of us wear all black, all the time. Most of us have SOME other colours 
in the ol' closet. Be original. You may even get +nommed for a very good 
desc.>>

5. Where was the character born (City, State, Hospital Name)? 
 
<<A word of advice. If you don't know the situation on SRMUSH, (i.e. you 
haven't played here before) make your character an import. Be from somewhere 
else, and be new to Seattle. That way, your ignorance of how things work will 
be IC. Also, if you are from Seattle, be specific about what area you're 
from. Don't just say "a slum". Or "a corp". Give your street or your 
neighborhood or your corp a name. A further note, if you are going to be 
from a place that has a published sourcebook, make sure you have the 
sourcebook, so you don't conflict with "established" events. Pick a city or 
a place that hasn't been profiled if you don't want to run into problems 
-- there's LOTS of places that don't have sourcebooks, chummers.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
6. What is the character's date of birth?
  
<<This is important. A good way to score points with BGreviewers is to 
mention the impact of global events on your character's life. If you were 
born early in the 21st century, how did VITAS impact you? The Crash? The 
Night of Rage? There's a timeline in the SRII rulebook as well as on 
various Shadowrun websites. Sort out when your character was born and what 
might have happened to her because of these major events. Also, if there's 
a sourcebook for your city of origin, try to scan it for ITS timeline, 
too.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
7. What was the character's family life like?
 
<<For cryin' out loud, please stop killing off all of your loved ones in 
your backgrounds. The theme of "The corps/yakuza/gangs/Hare Krishnas 
killed my wife/kids/mom/dad/pet hamster Willy in backgrounds is 
overdone. Which isn't to say it CAN'T be done, just that about every third 
player wants to be an orphan. Families are good RP material. You can send 
them nuyen to help out, they can be used as leverage to get you to do things 
for that evil Mr. J. Hell, maybe your brother hates your guts and he's a 
Johnson now and HE'S trying to kill you. Be creative.>>
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
8. Has the character begun his own family?
 
<<This doesn't necessarily have to be something the character KNOWS about. 
I once wrote a BG where the character had an illegitimate son that he knew 
nothing about. It was just in there for flavour and as a plot hook for 
later. Perhaps you could write a cooperative background with another player 
to play a husband and wife, or a pair of lesbian life-partners, or whatever 
kind of family you want. This is a super way to guarantee you'll have RP. 
This can also be extended to runner teams and such. If you KNOW someone 
who plays here, ask about including them in your BG. This can be something 
as simple as a contact or buddy, or you could be a long-lost brother. Or 
whatever. If you don't know anyone here, there is a chargen contacts-system 
in place to help matchmaking.>>
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
9. Where or how was the character educated?
 
<<This is more than just schools.  This is how the character was trained 
do whatever it is that he or she does. A major problem with this issues is 
that I can't count the number of backgrounds that claim the character was 
"trained to be a shadowrunnner" like there's a shadowrunners' union or 
something. There is NO shadowrunner guildhall, in the AD&D sense. There are 
also a legion of characters who had a shadowrunner-mentor who taught them 
"all the tricks of the trade". Ex-military characters are also overdone. 
When thinking about where your character learned what she learned, explore 
alternate paths. Learning to fight is usually a smaller part of people's 
lives. Few people spend years and years training to fire a gun, unless they 
are Olympic marksmen or professional cops/soldiers. If your character WAS 
in the army, did they pick up any NON combat skills? Also, a basic soldier 
in the UCAS army receives enough training to make them quite deadly in 
comparison to Joe Q. Public. Not every ex-military character needs to be part 
of an elite Navy Seals-type unit. And if they WERE part of such a unit why 
did they leave after the army spent millions of =Y= training them and 
implanting them with cyberware? How did they get away?>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
10. Has the character ever done anything else for a living? 
 
<<This might be grouped in with #9, education. Whether your teen years 
were spent at a prep school or running drugs for the mafia, thinking about 
other employers, legitimate or illegitimate is an important part of 
character development.>>
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
11. What are the characters beliefs on church and state?
 
<<Politics and religion, chummer. The two most volatile topics at any 
cocktail party. Be aware of what politics and religion have become in 2058 
and think about how your character regards them.>>
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
12. Describe the character's moral code. Include how mercenary he is, 
whether or not he'll kill innocents, etc.
 
<<Completely immoral/remorseless characters are generally not accepted on 
this MUSH. The stone-cold sociopaths are the BAD guys, chummer. Even if your 
character is a paid assassin for the yakuza, she needs to have some sort 
of feelings towards the slain. There ideally should be some kinds of things 
that a character will NOT do for money, everyone needs to have their limits. 
it's good RP. This is exemplified by the character Rico in the SR novel 
"Fade to Black". Rico stands by his own personal code, even when it could 
cost him his life. This may also include the 'samurai code' various people 
talk about regarding street samurai honour and the Mercenary Code in
The Fields of Fire sourcebook.>>
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
&chargen questions 13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
13. What are the character's goals?
 
<<A character with no goals will stagnate on the MUSH. If you have goals, 
even unattainable ones like "protect the innocent", your character has 
direction. You will know better how to RP the character in new situations 
if you take into account what she wants out of life. Some people say you are 
what you do. I say that you are also what you want. Desires shape actions 
that lead to the realization of the desires. Define both short and longer-
term goals. Perhaps the character's shortterm goal is to join the Ancients 
and their longterm goal is to find their long-lost mother. Be innovative!>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
14. Why does the character run the shadows? (Why does he run the shadows 
still, rather than getting a "real" job?)
 
<<Most people don't PLAN on becoming shadowrunnners. It just happens. It's 
NICE to work for a corp. You know where your next paycheck's coming from, 
you work regular hours, you can sleep relatively soundly at night. It 
ain't all bad, chummer.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
15. What kind of personality does your character have? 
 
<<Three words. Detail, detail, detail. This is critical for RPstaff to 
judge your RP and award those nifty "RPing in character" Karma awards. 
I personally prefer a personality synopsis in a single slot of the BG, 
in which the character's basic personality is described.>>

16. What special qualities does the character possess? This does not refer 
to skills, but rather at other things, such as How he gets along with 
people, does he plan ahead, does she speak with an annoying voice, does he 
pick his nose all the time, etc.
 
<<Everyone has 'quirks' and they can really help you RP. Think about them 
and include them in your BG.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 17
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
17. Are their certain things the character can't or won't do? Why?

<<The flip-side of the special-qualities coin. Think in terms of habits,
fears, phobias and such. Everyone has problems.>>
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
18. What things, people, or ideas does the character hate?
 
<<Not everyone HATES megacorporations. Be reasonable. Corps probably MADE 
everything your character owns. Also think in terms of racial or ethnic 
prejudices. Racial prejudice is RAMPANT in 2058. Racism is almost popular, 
kind of like being a Republican. One caveat: Racial prejudice, even extreme, 
does not equal "I want to kill all the trolls/breeders/elves/whatever. 
So you have an extreme prejudice against orks. This doesn't mean you get 
into a lather and pull out the Predator II every time you see an ork. It 
means you are almost totally convinced that they're subhuman or otherwise 
worthy of contempt. You may just refuse to acknowledge them Despite YOUR 
prejudice, the UCAS law still counts orks as citizens, so if you blow one 
away, it's still MURDER, chummer. Prejudice can be insidiously subtle. 
Perhaps you PITY the orks. Perhaps you just don't think that trolls are 
human. Perhaps the trogs are like little monkey children that must be 
supervised closely. Be prejudiced, just don't be stupid.>>

person.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
20. What is the character's name? Give both full birth name, as well as 
nicknames, street names, etc.
 
<<A shocking number of backgrounds don't include a last name for a 
character. Something else worth noting . . . give important people in 
your backgrounds names as well. That way, maybe an NPC can ask you about 
"Three-Finger Jimmy" (that Yakuza chummer of yours from your BG who was 
really inept) when you're IC, and you'll know what the hell they're talking 
about. This is much more IC and more satisfying than having some 
Rpadmin page you OOC and say "You know Jimmy from your days in New York, 
he's the Yakuza guy who used to sell you the odd piece of tech from time 
to time.">>

21. Come up with a reason for why the character became a shadowrunner. 
(This is not the same as #14, but rather why he started running the 
shadows originally. What led him to it?)
  
<<This is pretty self explanatory, but a good example of thinking a 
character through. Every person has a number of 'turning points' in their 
life that had critical impacts on the way they continued on through their 
existence. Explain the turning points for your character.>>
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
&chargen questions 22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
22. Does the character have a SIN? Does the character actually use it?
Or is the character one of the SINless masses? This may be affected by 
the characters previous employment.
 
<<See Sprawl Sites for a good discussion of SINs. Any active member of the 
shadows probably has one (or more) Fake SINs. Write them into your BG 
and pay for them with chargen resources. Ask the RPadmin that approves 
you to put them on your character's +sheet. As a member of the shadows, 
these fake SINs are the tools you need to rent apartments, buy things in
legitimate stores and so on. Unless you want to live exclusively in a
street/squatter/low lifestyle, you'll need a decent fake SIN or two.

If you've got a REAL SIN, it's not necessarily the end of the world.  
So long as you don't USE the SIN for anything, you can't be tracked by
it. If you've never given blood samples, then you can't be tracked by 
your SIN even if someone finds your blood on a crime scene. There are also
all kinds of administrative barriers to matching crime-scene DNA to a 
database of millions of peoples' stored genetic code. Think about it. 
So you're an ex-corper and you've got a real SIN? DON'T USE IT. The only 
real problems you will run into are if you have family you care about 
associated with your real SIN and/or you DO have DNA records with your 
ex-corp (in which case, just don't do Shadowruns against THEM).>>

23. Is the character a full-time shadowrunner? Or does the character lead 
a Batman-like double existence?
 
<<Working at bars, or other IC businesses is a nice way to fill in the gaps 
between shadowruns. Asusming you can get such a job. Some bars are actually 
covers for major players like Fixers or organized crime. Working at such a 
bar could turn into a real goldmine for a talented employee. Something to 
think about.>>

25. What hobbies or pastimes does the character enjoy, if any? 
 
<<Does the character take up basketweaving when she's not kicking the 
cyberzombie's hoop around the block? Actual shadowruns take up a small 
percentage of your life. Decide what you're doing for the rest of the 
time.>>

 NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS 26
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
26. Where did the character learn his Skills and train his attributes?
 
<<Generally, all skills should be clearly explained in the BG. See NEWS 
RULES SKILLS LEVELS for a sample of what the levels mean using Firearms 
as an example. 3 is the 'mythical' average level. Jane the Accountant 
probably has Accounting: 3. Also, you should explain in the BG any 
attributes that are exceptionally high or low. Anything more than one 
point away from the racial average (humans with 1's or 5+ attributes, 
trolls with INT/CHA 3+, basically anything that you assign only one point 
or more than 4 points to in numerical character generation) need to be 
explained.>>

27. List any past serious relationships that your character has had, and
give a brief overview of the relationship.
 
<<Unless the character is a social pariah, she probably had a relationship 
or three. Think about it, and decide how the character feels about the 
past close relationships and how she feels about getting into future 
relationships.>>

How do people recognize you? If you changed your character-object's name, 
would people remember who you are based on your speech and desc?>>

29. Does the character have any prized possessions?
 
<<Admins have a nifty couple of powers called +name and +desc. They can 
change the name and desc of some objects for you. Perhaps your Sword is 
actually an antique Scottish Claymore! Perhaps your Streetline Special is 
one of the limited-editions with the metallic mauve finish! This is a great 
way to personalize your character! Ask for it!>>

30. If your character has cyberware, where did she get it, why did she get 
it, how did she get it, and what does she think/feel about it?
  
<<Cyberware of some sort is relatively common in some circles in 2058, but 
you have to decide how your character feels about the cyber. Hatchetman's 
monologue in the SR sourcebook 'Cybertechnology' is a fabulous example of 
this. Tom Dowd explains exactly how Hatchetman got his chrome, why, where, 
and what the character feels about it. Despite various debates on the 
nature of chrome and its acceptance level in 2058, you need to decide how 
YOUR character feels about the chrome in herself and others and WHY she 
feels that way.>>

31. How does the character feel about magic?
 
<<If the character is magically active, this will be a substantial area 
of focus in the background as you define your magic, your relationship to 
it and how you perceive it. However, even for mundanes, everyone has probably 
seen a little magic here and there in 2058, at least on the trid. How do 
you feel about it? Decide it and RP it! A note: Most people are NOT experts 
on magic and know very little about it--sort of like how most people 
think car gas tanks explode when crashes happen even though they really 
don't except in the movies. Think of magic as a very complex, very technical 
subject about which most people, including some magically active people, 
are pretty ignorant. Except for people with the Magic Theory skill, tossing 
out spell names and technical information about the astral mechanics of 
spellcasting is not very IC. If you can't resist acting like an expert on 
magic, spend some skill points on the skill.>>

<<Fear is a way of life in the future. What keeps you up at night? What 
gives you the heebie-jeebies? There's lots of things to be afraid of in

inducing stimuli to good dramatic effect.>>

bonuses and/or penalties when considering how you compare to OTHER 
people of your race. A 3-charisma human is comparable to an ugly or 
obnoxious elf and so on. In most cases, if your base attribute is a 1, a 
5 or a 6, you should make some note of it in your background because it 
is exceptional.

 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES DECKER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This is the straight poop from the Matrix RPStaff, chummers. If you want
to be a decker, read it, learn it, and live with it.
 
If you wish to be a decker on here you must have VR2 <Virtual Realities 2>
experience and have played a decker in tabletop games. The reason for this 
is that the decker is one of the hardest character classes on here. The 
matrix is almost totally automated and you will become totally lost if you 
do not have this experience. We suggest first time players to the MUSH do 
not try and play a decker unless you have a lot of experience with VR2.
 
DECKER CHARACTERS RULES FOR SRMUSH:
- Character Attributes of 1 are not allowed
- Computer skill must not be below a 4 and above a 6; you may concentrate 
    the 6 to 5(7) though
- must take Computer, Matrix Etiquette, Computer Theory, and B/R Computer 
    skills
- must get a datajack
- no other skill besides matrix skills (above) may be above a 4

Background Rules:
1. Your background must be original (something different not the norm).
2. You cannot use Megacorporations in your background; you CAN use a sub-
   sidiary of a megacorp, but limit the impact you've had on this corp.
3. Try and stay away from creating a college-student with a lot of schooling
   this is a shadow world so keep that in mind with the backgrounds.
4. DO NOT just answer the NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS straight out, but add the
   answers within your characters story.
5. DO NOT add unnecessary character descriptions within the BG. 
6. Your background should be written like a story/essay. Make it interesting
   to read and it should be a minimum of about 2 pages in length. 
7. Somewhere in your story there would be 2 types of NPC character that the
   matrix staff might use to get you involved in Tinyplots. Note they do 
   not have to be fixers and should not be a family member or considered a
   "Buddy" contact. They should be just someone you met and have done some 
   biz with or that you owe something to. Try and describe this NPC a 
   little so a Mjudge can play them.
8. Do not make your story all positive and filled with what you can do good
   with no flaws. Everyone has flaws and we like to see them in your
   background, too. (also review NEWS CHARGEN QUESTIONS).
9. Finally, DO NOT have your character create fake SIN's in your BG, we 
   do not allow players to fake SIN's greater then a rating 2 on here.

Final tips:
- Remember when making your character, you order your deck and programs 
  AFTER you have been approved so save those resource points. The more
  cyberware you get the less you will have to spend on that deck.
- Spend some time thinking about your character's Matrix ICON and what it
  means (if anything). 
- Decide how your character feels about the Matrix and define it in your
  background.  This character is a DECKER, so the Matrix will help define
  who (s)he is.
- There are some advantages to playing a metahuman (non-elf) decker. 
  Contact Matrix RPStaff for more information.
- Don't expect to start out as powerful as Dodger or Fastjack. You'll have
  to grow into your talent and it will take time. Enjoy the ride, it will
  be a lot of fun!

&chargen archetypes ganger
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES GANGER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
The ganger system is a little bit in flux, so this section just contains
a few tidbits of advice for those who want to play street-scum. 
  
1. There are restrictions on what cyberware gangers can have, what skills
   they can have and more. Check out the Ganger Recruitment area in
   Chargen for more information. 
2. There are several IC gangs made up of players and NPCs.  If you want to
   be a member of a gang, it's a good idea to try and get in contact with
   some of the members of the gang BEFOREHAND as well as trying to discuss
   your app with one of the Ganger Admins (See +staff/all).
3. The GANGER ADVANTAGE. It seems like there's not a lot of up side to 
   being a ganger. You can't start with Wired Reflexes-2, your skills 
   aren't that great to start with and you've got pre-set enemies all over 
   the 'plex. What's the up side? In SR's combat system, every opponent 
   beyond the first you engage in Unarmed or Armed combat at the same time
   give as YOU imparts a +1 to their TNs to hit and a -1 to your TNs to hit.
   This means when you and three buddies fight a samurai, the sammy has a 
   TN of 6 and the three gangers each have TNs 2 to hit. The sammy's 
   probably going to get pasted. It pays to have friends.

Ganger advice, cont'd
   
4. Gangs are a good place to start off as a player on SRMUSH. You have 
   some ready-made partners to RP with, you have some pretty clearly 
   defined goals and you can have a lot of fun.
5. Some (though not all) gangs require you to join them once you get IC. 
   You create a 'wannabe' character, someone who is ready to join a gang
   but hasn't yet done so. Then, you can attempt to join the gang through
   roleplaying.  From the personal accounts of many gang players, this
   is one of the most-fun RP experiences, as they try to convince the gang
   that they've got 'the right stuff'.
  
More ganger information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Ganger Admins and players.

&chargen archetypes rigger
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES RIGGER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Being a rigger is a chance to be more than "the guy who drives the cars".
Especially with the release of the Rigger 2 sourcebook and some dedicated
staff on SRMUSH devoted to riggers, they are flourishing as a character 
type.
 
Here are some guidelines for prospective Rigger characters:
 
1. You should own a copy of Rigger 2 and understand the rules therein.
   Shadowrun MUSH uses the Rigger 2 rules (with some exceptions, see the 
   postings on the +bboards) and if you want to rig, it's best if you
   know them.
2. In order to be a rigger, you must have a datajack and a Vehicle Control
   Rig.  Even players who claim they have played Riggers in TT games often
   neglect to give their character a VCR and thus, are not riggers.
3. Resources are reduced on Shadowrun MUSH, which will cut into your budget
   for drones and cyberware. Keep this in mind when designing your char-
   acter and allow for the reduced nuyen available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   
&chargen archetypes rigger2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES RIGGER2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
4. Explain the relationship your character has to rigging. Why does (s)he
   rig? How did (s)he get started? What kinds of vehicles does (s)he rig?
   Rigging is primarily for high-performance vehicles. Joe Public doesn't
   get a VCR so he can drive his Americar better. Nor does FedEx equip 
   its drivers with VCRs to drive their vans around, collecting packages. 
   You might want to be more original than "he was a corp rigger" or "she 
   was in the army and decided to become a rigger" as well.
5. You get to start with a rigged vehicle and 2 drones, maximum. Choose 
   these to reflect the background your character has and what would be
   most appropriate, not just what you can get that has the most "bang 
   for the buck".
6. Not every Rigger needs to be a mechanic. Though it helps to be able to
   jury-rig repairs on your main vehicle, if you need to go to a mechanic
   for this, it provides a good RP opportunity. 
 
More rigger information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Rigger Admins and players.

&chargen archetypes samurai
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES SAMURAI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
There are so many characters that fall into the loose category of 
'samurai' that we could write reams of text that listed them all. Mercs, 
Bodyguards, Former Company Men, Former Military Officers, as well as your
basic street-pred urban predators. The main thing that pulls these 
characters all together is that their primary function is usually combat.
 
Deckers have the Matrix, Magicians spellcast and go on astral quests, 
Riggers zip around with drones and cars and helicopters, but all samurai
usually have is the ability to kick some butt.
 
There is a surplus of "plain vanilla" street sams on SRMUSH.  Muscle is
relatively cheap for shadowruns because it's so plentiful. Also, if all 
you can do is beat people up, there are limited opportunities for RP. The
best way to make sure that you can keep busy (both in RP and shadowruns) 
is to make sure that your character is more than just a set of Wired 
Reflexes with a gun.
 
<continued in NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES SAMURAI2>
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
&chargen archetypes samurai2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES SAMURAI2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Adding 'specialties' to your character, be it mechanic, biotech, 
electronics expert, demolitionist, paranatural hunter or what have you, 
adds increase opportunities for RP.
 
Some guidelines for creating a samurai:
- try and come up with an original skillset and cyberware mix
- review NEWS RULES SKILLS LEVELS when you choose combat skills and make
  sure that the level you assign to a skill is appropriate to your BG
- remember you don't necessarily need Wired Reflexes to be a good fighter
- most people that are good at violence have a specialty
- decide how your character feels about his cyber and why (s)he got it
- find something to make your character unique among samurai-types
 
Being a muscle-type character in Shadowrun can be a rewarding experience
if you let it evolve beyond simple combat. Anyone can +roll dice in a 
timestop; the talented samurai grow into something more than just 
effective combatants.

&chargen archetypes fixer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES FIXER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SRMUSH offers a chance to play a Fixer, brokering deals for nuyen, power 
and shadowruns in the criminal underworld of Seattle. There are some 
forthcoming policy changes that will likely change how fixers are treated,
but in the interim, here are some general guidelines and advice for
wannabe-Fixers. The application process for Fixers is fairly demanding. 
With the additional power available to most Fixers, responsibility and 
maturity are also required. See your Fixer Admins for more details.
 
1. Your rep is your livelihood. How you behave, in your BG and once you're
   IC, will determine what people think of you and what kind of business
   they're willing to transact with you. If you don't have the natural
   paranoia and shadow-smarts to play like a top-class Fixer, then don't
   create one in your BG . . . play an amateur Fixer who still needs to 
   learn all the ropes.
2. Your most important skills are your Etiquettes and your Negotiation.
   (some kind of Equipment Acquisition skill will likely become a new part
   of the system with the new rules, but for now, Etiquette and 
   Negotiation are IT). You need to demonstrate HOW the character became 
   so street-savvy or corp-savvy (or whatever) in the BG.

 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES FIXER2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
3. You are who you know. Without contacts, a Fixer can't DO anything. You
   must cultivate contacts and relationship in order to be a successful
   Fixer.
  
4. You are more than a gear distribution device. Many players treat their
   local Fixer like a shadowy Stuffer Shack. They demand this, that and
   the other thing, all with APDS ammo and then the player will often 
   quote sourcebook prices to the Fixer and get all in a snit if they 
   can't get what they want or if the Fixer deviates from the list price.
   Equipment sales the LEAST lucrative part of being a Fixer. The margins
   on brokering shadowruns and info trading are generally much higher and
   much more likely to put the Fixer into the lap of luxury.
 
More Fixer information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Fixer Admins and players.

&chargen archetypes magician

 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES MAGICIAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Magical applications are restricted on SRMUSH. Currently, once a month or
so, applications are opened up and people can compete for a number of open
"slots" for various kinds of magical characters. The info on the opening 
and closing of applications is typically posted to +bboard 1 (General).
 
Because of the competitive process for magical applications, these 
backgrounds need to be EXTREMELY well done.  Applicants must display 
their knowledge of Shadowrun and Shadowrun magic, their creative ability 
and their sense of how the magic of their character 'works'.
 
On average, the background for successful magical applicants run anywhere
from 20 to 40 one or two-paragraph Bgslots. This translates into 
something like 3000-5000 words. Length isn't a requirement, but most 
people find that in order to explain their character concept in the 
required depth, a fairly long BG develops.

 NEWS CHARGEN ARCHETYPES MAGICIAN2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
When writing a background for a magical character, the character's magic 
is one of the most important aspects of the character. Therefore, the BG
must include good detail about the character's magic, the character's 
feelings and/or perceptions about the magic and some sort of proof that
the player understands how Shadowrun Magic is supposed to work. It's not
absolutely required, but possession of the SRII rulebook, the Grimoire 
2ed and Awakenings will be extremely helpful to a magical character.
 
The Magic RPStaff can provide more insight into exactly what they're 
looking for in an magical application. In the meantime, here are some 
tips for magical applicants.
 
- Cat, Raccoon and Snake shamans are a little overdone here at SRMUSH
- fetish-required spells are looked kindly upon because they stimulate RP
  with the MUSH's talismongers
- playing a magical character is considered a privilege and magical 
  players are expected to be online and RPing as often as possible
 
More magical information and advice will be posted as it becomes available
from the Magic Admins and players.
