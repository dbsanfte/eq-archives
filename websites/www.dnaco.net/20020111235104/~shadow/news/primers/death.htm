      <p> Death. In ShadowRun, or, in fact, in most RPGs, it's a fact of life. 
        Sooner or later, every character will meet their doom, some in more grisly 
        ways than others. Some die in a blaze of glory (Kash's little bike sacrifice?), 
        some die with a big splash (John's drug-crazed assault, while blind, on 
        the Alabaster Maiden) and some die stupidly (Kash's little bike sacrifice? 
        :)), but, regardless of who you are, you stand a very real chance of dying 
        in this world. 
      <p>How to avoid it is pretty hard to quantify. Just about everything in 
        this Primer is intended to give you tips on how to play a character that 
        won't be so easy to kill, all the time, but this is probably the closest 
        I can come to tips on how to avoid such a fate directly. 
      <p>FIRST: DON'T GO UNPREPARED TO CERTAIN PLACES. 
      <p>If you're an elf or a human, going to certain parts of the Ork Underground 
        is taking your life in your own hands. If you're an Ork or a Troll, getting 
        harassed by the cops in DownTown can be a fact of life. Think of the blacks 
        in southern U.S. during the 50's and 60's for a comparison. Don't walk 
        into Sylvan Shadows and curse out elves. By the same token, social strata 
        are very real, and the Barrens is not a fun place for well-dressed people. 
        At all. Even if that tuxedo is armored.
      <p>SECOND: AVOID COMBAT. 
      <p>Combat is not something that should be sought out as the solution to 
        all your problems. Of course, there are some characters whose lives revolve 
        around the brutal facts of life and death (gangers for one), but, for 
        the most part, you are safer all the time if you can negotiate your way 
        out of situations. Sometimes, attitude is all it takes. Other times, you 
        have to remember (unless you're a Yakuza :) ) that your life is PROBABLY 
        more valuable to you than your pride. Someone once mentioned that Halo 
        Jones defused a volatile situation with five Hell Hounds with nothing 
        but herself and a single friend. This was attitude. Other times she's 
        been near dying if she said the wrong word to a certain Yakuza member. 
        This was sacrificing pride for a greater goal. 
      <p>THIRD: BE CONVINCED OF YOUR OWN MORTALITY. 
      <p>Powergaming is worth a lot maybe in the minds of number crunchers. But 
        I've seen the best go down to the worst. I've seen characters who have 
        been amped get taken down by people right out of chargen. Even when you 
        have the chrome and the skill, that doesn't mean you're immortal or invincible. 
        Numbers frequently lie, and you never know what your opponent is capable 
        of. And people so frequently underestimate their opponents and act like 
        they're King Doodie, it's not funny. 
      <p> FOURTH: BE PREPARED. 
      <p>Never fight your enemies' battle. Force him (or her) to fight your battle. 
        Ninety percent of combats are won not by stats, but by planning and superior 
        strategy. Pick your battlefield. Piss off your opponent so they aren't 
        thinking straight. Use your abilities to your best advantage, and put 
        them at a disadvantage. 
      <p>FIFTH: CONSIDER YOUR VENUE CAREFULLY. 
      <p>A combat once occured--RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE AZTECHNOLOGY PYRAMID. How 
        STUPID was this? No matter WHAT my reasons for fighting were, if it were 
        ANY of my characters--INCLUDING Dunkelzahn himself--I would have RUN rather 
        than fight in such a STUPID place. Even if I win I'm probably dead meat. 
        The Downtown area is not the best place (though there are places that 
        you could go there to fight) to get into a scuffle. People seem to like 
        taking their fights outside of Silhouettes, not realizing that Alaskan 
        Way IS a AAA-priority law enforcement zone. Lone Star is everywhere. The 
        Barrens is not the best place to get into a scuffle. Gangs are everywhere, 
        and most of the pedestrians are armed--no telling what they'll do. Ask 
        the Judge for all the details of what you see before you consider pulling 
        a gun. Use those street etiquette rolls to get a basic clue about your 
        area (if you have that skill) and what the permutations of fighting in 
        it might just be, if you can't deduce these yourself.
