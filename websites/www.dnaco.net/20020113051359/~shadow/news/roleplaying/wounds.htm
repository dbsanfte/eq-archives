      <p>There has been some concern about physical wound levels and what they 
        mean and what you can do while wounded at X level. This ruling is intended 
        to clarify wounds and the actions associated with them.<br>
        <br>
        Deadly: This is when you take a wound that would kill you if not stabilized 
        by a trauma patch, vat, or a competent doctor or mage working very hard. 
        At this point you are considered unconscious and unable to move. I.e., 
        no phone calls, no decking, no walking around, you are where you are unless 
        moved by someone else. You must be brought to a medical facility to live. 
        A trauma patch or first aid will sustain you until you get there. If you 
        are taken out such, by another PC or group and you are caught running 
        around the MUSH you will be dead. When in doubt, +judge.
      <p>AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A HOSPITALIZED LIFESTYLE (500=Y= 
        per day plus doctor's fees) WHEN AT THE DEADLY WOUND LEVEL. If you don't 
        keep Up this kind of lifestyle, you won't heal and in fact might just 
        die from complications. You are effectively unconscious until you heal 
        to SERIOUS.<br>
        <br>
        Note: For Serious, Moderate and Light Wounds, you may or may not require 
        Medical attention, as noted by the rules on wounds in SR2.<br>
        <br>
        Serious: You are conscious but hurting severely. You can move about but 
        you are very aware of the pain. You can move around, walk, talk, drive, 
        etc, but doing anything other than lying still probably means you are 
        in constant pain.
      <p>AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A HIGH LIFESTYLE (300=Y=/day) 
        WHEN AT THE SERIOUS WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for 
        this kind of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into 
        a DEADLY wound level from complications.<br>
        <br>
        Moderate: This is a medium wound. You can walk around, travel, deck, you 
        just do so with a moderately uncomfortable level of pain. 
      <p>AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A MIDDLE LIFESTYLE (150=Y=/day) 
        WHEN AT THE MODERATE WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for 
        this kind of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into 
        a SERIOUS wound level from complications. <br>
        <br>
        Light: This is like stitches healing, black eye, scab...you can pretty 
        much do anything you want, with minor discomfort. 
      <p>AS PER THE SR2 RULEBOOK, YOU MUST MAINTAIN A LOW LIFESTYLE (30=Y=/day) 
        WHEN AT THE LIGHT WOUND LEVEL. If you don't take it easy AND pay for this 
        kind of lifestyle, you don't heal and might get worse, slipping into a 
        MODERATE wound level from complications. <br>
        <br>
        Basically, with all kinds of wounds, if you don't REST, you don't get 
        better. Period. If you are caught schlepping all around Seattle with a 
        SERIOUS wound, then you will not heal until you relax and maintain the 
        rest and medication provided by the equivalent of a HIGH lifestyle for 
        the proscribed period.<br>
