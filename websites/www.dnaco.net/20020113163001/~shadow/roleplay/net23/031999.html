<P> "... so it would appear as though the killers have eluded capture." Amy Lolacker , one of the night news personalities, shifts in her seat. Her short cut blonde hair frames her face nicely and her eyes are beautiful indeed. The camera cuts views and she looks over as she begins her next piece. "In other news today, people gathering in front of the English Parliment today stood fast in their beliefs when.." 
 
<P>*Click* "AAAaaaaaaagh!" 
 
<P>*Click* "... but in contrast to today's society, one can.." 
 
<P>*Click* "..gets you down, try Zanta." The screen fades from the gorgeous brunette model in the tight shirt. It's not long before another image replaces the blank screen. A Lone Star car speeds by lights flashing, disappearing down the street as it turns sharply. Music kicks in as the scene changes to a one-sided firefight, with 6 Lone Star officers firing fully automatic into a small trailer home. "Tonight... on Seattle's Criminal Element." The scene changes again to four Lone Star cops, one a troll, waiting outside a door as an unlucky teen dashes out of it. He is immediately beat down by Da Man. "Dumb Criminals and Their Actions. Our first scene opens up at a quiet little building located in the South Downtown area, near the Elven District at Maynard and King." The scene fades into view, you can see that the building is brownstone, two stories tall, and beautifully designed, with a long flat base, over one hundred feet long, and a checkerboard second story, the squares being seperate buildings, perhaps individual offices. In one of the spaces on the second floor is a helipad. The windows are thick (probably security) glass, set perhaps ten feet apart, and are only one foot wide and three in height. At the bottom of the screen appear the words: Mature Content Pictured. 
<P>         "And here we introduce the two... villians." The view changes to that of a security camera overlooking the door. The time in the bottom right reads 11:06 PM. Suddenly two men appear, apparently coming to a stop after a run. Both wear black, and one of them has a turban wrapped around his head to conceal his face. 
<P>         Without pausing for much, the turbaned man immediately withdraws a small box and begins tampering with the maglock located on the outside of the door. He works like this for about a minute before turning to the other black garbed man and shrugging. 
<P>         Sound kicks in and from the background noise you can tell that it's a feed from some close microphone. A gruff sounding voice comes over the system. "What are you guys doing?" 
<P>         The man who had been working on the lock rallies his confidence, and says "My passkey apparently was stuck in the lock. I was trying to remove it." The speaker system clicks on again. "Uh huh. You wish to explain yourselves?" The masked man states calmly, "We are here to fix computer equipment--appointment times have been acting glitchy, they have told us." 
<P>         The speaker crackles to life again. "Oh yeah, well I'll just let you guys right in then. Why don't you two do us all a favor and get the fuck outta here. We've already called Lone Star and they're sending a squad car over, so you better start hightailin' it before ya get gunned down for trespassing." You can see one of the men, the one doing all the talking, close his eyes for a moment before unleashing. He speaks angrily into the speaker, "What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you want to get fired, you stupid dipshit? DID YOU EVEN CHECK IF MY KEY WAS STUCK? NO!" 
<P>         The speaker system remains silent for a little bit. After like thirty seconds, it crackles to life again. "Hrm, yes well, I didn't think of that. Here I was looking at two black garbed people running through my security cameras to try to fuck around with the Lock on the DOOR without Bothering TO ASK us, or TELL us you were here, and NOW you're trying to tell me that your key is stuck... oh no wait, you're here to fix shit... oh no, we'd Like to go Back to our ORIGINAL FUCKIN' story that your key is stuck? WHEN the FUCK did you think I was Fuckin' BORN you fuckin' LAme Ass JAGOFFS?!?" 
<P>         The man frowns before retorting. "Well, hell, maybe we would have told you boys when we got in, for god's sake? We're supposed to fix shit, and we just fuckin' like to wear black. So let us the hell in, now. You're gonna get fucking reported if you don't, man." The speaker is once again silent for a while. When it comes back on, the speaker is obviously chuckling. "Oh... well then you two assholes have some ID you can show us, right?" The pictured man then begins going through his pockets, finally producing a card and showing it to the camera, though all the information on the card as been edited out. The speaker system remains silent for a bit. From on the street, the two officers exit their vehicle, the light rain splashing lightly on their rain gear and armor. The speaker crackles to life again. "Yeah well... I might have believed you earlier, but you guys'll have to come back later after we put our lock back together." 
<P>         After a moment to consider, the person then turns, kneals, and sets to work again. Using some new found skills, or perhaps recalling a little trick from the earlier days, the man uses his light fingers anew. He joins the correct leads in certain places, splicing wires in others, with no pause for uncertainty. With confidence the man manages to not only disengage the override lockout on all entry reads, but convinces the lock to open as well. The LEDs turn green. The second man then kicks in the door and pulls the first one through, ripping out all the wires and tools from the lock as he does so. The plastiglass door shuts rapidly, just before a pair of Lone Star officers slam into them, effectively getting blocked out. They then back up out of camera shot... but you can see that one remains. 
<P>         Then, once again the camera switches views... this time you're looking at an interior security camera angle. 
<P>         The building is something to behold. Strong arching tree branches, cunningly made of reinforced composites, spread out in wild, zagging patterns from columnar "trunks," and support the roof and ceiling. The walls are lined with rows of dwarf bamboo in planters, and the walls are painted a pattern of brown and light-green hatching in the Japanese "lightning" pattern, almost chevron-like in nature. There is a desk and several chairs slightly shielded by the bamboo, and a sofa and chairs provide room for prospective clients. Everything is well lit, so it's easy to see the pair of men stepping across the foyer. 
<P>         From somewhere off camera, you hear a male voice shout a warning. "FREEZE ASSHOLES! Don't Fuckin' Move." Due to the way the pair react, you can tell that the shouter is somewhere down a hall that apparently disappears underneath the camera angle. 
<P>         Not surprisingly, the pair do not 'Freeze'. Both pull their guns, diving behind a couch each, and the one on the left comes up firing twice. Soon, an all our gun battle rages in the reception lounge of the Tsumori Tatemono building. The two criminals are firing rapidly, but the couches they are hiding behind are getting chewed beyond belief. You can make out the beams of laser sights in the gunsmoke and couch debris, as bad guys and good guys square off in a deadly contest. 

<P>         But the world is saved. The two men are shown getting hit here and there, angrily taking light amounts of damage until a big one. The man on the left, the one that originally fired, looks as though he takes a good hit. 
<P>         The camera then resets. Digital imaging zooms in on the man as the scene is replayed in slow motion. You can really make out the agony in the man's face as round after round plunges into his body, spraying blood and sending the cretin down in a howl of pain. 
<P>         "His nefarious partner, of course, then gave up all hope of overcoming the odds, and willingly began pleading for his life. Even though the man apparently had medical training, evident by his medkit shown here." Quick zoom in of a medical kit he is holding at the time. "This poor wretch immediately began telling the guards that the entire idea was his partner's fault." He can be see pointing emphatically at the downed and dying criminal. 
<P>         The show cuts to Rodney Richards, host of Seattle's Criminal Element. His jet black hair and smooth face is complemented by a practiced smile. "Both of the men were rushed to SEattle General to receive medical aid, where they are both listed in stable condition. They have been booked and will no doubt be convicted with the substantial evidence against them. Once again we see that it doesn't pay to be a part of... Seattle's Criminal Element."
