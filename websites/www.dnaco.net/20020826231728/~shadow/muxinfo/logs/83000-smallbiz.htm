<p>08/30/2000</p>
<p> Penta says &quot;Erl, where might one find the smallbiz rules thus under discussion?&quot;</p>
<p>Anima waves. I'm here in this guise 'cause my PC is busy atm. ;)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs and hrrrrrms. &quot;Well... we're basically gonna take it 
  one section at a time, pose as we go.&quot;</p>
<p>Garrett finds a seat and settles in.</p>
<p>Akiko arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Dickinson arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Catriona arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Dickinson dances around, kicking Duke of Erl and LymphDawg tha Playa Hater 
  alternately.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Akiko says, &quot;now now :)&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph gets kicked around</p>
<p>Anima swats Dick down.</p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; ErlRemoteBody says, &quot;Aww... no &lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; for this 
  body.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; ErlRemoteBody says, &quot;Okay. we're gonna wait a couple minutes 
  more for late-comers.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Anima says, &quot;Here. I'll do the AdminSmackDown for 
  you if you like ;)&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; ErlRemoteBody says, &quot;Chat or something. Don't leave the room 
  in silence.&quot;</p>
<p>Garrett hands Anima a slinky to keep her busy.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Akiko says, &quot;me too :)&quot;</p>
<p>Dickinson says, there isn't an admin in this room that has enough hair on his 
  ass to smack him down.</p>
<p>Garrett hands one to Akiko too.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Admin&gt;&gt;&gt; Lymph says, &quot;I'll help too, we can tag team 
  smack down ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Garrett hands Lymph some TNT.</p>
<p>Announcement: Erlkonig shouts &quot;Smallbiz starting in two minutes. Get there 
  now, or be late.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta knife's dick's head to the wall, then nails his arms and legs to the 
  wall.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ooohs and starts chanting, &quot;Sacrifice! Sacrifice!&quot;</p>
<p>Dickinson says &quot;See? It had to be a PC that did it. Y'all admins are scared. 
  :)&quot;</p>
<p>Jane arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Anima has no hair on her ass, but will smack you down anyway, Dick.</p>
<p>Penta takes out the sacrifice sword.</p>
<p>Anima woowoos and tags Kiko :)</p>
<p>Garrett watches in amusement from his bean bag.</p>
<p>Penta puts it down, and takes out his other sword. He then approaches Dick. 
  &quot;THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;That RemoteBody thing really creeps me out, it's like you 
  left your arm here to talk in your stead..&quot;</p>
<p>Penta cuts off Dick's head.</p>
<p>Jane plops down next to Garrett.</p>
<p>Akiko cracks her knuckles, and grins</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs to Lymph and flexes.</p>
<p>Dickinson bleeds on Jane.</p>
<p>Garrett offers Jane some popcorn.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Had enough, eh? Running away, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta flops down onto the floor and watches.</p>
<p>Jane munches noisily.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;In anycase, we're gonna get underway.&quot;</p>
<p>Lynna arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Smallbiz meeting is now in session, or some 
  drek like that. Okay. Lemmee just pull up a couple things.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;And I will be slightly lagged... I'm doing a run with 
  my main body. I apologize for that.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Which should prove that yes, admins do runs. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Cowboy arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. This is an informational meeting moreso than 
  anything else. Rules _are_ up for discussion, but calcing through several example 
  businesses they seem to work fine, and you end up with a lot more than a piddly 
  5% a month.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Now. What profit is calculated off of is the 'Ideal 
  Amount', which is the cost of building plus any directions. Kind of like investment, 
  but slightly different. Having simply a floor in an office building gives you 
  the value of the building, not just your floor.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Minus a small percentage, of course, to reflect that.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Any questions about that?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes smiles, &quot;Look at the lovely assembly of people.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;We should probably have a speaking order for this or something?&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'directions' in 
  context, Erl.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Directions?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody can't see where he typed 'Directions'...</p>
<p>Garrett has disconnected.</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Cost of building plus any directions.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Decorations.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Mistype.&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. OTher than that, any questions?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes blorts</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;My turn! If you have a small biz in a *big building* which 
  you do not own, does the ideal amount still come from building value? Like, 
  a coffee bar in a skyscraper kind of thing?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I think it matters.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;You pay higher rent for a good reason :)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Ah. Good point. No, a larger percentage would be 
  taken out. That's kinda up in the air right now because I haven't had to deal 
  with anything like that yet. The rules are complete for buildings-unto-themselves. 
  The reason for taking from the building is to reflect extra business when you're 
  in-house.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;though it may make sense to prorate based on your 
  rent.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph nods</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Something like that will be worked out when circumstances 
  demand. But yes, higher rent means a higher ideal.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. If there are no more questions, let's move on 
  to what everyone cares about - money.&quot;</p>
<p>Akiko says &quot;does location/footfall make a difference?...what I mean is, 
  when I owned ltd....it was considered a low income biz cos it was in a shitty 
  area,,,yet, it was one of the busiest places&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Location (as in, district) makes a difference in expenses, 
  moreso than profit.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;OBviously, UG and 'Rens are cheaper for staffing, 
  etcetera.&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona still wants to know why this level of complexity is necessary, what 
  it adds to RP, how it makes the life of future admin easier, when they will 
  have to live with your decisions in a week, a month, a year or whatever.</p>
<p>Catriona says &quot;and if they don't like them, what about the players who 
  get to have yet another rules change on a whim?&quot;</p>
<p>Akiko says &quot;what about profit? i got 1k a month for running one of the 
  busiest bars,,,,that sound fair? no&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona cares less about money, really.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I think it is worthwhile, if we get a nice broadbased 
  rules decision Cat. Staff have tried to finish a smallbiz ruling for a long 
  time now.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;And I do care about money, most of us aren't deckers 
  who can sell our programs&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;When it comes down to it, Catriona, the only pain-in-the-ass 
  is the initial design of the business.&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona thinks if it's complicated it's as bad as all the other rules they 
  have here.</p>
<p>Akiko says &quot;exactly&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I make an investment in a property it is because 
  I want a return.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;After that, its simple as can be.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Let's hear the rules before attacking em..&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods. &quot;Thats what I'm hoping we can do.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. First off: Businesses. The type they are, and 
  what that means for 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;We've had Shane and many other staffers who quit 
  before finishing their systems, due to rl reasons (or having spent more time 
  on other things like paranormal hunting or medical rules).&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona thinks that Admin can no longer find time to do skill raises. And 
  you want to make 20 charts for differing expenses to come up with -one- business. 
  And then force whoever has to deal with it to take dice rolls every month.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm not quitting. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Anyway. Cat - the system's gonna be automated, aside 
  from setup.&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona says &quot;Every admin is 'temporary'. Every admin leaves the game. 
  Everyone grows up. Everyone has something happen to them. YOu are not gonna 
  be here in 5 years as an admin.&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona says &quot;and 9 times out of 10, when the admin that made the rules 
  leaves, no one maintains them.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Cat they are coding this. Quit complaining till 
  you hear what he says.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; Dickinson wonders, are we here to discuss the new rules, or have 
  one person tell us all why we shouldn't even try to fix the problem?</p>
<p>Catriona shakes her head, &quot;No, I'm leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>Catriona pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Let's talk about systematic complaints later, this isn't really 
  the time.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody sighs slightly.</p>
<p>Dickinson pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. The biggest problems with systems before was 
  that every business earned the exact same amount. Which is definately not realistic. 
  Try to tell me that a grocery makes as much as a nightclub.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Good riddance is what I say. Lets hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>Akiko says &quot;exactly&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Prepare for awful formatting, and missing %'s.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;<br>
  Bar 25 <br>
  Bar (24/7) 35 <br>
  Night Club 35 <br>
  Security Consulting 10 <br>
  Parahunting 15 <br>
  Esoteric 20 Restaurant (Fast Food) 30 <br>
  Restaurant (Fine) 25 <br>
  Restaurant (Family) 20 <br>
  Car Dealership 20 <br>
  Clinic (Cyber) 20 Clinic (Bio) 15 <br>
  Clinic (Alpha) +5 <br>
  Clinic (Beta) +7 <br>
  Clinic (Delta) +10 <br>
  Clinic (Street) -10 <br>
  Training 45&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Those are the types, and the base percentages for 
  profit. Clinics were the tricky bit - Damn you, Johnny.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Uh.. Is that monthly?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Monthly.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;However, that's just a _base_. No modifiers attached.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Um.. Does this mean you can pull a 35 profit on your investment 
  per month?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;In theory. This is _gross_ profit.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;It calcs in the end.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph nods</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Plus, we'll be adding a coded 'market' machine later 
  on. You'll see great profits for a few minutes until that's set. But that's 
  not the here or now.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;So... any questions on that so far?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Is this the base? Like lets say I have a famiy restaurant 
  at 20. That is 20k/month?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Or is that a .20% or 20% or is that what we shall 
  be revealed when I shut uP?&quot;</p>
<p>Lynna says &quot;I assume that the decision will be made at set-up as to what 
  it will be as I can see many places not falling into those categories. Will 
  you be making those decisions?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;20%&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Businesses will have to take into account stuff like chef's 
  wages and grocery bills and electric bills now huh?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;Yes. Categories will be added as needed. And lymph 
  - yes. That's part of the initial setup. Everything runs itself _after_ the 
  setup.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph nods, &quot;Neat&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods. &quot;Ok that makse sense. If I invest more into my company 
  to upgrade and grow... I take it that alters or requires a 'resetup'?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Nope. Depends what you're doing - building a new wing 
  would quite obviously require hiring more staff. Redecorating the place is just 
  adjusting the decorative costs.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Now - next thing. You can designate 'decorative 
  costs' as a bonus. This is little thing that just makes your biz more 'pretty' 
  and attracts more customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That is what I&quot;m talking about. substantive 
  alteration.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs. &quot;Then we need to adjust things, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Just as if it was a real business.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Gotcha. So the base rasises. the other part is just 
  glitz/advertising.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes shuts up now.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods.</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;I have a question. How about if you do work that PCs pay 
  for? How does that affect your percentages?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;PC business is PC business. It makes enough money 
  on its own to not have to figure in.&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;Okay. SO the calculations are purely for assumed NPC biz. 
  Cool, gotcha.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Each 'rating' of redecorating adds 2% to your base 
  percentage.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm not gonna type that chart now, because it's simple.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'll post it later.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Any other quests about redecorating?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Nope&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;How does redecorating a machine shop, or a laundromat work?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;OKay. I'm AFK for a sec. Start an argument or something.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Those are almost all cash businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>Akiko has disconnected.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;all you do is supply the space.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Are you talking about the machine shop &amp; laundromat?&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;An argument eh? Ah, Americans suck.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta has disconnected.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;yes. Laundromat you can just call a service and 
  they'll throw their machines in for free, you split income and don't have to 
  worry abou tit. (Ik now because i've worked in management w/ my parents apartment 
  building)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Kthanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Yeah, so how would decorating such a service help profit?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;It wouldn't. That is where admin judgement comes 
  in :)&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That is where Erlkonig's 'rating points' or whatever 
  come in. He can say &quot;no that makes no sense&quot; :)&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Judgement is key&quot;</p>
<p>Anima puts doilies and flowers around her body shop's garage :)</p>
<p>Jane pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>Lymph nods</p>
<p>Penta actually wonders...Why should decorating help, say, a gunshop? As Anima 
  just facetiously semi-noted (I think?) with that pose...Wouldn't most businesses 
  on the grid here thrive more on Word of Mouth, instead of windowshoppers?</p>
<p>Anima was making just that point, Penta, albeit in a slightly wiseass manner.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Yes, in a way. Once again - admin judgement. If 
  it doesn't make sense to spend 40000 in redecoration...</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Next thing.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Cost of product.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Base cost of product is 60% for a biz. We'll change 
  that as business demands.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Bar's have either 10, 20, or 30, based on what kind 
  of liquor they stock.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta uhhs? 10, 20, or 30 what?</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;He is talking about costs&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta=dense?</p>
<p>Anima notes that if you're looking at real-world service industries, ie. the 
  aforementioned body shop, a good chunk of the cost is labor.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;We're talking parts, right now.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Labor is separate.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;And that percentage only factors in when selling stuff to 
  PCs right? As NPC transactions are just factored into the background?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;What you sell costs somethings. Lymph - these rules 
  deal only with NPCs.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;So 60% of the profit is lost for most businesses? Ah ok ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yup.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;Sorry, I didn't make it clear... I meant that the cost of 
  parts is usually a lot lower than that.&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;But anyhoo... I'll shut up and let you go on. :)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs. &quot;Like I said, Anima. This is all up to negotation. 
  This is only the temp values.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Now. Advertising!&quot;</p>
<p>Penta wonders...will Import/Export bizzes be possible under this system?</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;You can advertize! No advertising obviously impacts 
  your business negatively.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Import/Export. Should be.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta whees!</p>
<p>Penta lets Erl go on.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Your cost is admin judgement. Advertising affect, 
  once again, your percentage. 1 rating point of advertisiment adds 2% to your 
  base percentage, and you can have multiple advertisiments, even at the same 
  rating.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I agree with Import/export. I'm sure some of the 
  syndicates will like them.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods to Goldy. &quot;Or, shadowrunners.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Any questions about that?&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;Nope, makes sense to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta prolly missed it, but...how're rating points determined? And, what're 
  we doing about security? Any mandate for PC'd security.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Rating points are based on money spent on advertising. 
  Once again, I have a chart with costs. I'm just asking for questions/problems 
  with the method.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;As for security - if you have no security, your business 
  rep is going to suffer. I'll get to that eventually. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Lynna says &quot;Well, why wouldn't everyone advertise as much as they can 
  then?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;There is a poit where you can oversaturate a market 
  and not supply what you are offering to all the interested parties. Not to mention 
  prohibitive cost.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods his head.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Posing on the run... one sec...&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. You'll be happy to hear that the otherwise useless 
  Business Administration skill now actually affects the percentage _before_ the 
  roll.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Each point of business administration increased the 
  percentage by 1, to represent that you have some clue to what you're doing.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph notes that he didn't think the old skill was that useless, a business 
  paying for itself in 4 years is far beyond good in RL</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;Depends on the business.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;True&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Now. Managers. I want to see the managers actually 
  spending _some_ time at their businesses. In any case, as a manager you specify 
  how much time you spend at the biz, making sure things move smoothly.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Obviously, you spend time there, you help things keep 
  moving smoothly, you increase your profit. You just specify it at setup, and 
  we go from there. Capisce?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Anima nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Too much time, of course, will end up detracting from 
  your biz, as employees tend to dislike being micromanaged.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Perhaps specify a 'management style', to compensate?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Since, in a small smallbiz, the manager/owner could be one 
  of the people that actually has to work, alongside the other employees?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods and shrugs. &quot;I'm open to that.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Now comes the pain-in-the-ass. Employees.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;Sorry to digress, but there seems to be little risk in investing 
  in a businesses, Apart from gross mismanagement or things blowing up, is there 
  any way to lose your investment?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes. But can we deal with that at the end, Lymph?&quot;</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;If you're one of the primary sources of skill and work in 
  the place, how's that handled?&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;I wouldn't jump out of line like that normally, I just have 
  to leave in 2 ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs. ;)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;You hire an NPC manager. A good NPC manager sucks 
  40kay a year out of your business.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. There's going to be correcting 'market factors' 
  that will be implented in a month or two.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph says &quot;So you're way ahead of me? Great, that's all I needed to know 
  ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Four types of employees - Bad, Decent, Good, 
  and Excellent.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;All wages posted are at 'Decent'. You basically need 
  to figure out adequate staffing levels, and hire them.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;More complicated, yes. But more realistic.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody is blasting through things for Lymph.</p>
<p>Cowboy pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Whaddabout PC employees?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Well... you set their pay-level.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Using the NPC things as a guideline.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes would use 'decent' as a good starting point to see where tey 
  go, then raise it if they do well.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;For orgs, who have employees working for free, then 
  they don't have to worry about staffing.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;Staff can learn over time... they learn even better 
  if you train them. That's a possibilty.&quot;</p>
<p>Lymph has disconnected.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;You can hire worse staff first off, and train them 
  yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta moves his pondering from...PC I/E bizzes to...hmm. PC Sec businesses?</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;PC Sec bizzes... yes, its possible. My char runs one.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta ehs. I meant outside of orgs, Erl.:-)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs.</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Anyway...any benefits to training staff yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;that'd require instruction skill methinkings&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Cheaper wages, plus more loyalty. If you're good to 
  your staff, an admin can't come in and mess around with them as easily. For 
  example - being nice to your NPC Manager means that he won't skip town with 
  a month's profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;There's definitely more loyalty when you, say, take a crop 
  of Bad employees and meld them into Good ones over time. Pure comraderie, if 
  yer a good boss.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Sounds like leadership will help?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Now - here is what's gonna cause the _most_ complaints.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;The Business Administration chart has changed.... 
  drastically.&quot;</p>
<p>Anima braces for impact.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Because profits are inflated, the chart has gotten 
  harsh.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  ErlRemoteBody says &quot;<br>
  Crit -50<br>
  0 -30<br>
  1 -10<br>
  2 0<br>
  3 5<br>
  4 10<br>
  5 15<br>
  6 20<br>
  7 25<br>
  8 30&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;A critical failure loses you 50% of your funds.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;You don't start adding to your profits until you get 
  three successes.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;And even then, it's only 5% with three successes.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Want to hear my justification for this?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta sees. Go forth, Erl.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Is that a &quot;Yes, explain why it's so horrid&quot;, 
  or, &quot;No, I understand?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody grins.</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Explain, but it's great.:-)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta knows from his mom's time in real estate....Profit margins, even for 
  the big guys, are a LOT lower than it looks in a lot of industries.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Take a look at the pistols skill. Pistols 1 
  - you can barely hold the gun. Likewise, you barely understand how to run the 
  business. Pistols 2 - you're better, but you're still nowhere being able to 
  hit a moving target with it. And so forth. You aren't competant at anything 
  until you hit a skill of at least 3.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;The chart reflects that. You can do a decent job, 
  but you can't really improve anything.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;As for critical failures. Getting three in a row is 
  very, very bad. That's when the real problems begin. IRS audit. Maybe a massive 
  staff turnover. That sort of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Any questions/objections?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. Whereas, BusAdmin 8...Why are you in a smallbiz? Check with the 
  local mega, chummer, you kick ass.:-)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Exactly.</p>
<p>Anima says, &quot;I have one. Is the Business Admin skill limited by time as 
  to how quickly you can buy it up?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;PC Security/Shadowruns. How're those being handled (if you 
  remember how I referred you to CD, Erl...)?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Like everything else, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;However, if you're serious, you can get a level 3 
  business admin just a little bit over a month.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Oh - you will be penalized if you don't spend any 
  time in the business office. Forgot to mention that. I don't care if its disconnected 
  time, just show that your char-body is actually checking in. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;And...oh yeah...TAXES!!! Are businesses and PCs going to have 
  to pay those now? (I assume all biztypes will have a SIN...)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;I hate taxes. We're assuming that it's automatically 
  calculated.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;No way in _hell_ I'm gonna code the tax code in.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm an accountant's son, not an accountant.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta hehs.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods. Taxes are a bitch. Please don't try to duplicate that 
  :)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Well... That's the basics.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;You never answered by query of PC Sec and Shadowruns and such, 
  Erl.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;IIRC, actually, Denver mentions that UCAS has gone to a MUCH 
  simplified tax code. Just, IRS is more vicious.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I remember reading something about that penta&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes has Denver boxed so I probably read it there</p>
<p>Penta nods. I have Denver SB and Corp Shadowfiles upstairs in 5m grab, and 
  CD is in the other room, if people (Erl?) have questions.</p>
<p>Penta has Denver boxed too. I wish they did that for another city. Was a great 
  way to cover a place.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Like Lymph said, profits are quite large. That'll 
  change in around a month. I'll be coding a markets object. Including market 
  saturation.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Too many businesses of the same type _will_ start 
  cutting nto each other's profits.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;What this means, though, is you will also be able 
  to do hostile business practices.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus.</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Meeting here?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods, I liked it to penta</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yup.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta oohs. My mom works for GMAC's real estate div these days...I'm seeing 
  all manner of corp hijinks, as everybody tries to pick on GM.:-)</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Ok, hostile business tactics how? slurring or actual 
  illegal tactics?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Either.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;If you can force me to do the research. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes nods</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. Any final questions/comments/concerns?&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods.</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;I was wondering about how permits work for illegal businesses...that 
  are legal in their jurisdiction. (Like bizes in the UG.)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs. &quot;We're running 'em just like the rest. As long its 
  a place that joe blow NPC can get to, then its fine by the rules.</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;So I don't need to get ammo from a fixer anymore...I can 
  order it wholesale?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;One would hope.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;You can get it from an ammo supplier in the UG.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;What will those ugly tuskers think of next? :)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Or the Barrens, right?:-)&quot;</p>
<p>Spring exhales deeply. &quot;Excellent...in the UG...a PC supplier...or a NPC 
  biz?&quot;</p>
<p>Brujo goes home.</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;How about taxes...are there any?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;If we get a PC supplier, then we work through the 
  supplier. If not, NPC will be fine.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs at Gold.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Taxes?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Irellavant.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Is there a _formal_ way of advertising now?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Did we discuss that already?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;And I'm putting in CGNEEDED an advertising exec, so 
  you can actually go to someone to design your adds for you if you need.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That'd rule&quot;</p>
<p>Spring smiles. &quot;Excellent.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Anything else?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta uhs. &quot;Rep, security...</p>
<p>Penta seems to be ignored...</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs. &quot;Yes. ;)</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Rep?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Fergot 'bout that.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes, businesses have Rep.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Security?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Having security, depending on the place, will make 
  customers feel better and will increase the amount of businesses. Generally, 
  at the moment the formula I'm toying with is every 20kay in security gives you 
  a +1 biz rep.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;And where can we and other peeps see the Rep at?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. PC Security...hows it figure?</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;As for business rep... it's partly a measure of how 
  long you've been in business, and how well you've treated your customers.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;PC Security - as in, they provide sec for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Aye. People you employ as security.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;How you figuring Rep...do you already know them...will you 
  tell us about them???&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes, you will get to see your bizrep.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;That's not complete as of yet, though.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Starting rep is quite simple - every year you've been 
  in biz, you get +1. Each 20kay of sec (mechanical) increases your rep.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;How do you deal with people who _inherited_ their biz?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Here is one. Mutiple investors: Partnerships, Small 
  corporations, etc.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Any penalties for NOT having security?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;No penalities.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;How are those handled?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Like anything else, really. The biz is the biz.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;No penalties for not having Sec....Errrrrrrrr....&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Does a laundromat need security?&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;How do we go about finding out how much security we already 
  have?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm talking systems, not employees.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;maybe an armored car ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;We sit down and talk.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;If you don't hire security guards when your biz needs 
  it, then problems may erupt from understaffing. For example, a club with no 
  bouncers is gonna have one _hell_ of a repair bill/liability suit/etcetera&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Are you going to come a knocking one of these nights and 
  have a chat with us about all of this...one on one?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm sitting down with each business owner/manager 
  personally and getting the initial setup done.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;There are gonna be some things that need to be set 
  up for each type of business. These rules are flexible, and the code will reflect 
  that.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Will there be like a _Yellow Pages_ for us...you know with 
  a little blib or something about our bizes?&quot;</p>
<p>Lynna says &quot;A +whoswho for bizzes.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;It'll be coded. I'm doing all the code myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring smiles. &quot;That's nice.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;The nod was to both Lynna and Spring. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta wonders when our local bizzes will start hiring.:-)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;That's another thing. NPC Bizzes _will_ start hiring 
  PC staff. I've already done that with one that I've set up.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;Is there a way to advertise for PC employees in Chargen?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;That's possible now.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;No staff has ever told you that before. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Spring smiles. &quot;Let me know more about that, please.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;I'm gonna get BC approval to drop a 'Characters Needed' 
  object for smallbiz alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That'll be nice.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;We still working with the posted salaries off the small biz 
  board...or did that change.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Posted... salaries?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Oh, you mean the ones I'm _gonna_ post? ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;About the investments and the bus adm and whatnot.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yes, that's gonna be your guidline for hiring.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;Okay...just wondering.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;However, with PC staff, you can actually _negotiate_ 
  what you pay them more easily than NPC staff. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;How do we go about unhiring NPC staff...hehehe...&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;YOU'RE FIRED!&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;That's how you do it. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;And then you tell me.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Penta - have I missed any of your questions?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Shadowruns. How're those being done? Basically like in Corp 
  Shadowfiles/Corp Download, or something special?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Umm... well, as for shadowruns, you can hire runners 
  to strike against another biz... PC or NPC. And you can take it directly from 
  a biz bank account, if you wish.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;If your not online...does your NPC security still exist...I 
  mean...say there is a riot or something...do looters kill your stuff...when 
  your not there?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. How will the run affect the target mechanically? Purely an RP thing, 
  or...?</p>
<p>Penta looks at Spring. &quot;Tis the rare sec service that actually is effective 
  during a riot.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring frowns. &quot;That sucks...&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;What's the use of having security if they don't secure things?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;NPC security always is on, if you have them hired 
  for then.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;However, as PEnta says. If there's a riot... you're 
  more likely to lose the staff _and_ your things.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;How much security would you need...I mean...to almost be 
  safe...I do live in the UG you know...&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods and shrugs. &quot;Depends on area, depends on size of biz.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;I suppose we will discuss that when you come and talk to 
  us then?</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes suggests a couple anthroform droids and some golems</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs.</p>
<p>Penta hehs.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yup.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;We can have golems?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;If PCs are allowed to have golems, then I'm starting 
  up a scroll-cleaning service.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring blushes.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Sure you can have goelms&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Earht elementals&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody grins.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Free earth elemental (bound)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Now then...Lethal-force ability for security...how'z that 
  bein handled?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Or a Maybe a ally/familiar spirit&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods to Penta. &quot;Yeah I want to know that too.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;either way, it fits 'golem'&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;See the laws for self-defence and property defence.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;A biz is only a biz. Only corps can get away with 
  gunning down a tresspasser.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;In the news? Aren't those...old?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Erl: Seretech decision, anyone?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Seretech?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Seretech? I'm not familiar...&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Uh. Guys. 'And so it came to pass.' SR3. Y'know, front of 
  the bloody book?:&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Uh. Guys. 'And so it came to pass.' SR3. Y'know, front of 
  the bloody book?:-)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Allowed corps to use lethal force in protection of property, 
  personnel, or public safety.&quot;</p>
<p>Lynna pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes ahs yeah</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Okay. That's corps... businesses are different, unless 
  you have the resources to set up a mini-corp. Oh - and Gold. Tell Elana I don't 
  care how good a cyberdoc is, she doesn't have the funds. ;)&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes hehs.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Elana is a wild one, thats why I've got reigns on 
  her.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;I work for the UG Business Commision...is that like a corp?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Reign her in tighter, bub. ;) You don't have to 
  put up with her IRL.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody hmms. &quot;I need to look at the UG structure and rules.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes hehs. &quot;I can only reign her mouth so much tho :)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody laughs. &quot;Ah well - tell her honeybunch misses her. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Penta notes, Erl...the difference between a corp and a biz IS none. Incorporation 
  is a normal step for a business.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody ahs and hrrms. &quot;Still... I have to think on that.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;There's no size noted.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes smirks.</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Actually, most businesses these days incorporate ASAP. It 
  costs something like, what? $20000?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes thinks it should be legal for security on a business site to 
  whack someone if they bringin smg's</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;Yes - reasonable force is more what I'm thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods to JG and Erl. &quot;Yeah. Proportionate force still applies (Yay, 
  was able to grab Mike Mulvihill and hash this out on AOL the other night, sort 
  of), but lethal force is legal, as per US v. Seretech. IRL, it isn't. General 
  rule MM said for GMs to use? The moment the intruders fire the first shot....Yer 
  OK to let loose.:-)&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That sounds agreeable. What if they walk in armed 
  with smg's?&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That sounds like intent to use to me.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;It could be argued, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;I agree with that...I mean...people walk into my store all 
  the time...with weapons jumping all over the place!&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I'm just positing. Lets say you get a crew of oh. 
  6 guys armed and armored.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;Intent. You gotta warn em first (this is important) in ALL 
  cases, but....once they're warned....</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;A hearth spirit pops up, confuses the shit out of 
  them while a LONE STAR HIRED elemental commences to engulf and choke them todeath?&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Exactly....&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Not to Gold, to Penta.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Anyway, thats just a basic idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;Yeah. We have time enough to debate it wherever.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Dark elf king dude, Is that it? :)&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;I think it sounds cool.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody nods. &quot;That's it.</p>
<p>Spring says &quot;It?&quot;</p>
<p>As in, -Finis- :)</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Yup. ;)&quot;</p>
<p>Spring nods. &quot;See you when you drop in to check on my biz.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Anything else from you two?&quot;</p>
<p>Penta ponders...Mergers/Takeovers?</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Entirely possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. Buyouts by megas/bigger corps?</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;That depends on company structure.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;And whether it would be worth buying.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody draws himself a cup of coffee and sighs. &quot;Anyone got brandy? 
  I need a drink.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes hehs</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody sighs. &quot;Okay. Argh. I need to concentrate on my run, so 
  I'm logging off. And, BTW, thank you both for being polite and patient with 
  me. It's nice.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes says &quot;Np. It looks like a very cool system&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;No problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta nods. &quot;Can I be emailed a draft of the rules sometime?</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Don't worry - it's all being posted.&quot;</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody says &quot;Once I assemble them in a non-Erlkonig readable format.&quot;</p>
<p>Penta hehs.</p>
<p>Penta has disconnected.</p>
<p>Johnny Goldeyes pops back out to the OOC nexus.</p>
<p>ErlRemoteBody goes home.</p>
<p>Lymph leaves through a hidden trapdoor in the floor.</p>
