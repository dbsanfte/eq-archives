Morris says "Ok, I'm logging this, the second meeting on converting to 
  SR3, the most important stuff." 

Meg says "Skills, Running the Shadows, and Beyond the Shadows, yes?" 

Shutter is present. 

Morris says "We are going to start with skills, yes Meg." 
Morris says "While doing this we want to keep in mind any house rules we 
  have that are currenytly in place." 
Morris says "Since this is a much smaller group, just blurt anything 
  out, we'll sort it out later." 

Eldritch says "I really like what they've done with skills, except for 
  their idea that firing a hunting rifle, assualt rifle and shotgun are 
  all vastly different." 

Lawson says "Agreed Eldritch" 

Lilith arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Lilith pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Meg says "But they aren't." 

Lawson says "those are really similar IRL" 

Meg says "That's not the idea at all." 

Eldritch says "I could happily go with Pistols, SMGs, and Rifles, and 
  ditch the Shotgun skill and Assault Rifle skill" 

Lawson says "I agree" 

Shutter says "I disagree." 

Meg says "Single shot, solid-bore weapons are used differently than 
  automatic weapons or shotguns... I'm not talking about pulling the 
  trigger, I'm talking about the way you use 'em." 

Shutter says "The posture is the same but the way you aquire your target 
  and "aim" are different with each. Assualt rifle is a vauge term tho' 
  and I don't like that" 

Morris says "But they all have defaults to the other skills, so its not 
  as dont know as not having the skill." 

Meg nods to Shutter. 

Lawson says "We can argue about what is and isn't realall day folks, we 
  can use this time better. IRL, when I fire my friend's SKS or m14, or 
  Benelly, they are all basically the same. Not similar, but the same. 
  The question is, how cloesly to the sr3 do you wanna go" 

Shutter says "It could possibly be to nit-picky tho'" 

Lawson says "Cuz it isn't realistic at all, it's done to keep chars from 
  being really good in combat." 
Lawson says "It's mostly for game balance, obviously." 

Morris says "Is it something that can be livable with?" 
Morris nods to Lawson 

Lawson says "It really screws weapons specialists, but I can live with 
  anything:)" 
Lawson says "I like eldritch's idea, a lot, that's me. I will always be 
  happy to pay however the hive mind decides is best." 

Meg says "Wait, Lawson... when you fire your friend's rifles, are you 
  acquiring moving targets at range?" 

Lawson says "What do you calla deer:)?" 

Meg says "Usually, I call 'em a stationary target. Once they start 
  moving, yer wasting ammo." 

Shutter uses his hands like a scale SKS and Deer. 

Eldritch says "I certainly have no problem with 5 firearms skills. I'm 
  just saying that if I ran a tabletop game, I would either go with 
  Pistols, SMGs and Rifles, or just Pistols and Rifles, and count the 
  SMG as a pistol (if it's an UZI or Ingram Mac-10 style) or rifle (if 
  it's a HK MP5 style) depending on the individual weapon" 

Meg says "And if yer hunting deer, I'm willing to bet yer using 
  solid-bore ammunition in the shotgun." 

Lawson says "Yes we are" 

Morris says "From game terms, defaulting to another weapon skill, like 
  from shotgun to rifle on gives you a +2 TN." 

Meg says "Right. which means the shotgun becomes a smoothbore longarm, 
  not a weapon firing shot." 

Morris says "You still roll the same number of dice, just you are 
  limited in your CP usage." 

Lawson says "Sure Morris, all I can offer is this. If you want reality, 
  there's NO difference in sighting a 12 guage, or 30 ought 6, or m14, 
  or sks. If you want game balance, you need to decide what you think is 
  fair. the rules as written do not reflect reality, and are pretty 
  harsh on gunmen. If you're cool with that, then that's where you wanna 
  play." 

Meg nods to Morris, "The way the rules work makes sense to simulate the 
  unfamiliarity with either autofire or with spreading-field munitions.. 

Eldritch says "I can see a +2TN going from pistol to rifle, because 
  they're completely different... I mean, +2TN is +50% difficulty at 
  short range. That's reasonable for unrelated things like pistol 
  marksmanship and rifle marksmanship." 

Morris says "How harsh are they really thoug?" 

Eldritch says "And just to note here, Meg." 

Lawson says "well Morris, consider e as an example ok?" 

Shutter says "Personally I like Rifle, Pistol, SMG, add a modifier to 
  the TN and go from there. But yes there is a difference between 
  sighting those weapons." 

Eldritch says "Shotgun skill covers shot or slug ammo." 

Meg says "well, personally, if I were writing up SR3's longarm rules 
  from scratch (as opposed to proposing modifications to the rules that 
  incoming players are going to be expecting), I'd say work it as 
  follows:" 

Shutter says "Lets vote, what are our options. I can live with any of 
  the stuff that has been floor so far...Just need to decide." 

Lawson wants to hear Meg's idea 

Shutter ditto's 

Lawson would also like to note that he respects the people in this room 
  and finds them intelligent and well-spoken so even if we disagree, I'm 
  not trying to be rude to you personally. We just have idffering 
  opinions. I learn a lot from these meetings. 

Meg says "1 skill: Rifles. Autofire can be applied 2 ways... spray n' 
  pray (lowers tn, no additional damage) or precision (increased tn, 
  increased damage). shot/flechette rounds would lower tn to hit (-1 at 
  short range, -2 all other ranges), but start at lower damage (9S slug 
  = 6M shot)" 

Eldritch says "Let's not redesign the ranged combat rules." 
Eldritch says "We're just talking about skills here." 

Meg nods, "I know, Eldritch... but that's a more accurate reflection of 
  how the familarity with longarms works, when shifting from one type to 
  another." 

Eldritch says "From a new player's perspective, which is worse? To read 
  a news post that says we don't use the Shotgun or Assault Rifle 
  skills, or a post that redesigns the entire ranged combat system?" 
Eldritch says "Or neither?" 

Lawson says "I think the pistols/smg's/rifles version is still fair for 
  game balance, and not too horribly unrealistic, so that gets my vote 
  *shrug*" 

Morris nods to Eldritch. "So are we saying that Assault and Shotgun and 
  Rifle be made one things called Rifle? 

Lawson nods to Morris 

Eldritch says "I think that would be most reasonable. Then at least the 
  shooter types don't totally get the shaft on TNs from defaulting." 

Shutter says "I think we need to stick as closely to the printed rules 
  as possible. I like the catch all Rifle" 

Meg says "As I said, if I was designing from scratch... not suggesting 
  mods... as it is... I'd say leave the rules as is. Otherwise, Jo-jo 
  the redneck who shoots quail every day with a 20-gauge rabbit-ear 
  firing birdshot is an ace sniper with a H&K G11 assault rifle from 
  1000 yards..." 

Morris says "I's say that specializations take that into account." 

Eldritch doesn't like specializations at all 

Shutter agrees with Morris. 

Lawson says "And yet we kind of have to include them now eldritch" 

Meg says "then I think we should encourage people to specialize, if 
  their BG doesn't justify familiarity with a variety of weapons." 

Morris says "Jo-jo is going to have a low rifle skill and high shotgun 
  spec." 

Eldritch says "Yeah, right, like I ONLY know how to use a M9 pistol, and 
  I can't aim a Desert Eagle half as well..." 

Meg says "No, Eldritch... more like 'I know how to fire a colt 
  M1911A1... I'm not ready for the heavier kick of the Desert Eagle 
  .50AE, nor the fact that the grip is a good .45 inches wider." 

Eldritch says "And that takes off 50% of your accuracy?" 

Morris says "In game terms, if you want to be good at all pistols spend 
  the cost to raise the base skill, dont take the cheap way out." 

Meg says "I've seen people hit themselves in the forehead the first time 
  they shot a DE... not with the bullet, of course, but with the slide 
  of the gun 'cause they just -weren't- expecting that much kick." 

Eldritch says "Did they miss, though?" 

Meg is a bit ashamed to admit I found it rather funny to see. 
Meg nods, "Big time." 

Shutter says "If you are familiar with a sidearm, and fire it you become 
  accustomed to it's windage, and feel. You will fire it better. It 
  could effect your accuracy terribly Say your used to your 45 
  peacekeeper circa 1810 and you pick up a Sig...Your expecting it to 
  shoot 4 feet to the left?" 

Morris says "I think you're focusing too much on RL and loosing site of 
  the game system, specialization is a cheaper way to be good, but there 
  is a cost." 

Lawson says "I agree Morris" 

Shutter snickers and agrees. 

Meg says "All I'm saying is that I think when the BG doesn't provide for 
  a broad familiarity, specializations should be encouraged." 

Eldritch says "From a specialization to a general is only +1TN anyway, 
  right?" 

Lawson says "+3" 

Eldritch says "What?" 

Meg says "No TN change, just fewer dice." 

Lawson says "Well on the lil chart it +2 +3 +4" 

Meg says "firing a sniper rifle w/yer Predator Specialization is +3" 

Eldritch says "I haven't really read up on SR3's defaulting stuff" 
Eldritch says "I mean firing a Manhunter with your Predator skill" 

Morris says "No Eldritch, you use the base skill. if you are Pistol(DE) 
  5(9), you use the 5 for all other Pistols. Defaulting only applies to 
  other skills." 

Lawson says "Kee rect" 

Eldritch says "What if you don't have Pistol (Spec) 5 (9)" 

Lawson says "so +0 tn eldritch, just less dice:)" 

Eldritch says "What if you only have (Spec) 9" 

Lawson says "then what are you defaulting too eldritch?" 

Meg says "you can't." 

Shutter says "It all sucks, but which provides the best balance, and 
  ease of implementation as far as conversion, and which do we want." 

Lawson says "You have to have the base skill eld" 
Lawson says "Can't just have the spec" 

Eldritch says "Ah." 
Eldritch obviously hasn't read much of the details 

Meg says "No specialization can have a rating higher than twicethe base 
  skill rating." 
Meg says "So no Pistol (Pred) 1 (6)" 

Morris nods to Meg. 

Lawson says "I also, nod to Meg" 

Morris says "So any additional problems with the Specialization rules?" 

Lawson says "They have a real good system for defaulting now IMHO, no 
  probs there" 
Lawson says "Yeah Morris, who gets to re-code chargen to list every 
  possible spec in the sr universe:)?" 

Meg nods, "Defaults work really nicely." 

Morris says "Ok, I like it too." 

Lawson offers meg a Hi5 

Meg thinks that'd be us BC ppl. 

Morris says "Thats for a later implementation meeting, one option 
  brought up last time was let the PCs fill it in and have the approving 
  admin do a more thorough review and approve all specs and skills." 

Shutter says "That's a good way to implement the skills right 
  away...code at leisure." 

Lawson says "But we all vote that specs have to be a part of sr3 right?" 

Morris says "Ok, well its a part of SR3, we'd need to vote to remove 
  it." 
Morris says "I think the specialization system will work." 

Eldritch says "It's wierd. I like that we don't use specializations in 
  SR2, but since SR3 changes SR2 Concentrations into General skills, we 
  really have to have specializations to make up for the hole." 

Morris says "Thats a good point, but I wanted to review all house rules, 
  no specs had been one. Is it still appropriate?" 

Meg says "Actually, Eldritch, most of the skills remain as they were... 
  it's only Firearms, Gunnery, and Armed Combat that got broken down." 
Meg says "Concentrations have just been renamed Specializations." 

Eldritch says "And Physical Sciences, and a couple of other ones too" 

Meg says "Well, Physical Sciences was a silly skill to being with." 

Shutter ponders 

Lawson says "To you Meg:)" 

Meg says "Hmm... I studied astrophysics... that means I can predict the 
  weather!" 

Lawson says "We can all make jokes about sr rules holes" 
Lawson says "Yes Morris, we needs Specs now" 
Lawson says "We have to do it,it's where the game went" 
Lawson says "We'll have to follow IMHO" 

Meg nods, "Yeah. Specs are definitely in." 

Eldritch says "Actually, I would say that most astrophysicists should be 
  able to read a weather map. Hell, I can, and I barely know anything." 

Lawson says "Let's stay with the main points crew, please:)?" 

Shutter says "Specializations are a yes it appears." 

Eldritch nods 

Morris says "Ok, then next is active skills, we've allready covered some 
  firearms.." 

Eldritch says "We need to address the changes in the Etiquette skill... 
  I LIKE SR3's Etiquette skill. The thing is, the MUX currently uses 
  Etiquette as a sort of Background Knowledge skill." 

Morris says "We'll get to that." 
Morris says "One last thing on specializations, it allows multiple 
  specs, any comments?" 
Morris says "Just thought of that." 

Meg says "I see no problem with that." 

Lawson says "It's a silly to do, but if you really wanna" 
Lawson says "I don't see why not" 

Eldritch says "Hey, if you want to waste the karma to learn more than 
  one specialization instead of getting the general skill, who am I to 
  argue?" 

Lawson says "exactly eldritch" 

Morris nods 

Meg says "I'd have to take a look at how +sheet works, but.... I -think- 
  it could be done w/out TOO much hassle." 

Eldritch figures +sheet will need a major overhaul anyway 
Eldritch says "+Sheet will have to have seperate areas for Active 
  skills, Knowledge Skills and Background Skills, just so you can tell 
  which is which." 

Lawson says "About Active skills Morris, what do you wnat input on?" 

Morris says "Active skills are pretty much the same as many skills here, 
  nothing really new. If there are no comments, lets move to Knowledge 
  skills." 

Meg says "Actually, we might wanna look into just grabbing germany's 
  +sheet... it's one of the better points of the MUX. :/" 

Lawson says "I think they're pretty self-explanatory, no problems here, 
  justify them in BG" 
Lawson says "but that's me" 

Morris says "Do we want to allow any skill the PC can think of?" 

Eldritch says "Might be better to try to come up with an exhaustive 
  list" 

Meg says "No..." 

Lawson says "I myself like trusting players. AN admin is capable of 
  telling someone that a skill in inapropriate" 

Meg says "Much easier to go with a definable field, and +gmnote the poor 
  sap as to exactly what the skill's supposed to be, if it's unclear." 

Eldritch says "At least that way you don't have to worry about PC#1 
  spending general skill karma to learn Forensics, and have PC#2 spend 
  general skill karma to learn only Forensic Pathology..." 

Lawson says "hey if you all wanna try and make a list of interest known 
  to man go nuts" 
Lawson says "i think it's gonna be tough to do myself." 

Morris says "But they give a specific example where some has a spec that 
  is the same as somes general, I think its on elven wine." 

Lawson says "To me, these skills should come from your creativity as you 
  design your character. Again, that's me" 

Eldritch grunts 
Eldritch says "If I see one damn character with the Elven Wines skill, I 
  swear..." 

Lawson says "if they overlap or run together, that's because the two 
  players ave different Ideas" 
Lawson says "And that's ok to me" 

Morris says "And they know different things about it, but then its up to 
  the admin finding info for someone to determine the difference." 

Eldritch nods 

Meg says "The guy who knows forensic pathology at 5 will know it more 
  thoroughly than the guy w/forensics at 5... he'll know the obscure 
  crap about who discovered what, etc..." 

Lawson says "And see I guess that's for player and judge to work out 
  together in the spririt of fun" 

Eldritch says "Ah. Good question." 

Lawson says "I don't need a hard and fast rule on these" 

Morris says "But starting the etiquette issue, I think we need to define 
  some specific skills that will take the place of the current etiquette 
  skills." 

Shutter says "I like general skills with judge envokde moddies to fit 
  the situation. But that's me." 

Eldritch says "Do we go with SR3 using Computer skill for hacking and 
  programming, or require two different skills like we do now?" 

Meg says "So I take it 'etiquette' is a goner, hey? ;)" 

Morris says "Thats something that I feel the matrix crew should decide." 
Morris says "No, etiquette is still a skill, but its not what we've been 
  using it for." 

Eldritch says "SR3 Etiquette has a great deal of overlap with 
  Negotiations." 

Lawson says "When you're playing IC, when have you all needed to roll 
  Ettiquette?" 

Eldritch says "If I were running a tabletop game, I would allow 
  Etiquette as a Complimentary Skill for negotiation rolls. I'd also 
  allow any relevant Background Knowledge skill, but then, I tend to be 
  flexible." 

Morris says "I feel the SR3 etiquette skill is for actually making 
  people think you fit in, its an influencing skill now." 

Eldritch says "Precisely" 

Lawson says "And here Morris, your typing does more than a number on 
  your +sheet" 

Shutter says "Or Affluence" 

Lawson says "If I see a guy in a suit with a limo in redmond, if he 
  isn't an established local, I don't -care_ what his etiquette is, he's 
  a target. Ok well, not to _me_ but to many others." 
Lawson says "It's one of those things that's different between a MUX and 
  TT IMO" 
Lawson says "Here you're responsible for your own "getting accepted and 
  recognizing prominent individuals"" 

Morris says "Thats true." 
Morris says "So does the etiquette skill from SR3 have a place in the 
  MUX?" 

Eldritch says "I don't think so." 
Eldritch says "But Background Knowledge skills DEFINITELY make up for 
  what we use Etiquette for now" 

Lawson says "I would agree with that" 

Morris says "I think it has a limited value, but only if an admin allows 
  you to use it against NPCs." 

Shutter says "I agree with that, it's not much use in PC to PC Rp." 

Lawson says "AS written on page 87 SR3, no, IMO that skill is not 
  concurrent with MUXing dynamics" 

Eldritch says "It just gets funky... We need to split skills up a little 
  differently, because it's possible to have Computer as an active 
  skill, AND a Background Knowledge skill" 

Meg says "I think the etiquette skill from SR3 can be better implemented 
  with knowledge skills... as well as a Streetwise Active Skill that 
  covers more than knowing how to act, but also being able to project 
  the right kind of image..." 
Meg says "ie: tough enough to not be worth it, but not a threat." 

Morris says "The active skill means you can do it, knowledge skills mean 
  you know about it, you cant use a knowledge skill as a active skill." 
Morris says "Meg, I think most of the social skills dont work well in a 
  MUX environment, especially in PC to PC encounters." 

Lawson says "for the way the MUX works, bg know skills and CHA should be 
  plenty on the rare occasion you need to impress an NPC in a plot or 
  whatever, IMO." 

Morris says "However, there may be enough NPC encouters where 
  Interrogation or Negotiation may be useful" 

Lawson says "yeah I would agree with that" 
Lawson says "With a judge, those can eve work pc vs pc" 
Lawson says "there's a tangible result." 

Eldritch says "I like Negotiation and Interrogation." 

Lawson says "Sounds like we all do." 

Morris says "We can leave all the skills in, but we need to make it 
  clear that other skills are doing what etiquette used to do." 

Meg says "Ok... then how do we determine access to Streetwise, if not 
  w/Etiquette of a Streetwise skill?" 

Eldritch is concerned about the Computer skill, though. 
Eldritch says "Background Knowledge: Streetwise" 

Lawson says "Sounds good to me" 

Meg makes a note to have that mentioned in the CG info, then, so ppl 
  know to take it. 

Lawson says "That's Meg, always planning ahead:)" 

Meg does try, yes. 

Eldritch says "Just have a number of pre-thought up ideas for Background 
  Knowledge skills, and then ALSO have a slot that the PC can fill in on 
  his own" 

Lawson says "And eldritch, maybe do that anway" 
Lawson says "For all know skills" 

Morris says "Thats a good idea, or just a list people can look at to get 
  idead." 

Eldritch says "What about Computer?" 

Lawson says "Offer a list of em" 
Lawson says "and then say, or make up your own" 

Eldritch says "It seems rediculous to me that there should be a seperate 
  skill for writing programs and a seperate skill for hacking." 

Morris says "I dont know Eldritch, that is one that the Matrix people 
  will decide. They have it that way for a reason." 

Meg thinks hacking, as they present the SR decking version of it, should 
  be a specialization of computer... after all, it's just programming on 
  the fly. 

Morris says "In SR3 they are different specs under computers." 

Eldritch says "I think if Firearms is going to get broken up, then it 
  would probably be reasonable to break up Computer too." 

Lawson says "I am comfortable leting Aneki and co haggle that out" 

Eldritch says "Instead of the Computer skill with Hardware, Decking, 
  Programming, and Cybernetics, have Hardware, Programming, Decking and 
  Cybernetics" 

Morris says "And have them default to each other?" 

Eldritch says "Then have specific specializations under there... Decking 
  (Specific Test) for instance... Maybe you have a Specialization in 
  Logon To Host Operations..." 
Eldritch says "Or a Specialization in Programming (Browse)" 
Eldritch says "Yeah, Bubba? He writes a bitchin' Browse program." 

Lawson says "It sounds to me like Eldritch should talk to the Matrix 
  group, cuz he has good ideas" 

Morris says "I agree." 

Eldritch has a unique perspective, because ICly, he's into guns, magic, 
  and computers. 

Lawson says "I had no idea there was IC email ntil Jet told me, that 
  give you a clue as to how matrix savvy I am:)?" 

Shutter listens. 

Morris says "Ok, lets talk about Stealth, any comments on how that 
  works?" 

Meg keeps forgetting about that, too ;) 
Meg says "AFK a sec..." 

Shutter says "Needs a refresher." 

Morris says "Is the open test a good thing?" 

Eldritch says "I don't think that open tests are as bad as people seem 
  to think." 
Eldritch says "The real problem with them is that they make consistancy 
  difficult." 

Morris says "Shutter, an open test is you roll your stealth skill, then 
  the highest roll isthe target number for other people to spot you." 

Eldritch says "Even if you have Stealth 6, which is VERY good, you might 
  stumble around like a moron one time, and then be completely invisible 
  the next." 
Eldritch +rolls 6 dice: 1 1 1 3 4 11 
Eldritch says "For instance. Your TN to spot me is an 11." 

Lawson says "I have been playing with open tests IRL for a while" 
Lawson says "_I_ have no problem with them" 
Lawson says "yes they make for some weird moments" 
Lawson says "But any good gm works around dice quirks" 

Eldritch says "That's a NICE roll. But what happens when the person who 
  performs the skill "Innate"ly rolls something like 1 1 3 3 4 5? 
  There's no margin for someone being consistantly sneaky." 

Morris says "Is there a better way?" 

Eldritch says "Maybe make the minimum TN for an open test be equal to 
  the skill?" 

Lawson says "Or trust your judges:)" 
Lawson says "To not just screw people for a bad dice roll, but that's 
  me:)" 

Morris says "I think its not that bad, it does allow for bad rolls, but 
  also for very good ones. Sometimes exterior events can undo your best 
  efforts." 

Eldritch says "So if you've got Stealth 6, you can count on your foe 
  having to roll a 6 or better?" 
Eldritch says "I mean, your foe still has the Rule of Six to screw you 
  with..." 
Eldritch says "That way you don't have to worry about screwing yourself 
  when you're good, though, you know?" 

Lawson says "Well I recommend this" 
Lawson says "Play with it, THEN you will know what's broken, if 
  anything" 
Lawson says "We can always ADD house rules, but it's looks better if we 
  don't subtract them" 
Lawson says "Soemtimes you gotta see it in action to really speak with 
  authority" 

Morris says "I think unless your skill os over 8, you'll get your skill 
  most of the time." 

Lawson says "As written, I don't see a major problem." 

Meg says "Back" 

Morris says "Any comments on open tests?" 

Shutter says "No Problems with them." 

Meg thinks Lawson's right on this one. 

Morris says "Ok, noting Eldritch's idea, I think we should start with 
  them as written." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Morris says "Finally Language skills, sounds like a 4 is now the minimum 
  for real conversation." 

Meg has a problem w/the language code as it is, but that's another 
  issue. 

Lawson says "I like the languages as we have them now. I was hoping we'd 
  just use the system to dtermine which ones you have" 
Lawson says "Sue the sr3 system to determine which ones you have, and 
  how high" 

Eldritch says "Yeah" 

Meg nods. 

Morris says "Ok." 
Morris says "Anything else on Skills?" 

Eldritch says "I'm not sure how I feel about the Read/Write skills... 
  Just seems like crappy AD&D stuff... You know, where only the Clerics 
  and Mages can read?" 

Meg says "Just a note so it's logged for the future: Can we at some time 
  review the current languages code? Words that are fairly basic in 
  concept get chopped up because of the way the language code works..." 

Morris nods to Meg. 

Meg says "ie: Someone w/(language): 3 will have a hard tiem saying 
  'tomorrow'" 

Eldritch says "My feeling on the language code is that if you can code a 
  better one that doesn't lag the MUX, by all means, go for it." 

Lawson says "eldritch, again, on a MUX when will r&w be a major issue?" 

Eldritch says "When you're trying to read the rules of the Banshee..." 

Shutter has no real problem with the lang code. 

Lawson says "You gonan re-write them not in english?" 

Eldritch says "Not like anyone doesn't carry their assault rifles in 
  there anyway..." 

Meg says "Or of any other place with posted notices... like all them 
  bulletin boards." 

Morris says "And add a +read language code." 

Lawson says "But folks,t hey're in english" 

Eldritch says "Yeah." 
Eldritch says "You have to BUY R&W English" 

Lawson says "If you wanna go there, sure, seems like a lotta hassle for 
  no real improvement to game play" 

Meg says "Lason: So what? If I speak English at 4, I only read it at 2." 

Lawson says "No Eldritch, I mean Craig can read em, even if Lawson 
  can't:)" 

Morris says "I agree on that." 

Lawson says "Unless you're gonna re-code eery sign for a +read code, 
  then r&w will have little effect" 
Lawson says "And personally, I don't see why we'd wanna do that, but if 
  you do, go nuts:)" 

Morris says "Ok, lets move on the running the shadows." 
Morris says "The first section is on perception." 

Meg rereads as we go. 

Lawson says "Seems pretty much the same" 
Lawson says "I saw nothing that raised an alarm" 

Morris says "Its not changed much, they now have a table that defines 
  what multiple successes means." 

Lawson says "So it's better defined, but the same....woohoo:)" 
Lawson begins to see the things Meg likes so much 

Eldritch says "Much of the stuff in Running the Shadows is paraphrased 
  stuff from Corporate Security" 

Meg thinks the nice, neat table of modifiers and such is a godsend :) 

Morris says "Next is security systems, a long section that looks an 
  awful lot like the thing in corporate security handbook." 

Lawson nods 

Eldritch says "Then there's yet another horribly inadequate section on 
  Credsticks and SINs" 

Lawson says "I personally don't have much to say about this stuff. It 
  looks good, it works. It's easy to find. A judge still has freedom to 
  tailor it his way." 

Morris says "Its mostly just descriptions, anyone see anything that 
  screams out?" 

Lawson says "Kudos for the physical search table" 

Morris says "Next is Fencing the Loot, which really doesnt apply hear, 
  and is covered mostylyby IC interactions." 

Lawson nods 

Meg likes having the table of perception/damage info on the various wire 
  types. 

Morris says "Ok, next is SINs." 

Meg always loved these... you can justify a riot by quoting scripture... 
  'let he who is without SIN cast the first stone'... 

Morris says "Based on the definitions in SR3, SINs are just a number 
  that has some personal info, they have Criminal SINs that do the whole 
  shebanf." 

Lawson says "Sorry" 

Meg nods, "Yeah.. SINs wind up basically just Soc Sec #'s in SR3..." 

Morris says "Do we want to make that the new standard, our current SIN 
  definition is more like Criminal SINs." 

Meg thinks it's a good idea... otherwise, we wind up making SINs more 
  restrictive than they are beneficial. 

Eldritch needs to call it a night 

Shutter says "From the small biz side of the house I'd like to see 
  everybody have a sin...that way they can get a bank account and not 
  make a big excursion of it." 

Eldritch waves 

Morris says "Also, that makes Fake SINs not a big deal, its just a 
  sequence of numbers, its the fake credstick that is important." 

Eldritch pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Meg nods. "Night, El." 

Morris says "SR3 does make better definitions of how credsticks fit in 
  and how to make a fake ID." 

Meg nods. 

Lawson nods 

Morris says "Ok, last in this is Lifestyles. They are pretty much the 
  same but add a Team Lifestyle." 

Lawson says "I wou;dn't, personally, because we don't do team stuuf like 
  now, no team karma for example, not that SR3 has it, I don't remember 
  either way" 

Meg says "Which isn't really an addition, it just mentions something 
  many groups were already doing." 

Lawson says "yeah if you want it, you can all rp it" 

Shutter says "No problem there." 

Morris nods 
Morris says "Ok, why dont we stop here and get into beyond the shadows 
  next time." 

Shutter okie's 

Lawson says "sure, can do" 

Meg nods, "Not a problem."
