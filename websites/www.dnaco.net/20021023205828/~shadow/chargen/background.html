There are currently 32 questions in the list and they are all important
in helping to define your character in the background you write. Take the
time to read them all and make sure that your background addresses all
these questions. Do NOT, however, attempt to submit a brief one-line answer
to all of these questions and then call that a background. We expect that
you will go to a little more effort than that in creating a background.
<P>
These questions are designed to provide a set of expectations regarding 
what sorts of information you should have to provide in your background.
They are by no means an exhaustive list, but many players have found them
useful in developing their background. 
<P>
A long time ago, one of the players on the game was nice enough to submit a 
background that he was willing to allow us to use as an <A title=Example

feel free to take a look.

<H5>The Questions</H5>
<OL>
<P><LI> What is your characters sex and race? <BR>
 
**This affects everything. Gender roles are blurred in 2058, but RPing a 
female character will be a different experience than a male.<BR>
  
There are no real race restrictions on Shadowrun MUSH. You can be human, 
elf, ork, troll or dwarf. However, certain RP considerations will come 
into play. Humans and elves generally can't get into the Ork Underground, 
for instance.<BR>

A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT RACES: One of the most common errors players make 
when designing their elf or dwarf player character is that they "changed" 
into an elf or dwarf when they were a teen. This DOESN'T happen, folks. 
Ever. Elves and dwarfs began being born to human parents in 2011.  It is 
only orks and trolls that 'goblinize' at puberty and this has not been 
common since the 2020s. If your 20-year old ork 'goblinized' when (s)he 
was 14, keep in mind that this is a VERY unusual occurrence by the 2050s. 
Quite frankly, the goblinized-as-a-teen angle is pretty much done to death. 
My advice? Say it once and say it loud! I'm trog and I'm proud! *grin***
 

<P><LI> What is your characters physical size? <BR>
 
**Is he exceptionally tall/fat/short/thin? Is she average? You'd be 
surprised how many "surprisingly large" trolls we get, how many tall, 
muscular humans and how many dwarfs that are "tall for a dwarf". We need 
more 'average' sized people and we also need more people to be 
un-perfect. It would be a nice change to see a couple of homely women,
perhaps a prematurely balding samurai and even a fat troll or three.**
 
<P><LI> What is the color of the characters hair, eyes, and skin? <BR>
 
**In the world of 2058, anything is possible, with cosmed surgery and 
implants and grafts. Be creative (without being ridiculous). If the 
character DOES have an artificially changed appearance, is it well done or 
cheaply done? Does it look GOOD, or just trashy? think about it. You may 
want to try adding some cyber-controlled animal-emulation bodyware. Or 
maybe your cybereyes have little holoprojectors that flash "Buy Fuchi!" 
What is cool and cutting-edge in fashion in 1998 is probably tacky and 
outdated in 2058. Maybe body piercing is passé but body coloring (with 
epidermal dye treatments) is the latest fad. Be original.**
  
<P><LI> What is the character's general appearance (i.e., How does he dress, 
etc.)? <BR>
 
**Not EVERYONE wears all black. Not EVERYONE wears trenchcoats all the 
time. Lord knows I've seen far too many people wearing STEREOTYPICAL 
clothes and claiming to look "striking". If you're a standout, be REALLY 
different in your desc. If you blend in, blend in, while remembering that 
black ain't the only color. Think about the colors you wear IRL. Some 
of us wear all black, all the time. Most of us have SOME other colours 
in the ol' closet. Be original. You may even get +nommed for a very good 
desc.**
  
<P><LI> Where was the character born (City, State, Hospital Name)? <BR>
 
**A word of advice. If you don't know the situation on SRMUSH, (i.e. you 
haven't played here before) make your character an import. Be from somewhere 
else, and be new to Seattle. That way, your ignorance of how things work will 
be IC. Also, if you are from Seattle, be specific about what area you're 
from. Don't just say "a slum". Or "a corp". Give your street or your 
neighborhood or your corp a name. A further note, if you are going to be 
from a place that has a published sourcebook, make sure you have the 
sourcebook, so you don't conflict with "established" events. Pick a city or 
a place that hasn't been profiled if you don't want to run into problems 
-- there's LOTS of places that don't have sourcebooks, chummers.**
    
<P><LI> What is the character's date of birth?<BR>
  
**This is important. A good way to score points with BGreviewers is to 
mention the impact of global events on your character's life. If you were 
born early in the 21st century, how did VITAS impact you? The Crash? The 
Night of Rage? There's a timeline in the SRIII rulebook as well as on 
various Shadowrun websites. Sort out when your character was born and what 
might have happened to her because of these major events. Also, if there's 
a sourcebook for your city of origin, try to scan it for ITS timeline, 
too.**

<P><LI> What was the character's family life like?<BR>
 
**For cryin' out loud, please stop killing off all of your loved ones in 
your backgrounds. The theme of "The corps/yakuza/gangs/Hare Krishnas 
killed my wife/kids/mom/dad/pet hamster Willy in backgrounds is 
overdone. Which isn't to say it CAN'T be done, just that about every third 
player wants to be an orphan. Families are good RP material. You can send 
them nuyen to help out, they can be used as leverage to get you to do things 
for that evil Mr. J. Hell, maybe your brother hates your guts and he's a 
Johnson now and HE'S trying to kill you. Be creative.**
  
 
<P><LI> Has the character begun his own family?<BR>
 
**This doesn't necessarily have to be something the character KNOWS about. 
I once wrote a BG where the character had an illegitimate son that he knew 
nothing about. It was just in there for flavour and as a plot hook for 
later. Perhaps you could write a cooperative background with another player 
to play a husband and wife, or a pair of lesbian life-partners, or whatever 
kind of family you want. This is a super way to guarantee you'll have RP. 
This can also be extended to runner teams and such. If you KNOW someone 
who plays here, ask about including them in your BG. This can be something 
as simple as a contact or buddy, or you could be a long-lost brother. Or 
whatever. If you don't know anyone here, there is a chargen contacts-system 
in place to help matchmaking.**
  
<P><LI> Where or how was the character educated?<BR>
 
**This is more than just schools.  This is how the character was trained 
do whatever it is that he or she does. A major problem with this issues is 
that I can't count the number of backgrounds that claim the character was 
"trained to be a shadowrunnner" like there's a shadowrunners' union or 
something. There is NO shadowrunner guildhall, in the AD&D sense. There are 
also a legion of characters who had a shadowrunner-mentor who taught them 
"all the tricks of the trade". Ex-military characters are also overdone. 
When thinking about where your character learned what she learned, explore 
alternate paths. Learning to fight is usually a smaller part of people's 
lives. Few people spend years and years training to fire a gun, unless they 
are Olympic marksmen or professional cops/soldiers. If your character WAS 
in the army, did they pick up any NON combat skills? Also, a basic soldier 
in the UCAS army receives enough training to make them quite deadly in 
comparison to Joe Q. Public. Not every ex-military character needs to be part 
of an elite Navy Seals-type unit. And if they WERE part of such a unit why 
did they leave after the army spent millions of =Y= training them and 
implanting them with cyberware? How did they get away?**
    
<P><LI> Has the character ever done anything else for a living? <BR>
 
**This might be grouped in with #9, education. Whether your teen years 
were spent at a prep school or running drugs for the mafia, thinking about 
other employers, legitimate or illegitimate is an important part of 
character development.**
    
<P><LI> What are the characters beliefs on church and state?<BR>
 
**Politics and religion, chummer. The two most volatile topics at any 
cocktail party. Be aware of what politics and religion have become in 2058 
and think about how your character regards them.**
    
<P><LI> Describe the character's moral code. Include how mercenary he is, 
whether or not he'll kill innocents, etc.<BR>
 
**Completely immoral/remorseless characters are generally not accepted on 
this MUSH. The stone-cold sociopaths are the BAD guys, chummer. Even if your 
character is a paid assassin for the yakuza, she needs to have some sort 
of feelings towards the slain. There ideally should be some kinds of things 
that a character will NOT do for money, everyone needs to have their limits. 
it's good RP. This is exemplified by the character Rico in the SR novel 
"Fade to Black". Rico stands by his own personal code, even when it could 
cost him his life. This may also include the 'samurai code' various people 
talk about regarding street samurai honour and the Mercenary Code in
The Fields of Fire sourcebook.**
  
<P><LI> What are the character's goals?<BR>
 
**A character with no goals will stagnate on the MUSH. If you have goals, 
even unattainable ones like "protect the innocent", your character has 
direction. You will know better how to RP the character in new situations 
if you take into account what she wants out of life. Some people say you are 
what you do. I say that you are also what you want. Desires shape actions 
that lead to the realization of the desires. Define both short and longer-
term goals. Perhaps the character's shortterm goal is to join the Ancients 
and their longterm goal is to find their long-lost mother. Be innovative!**
     
<P><LI> Why does the character run the shadows? (Why does he run the shadows 
still, rather than getting a "real" job?)<BR>
 
**Most people don't PLAN on becoming shadowrunnners. It just happens. It's 
NICE to work for a corp. You know where your next paycheck's coming from, 
you work regular hours, you can sleep relatively soundly at night. It 
ain't all bad, chummer.**
 
<P><LI> What kind of personality does your character have? <BR>
 
**Three words. Detail, detail, detail. This is critical for RPstaff to 
judge your RP and award those nifty "RPing in character" Karma awards. 
I personally prefer a personality synopsis in a single slot of the BG, 
in which the character's basic personality is described.**
  
<P><LI> What special qualities does the character possess? This does not refer 
to skills, but rather at other things, such as How he gets along with 
people, does he plan ahead, does she speak with an annoying voice, does he 
pick his nose all the time, etc.<BR>
 
**Everyone has 'quirks' and they can really help you RP. Think about them 
and include them in your BG.**
 
<P><LI> Are their certain things the character can't or won't do? Why?<BR>

**The flip-side of the special-qualities coin. Think in terms of habits,
fears, phobias and such. Everyone has problems.**
       
<P><LI> What things, people, or ideas does the character hate?<BR>
 
**Not everyone HATES megacorporations. Be reasonable. Corps probably MADE 
everything your character owns. Also think in terms of racial or ethnic 
prejudices. Racial prejudice is RAMPANT in 2058. Racism is almost popular, 
kind of like being a Republican. One caveat: Racial prejudice, even extreme, 
does not equal "I want to kill all the trolls/breeders/elves/whatever. 
So you have an extreme prejudice against orks. This doesn't mean you get 
into a lather and pull out the Predator II every time you see an ork. It 
means you are almost totally convinced that they're subhuman or otherwise 
worthy of contempt. You may just refuse to acknowledge them Despite YOUR 
prejudice, the UCAS law still counts orks as citizens, so if you blow one 
away, it's still MURDER, chummer. Prejudice can be insidiously subtle. 
Perhaps you PITY the orks. Perhaps you just don't think that trolls are 
human. Perhaps the trogs are like little monkey children that must be 
supervised closely. Be prejudiced, just don't be stupid.**
        
<P><LI> What things people, or ideas does the character love?<BR>
 
**If you don't have anything to love, be prepared to RP a depressed 
person.**
 

<P><LI> What is the character's name? Give both full birth name, as well as 
nicknames, street names, etc.<BR>
 
**A shocking number of backgrounds don't include a last name for a 
character. Something else worth noting . . . give important people in 
your backgrounds names as well. That way, maybe an NPC can ask you about 
"Three-Finger Jimmy" (that Yakuza chummer of yours from your BG who was 
really inept) when you're IC, and you'll know what the hell they're talking 
about. This is much more IC and more satisfying than having some 
Rpadmin page you OOC and say "You know Jimmy from your days in New York, 
he's the Yakuza guy who used to sell you the odd piece of tech from time 
to time."**
 
<P><LI> Come up with a reason for why the character became a shadowrunner. 
(This is not the same as #14, but rather why he started running the 
shadows originally. What led him to it?)<BR>
  
**This is pretty self explanatory, but a good example of thinking a 
character through. Every person has a number of 'turning points' in their 
life that had critical impacts on the way they continued on through their 
existence. Explain the turning points for your character.**
 
        
<P><LI> Does the character have a SIN? Does the character actually use it?
Or is the character one of the SINless masses? This may be affected by 
the characters previous employment.<BR>
 
**See Sprawl Sites for a good discussion of SINs. Any active member of the 
shadows probably has one (or more) Fake SINs. Write them into your BG 
and pay for them with chargen resources. Ask the RPadmin that approves 
you to put them on your character's +sheet. As a member of the shadows, 
these fake SINs are the tools you need to rent apartments, buy things in
legitimate stores and so on. Unless you want to live exclusively in a
street/squatter/low lifestyle, you'll need a decent fake SIN or two.<BR>

If you've got a REAL SIN, it's not necessarily the end of the world.  
So long as you don't USE the SIN for anything, you can't be tracked by
it. If you've never given blood samples, then you can't be tracked by 
your SIN even if someone finds your blood on a crime scene. There are also
all kinds of administrative barriers to matching crime-scene DNA to a 
database of millions of peoples' stored genetic code. Think about it. 
So you're an ex-corper and you've got a real SIN? DON'T USE IT. The only 
real problems you will run into are if you have family you care about 
associated with your real SIN and/or you DO have DNA records with your 
ex-corp (in which case, just don't do Shadowruns against THEM).** 
         
<P><LI> Is the character a full-time shadowrunner? Or does the character lead 
a Batman-like double existence?<BR>
 
**Working at bars, or other IC businesses is a nice way to fill in the gaps 
between shadowruns. Asusming you can get such a job. Some bars are actually 
covers for major players like Fixers or organized crime. Working at such a 
bar could turn into a real goldmine for a talented employee. Something to 
think about.**
         
<P><LI> Which person(s) or group(s) do you love the most?<BR>
 
**This is an expansion of "What do you love?". Decide on priorities for
 your affections, so you may choose between them if need be.**
          
<P><LI> What hobbies or pastimes does the character enjoy, if any? <BR>
 
**Does the character take up basketweaving when she's not kicking the 
cyberzombie's hoop around the block? Actual shadowruns take up a small 
percentage of your life. Decide what you're doing for the rest of the 
time.**
 
<P><LI> Where did the character learn his Skills and train his attributes?<BR>
 
**Generally, all skills should be clearly explained in the BG. See NEWS 
RULES SKILLS LEVELS for a sample of what the levels mean using Firearms 
as an example. 3 is the 'mythical' average level. Jane the Accountant 
probably has Accounting: 3. Also, you should explain in the BG any 
attributes that are exceptionally high or low. Anything more than one 
point away from the racial average (humans with 1's or 5+ attributes, 
trolls with INT/CHA 3+, basically anything that you assign only one point 
or more than 4 points to in numerical character generation) need to be 
explained.**
 
<P><LI> List any past serious relationships that your character has had, and
give a brief overview of the relationship.<BR>
 
**Unless the character is a social pariah, she probably had a relationship 
or three. Think about it, and decide how the character feels about the 
past close relationships and how she feels about getting into future 
relationships.**
   
<P><LI> What distinguishing features does the character have? <BR>
 
**This is everything from habits to clothes to general weirdness. Is the 
character memorable? Why? What differentiates him from the next samurai? 
How do people recognize you? If you changed your character-object's name, 
would people remember who you are based on your speech and desc?**
 
<P><LI> Does the character have any prized possessions?<BR>
 
**Admins have a nifty couple of powers called +name and +desc. They can 
change the name and desc of some objects for you. Perhaps your Sword is 
actually an antique Scottish Claymore! Perhaps your Streetline Special is 
one of the limited-editions with the metallic mauve finish! This is a great 
way to personalize your character! Ask for it!**
 
<P><LI> If your character has cyberware, where did she get it, why did she get 
it, how did she get it, and what does she think/feel about it?<BR>
  
**Cyberware of some sort is relatively common in some circles in 2058, but 
you have to decide how your character feels about the cyber. Hatchetman's 
monologue in the SR sourcebook 'Cybertechnology' is a fabulous example of 
this. Tom Dowd explains exactly how Hatchetman got his chrome, why, where, 
and what the character feels about it. Despite various debates on the 
nature of chrome and its acceptance level in 2058, you need to decide how 
YOUR character feels about the chrome in herself and others and WHY she 
feels that way.**
 
<P><LI> How does the character feel about magic?<BR>
 
**If the character is magically active, this will be a substantial area 
of focus in the background as you define your magic, your relationship to 
it and how you perceive it. However, even for mundanes, everyone has probably 
seen a little magic here and there in 2058, at least on the trid. How do 
you feel about it? Decide it and RP it! A note: Most people are NOT experts 
on magic and know very little about it--sort of like how most people 
think car gas tanks explode when crashes happen even though they really 
don't except in the movies. Think of magic as a very complex, very technical 
subject about which most people, including some magically active people, 
are pretty ignorant. Except for people with the Magic Theory skill, tossing 
out spell names and technical information about the astral mechanics of 
spellcasting is not very IC. If you can't resist acting like an expert on 
magic, spend some skill points on the skill.**
   
<P><LI> What does the character FEAR?<BR>
  
**Fear is a way of life in the future. What keeps you up at night? What 
gives you the heebie-jeebies? There's lots of things to be afraid of in 
2058. This is also an important RP device, as you can respond to fear-
inducing stimuli to good dramatic effect.**
