<H1>Application Not Found</H1>
<P>This big and nasty messages is generated by your web browser because you
do not have a telnet application associated with it.  Associating an application
is usually found under helper apps, wherever that may be on your browser.
<BR><BR>
The reason this may happen is that you may not have a telnet application on 
your system.  You need to get one, do not use the telnet program that comes
with Windows95 or NT, it will not work right when telnetting to a non-standard
port.  I would suggest going to <A HREF="http://www.tucows.com">www.tucows.com

<H1>MUSH Clients</H1>
<P>The best thing to use to connect to a MUSH is a MUSH client, this is a type
of telnet program designed by MUSHers to make MUSHing easier.  There are many 
varieties of MUSH clients, you can find a list of whats available at
<A HREF="http://www.rahul.net/galen/client.html">this site.</A></P>

Hope this helps and happy MUSHing.
