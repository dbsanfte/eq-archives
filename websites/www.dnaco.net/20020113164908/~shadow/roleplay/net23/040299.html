<P>"Good Afternoon Seattle, this is Jasper Varo for Net23 News. Today we bring you a shocking story, a single assailant attacked yesterday evening the LoneStar HQ. We have this shocking footage from the LS security force that handled the situation.

<P><I>The footage that follows is obviously amplified by a low-light filter as the hue of the screen changes, a red Americar is seen screaming down the street as a figure begins firing at the building in the foreground. A quick response team returns fire as the car unloads several rounds; there is the sound of some shouting as a large explosion detonates from the sidewalk in front of the building, missing it completely. A few more quick bursts of bullets and the americar crashes into a lighting poll, the officers approach the car, removing the well-ventilated body of the man inside. The scene returns to the studio as Jasper looks into the camera.</I>

<P>"Quite a remarkable gun battle, there were no reports of any casualties on the LoneStar side, the explosion you saw was a hand grenade launched by the assailant, a man identified as Korynne Blade. Mr. Blade was the only casualty reported. The LoneStar as a precaution has roped off the large blast area until it can be repaired. Now for mid-day traffic, Norman?"

<P><I>The shot shifts to a dwarf, standing near a traffic grid; it is showing completely red.</I>

<P>"Well Jasper, there are complete land-based backups near the Redmond and Bellevue areas, we would ask anyone heading to that area to reconsider as your average wait time across the bridge is still a good seven or eight hours. Downtown is a different story however, the lights are currently configured to heavy traffic and are only changing every fourteen minutes. Coming from the east your travel time will be one-hour minutes to one hour and forty-five minutes per three blocks, from the north, it is expected to be forty minutes to an hour. Air traffic is heavy to Council Island, as well as the Elven District, and the rest of the International District. Public transportation reports they are traveling on their load schedule, standard delays are expected as daytime travelers once again tax the public transportation system. Again the staff at Metro and the DOT would like to encourage you all to stay home and work remotely to the office. Back to you Jasper."

<P>"Thanks Norm, the weather this afternoon is calling for clear skies, with moderate wind from the southeast. Current temperature is 2c, and the ground condition is dry. Next weather update at 05:15. This is Jasper Varo for the Net23 Afternoon Report. Remember, if you have any news, leads, or information please contact Net23 at LTG6347-47046."

<P><I>The Net23 logo re-appears and as a voice says: "Net23 - The power of information". The logo spins as a number is displayed LTG6347-47046 </I>
