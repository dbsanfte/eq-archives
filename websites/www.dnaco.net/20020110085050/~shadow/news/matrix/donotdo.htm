      <p><b>DO NOT DECK FROM HOME<br>
        </b><br>
        Okay, so you got your house all set up. Your computer chips nearby, a<br>
        comfortable chair, your buddy to pull you out in case of trouble, etc 
        etc.<br>
        You jack in to the trix to do some serious deck punching. What's wrong?<br>
        <br>
        You're decking from home.<br>
        <br>
        People, PLEASE! Use your head. If your hacking a system and get traced,<br>
        you're as good as dead. Go some place like Hojo's and rent a coffin, deck<br>
        from there. Might not be as comfy, but a hell of a lot safer.<br>
        <b><br>
        DO NOT FORGET POSING</b><br>
        <br>
        First off MJudges are sick of seeing none of you deckers RPing within 
        the<br>
        trix. If anything you'd be RPing twice as hard. This is what you do. This 
        is<br>
        your whole purpose on the MUSH. If anyone caught not RPing within the 
        trix<br>
        while in a IC situation, they will be force dumped, giving them a nice<br>
        shock.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DECK IN CONTAINER<br>
        <br>
        </b>Do not put a deck in any bags or containers. If you do put it in a 
        larger<br>
        container like a locker or such MAKE SURE YOU DROP IT before you try and<br>
        use it. For smaller bags and cases a deck will not fit in those, you must<br>
        use the deck conceal command instead.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MORE THEN ONE PROGRAM/FILE ALIAS</b><br>
        <br>
        If you have a desktop computer do not try and load a program that has 
        the<br>
        same alias as a SOURCE code file you have designed. DO NOT put the same<br>
        program or file in the same storage object &lt;chipcases and chips I'm<br>
        talking about&gt; that have the same alias or you will erase one of the 
        copies.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MORE THAN ONE CHIPCASE<br>
        </b><br>
        DO NOT ASK FOR a second chipcase, 1 chipcase per person, there is too<br>
        much of chance you will mess up the chipcases as they will both want to<br>
        do the same code and it could really mess things up.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SAME PARENTS<br>
        </b><br>
        Also remember desktop computers and decks have the same parents and do<br>
        not keep both in the same room or on you. If you must have both on you, 
        DO<br>
        NOT logon to the computer.<br>
        <br>
        <b>MOVING PROGRAMS AND FILES</b><br>
        <br>
        PLEASE when loading chips on your chipcase DO IT SLOW otherwise you<br>
        will loss information and mess up the chipcase. Also when moving a files<br>
        off decks DO THAT REALLY SLOW, there is a wait while it creates the chip<br>
        if you start another before the first is done it will really mess up both<br>
        files. Make sure the chip is on you before you to the next command.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SOURCE CODE ON OFFLINE</b><br>
        <br>
        This is going to be the only warning, DO NOT put source files on offline<br>
        storage units, if your caught doing this you not going to like what happens.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TRADING PROGRAMS<br>
        </b><br>
        Ok this is a reminder, if you do not own the program chip, you better 
        not<br>
        have it loaded on your PC or deck. This is your only warning, IF YOU DO 
        NOT<br>
        HAVE A CHIP FOR A PROGRAM, remove it from your storage. A few of you<br>
        are using copies of each others software to the point where your decks 
        are<br>
        mirror images of each other. It has already happened that a decker made<br>
        the mistake of saying he hacked a place he hadn't. Unfortunately, he<br>
        unknowingly said it to the live security for that place. The security 
        person<br>
        took the decker in for it, too. When the deck was scanned, lo and behold,<br>
        there was all the software they'd seen on the icon. The icon was different<br>
        though... but that's easy to reprogram. So what happened? Sad story... 
        he'll<br>
        more than likely die for it. All the crying in the world about this being 
        un-<br>
        IC will change nothing. You run the risk of this happening to yourself 
        if you<br>
        are going to mirror your deck off of someone else's...<br>
        <br>
        You may sell a program to another player but you must send the RP log 
        of<br>
        the scene to Rubik. Otherwise it will be considered a trade and the<br>
        program will have to be removed.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PAYDATA IN CHIPCASES<br>
        </b><br>
        DO NOT DO-- I strongly suggest if you want to keep your paydata files, 
        DO<br>
        not put the paydata chips into the chipcases, seems for some weird reason<br>
        its not getting the info.
