      <p> This simple phrase is probably the most important one you will ever 
        need to remember as a player. INFORMATION IS POWER. Be careful who you 
        trust, a lot more careful than most everyone I've ever seen on the MUSH 
        has been in the past. 
      <p>The situation is usually exacerbated by the perception that there is 
        'nothing to do'. Characters sit in bars, and make conversation, and make 
        friends, and wind up confessing their entire life's history to someone 
        they know next to nothing about, or to someone who is telling them the 
        same thing. And when something INTERESTING happens to any one of these 
        people, immediately they tell it to everyone else. This can and has gotten 
        people killed and, as well, for the most part, those of you who play the 
        hardcase runner should know better than to trust people like that. 
      <p>INFORMATION IS POWER. This is key. The more you know, the better off 
        you are, and the power of that information and knowledge is degraded and 
        diluted the more you disseminate it. As well, information is MONEY, too. 
        You can sell something only you know to a fixer, but if everyone knows 
        about it and doesn't hold it dearly, then the information is worth nothing. 
      <p> This is also related to OOC/IC information, the bane of any MUSH's existance. 
        People that are half-informed OOCly spread it further OOCly, and it turns 
        into a big game of (you guessed it) telephone. Not only that, OOC discussions 
        frequently cross over to IC even in the hands of the best players who 
        "never ever would cross over that information cross my heart and hope 
        to die". One entire series of player deaths, a total of I believe it was 
        six, and one NPC death, once occurred as the direct result of such a crossover--someone 
        whose roommate was on the MUSH told them something, OOCly, and the player 
        inadvertantly believed that this was IC information, which set into motion 
        a chain of events that inexorably led to the deaths of six PCs. The people 
        involved (for the most part) don't know who they are or the truth of the 
        matter because it's highly embarassing situation. But this is an example 
        of how even the best-intentioned players can wind up ruining a lot because 
        of OOC information. People who die come out of the DPR and talk about 
        the circumstances of their death, even when it's supposed to be secret; 
        people who die do things because they might be pissed at their killers, 
        and let others know OOCly what happened, and this ruins tinyplots and 
        people's lives. This is not only unfair, it's stupid and childish, and 
        it can easily ruin the game. 
      <p>The next time you think a little page explaining X or Y is okay, because 
        it can't harm anyone, and you trust the person to keep it IC seperate, 
        please rethink it. Because it can, even in the most apparently harmless 
        of cases, get people killed. And it ruins the surprise of finding things 
        out ICly. 
      <p>Since I became a Director, over half of my work time has been consumed 
        tracking down a lot of OOC/IC crossover crap. There are those of you out 
        there who have asked what you can do to help the MUSH become better; well, 
        there's your answer: DON'T SPREAD OOC INFORMATION. It becomes the largest 
        pain in the ass that there is.
