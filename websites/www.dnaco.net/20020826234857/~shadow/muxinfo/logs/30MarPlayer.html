Roman says "hey brent" 

Jackrabbit arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Locke says "It's just a public meeting..." 

Jackrabbit says "Am I inviterd?3" 

The current time and date is: Thu Mar 30 20:58:01 2055 

Roman says "everyone is invited" 
Roman says "even dead people" 

Jackrabbit grins 

Roman pokes Marusa. 

Jackrabbit says "cool" 

Marusa looks for a cozy coffin to lie into. 

Jackrabbit lights a Garcia Vega Crystal cigar 

Ripper arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Jackrabbit says "Stylin'" 

Locke says "Hmmm, serrin said he'd be here....." 

Marusa coughsin the smoke. 

Roman says "ok, first matter of business: how much money everyone is 
  going to donate to roman" 
Roman says "i think 10k apiece should suffice" 

Locke says "Um, how many mages you gonna kill for me? :)" 
Locke snickers. 

Jackrabbit looks at Marusa "Ow.. The Anthony Perkins manuever" 

Roman says "laughs" 
Roman laughs. 

Marusa says "Roman?" 

Daniel Elazar arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Locke says "Oh, and Worldbldr here is logging everything, for the people 
  who couldn't show up" 

Daniel Elazar says "Cool." 

Roman says "oh" 

Marusa says "Now... please stop POKING me." 

Locke points at WorldBLDR. 

Roman says "he can remove my snide remarks, then" 

Jackrabbit nods "Good Stuff" 

Roman says "just edit them out" 
Roman chuckles. 

Brent Corson says "heh" 

Jackrabbit says "huhuh huhuh huuh heheheh" 

Locke says "Nope, no editing. :)" 

Jackrabbit says "She said POKING" 

Marusa says "Why is everyone donating to Roman?" 

Roman says "they're not, i was hoping i could trick them" 
Roman snaps his fingers. 

Marusa is confused, spammed and lost. 

Locke says "Because his empire fell?" 

Jackrabbit goanz 
Jackrabbit groanz 

Romanl 

Roman 

<OOC> Roman says, "oops" 

Marusa says "Brent, &short-desc me=A newbie." 

Jackrabbit sits back and watches the smoke from the cigar fill the room 

Locke says "Well, I guess players talking to players isn't too 
  riveting...." 

Marusa grins, hops on the coffin and waves with her feet, sitting on it. 

Slash arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Roman says "i dunno i'm sure we could come up with some decent topics" 

Locke says "Woo-hoo, our first admin" 

Marusa nods.

Marusa waves. 

Reaper arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Dixon smiles, and the admin that called this meeting is not on :-) 

Jackrabbit says "Open stores for legal firearms purchases?" 
Jackrabbit ducks for cover 

Locke says "Well, we really should have a moderator....." 
Locke says "any volunteers?" 

Roman says "moderators just get in the way ;)" 

Marusa says "Moderator?" 

Constantine Rye arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Locke says "to keep all the topics in order, and make sure this isn't 
  just a spam fest" 

Reaper says "I would think the moderator would get slammed a lot." 

Glorie arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Constantine Rye burps. 

Locke says "why should the moderator get slammed?" 

Daniel Elazar says "Well, there should be someway to recognize 
  speakers..." 

Jackrabbit Booms out in his best Patrick Stewart voice: "If you wish, I 
  shall moderate this discussion." 

Glorie says "What's going on?" 

Reaper says "because he is in control." 

Locke says "Control of saying, ok, next topic?" 

Jackrabbit says "Let's keep it open"" 

Locke says "Come on Reaper, a little order will help this go a long 
  way." 

Slash says "make it so" 

Jackrabbit says "Diplomatic and Democratic" 

Reaper says "okay then" 

Reaper says "start then" 

Locke says "Well, jack said he would" 

Jackrabbit says "Ideas?" 

Constantine Rye pukes at the bad pun 

Locke says "so, I guess page? him with your topics?.....how does that 
  sound?" 

Jackrabbit says "My Idea was legal firearms purchase stores to cut 
  Equipreguest delay" 

Marusa waves to Rye, smiling. 

Reaper says "and no poses?" 

Roman walks over to the coffee maker and whips up a cup. 

Glorie says "Who are we paging?" 

Nicole arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Reaper says "prevent spaming?" 

Locke says "yeah, no poses" 

Mirelle waves. 

Locke says "Legal firearms stores...I think one of the builders is 
  making something like that..." 

Roman says "legal firearms stores? that's kind of begging for abuse, in 
  a way, but it would be interesting to see how it turned out" 

Glorie says "Who are we paging with our topics?" 

Marusa says "You want to buy a gun, you got to have a SIN." 

Jackrabbit says "Hmm.. the main concern would be what is legal, exactly, 
  and bribes figured in if any." 

Brent Corson says "where is serrin" 
Brent Corson says "I thought this was his show" 

Roman says "well if you're sinless and smart, you'd have someone with a 
  sin stock up and sell to you" 

Locke says "I think that the store would be like the stock market..." 

Slash says "whoa - lets let the moderator moderate people" 

Jackrabbit says "I have one, and have found Sinners cant get weps but 
  criminals get 'em easy. Like today." 

Glorie says "It isn't _his show_, he was just that he's the person who 
  thought it up." 

Roman says "but he said he was gonna be here, shrug" 

You aren't a member of channel! 

Roman says "wondering if we should wait for him" 

Jackrabbit says "Do yo uhave an Idea Glorie?" 

Glorie says "Yeah, I think that the first thing we ought to discuss is 
  how this meeting is going to run." 

Locke says "And for everyone just joining, WorldBLDR is logging this to 
  a file, for people who couldn't make it tonight." 

Jackrabbitis republican, anti Gunban, and proud =) 

Brent Corson says "oh yeah, somebodies concert is supposed to be right 
  now, from the bboard, maybe I will go watch it since this is going 
  nowhere" 

Roman says "laugh" 

Reaper says "Yeah...this is pointless for me." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 
Brent Corson says "anyone want to buy a gun?" 

Jackrabbit says "Well, as there is a lile being recorded, if you have a 
  gripe, this is the time.. don't complain later.. let's talk" 

Brent Corson laughs at his own comment. 

Mirelle says "Ok...it's time to make this a little more organized" 

Glorie says "Well, I can think of a topic, but I'm afraid to bring it 
  up." 

Jackrabbit says "Yes. Concerns, in order. Glorie, go ahead.." 

Roman says "do it" 

Mirelle says "Ok, would anyone object to me sort of 'leading' this 
  meeting?" 

Glorie says "Okay...and if anyone thinks we shouldn't discuss it, then 
  say so..." 

Locke says "Ask Jack, he's in charge right now" 

Jackrabbit says "Go on, you have nothing to gain or lose ICly" 
Jackrabbit smiles 
Jackrabbit says "The perfect choice" 
Jackrabbit offers Mirelle the big chair 

Glorie says "I think we ought to discuss Serrin." 

Dixon says, "I like Mir-el-ly better. 

Mirelle IS experiencing lag, so be patient with her. 

Mirelle smiles and sits in the big chair. 
Mirelle says "Ok, I think it would be fiair to wait until Serrin is 
  present until we discuss him" 

Jackrabbit says "Now, let us begin anew, as JFK would say" 

Glorie says "Hm, I'll take the silence as a 'let's not discuss this.'" 

Jackrabbit says "Cool" 

Marusa offers some fresh meat from her hand... if anyone's hungry. 

Glorie says "Would it though?" 

Mirelle says "Are you thinking that perhaps people won't want to say 
  certain things if he is around?" 

Glorie says "I know that I wouldn't be comfortable if he was here." 
Glorie nods. "Yes." 

Jackrabbit says "Hmmm" 

Mirelle nods, "Ok, we'll discuss Serrin then, but he will probably have 
  access to this log file..." 

Roman says "we all gotta die sometime" 

Glorie says "I don't have a problem with him knowing what's said." 

Mirelle says "But knowing Serrin, I don't think anyone has to worry 
  about a retaliation" 

Locke says "anyone who wants it can have a copy" 

Jackrabbit says "Who's keeping the log?" 

Marusa thinks that discussing someone behind his/her/its back isn't that 
  nice. 

Glorie says "WorldBLDR is." 

Jackrabbit Oh 

Vortex arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Jackrabbit nods 

Glorie says "It isn't talking behind their back in a malicious way 
  though." 

Jackrabbit says "Hmm.. If it can't be said to their face,then what is 
  it?" 

Roman says "shrug it's one thing to talk about someone behind their 
  back, entirely different thing if it's discussing a possible problem 
  with that person" 

Mirelle says "Ok, if someone has a gripe about Serrin that they wish to 
  discuss, please raise their hand and the first person I ssee will get 
  the floor." 

Marusa thinks. 

Valkyrie says "Folks... One at a time. I'll keep a queue. If you want to 
  speak during a particular topic, page me. If you would like a 
  particular topic addressed, page me, too.. Take your time, though... 
  I'm doing this manually." 

Mirelle says "I also want to impose one rule of mine....please don't 
  give us pointless @emits" 

ShotoBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
ShotoBLDR floats in. 

Mirelle says "Not to pick on your Marusa, but we really don't need the 
  spam of 'Marrusa thinks.'" 
Mirelle says "With all the people in here, we need to stay as quiet as 
  possible" 

Brent Corson says "how does one go about getting involed in a plot? I 
  have been on this mush for over 5 months, and I have yet to be in a 
  plot" 

Mirelle says "If no one has anything they wish to say about 
  Serrin...then we can move on" 

Valkyrie says "No one is paging me at all..." 

Mirelle says "I will wait a bit more, as there may be lag that is 
  delaying people." 

Jackrabbit says "Speak up or forever hole your piece" 

Matsuoro arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Matsuoro waves. 

Jackrabbit nods 

WorldBLDR says "As a note to people just joining us, I am logging this 
  and a copy will be available to anyone who requests it." 

Grunt arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie dropped Meeting Rules. 

ed fashion." 

Roman says "chortle" 

Dixon says "Brent they way to get involved in TP's is to Role Play, meet 
  people, talk, get to know them and let them get to know you......" 

Mirelle says "Ok...let's move on then" 

Valkyrie says "say Ok.... firsat topic is how to get into TP's, then..." 

Jordan arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Mirelle says "Any question or subject someone wishes to put forth?" 

SuperGluBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Jojo arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Anyone with a question or comment, please page me." 

Mirelle says "Oh..." 

Mirelle says "Does ANYONE wish to put forth a subject at all...?" 

Locke says "we have a subject, don't we?" 

Mirelle says "Any gripes, questions, comments?" 

Jackrabbit says "I dstil have mine..." 

Marusa says "Me?" 

Ripper raises his hand. 

Mirelle says "Ok, what is it Jackrabbit" 

Jackrabbit says "still... sorry... the Gun thing?" 

Valkyrie says "Gun thing?" 

Mirelle says "Oh...well, I don't know if the appropriate staff is on to 
  discuss that" 
Mirelle says "Marusa: What's yours?" 
Mirelle says "Oh, Valkyrie's here, that's right" 

Brent Corson says "well I want to talk about how to get into a plot" 

Marusa says "UM: Needed characters." 

Jackrabbit says "It seems it is hard for Sinners to find equipment 
  without "Darker" contacts.. I was wonbdering if stores selling legal 
  weaponry and ammo/accessories would be available soon." 

Nunzio arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Jackrabbit says "hey Nunzio" 

Mirelle says "Ok, sorry Marusa...just a second" 

Nunzio says "Yikes. People people people. :)" 

Valkyrie says "SIN'd people shpould not have a hard time buying certain 
  hardware... like pistols, etc... but if you're looking for anything 
  harder than that, you'll have trouble. You can use EQUIPREQUEST for 
  your purchases." 

Mirelle says "That's not my department...any other admin or wizard..?" 

Daniel Elazar raises his hand. 

Nunzio says "But have more fun, find an IC fixer, and go through him. 
  :)" 

Jordan nods "it may not be IC for a character to do that though..." 

Valkyrie says "Daniel? You want to add to this?" 

Jackrabbit says "Yeah ain't that the truth. Right now I am dong that.. 
  but I don't like that relatively good people have to hook up with 
  gangers to buy a box o bullets." 

Daniel Elazar says "Sort of on the subject: If a SINned chracter mails 
  equiprequest for a permit, is there a material object, or is just 
  written on their +sheet or something?" 

Mirelle says "Nunzio, the point was that there are people with SIN's 
  that don't want to get 'darker' contacts like Nunzio" 

Valkyrie says "You don't. If you want an untracable gun, you do." 

Jackrabbit says "Sort of like what the Democrats want America to be like 
  (Ducks for cover ;-)" 

Nunzio says "Hey I got a SIN! :)" 

Mirelle says "oh shoot...I have to go AFK...take the helm Valkyrie" 
Mirelle waves. 

Jackrabbit says " Sin? Ditto, and DocWagon clearance. Still takes 
  forever" 

Nunzio says "Paperwork. Red tape. Takes time. :)" 

Valkyrie says "Permits are usually just added to the character code." 

Jackrabbit nods. "Cool. Other concerns people? 

Valkyrie says "Brent wants to know about getting in plots." 

Daniel Elazar says "So it would show up on the +sheet?" 

Valkyrie says "Ok..." 

Jordan raises a hand and waits to be recognized 

Nunzio says "A permit would show up on teh gun code. Not your sheet." 

Valkyrie says "No..right now that doesn't show up on +sheets but Judges 
  can see it." 

Jackrabbit says "Jordan?" 

Jordan says "Well...on equipment..." 

Valkyrie says "Jordan?" 

Jordan says "We just send in the request, then what?" 

Marusa waits with another topic after ppl are done. 

Valkyrie says "An Admin will get back to you." 
Valkyrie says "That should be it." 

Jordan nods "ok. Any idea of the time frame involved?" 

Lampshade arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "The one questiuon I can not answer is how long something 
  will take. It all depends on how much other stuff is happening, how 
  coherent your request was, how tight the Admins underwear are... :)" 

Nunzio chuckles 

Valkyrie says "Are there other questions pertaining to gear 
  acquisition?" 

Jordan says "Is there any gear availible out in stores?" 

Jackrabbit says "What about Jimmy Z's?" 

Nunzio answers his cellular phone. 

Jordan says "When I made my char I had planned on it being gear heavy, 
  not cyber." 

Nunzio continues to speak into his cellular phone. 

Jackrabbit says "Tell me aout it!" 

Valkyrie says "Not currently. At some point in the future, that is 
  planned. The idea is that we can add that later after we add the 
  things that we're waiting on that stall us from saying "This MUSH is 
  open."" 
Valkyrie says "Folks, hang up the phones and don't answer them. Enough 
  spam in here already... Please. :)" 

Nunzio hangs up his cellular phone. 

Jackrabbit says "I know.. but what other things?" 

Jordan nods "Last question on that subject then... 

Valkyrie says "You can obtain ANYTHING you need through EQUIPREQUEST, 
  Jackrabbit." 

Valkyrie says "If you can afford it, that is..." 

Jordan says "When we rp can we Rp having certtain mundane items. Like 
  I'm a reporter can I rp having a camera?"" 
Jordan nods 

Jackrabbit says "I can afford it (Somehow with my Salary ;-) It is just 
  the time ." 

Nunzio says "Yeah, that'd be something to just RP. Why clutter the DB 
  with that, when you can just RP it." 

Jordan nods "Just wanting to make sure it's ok." 

Valkyrie says "You should expect to have a camera. You can request 
  one... Serrin might want to give you an item. He might just say 'pose 
  it'... my feeling is that you should just pose it and so be it. Just 
  don't pose pulling a news van out of your butts and you're ok. :)" 

Jackrabbit says "Like my cigars... they don't sell em so I RP it 
  (constantly)" 
Jackrabbit coughs 

Nunzio chuckles 

Valkyrie says "People... keep the comments to a minimum..." 

Marusa says "SERRIN? Why not you or other admin? Why SERRIN?" 

Jackrabbit nods 

Valkyrie says "Serrin's in charge of the media." 

O'Meara arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Jackrabbit says "yo" 

Valkyrie says "Ok... Any more questions regarding Equipment 
  Acquisition?" 

Brent Corson says "how was your show o'meara" 

Jordan says "Okie, I'm through, thanks." 

Valkyrie says "Ok... On to a new topis. Brent, I know what you want to 
  talk about... I skipped Marusa before... we'll come back to you. 
  Marusa, did you want to present something?" 

Jackrabbit says "Anything else, ladies and gentlemen?" 
Jackrabbit says "Marusa?" 

Marusa says "Yes.... typing..." 

Valkyrie says "Thanks, Jackrabbit... I'll handle it." 

Marusa says "An idea: pre-created characters the admins need to run the 
  MUSH... why don't we have them to give to dead people?" 

Nunzio says "People do. It's called a backup character." 

Locke says "I think that's already done a bit" 

Jackrabbit says "It eliminates personal choice?" 

O'Meara says "Has autochargen been brought up?" 

Nunzio says "Just have it there, waiting for you to use, when you kick 
  it. I had one, but sacrificed it for someone else." 

Valkyrie says "Pre-created characters? That's actually yet another task 
  added that will slow Admins down." 
Valkyrie says "Umm..hey..." 

TrixCoder arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Quiet...please." 

Jackrabbit says "How about you make one extra in case?" 

Valkyrie says "Chargen takes a while. I don't think any Admin is going 
  to want to sit and make a host of characters just to speefd things 
  along. What a lot of people do manage to do, though, is ask what might 
  be needed, if they've just died, and an Admin might usher them through 
  chargen  to make that character at that point. I know this happened with a  
  character who died at @7am this morning. By 3pm, he was back and playing." 

Jackrabbit says "I think a good idea that would not take MUSH space 
  would be for people to write stats down, and do another char. in case 
  you get killed you can bring it up quicker." 

Valkyrie says "Some people have backups waiting for them from before the 
  One CHaracter Rule.... but, in general, we don't allow people to 
  create backups at this point." 

Jackrabbit says "Yeah" 

ShiawaseBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Marusa says "How come then people can get on so fast?" 

Valkyrie says "Jackrabbit has a good idea. Keep a new characte in ind so 
  if anything does happen, you can tell the Judge, "I have an 
  application ready now. Any chance I can get it looked at?"" 

Jackrabbit says "Or a couple, in case there is a real hot opening" 

Valkyrie says "Generally, after a fight where people die, Admins feel 
  bad about it. They want to help Players get back into the game..." 

Valkyrie says "You just have to be ready for it..." 

Thelon arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Marusa says "Whom should I say it?" 

ShotoBLDR says "Ok, So technically you can get a CharApp approved by ANY 
  RP Admin? and you don't have to send it in to Srun-Reg@Dnaco.net?" 

Valkyrie says "IN most cases, to the Judge who took care of the combat. 
  If you have an app ready to +mail to me, I almost always give it 
  immediate attention." 

Jackrabbit nods 

Valkyrie says "No... don't look at it that way. +mailed apps have to go 
  through me... and if I get mail bombed with them, I won't accept them 
  that way any more." 

Marusa gother app. on Srun-reg... "What can I do now?" 

Valkyrie says "I get >80 pieces of mail a day as it is." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Valkyrie says "Ummm... what's a gother app?" 
Valkyrie says "Probably a type but I dunno... :P" 

Marusa says "got_her." 
Marusa fires her typist. 

O'Meara says "May I ask a question?" 

Jackrabbit says "Well I have several Ideas for other chars. But I'm not 
  telling you all ;-)." 

Valkyrie says "If your app is on the App Account, it will be handled as 
  fast as possible. Marusa, I happen to know your's is already being 
  considered." 
Valkyrie says "Say it, O'Meara. :)" 

ShotoBLDR says "I have been waiting since Monday...*Sigh*" 

Marusa nods thanks. 

O'Meara says "Ok, I'd like to suggest autochargen, but only for gangers. 
  IMHO (of course) We need more PC gangers, and this would help that out 
  a lot. (more coming)" 

Silver Judge arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

ShotoBLDR says "what is going on?" 
ShotoBLDR says "whoa, sorry..." 

O'Meara says "Have them stuck in some 'ganger room' until someone can 
  look over their sheet, their skills, etc, make sure everything is 
  straight, then let them out into IC" 

ShotoBLDR says "Nevermind" 

Jackrabbit says "Well, I have to go on Duty in case DW is required... 
  all you have a good evening.. and hey, let's be careful out there." 

Nunzio has to idle to go pick up his mom. I'm just gonna stay in here. 
  :) 

Jackrabbit smiles 

Rez says "Hi all." 

O'Meara says "It might be cool to have them affiliated with a set when 
  they go out into the IC world, too. :)" 

Brent Corson says "Hola" 

Rez says "Wassup?" 

QuicksilverBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
QuicksilverBLDR sweeps into the room, accompanied by a squad of the 
  Imperial Guard, resplendent in scarlet, a platoon of Dorsai in grey 
  battle suits and several companies of Klingon Marines, recently 
  arrived from Krenn's cruiser in orbit. 

Valkyrie says "I'll present that idea to Malign, O'meara. It might save 
  time and help him out. :)" 

O'Meara says "brb" 

WorldBLDR says "Note to those joining, I am logging, page if you'd like 
  a copy." 

WorldBLDR says "actually, page locke" 

Walker arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Shotobldr has a comment." 

ShotoBLDR says "ok ,So technically any RP admin can approve character 
  applications, or do they auto matically get sent to you if a newly 
  desceased character asks an admin?" 

Jordan waves 

Valkyrie says "I answered this, Shoto... No. Any +mail'd application 
  goes through me... and I will stop accepting them that way if I get 
  mail bombed with them. I already get >80 pieces of mail a day." 
Valkyrie says "Does anyone have any further questions or comments about 
  the Char Apps?" 

Rez says ">80? I feel unloved." 

ShotoBLDR Smiles, "Thanks, thats it:)" 

Valkyrie says "Ok... Brent asked something earlier.. He was wondering 
  how to get into TP's.//" 

TrixCoder says "Um..." 

Locke says "magic ban, still on?" 

Valkyrie says "So... here's a quick guide..." 

TrixCoder says "I was gonna ask something..." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 
Brent Corson says "yeah" 

Valkyrie says "Ok... back up." 
Valkyrie says "Ask away, Trix..." 

TrixCoder says "Is there any way we could get a moderated session with 
  an admin to discuss backgrounds...." 
TrixCoder says "Like how to make them better? And maybe some 
  suggestions? (Some of us aren't particularly twisted, nor english 
  majors, much less writers.)" 

Rez is always willing to discuss a character concept with people. :) 

TrixCoder nods, "Okay Dokay." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Valkyrie says "If you page the appropriate Admin, you'll almost 
  definitely get help. PlayerHelp Admins are usually good sources for 
  help on these subjects as they almost always have the ear of the 
  RPStaff." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Matsuoro says "I would also like to offer any kind of assistance I can." 

ShotoBLDR says "Heh" 

Matsuoro says "I enjoy writing." 

Rez says "If you don't know who the appropriate admin is, page Player 
  help staff." 

Valkyrie says "I hate to do this... but I have to admit we have finally 
  goten down to the number of mages we want... and slightly below. That 
  means there are a VERY FEW openings for mage characters. I can see the 
  app account getting blasted... so don't ge 

t too hyped." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Valkyrie says "Now to Brent's issue... finally!" 

ShotoBLDR says "What about Corp Mages?" 

Brent Corson says "who should we mail? talieson? heh" 
Brent Corson says "ok" 

Valkyrie says "No... email to the usual app account." 

Brent Corson says "I was wondering how one goes about getting involved 
  in plots" 

Valkyrie says "Plots don't usually fall into anyone's lap. If you sit in 
  a bar, you have to get lucky to have a plot happen around you. Why? 
  Well.. we're always looking more at the movers and shakers. In this 
  particular sense, the moving target gets hit e 

asier." 

ShiawaseBLDR says "Are most Corp Mages NPC's?" 

Roman says "what else is there to do" 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Roman says "re: besides sit in a bar, sometimes i wonder if this is 
  shadowrun mush or an alcoholics anonymous meeting" 

Jackrabbit arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Brent Corson says "well how do I get to be noticed if nothing ever 
  happens to me? I mean I spend 90 of my online time here in bars, 
  because there is _nothing_ else for non-plot people to do" 

Jackrabbit says "I have returned" 

Valkyrie says "Some plots get started by characters. They try to do 
  something that they need an Admin to help them with... and that gets a 
  plot started right there." 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Valkyrie says "Calm down on the hmm'ing and commenting, please..." 

Locke says "I've talked to people who have started their own TPs for 
  their chars, and they had a lot of fun, nothing big, just maybe 
  something from your background..." 

Marusa says "Try to bring three troll friends with you and break the 
  lift in Starlight towers?" 
Marusa says "lift=elevator" 

Valkyrie says "Folks..." 

Jackrabbit says "Rob the stuffer shack" 

Valkyrie says "There are 9029837454658639 suggestions we can make..." 

ShiawaseBLDR says "OhOh...Sounds like we got a European here." 

Valkyrie says "Do it later." 

Rez says "BRB" 

Valkyrie says "We want to get the biggest issues out of the way. You can 
  offer all the specific help you want later." 

Marusa says "Um.... Val?" 

Valkyrie says "The easiest way to have a plot happen to you is make sure 
  YOU have an agenda. If you have goals to reach and stuff you want, 
  things WILL happen to you..." 

Marusa says "Right... insult a troll, try to sneak into Ancients HQ..." 

Jackrabbit says "Call the leader of the Ancients an Elf Poser sellout 
  =)" 

ShotoBLDR dropped Shoto. 

Valkyrie says "Don't rely on 'seeing stuff happening' and just being in 
  the 'right place at the right time' to get invoved. That doesn't work 
  too often... although it might happen more often. Silver JUdge is 
  running one-nightewr plots for almost anyone who'll ask him. Page
  Silver if you're looking for some action, folks. He has it in his DOING." 

Valkyrie says "Or his +finger... I forget which..." 

Silver Judge says "+finger" 

Marusa says "Try to use white graffitti on the red smaurai while he's 
  not looking?" 

Valkyrie says "Marusa, enough.," 

Jackrabbit says "Both last I saw" 

Silver Judge says "That's all ways to commit suicide marusa" 

Valkyrie says "Silver, you wanted to say something?" 

Silver Judge says "Yes, My biggest job here is to get action out there 
  to the general player populace." 
Silver Judge says "All of us Judges feel this way" 
Silver Judge says "Not the big involved multi-session TinyPlots the 
  RPadmins run" 
Silver Judge says "But one-night runs" 
Silver Judge says "weird events" 

Shoto loses its ears and becomes deaf. 

Silver Judge says "So if you're really bored, ask me" 

Fade arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Fade wows. 

Silver Judge says "If I am not already working on one, I'll be happy to 
  help" 

Shoto grows ears and can now hear. 

Silver Judge says "That is what all those new judges arefor" 
Silver Judge says "That's all from me" 

Valkyrie says "Ok... does anyone else have a comment about Plots? 
  Finding 'em? Getting into 'em?" 

Brent Corson says "I'd love to be in any kind of run" 
Brent Corson says "but I dont know any fixers or anyone to set me up 
  with a johnson" 

TrixCoder says "Who would we talk to...." 
TrixCoder says "If we wanted some ideas for a specific character?..." 

Silver Judge says "well I know of at least One guy advertising on 
  streetwise" 

Brent Corson says "hmm" 

Jackrabbit says "Be fixers.. be Johnsons :-)" 

Valkyrie says "Brent, you have to find those people IC'ly. Anyone who 
  knows where a Fixer is or has a Johnson got those things by playing, 
  asking questions and learning." 

TrixCoder says "No I meant say I'm playing joe sam who is ex LS" 

Jackrabbit says "Past contacts=TP situations" 

Nunzio says "Just a sec. :)" 

Matsuoro says "I suggest being creative." 

TrixCoder says "Is there anyone I can talk to who can give me specific 
  ideas how to get him invovled in TPs?" 

Nunzio says "Ideas about getting into plots. :)" 

Brent Corson says "are there alot of fixers around right now? or do some 
  need to be made?" 

Matsuoro says "Take ideas t +mail roleplaying" 
Matsuoro says "you say, okay, nothign happend to it..." 

Nunzio says "Pretty easy. Make introductions, find people." 

Matsuoro says "but check +staff..." 
Matsuoro says "Get someone who is ON duty and grab their ear if they can 
  lend the time." 

TrixCoder is confused now. 

Nunzio says "Talk to them. Tell them about yourself, _DISCREETLY_, and 
  hope for the best." 

Valkyrie says "There are a lot of fixers, Brent. There is no one 
  specific that you can talk to OOC'ly except the Admins in charge of 
  the area you'd like to have your plot be involved in, Trix." 

Fade nods, "Introduce yourself and make a good impression." 

Matsuoro says "But do the work and the creativity yourself, give the 
  Admin something to RUN with... They are all capable from personal 
  experience." 

Valkyrie says "By no one specific, I mean you can talk to anyone..." 
Valkyrie says "Mats... please... let me know if you want to talk... I 
  promise to get to you." 

TrixCoder shakes his head vigoursly, "No what I mean is what if we are 
  bereft of plot iokdea 

Valkyrie says "Are there any other questions or comments to be made 
  about the Plot situation?" 

Nunzio says "I've got a few." 

Jackrabbit is all ears 

Valkyrie says "Go ahead, Nunzio." 

Nunzio says "Ok. First off, I know from personal experience, that there 
  is a TON of things going on out there. Half of them tho, are ones you 
  create." 
Nunzio says "Don't be afraid to invite yourself on some occasions." 
Nunzio says "And find out about the people around you." 
Nunzio says "And let them find out about you. No life stories, just 
  enough to know what you are about." 
Nunzio remembers putting something like this on the mailing list. :) 
Nunzio says "And above all else. Be active! sitting around in a bar is 
  productive to a point. But there are a ton of things out there that 
  you can find out about, and that might lead to other things." 

Marusa raises her hand. 

Valkyrie says "Marusa?" 

Nunzio steps down off his soapbox. 

Jackrabbit says "Marusa?"" 

Marusa says "Just my thought: I wonder how can people sit there and do 
  nothing: there were three tragic love stories in 2 days... =)" 

TrixCoder raises a hand. 

Marusa shrugs, "MUch more fun that any soap opera. =)" 
Marusa says "I'm done." 

Valkyrie says "Trix?" 

TrixCoder says "I think it's cause quite often people don't know HOW TO 
  DO things." 

TrixCoder says "Or how to get invovled." 

Nunzio says "Then you fumble along, and hope to learn quick." 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio... in turn." 

Nunzio says "Sorry." 

Jackrabbit arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

TrixCoder says "We come here, and they tell us READ all this.... HELP, 
  NEWS, Etc." 

Jackrabbit says "Whew" 

Slash raises his hand. 

TrixCoder says "But there is nothing we can read that tells us how to 
  roleplay... or get invovled." 

Interim arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

TrixCoder sits back down. 

Grunt arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Slash?" 

Slash says "One sure fire way to get involved in things is to join a 
  group..." 

Nunzio says "RIGHT ON! :) Sorry, had to add that. :)" 

Glorie arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Slash says "even if you don;t have tps revolving around you, the 
  internal dynamics can be just as much fun." 

Nunzio raises his hand, and waits to pull out his soap box. 

Slash says "ok, couple page questions.." 
Slash says "what if you character doesnt fit into a group?" 

Slash says "my answer is: then you've made a character who is going to 
  be boring to play. Sorry, but this is about RPing with other people, 
  at least for me." 

TrixCoder raises his hand again (But can wait for a bit) 

Slash says "even freelance runners are going to make contacts, and run 
  with trusted groups of runners ... no shadowrunner is going to be able 
  to do a run his/herself." 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio?" 

Nunzio gets on his soapbox again. 
Nunzio says "JOIN GROUPS!!!!!!!" 
Nunzio says "They add so much to your character!" 

Interim smiles. 

Fade asks to retort to Nunzio. 

Nunzio says "To answer the question of if you don't fit." 
Nunzio says "Then get CONTACTS in a group." 

James O'Malley arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Nunzio says "Come on. Like this whole thing revolves around the groups." 
Nunzio says "EVERYTHING depends on teh groups. Everything." 
Nunzio says "If there were no corps or org crime groups, there'd be no 
  runs." 

Shoto says "As far as groups go, I know there are a bunch of corps out 
  there, and Ares will be aggressivly recruiting once I build it:)" 

Valkyrie says "Shoto, in turn, please." 

Nunzio says "If everyone would get contacts or join groups, then 
  everyone would be doing stuff." 

Nunzio steps off his soapbox. 

Valkyrie says "Trix?" 

TrixCoder says "Ok..." 

Matsuoro burns Nunzio's soapbox for heat. 

TrixCoder says "SOme of don't, and won't belong to groups." 
TrixCoder says "Just like RL." 

Jackrabbit says "flashes the peace sign "later"" 

SuperGluBLDR dropped Mini Tape Recorder. 

ShiawaseBLDR dropped Shiawase. 

Marusa raises her hand. 

TrixCoder says "And BGs can't be changed (At least not to my knowledge)" 

TrixCoder says "In RL you don't have to be a member of a group to have 
  interesting things happen, you just need to know/meet people." 

Locke nods in agreement. 

TrixCoder says "And sometimes not even that." 

Nunzio points out you don't have to belong, you can have contacts too, 
  but joining is much more fun. :) 

James O'Malley says "May I ask what we are discussing?" 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio.... in turn, please..." 

TrixCoder says "I guess my point inthat case would be A)How can we get 
  invovled (Besides contacts with groups) and B)What do those of us do 
  who didn't put buttloads of contacts into our BG." 

Valkyrie says "Fade?" 

Nunzio raises his hand again, and pulls out yet another soapbox. 

Fade says "My question is answered, continue :)" 

James O'Malley raises his han. 

Ruby arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Marusa?" 

Marusa says "I just want to make a suggestion:" 
Marusa says "If someone feels bored, go nuts!" 

ShiawaseBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Nunzio ughs. 

Marusa says "It's just a game. If you feel like needing action, +judge I 
  wanna blow the club. Or something..." 
Marusa says "Just get a good IC reason to do it... and here you go!" 

Roman raises his hand. 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio?" 

Nunzio gets up there again. 
Nunzio says "Ok, Trix. Do you know what a contact is?" 

TrixCoder nods. 
TrixCoder says "I think." 

Nunzio says "It's just someone you met and know right?" 

SuperGluBLDR says "test" 

TrixCoder nods slowly. 

Grunt arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Nunzio says "So why not try to get the ones who can help you out. And 
  those are, without a doubt, the people in the orgs." 
Nunzio says "You don't have to change your bg for that, you just have to 
  meet them." 
Nunzio says "If you make a good impression, hey things may be looking up 
  for you." 

Fade raises his hand. 

TrixCoder nods, (I've got to go, but explain it Locke is gonna send me 
  the log) 

Nunzio says "There is no way in hell that you are going to be able to do 
  much around here AT ALL without being involved in the groups somehow." 

Shiawase says "Just testing my puppet." 

Nunzio says "just from personal experience, all my chars in the table 
  top came from somewhere. There were in a group. And they had all sorts 
  of hooks in them that allowed my GM to have fun with the group and me. 
  You need that sort of thing for your character to advance into a good 
  capable runner, or whatever." 

Grunt raises his hand and waits in turn. 

Nunzio says "I'm done with that one. Boss? :)" 

Daniel Elazar raises his hand. 

James O'Malley gets up. 

Valkyrie says "James O'Malley?" 

James O'Malley says "Alright, now I understand that there is the 
  temptation to just go crazy out there..." 
James O'Malley says "But think about it. Your char didn't get the title 
  of a Runner by suddenly appearing out of no where..." 

Locke says "If you char _is_ a runner..not all are." 

James O'Malley says "In my opinion, none of the PC's (runners or not) 
  should be so ignorant as to not know not to walk around with a Panther 
  or something like that. Survival of the fittest would have eliminated 
  them right away." 

SuperGluBLDR nods. 

Ruby gasps in amazement at that statement. 

Matsuoro is almost finished with his Alt char's background. 
Matsuoro says "I am taking my down time to write a background for when I 
  die... been making enemies lately. :)" 

James O'Malley says "The point is, the PC's on here are either, 1) 
  ignorant citizens, or 2) the people who have made it this far. Now, 
  contacts to an org are excellent ways to get jobs, and probably the 
  easiest. but I have to disagree with Marusa (?). None of the PC's would
  go blow the club, they would have died long ago thinking they could have pulled that off." 

James O'Malley says "My last char was a kid, pretty secretive, and 
  pretty boring to play, basically because he was connected to people 
  who cared about him, and they knew that the best chance of survival 
  was away from the underworld." 

Fade raises his hand. 

Nunzio scritches Morris' ears. 

Valkyrie lags... 

Roman raises his hand. 

James O'Malley says "And since I was never connected to an org, I never 
  got TPs, but it was realistic. I think that every char has to realize 
  that they are either a grunt who is starting from the bottom to work 
  their way up, or someone at the top trying to stay there, or someone 
  trying to get out of the whole mess." 

James O'Malley says "That's my 2bits (I'm old fashioned, sue me)" 
James O'Malley steps down. 

Locke says "next val?" 

Roman says "i think valkyrie fell asleep" 

Nunzio thinks this subject has now been beaten to death. 

Locke says "Morris, want to take over if Val doesn't recover?" 

James O'Malley says "Hey, sorry if it was boring. Jeez." 

Morris says "I can, but I would be lost. Whats the topic." 

Locke says "I have something to bring up." 

Nunzio says "How to get into TPs, and has now evolved to being in or 
  around orgs." 

ShotoBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
ShotoBLDR floats in. 

Valkyrie says "Lag Beast Attack..." 
Valkyrie says "Sory." 

Roman has his hand in the air. 

Nunzio beats the lag beastie away with the BIG STICK!!!!! (TM) 

Valkyrie scrolls back. "Just a moment..." 
Valkyrie says "Umm... Roman, you were after James O'malley. Sorry about 
  the lag..." 

Roman says "ok" 
Roman says "basically i just wanted to say a few things" 
Roman says "first of all" 
Roman says "re: what marusa said" 
Roman says "about going crazy and doing stuff when you're bored" 
Roman says "well, that's cool by me, but just don't do stuff that's 
  connected to my char, example:" 
Roman says "the other day i was lounging in a bar" 
Roman says "and someone came in" 
Roman says "and @emitted that, i don't remember exactly, i think a fish 
  popped out of someone else's jacket" 
Roman says "everyone proceeded to say what the hell?" 

Matsuoro says "OOC heading home, seeya." 

Roman says "the person who emitted it said, 'roleplay it out, you 
  whiners'" 
Roman says "then got upset and left" 
Roman says "so basically, if you're going to go nuts" 
Roman says "be realistic" 
Roman says "and don't do anything that wouldn't correspond with other 
  people's chars" 
Roman says "secondly" 
Roman says "i wanted to say re: organizations" 

James O'Malley says "So how often are you on this little box?" 

Roman says "that not everyone is going to be involved or want to be 
  involved with organizations, i think they're a cool thing and an easy 
  way to connections and stuff, but they don't always fit icly with 
  people, for instance my char is pretty set against joining any org
  because his views are sure to upset someone in the organization, chuckle" 

James O'Malley says "Sorry, that was for a page, *embarrased grin*" 

Roman says "and he feels that he wouldn't want to be 'stuck' inside an 
  organization and their agenda, he'd rather do what he wants" 
Roman says "shrug, that's about it" 
Roman says "i'm done" 

Valkyrie says "Daniel Elazar?" 

Daniel Elazar says "With regards to being involved in groups, and having 
  a bg that involves group, as Nunzip and James brought it up: If that 
  is neccesary to having a succesful chracter, then why is "unaffiliated 
  runners" listed as one of the needed character types? Perhaps that should
  not be on the list. My character is not primarily a runner, but I tried to 
  create a completely unaffiliated person because I thought it was needed.
  If that's not true, then perhaps the character suggestions in the OOC room 
  should be changed to reflect that." 

Daniel Elazar lags something fierce, sorry. 

Nunzio raises his hand again, and sighs. 

Valkyrie says "Shoto?" 

ShotoBLDR says "Reply for the severel Different topics we have going 
  here:" 
ShotoBLDR says "TP's: I am sick of hearing complaints from players about 
  not being in TP's many I jhave heard make it sound like nothing evr 
  happens, and expect the ADmins to entertain them, make your own plots, 
  don't whine about not ever being in any" 
ShotoBLDR says "Re Organizations:" 

Nunzio slaps loudly 
Nunzio says "Claps even." 

ShotoBLDR says "Organizations IMHO should be _one_ of the primary 
  basises for TP's think about how many Tabletope Shadowrun games that 
  have been played that were based on a run for a corp, or any org, if 
  you are not a memeber of an org,then agian i would say, its up to you to 
  RP in your own Plots" 

ShotoBLDR says "I think that many players need to stop waiting for a 
  Shadowrun to come up and involve them, and think about what other 
  RPing opportunites there are for their characters" 
ShotoBLDR says "S'all" 

Valkyrie says "Ok..." 
Valkyrie says "I'm not sure going crazy is a good idea. Unfortunately, 
  what you usually leave behind re hurt or disgruntled players.... and 
  staff. Someone has to pick up the pieces. 

Orgs are an EASY way to get involved. Yes, there are PC's that won't 
  want to join them. But, if you make a loner, you HAVE to understand 
  that they are only happy choices IF you either get out there and do 
  something yourself or you get extremely lucky and something falls into
  your lap. I can't help you with the latter. It just has to happen. The
  former, however, is all up to you. You have to talk to an Admin or a
  Judge. We're not psychic... If no one has anything else to add, we'll
  start a new topic." 

Constantine Rye arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Nunzio says "I do! :)" 
Nunzio says "I've got something to add." 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio, are you sure? I think this topic's done." 

Nunzio says "No, it'll help." 

SuperGluBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie says "Go ahead..." 

SuperGluBLDR arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Nunzio says "I'm going to reach back in my mush experience here, and 
  give some examples, without names." 
Nunzio says "One, Fade. Me and him were talking through pages. Ok so I 
  mentioned a name." 
Nunzio says "He had a character in an org. He really enjoyed it. It's 
  not as fun for him now cause he's not in one." 

Valkyrie says "Nunzio, thanks... but we've beaten the topic enough that 
  examples are not reallly necesary. I want to move on." 

ShotoBLDR says "I wanna hear what he has to say" 

Nunzio says "Ok. Just one last thing." 

Valkyrie says "No offense... but we've been on this topic for 90 
  minutes." 
Valkyrie says "Page him, Shoto. He'll tell you." 

Nunzio says "As far as Marusa's going nuts thing. That's totaly 
  bullshit, and usually ends in someone's PC getting killed and that 
  person missing out on fun. It's a stupid and annoying thing to do." 
Nunzio says "Find actual RP, don't '" 
Nunzio says "'go nuts'." 
Nunzio says "Done." 

Valkyrie says "Ok... Glorie has to leave but she wanted to see a topic 
  covered so... we're going to talk about Meeting Scheuling and where 
  you can send Agenda ideas for the next meeting..." 

Constantine Rye nods. "John went the same way. too convienent." 

Glorie says "Okay, this should be quick: if people think this idea works 
  as a way to run these meetings, then cool. I was thinking there should 
  be one person to whom we can +mail topics for the agenda and those 
  will be discussed at the meeting. At the end of the meeting there can
  be an 'open mic' for comments, whatever." 

Glorie says "Also, how often should we have these? I think once a month 
  should be okay." 

Valkyrie says "We might put a booth up in the OOC room for this." 

Nunzio would like to add something. 

Valkyrie says "So everyone can see the topics presented beforehand." 

Glorie says "Good diea." 

Valkyrie says "Perhaps inspire new ideas." 

Nunzio says "Can this person selected, decide on the topics. Like if 
  someone adds on some stupid inane useless topic, can that person just 
  say, forget this one?" 

Glorie says "That's all I'm gonna say. Discuss amongst yerselves. :)" 

Valkyrie says "As for how often we can do this,Onced a month seems 
  probably the most productive and possible." 

Nunzio says "I like once a month." 

Locke says "I think the stupid topics wouldn't have a lot of time spent 
  if they are stupid." 

Valkyrie says "Yes... we will pick and choose at the topics. Some won't 
  need to be brought up here." 

Nunzio says "Thank you. I'm outta here. :)" 

Locke says "but shouldn't not be thrown out by one person." 

Valkyrie says "Right...there will be a fair system involved." 

Nunzio says "This isn't a democracy. This is a MUSH. A certain number of 
  people control it. Maybe not one. But players as a whole should not 
  run the mush. That just makes things too slow." 

Valkyrie says "Does anyone else have anything to add to the Scheduling 
  and Agenda topic?" 

Constantine Rye nods. A democracy is impossible to run. 

Ripper raises his hand. 

Shiawase says "Just putting my vote for once a month meetings." 

Valkyrie says "Ripper?" 

Thelon says "I too think once a month should be fine." 

Ripper says "How about just mentioning topics on the bboards?" 

Daniel Elazar raises his hand. 

Valkyrie says "The bboard has limited space. Although the bboard will 
  probably inspire topics, I don't think we should rely on it." 
Valkyrie says "Daniel?" 

Constantine Rye raises her hand. 

Ripper says "Then when the meeting comes around, you can say, I agree 
  with 1/700 or whatver...or add your own comments." 

Daniel Elazar says "For those concerned with one person okaying the 
  subjects . ." 

Valkyrie says "It won't be one person..." 

Daniel Elazar says "Anything which someone really wanted to talk about 
  could be brought up in the open mike section of the meeting." 

Valkyrie says "Very true, Daniel. :)" 
Valkyrie says "Rye?" 

Constantine Rye says " may i suggest that logs of the meetings be made 
  availible on the ftp site? some of the musers are not able to make 
  it..." 

Valkyrie says "Morris, is this possible?" 

Morris says "I can do that if someone sends me a log. I can even use 
  logedit to make it pretty." 

Constantine Rye says "Locke?" 

Locke says "If not, I'll be happy to e-mail any logs of any meetings I 
  log." 

Valkyrie says "WorldBLDR is handling the log. Ok... we'll have a bb up 
  when it is available, Rye. Good suggestion." 

WorldBLDR nods. 

Valkyrie says "Anyone else on Scheduling or Agenda?" 
Valkyrie says "If not... last topic..." 
Valkyrie says "Locke, I think you had something to say on Karma Awards?" 

Locke says "Yeah, I had a comment first..." 

Valkyrie says "" 

Locke says "About the bboards..." 
Locke says "I notice that there is not a lot of space on it, and yet 
  there is a lot of old, useful information on some of them. I was 
  thinking that this information should be taken down and reformatted 
  into another sign for the OOC room...(more)" 

Morris raises his paw to Lockes comment. 

ShotoBLDR says "what about a News Room so the OOC room doesn't get any 
  more cluttered" 

Locke says "also, Does the staff 'censor' posts? There are a few times 
  that I've posted messages only to find that they were deleted, without 
  any response." 

ShotoBLDR says "Thats happened to me once too..." 

Constantine Rye says "and me." 

ShotoBLDR says "deleted the same day I posted." 

Locke says "response?" 

Morris says "First, my plan has been to add the old useful info on the 
  bboards to news." 

Locke says "ok." 

Morris says "Of course my plan was to do that when I had the time." 
Morris says "Next, I am not aware of any censoring of posts. It is not a 
  policy here to censor any bbposts." 

Locke says "Well, I know I didn't erase it.." 

Morris says "I'm not saying you did. I dont know what happened to these 
  posts." 

Roman says "heh, did it say anything that would warrant it's removal?" 

Locke says "Sorry if that sounded mean, it wasn't meant to be." 
Locke says "not that I thought Roman." 

Roman says "hmm" 

O'Meara arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Locke says "One of them was about censoring, in fact..wondering where my 
  other post had gone." 

ShotoBLDR shrugs 

Morris says "Hmm. I dont have an answer." 

ShotoBLDR says "I am outta time, Latr People" 

Locke says "ok, well that's alright..just something to keep a watch 
  for.." 
Locke says "ok, onto my main point, about karma awards" 

Locke says "From stuff on the pub channel, concerning this subject that 
  I've heard, I'm wondering why does Karma seem to be given more heavily 
  for IC combat, but not most other IC behavior?" 

Locke says "hello?" 

Morris says "I think thats because with few judges the only time a judge 
  sees you is in a combat situation. We're trying to fix that by adding 
  more judges to be around for general RP situations." 

Locke says "ok, what about professions? like concerts, etc....?" 

Morris says "How many judges have made concerts?" 

O'Meara says "No kidding, look at all the new judges! :)" 

Constantine Rye says "I would have to interject... Daily concerts? 
  well... Single shebangs, ok... but the evry day stuff, why should they 
  get any more than the aveager shmoe doing thier normal job?" 

Locke says "Well, if some characters will never see combat, does that 
  make them less important?" 

O'Meara says "Exactly the point, Rye, people aren't getting any karma 
  for that...they get no karma (read experience) from it..." 

Morris says "Exactly, and the judges will be helping with smaller TPs to 
  involve more people. Both player generated and admin generated." 

Constantine Rye says "Then special provisions should be made, but every 
  time player x does a concert, why should they get karma, if they won't 
  be using it..." 

Locke says "I didn't say that." 
Locke says "there should be some ammount of recognition." 

Constantine Rye says "sorry, didn't mean to put words in your mouth" 
Constantine Rye says "Do they get paid? is that not recodnition?" 

Locke says "but still money != karma." 

Morris says "They are both important." 

O'Meara says "I've made a couple thousand mongering here, but that's 
  about it. Think I had a lot of biz, considering the hold on magickers? 
  Heh..." 

Locke says "but morris said they're working on it, so that's fine with 
  me." 
Locke says "I'm done" 

Morris says "I have a question for you all." 

O'Meara says "cool." 

Constantine Rye says "I have made a fair share of money, and karma, but 
  not from doing just my every day job, I had to go out of my way and do 
  something a little special... I aggree that the concerts take a lot of 
  time, but..." 

Locke says "ack, he's turning the tables!!" 

Morris says "Would you think it worth it to institute sending in logs 
  and awarding karma based on those logs?" 

O'Meara says "Uh, you guys have WAY TOO much to do as it is, don't you? 
  Who on earth would want to go through every last log that was sent 
  in?" 

WorldBLDR says "Logs can be edited though.." 

Constantine Rye says "Yes." 

Morris says "The bad thing about something like that is it would take 
  judges away from the MUSH to review logs." 
Morris says "Yes they can." 

WorldBLDR says "I have a suggestion to make" 

Morris says "Yes World?" 

WorldBLDR says "in regards to the +nom...." 

O'Meara says "Morris, are you going to try to hire any more Euorjudges? 
  This place needs em pretty bad. I've talked to people that didn't know 
  what a timestop was..." 

Valkyrie sighs... 

Constantine Rye says "Logs can be editied, but It would a. only hurt 
  those who didthe cheating, and b. it would seem obvious if someone was 
  submitting logs all the time. you can +nom 2 times a wwek, how about 
  +log once a month?" 

Valkyrie says "Sorry...yet again..." 

O'Meara says "sorry about what? Sorry if I missed it earlier. :(" 

WorldBLDR says "how about making it 1 +nom = .5 karma, instead of 2 +nom 
  = 1 karma...then if all a player get's is 1 +nom, it doesn't get 
  wasted, it gets saved until another is received. I mentioned this to 
  Serrin, but he said that it would entail too much coding, but I didn't
  think so. (more)" 

Locke says "whoops, that was supposed to be this screen, let me 
  continue." 

Valkyrie got dumped offline... 

O'Meara says "just have that +nom carry over to the next week, it's a 
  one line command, from what I've heard." 

Valkyrie says "Sorry about being gone for @10-15 minutes. :)" 

O'Meara says "Oh. Yeah, you should be. :P" 

Morris says "As for EuroJudges, I'll add them if they apply. We are not 
  discouraging them." 

Locke says "How about just keeping track of half-karma, instead of 
  karma? then no messy decmil point." 

Jdc arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

O'Meara says "Morris, I'd like to make a suggestion about the +noms, and 
  I realize it would take a bit of work, but here goes" 

Morris says "I made that decision for the karma awards Locke. I just 
  dont see a reason for carry over. The +noms were designed as a weekly 
  representation of how your fellow mushers thought of your RP." 

Locke says "but if a person get's one +nom a week, for a month, it 
  equals nothing." 

O'Meara says "Would it be possible to make it so you can keep track of 
  where people get their +noms from? I get the feeling that twink 
  circles are rampant here, simply because people know they can get away 
  with it." 

Morris says "Your right, which means that only one person thought they 
  were RPing well, which is not enough in my minf." 

Valkyrie says "Yes... it is possible. It has recently started benig 
  done, as a matter of fact." 

Morris says "That is possible O'meara/" 

O'Meara says "well, no, that's not the point..." 
O'Meara says "They aren't getting the +noms based on their RP, it's 
  based on who their friends are." 

Constantine Rye nods. 

Locke says "O', that first response was to me" 

O'Meara nods 

Locke says "can I make a quick comment?" 

Valkyrie says "NO! :)" 
Valkyrie says "Of course." 

Morris says "And we are concerned about any trend like that O'meara, it 
  defeats the real purpose of +nom." 

Locke says "what happened to the matrix/guest comments on the help 
  channel?" 

O'Meara nods 

Locke says "I kinda liked them." 

Valkyrie says "Matrix/Guest comments?" 

O'Meara grins "When?" 

Locke says "you know, guest-1 has jacked into the matrix and g-1 has 
  been dumped by black-ice" 

You aren't a member of that channel! 

Valkyrie says "The gust system has been recoded a bazillion times... 
  Probably got dumped in one of the incarnations." 

Locke says "Well, just a curiosity." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Locke says "hmm, gust system...well blow me down.." 
Locke snickers. 

Grunt arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Valkyrie chuckles. 
Valkyrie says "Umm... I think that's about everything..." 

O'Meara says "I've got a question." 

The current time and date is: Thu Mar 30 23:41:45 2055 

Valkyrie says "Sure. :)" 

O'Meara says "Ok, are there plans to have people set their short desc, 
  and auras before they leave chargen? Call me anal, but I'd rather look 
  at someone's aura than their physical desc half the time...just a pet 
  peeve, when they don't have one set..." 

O'Mearathe prima donna. ;) 

Grunt smiles. 

Valkyrie says "Yes... we'll put those instructions in the Final Room in 
  Chargen." 

O'Meara cheers! 
O'Meara says "very cool, thank you." 

WorldBLDR says "Ok, if this is it, I'm gonna turn off the log 
  now...everybody say goodnight. :)" 

Valkyrie says "Unless anyone else has anything to ad?" 

Grunt says "Goodnight." 

O'Meara says "Goodnight." 

Valkyrie says "Ok... meeting closed. :)" 

Constantine Rye says "nope, i think it was a good session..." 

WorldBLDR says "Ok, Log off."
