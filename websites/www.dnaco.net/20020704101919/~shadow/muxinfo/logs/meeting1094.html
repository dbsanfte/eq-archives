Villiers says "I considering how to get cyberware operational in the 
  near future as well" 

Serrin nods. 
Serrin says "Do you think we can get a structure for the Matrix, and the 
  basic builder's manuals, up by Thanksgiving? (two weeks from today)?" 
Serrin says "we were applauding Villiers and getting a Matrix report, 
  an' he's toolin' along real well, cuz he's wiz :)" 
Serrin says "now we move on to something real quick, cuz Krenn's not 
  here" 

Morris says "Yes he is, a behind the scenes wiz. :)" 

Serrin says "Vehicles" 
Serrin says "I know about how far he's gotten and he's limited by two 
  things" 
Serrin says "(1) he doesn't have the Riggers Black Book, but I think we 
  can farm out the stats fr the cars to people who do--much like Morris 
  with the guns. I'll talk to him about that." 
Serrin says "(2) he's the one working on debugging the wonderfully 
  beautiful telephone system." 

Gallant says "I mailed him as a pc over a month ago all the Lone Star 
  and DocWagon stats." 
Gallant says "I can provide him with faxes of everything." 

Serrin says "So I'm sure that vehicles will be done as soon as possible, 
  though with our DBsize as huge as it is, that's actually a good thing 
  that they are not all up. ;)" 
Serrin says "Question, though. Val mentioned in her mail about vehicles 
  and backgrounds. Do you still want me to handle the vehicle 
  distribution system as I have been, or move that to RPAdmin area?" 
Serrin says "rather, not about vehicles and backgrounds, but about 
  giving people stuff based on backgrounds." 

Morris says "RP admin, they dont get the vehicle until the background is 
  approved." 

Valkyrie says "People buying vehichles is one thing. People saying they 
  want 'em cuz they're in their bg's is another." 

Morris nods, "Or anything else." 

Valkyrie says "And right now, you can't buy a vehicle in chargen." 

Morris says "Its on my todo list. A vehicle chit maker in chargen..." 

Serrin says "Right, Val. So I've been handling it via background and 
  remaining resources left from chargen--a thing that is hard to trace 
  after they've left chargen." 
Serrin says "But I'm MORE than willing to turn that over to RPAdmins." 

Gallant says "Well, I feel that lifestyle and backgrounds are the place 
  to look." 

Serrin says "I'll delete the post and tell them to contact the RPAds." 

Morris nods 

Gallant says "But we also have to keep in mind that a beginning player 
  really shouldnt have resources" 

Serrin says "Next bit o'binniz." 
Serrin says "Sorry, Gallant wasn't done :)" 

Gallant says "to own a nightsky or westwind unless their lifestyle and 
  background warrants..." 
Gallant says "fine" 

Serrin says "But I would say the RPAds can basically talk about it 
  amongst yourselves as to how you want it handled, so ka?" 

Morris says "ka ka ka." 

Serrin giggles. 

Gallant says "eeeewwwwww." 

Serrin says "Morris is in a funny mood tonight :)" 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Serrin says "Next bit of business before the discussion of new stuff 
  beings." 

Morris says "Its friday, for me at least. :)" 

Gallant says "mee toooo." 

Serrin says "Talieson, economy: progress on corporate economy, progress 
  on underworld economy, corporate activity you are aware of, and other 
  economy-related discourse that you can think of that we might want to 
  know about to get a better picture of things, please." 

Talieson says "Well....Econ is going slow because of a few reasons..." 
Talieson says "1) Corps are not IC, and are dragging butt (save for 
  Aztechnology)" 
Talieson says "2) I need a comprehensive list of the underground Orgs to 
  establish what they deserve on a quarterly basis." 
Talieson says "3) I have a new guy running my state named Pataki." 

Serrin laughs! 

Talieson says "4) I'm bummed about that..:)" 

Villiers grins 

Serrin says "OK" 

Talieson says "That's it.." 

Gallant says "Well, how do you think I feel, none of the things I voted 
  for won." 

Serrin says "I've a few suggestions." 
Serrin says "Number one suggestion: we put the Sherman Huang character 
  and Renraku Corp on the open positions board." 

Talieson says "Oh?" 
Talieson says "Ok." 

Valkyrie seconds. 

Serrin says "I discussed this briefly with Grimmzackh. He was planning 
  on doing so with Renraku Corp..." 
Serrin says "But he didn't think that anyone would want to play Huang." 
Serrin says "We might also want to do the same thing with Tadashi, as 
  Grendel hasn't been playing him likehe has Lotus. he's let the 
  character fall into disuse once he made it an NPC." 

Gallant says "I have noticed as a general rule" 

Talieson nods 

Serrin says "We should do the same thing with Fuchi Corp, unless someone 
  can take a moment to sit down with Samantha Villiers and see what's up 
  there. I'm not certain if that character is currently an NPC or a PC." 

Gallant says "that players in the mafia and" 
Gallant says "such are never online..." 

Serrin says "ah, actually, the problem with Fuchi is that it isn't 
  linked yet. So never mind that." 
Serrin says "Sammy is indeed a PC, from fingering. AS far as Mafia and 
  Yakuza, they are online often, actually--Paulo 
  Clemente/Outrider/Mephisto, plus the larger amount of the now-defunct 
  Steel Rose organization." 
Serrin says "Val, Zeiss Corp--PC or NPC?" 

Valkyrie says "Zeiss is NPC... VERY NPC." 

Morris says "What we need is dedicated people to run the corps that are 
  nearly finished..." 

Serrin says "So ka. Get them hiring, in your COPIOUS amounts of spare 
  time :)" 
Serrin agrees with Morris. 
Serrin says "Well...Aztechnology will be linked just as soon as he 
  finishes elevator, assorted object, and &SECURITY coding." 
Serrin says "Renraku, Knight Errant, and Shiawase need to be farmed out 
  to new applicants." 

Morris says "Zeiss is not like that Serrin, we are handling it in the 
  way we need it to be. It will move when we are ready." 
Morris says "What happened to Shiawase" 

Serrin says "Fuchi needs to be talked to, to see what's up. Network 23 
  is hiring left and right, kinda. Reuben Straight has been on-again, 
  off-again." 
Serrin says "I don't know what's up with Shiawase, actually." 

Talieson says "I haven't heard anything about it...Haven't seen them 
  online" 

Morris nods 

Serrin says "OK, so we put Renraku, Knight Errant and Shiawase in the 
  Jobs Needed positions." 
Serrin says "And Tal, can you talk to Samantha when you next see her 
  online?" 

Talieson says "I got an update from them about 3 weeks ago, but it was 
  something to the effect that they wanted to help rebuild the city 
  after the riots" 

Serrin says "Sam Villiers, that is?" 

Talieson says "I will" 

Gallant says "I would like to see KE's leadersip be RP Admin." 

Morris says "Not Shiawase, unless its close to finished." 

Serrin says "Not Shiawase? OK." 

Talieson says "No...Shiawase needs work" 

Gallant says "Because of the link to Ares Macrotechnology and their 
  villanous ways." 

Serrin giggles. 

Morris says "We only let them do Shiawase cause thats what they really 
  wanted to do." 

Serrin says "Opinions on KE?" 

Gallant says "I think it would be fun to have plots run through them, 
  and let the Corpers deal with the actual wherewithall." 

Morris shakes his head, "I would like to see KE as PC." 

Serrin says "I don't really have one either way except to say this: can 
  RPAd handle the added burden of running KE and keeping it active? If 
  they can, then yes, I'm totally for it." 

Gallant says "I know I can." 

Morris says "And Ares too, especially Ares." 

Gallant says "I actually need a corp that I can rely on." 

Morris says "There are enough small ones to not need to restrict the 
  major ones." 

Serrin says "Other opinions?" 

Gallant says "Well KE is not all that large, maybe using the parent 
  corp, Ares..." 

Morris says "If someone wants to be KE, really wants to, we should let 
  them." 

Gallant says "I agree." 

Serrin says "Actually, I've an idea." 

Morris says "But if no one wants to be it, we RP admins will use it, but 
  not run it." 

Gallant nods. 

Serrin says "Gall, since you have the time apparently (grin)...maybe a 
  TP that involves the heads of the corps, or something that might spur 
  them to action on something? just a suggestion." 

Talieson thought that was his dept...*shrug* 

Gallant says "I have a run in progress that requires an evil corp... :>" 

Serrin says "that could work in Samantha Villiers, and Aztechnology when 
  they get online. Just an idea. Oh, Talieson too." 

Morris says "It is Tal." 

Serrin says "I'm sorry, I'm just dumb." 
Serrin smacks himself and abases himself repreatedly. 

Talieson says "to be honest...the corps refuse to RP until they are 
  linked and feel that they have enough money, etc..." 

Morris says "Is Aztec linked yet?" 

Serrin says "Fuchi should be linked soon, BTW--Temporus is farming out 
  their inspection to me, and I will get on it on Monday." 

Talieson says "Yes, but you know that old story Morris..:(" 

Serrin says "Aztec will be linked as soona s he finishes &SECURITY and 
  elevators." 

Morris says "I want to see what he does when linked..." 

Serrin nods. 
Serrin says "Okay...I guess that's all that can be said about this right 
  now." 

Morris nods 

Serrin says "So onto concern #1 as brought up today, dbloat. And 
  possible ways to curb it. During the lag-probs today Temp and I were 
  on the phone for a while discussing it....there are two things we came 
  up with that I'd like to talk about, in order, actually." 

Arachnia steps through a swirling portal of inverted space. 

Serrin says "Hi Arachnia :)" 

Gallant says "Hello Arachnia." 

Arachnia nods with a smile, "Greetings, Just got off work and am at My 
  father's house 

Serrin says "The first way we came up with to remove dbloat has to do 
  with a possible suggested builder restriction." 

Morris says "Hi Arachnia" 

Serrin says "Which is as such. At this point, most every neccessary 
  project is being worked on as it is. So we, instead of having builders 
  apply to make new stuff, and then move on to work on other ideas, 
  instead only let people build the things that the Builder Wizzes need 
  to have done." 
Serrin says "An assignment basis of building rather than a 
  request/granted request basis of building....opinions?" 

Morris nods 

Arachnia has been saying something close to that for a whil 

Gallant says "Have a plan before you build, so to speak." 

Serrin says "Not even that, Gallant..." 

Arachnia says "No, I dont think that is what He is sayiong Gal" 

Serrin says "More of, don't build drek unless the Wizzes assign you 
  something to build." 

Morris says "That will help with reducing expansion, but we need to 
  reduce." 

Talieson says "I brought this up at the last meeting I believe, and 
  everyone thought I was crazy...I pointed out that PsychoBLDR was 
  planning over 100 rooms for Cascade...You all said "We have PLENTY of 
  DBspace"...Nice to know you are finally seeing my point.." 

Arachnia says "More along the lines of...YOU go build this..." 

Nightshade grins. 
Nightshade says "Hiya" 

Serrin says "Nightshade, new RPAdmin, meet Arachnia, old RPAdmin, a 
  crotchety old wench I know IRL, who is kinda neat sometimes :)." 
Serrin says "Villiers?" 

Arachnia sticks her tounge out at Nightshade to prove her 
  "Crotcheteness". 

Serrin says "opinions?" 

Arachnia says "Yes, I am crotchety." 
Arachnia says "Anyother opinions?" 

Gallant says "Awww, Serrin... dont be nice." 

Talieson says "what's this about Arachnia's Crotch?"

Serrin says "Anyone else have any opinions on this building thing?" 

Morris says "Our choices are stop building or get more memory for the 
  machine..." 

Serrin says "I'm working on that ;)" 

Gallant says "What are the limitations as present." 

Talieson says "I said this 2 months ago....Did anyone listen to the 
  suit? Nope..:)" 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Nightshade grins. 
Nightshade couldn't really be called crotchety, but he is kinda ticked 
  most of the time. =) 
Nightshade is laggin' really bad, so excuse the pauses. =) 

Serrin says "OK, I guess we stop building for now." 

Morris says "The machine has 16 meg of memory, the current db is 13 
  meg." 

Villiers says "one sec" 

Quicksilver gestures in the drow hand language, "Why haven't you killed 
  him yet, Arach?." 

Villiers says "At the moment, I've put a halt to new builders ...haivng 
  them build by request only will be a massive administrative headache, 
  but is someone else wants to handle it, it's a great idea :)" 

Morris notes Tals comments. 
Morris says "We can continue to grow, we wont crash the machine, but the 
  lag will continue to get worse as we get into virtual memory." 

Serrin says "Not only put a halt to new builders, Vill...I'm also 
  talking about restricting existing builders to stop nonessential 
  projects." 

Gallant says "Morris, what are the cost options of upgrading the 
  machine?" 

Arachnia Was under the impression that we were on at least a 1 gig drive 
Arachnia says "One gig is about 6-7 hundred dollars" 

Morris says "Its not hard drive space thats the problem. Its memory 
  usage." 
Morris says "TinyMUSH puts the entire Db into memory." 

Arachnia grimaces 

Gallant says "Yuck!" 
Gallant says "Whats a 64 meg upgrade run?" 
Gallant checks his bank balance. 

Serrin says "I'm working thru Lang to pick up some mem for him, Arach, 
  but it's slow going" 

Arachnia sighs 

Morris says "It takes 4x9 simms, wich are about 150 each." 

Gallant nods. 

Serrin says "OK..." 

Nightshade says "Ack." 

Morris says "Need four simms min." 

Talieson says "$600??Sheesh!" 

Morris says "Not cheap buying them." 

Serrin says "I'd be willing to take on the "administrative hassle" of 
  assigned buildings, and the problems of telling existing builders to 
  stop building." 

Villiers says "right...it's a good idea, but I would prefer not to 
  handle it myself...dealing with that many requests will be a real 
  time-sucker" 

Arachnia says "Question..." 

Morris says "Yes?" 

Arachnia says "Not to insult anyone here or anything...But has anyone 
  looked into mabey getting put on a school's main fraim or something?" 

Gallant says "I am joining a game company in 4 days." 
Gallant says "They have an excellent connection and in house service." 

Serrin says "actually, the problem with that is that while being on a 
  school's mainframe might have the attraction of having more memory, 
  that memory is used by 543254325432 other tasks." 

Arachnia would rather deal with lag than limits. 

Gallant says "I feel the same way." 

Arachnia says "Also, has anyone spoken with Fasa recently?" 

Morris says "Then build here." 

Serrin says "FASA is in the middle of an SR restructuring." 

Morris says "I said it wouldn't crash the machine, just increase lag." 

Arachnia says "Purhap they would be interested in Buying the mush and 
  therefore pay for the needs of it..." 
Arachnia says "just an idea" 

Serrin says "I can try to call again--it's been weeks." 

Gallant says "I can also call, Email on GENIE is the best way" 

Serrin says "I'll get Dowd on the horn and see what he's got to say." 

Talieson doesn't think Fasa has much use for a MUSH...No Profit to be 
  made. 

Morris nods 

Gallant says "Actually Tali" 

Nightshade says "I think a lot of builders are under the assumption that 
  there's plenty of disk space left. If we mention that there's a 
  problem, they may get rid of some of their current projects. I know I 
  will." 

Serrin says "I've already spoken to him, and he liked the idea." 

Nightshade acks 'cuz he's still lagging...badly. 

Arachnia says "Plenty of profit..." 

Gallant says "Internet is a big marketing deal" 

Arachnia nods 

Villiers says "guys I need to go...got work to do" 

Serrin says "I'll talk to him." 

Gallant says "Seeya." 

Serrin says "OK, Vill." 

Arachnia says "How many people here Newbies) that have gone out and 
  baught the main book judst so they can play here? Alot" 

Villiers says "I'll talk to those of you interested in the building 
  stuff later if you like" 

Serrin says "OK Villiers." 

Talieson doesn't want to be charged to MUSH...And most other people 
  wouldn't either. 

Villiers waves 

Serrin says "We'll discuss that sort of thing soon..." 

Arachnia says "No charge would be nescessary. It is advertising not 
  sdervice is how we could promote it to FASA" 

Serrin says "I don't think anyone here wants to sell the MUSH to FASA 
  and be charged for it unless they feel like paying us game designer 
  money for the work we've done, nor do I think they'll want to buy it." 

Gallant says "I actually think that a advertising and promotion will pay 
  for FASA accepting cost of maintenance." 

Arachnia nods in agreement with Gallant 

Gallant says "I work in the game industry" 

Serrin says "And I'll talk to Dowd about it. I agree with you, Gallant." 

Gallant says "I just quit my boring job..." 
Gallant says "and I am back." 
Gallant says "okokok, the secret corp is 3DO... dont laugh, they pay 
  well." 

Arachnia says "Like I said, I know at least 10 peeople who joined the 
  mush, then went out and bought fasa products strictly because of the 
  mush" 

Serrin says "That's what I said in my pitch to him. He said to hold off 
  because ShadowRun is switching managers, and this sort of thing is 
  less of a priority than getting it set up under new management." 

Morris says "This discussion has come up on the newsgroups..." 

Talieson says "It's a nice concept...I don't think they'll buy into that 
  idea though...Worth a" 
Talieson says "shot" 

Gallant says "Hmm..." 

Serrin says "I'll call him Monday." 

Gallant says "In a few weeks I will do a post script advertisement." 
Gallant says "and a write up." 

Serrin says "No advertisements yet for the MUSh please." 

Gallant says "then we will see what people think... :> nono, internal." 

Serrin says "Not until we are officially open." 
Serrin says "Oh, okay." 

Gallant says "You have to have something visual to be able to sell.." 

Serrin says "Anyway, we're digressing..." 

Gallant says "anyway, enough" 

Valkyrie reconnects and KICKS her net! 

Serrin says "The second part of the DBloat proposal." 
Serrin says "Reducing dbloat." 

Morris says "What machines does the company you are going to work for 
  have?" 

Serrin says "First of all, I'd like to wipe out all players and their 
  objects who have not connected since September 1st." 

Arachnia definately agrees with an "Inactivity" claus. 

Serrin says "Second of all, I have to go through the Mail Room Storage 
  and wipe out the Mail Data objects for every player we have ever had 
  that has been nuked or goes away." 

Morris nods 

Arachnia says "Setting up a total mail wipe every 30 days or so is a 
  good idea as wel." 
Arachnia says "Other MU**s do it and it works there" 

Serrin says "Thirdly, the RPAds need to come up with a strict policy for 
  procedures to be followed when nuking someone. Erasing all items (the 
  Dead Player Stuff Vat--is it really neccessary? If the killers don't 
  take the objects, why not @dest them?"" 

Arachnia says "If it is important enough to keep, it is important enough 
  to print out." 

Serrin says "They ALSO have to ex player/MBOX and destroy the MBOX 
  item." 

Arachnia says "Another "mail" thing..." 
Arachnia says "Is it realy necsecarry when commenting on someones mil to 
  keep quoting the whole thing back again and again?" 
Arachnia says "Shadore does this every time." 

Serrin says "We should also go through and erase all the apartments and 
  stuff that dead people leave behind unless such are important for RP 
  reasons. However, once I talk to Alicia about recoding the apartments, 
  I hope to get her to code in something that makes that easy, like a 
  central registry for all people so that it is easy to look into where 
  everyone lives." 
Serrin says "In addition, (and he hates the idea but is going to do it), 
  Temporus is going to be printing out a global @search of all things on 
  the MUSH for me, by Nov 17th. I'm going to go thru all 15,000 items 
  and get rid of the trash." 

Valkyrie says "The Dead Vat was mainly put there so that Admins would 
  have a resource to draw things from should they be necessary... a 
  Fixer, for instance, might need a gun... easiest way to get one is to 
  just get one..." 

Arachnia did not even know about the dead vat 

Serrin says "Serrin, Janitor Admin. :)" 

Talieson didn't either 

Gallant says "it works..." 

Serrin says "Opinions on any of the points brought up so far please?" 

Valkyrie says "The Dead Vat wasn't a big thing. I had originally made it 
  for my own use. Other people started contributing..." 

Gallant says "I think its neccesary." 
Gallant says "Better than creating new items." 
Gallant says "until we have more db" 

Serrin says "It's only neccessary until Morris gets the gun distribution 
  service set up." 

Arachnia says "One a diressed point there..." 

Gallant says "I have a char in chargen for other items." 

Serrin says "As it is now, that vat contains about 200 items." 

Arachnia says "The gun creator in Character gen should stop putting the 
  OWNER name on it..." 

Serrin says "Maybe a bit less." 

Valkyrie says "True... but I made that vat quite a while ago..." 

Arachnia says "A gun should only have that if it gets registered in the 
  game." 

Serrin says "I don't blame you for the Vat, Val--it was a good idear :)" 

Morris nods 

Serrin says "And Arachnia--" 

Gallant says "Yes. I agree." 

Serrin says "the guns have to be registered. They might not be *LEGALLY* 
  registered ICly." 

Gallant says "Serial numbers can be filed off." 

Valkyrie agrees with Arach about the gun name thing... 

Gallant grins. 

Serrin says "However, if they are not reigstered OOCly, we can't FIND 
  specific guns." 

Arachnia says "We shouldnt need to find them" 

Serrin says "Sometimes we have to." 

Arachnia says "Not to mention the fact that the way it is, there is no 
  way TO register them "Legally"" 

Serrin says "Especially with missing equipment, people that steal, etc. 
  etc. etc.." 

Morris is thinking of using notes for stuff like that. 

Valkyrie says "Another field might be in order on each gun... 
  &registered. Either it is Yes or No... if it is Yes, then the gun gets 
  registered to the owner. If it switches hands and is reregistered, 
  change &owner and 

egistered." 

Serrin says "We need to have the ability to track specific weapons." 

Arachnia says "Personaly, on THAT note...I feel..if they want to play 
  before we are open and have all the bugs worked out. If something gets 
  "Lost" tough. It's lost and stop spending so much time hunting down 
  lost items" 

Gallant says "Maybe a Weapon Accessory" 
Gallant says "That lets any RP admin do that... add smartlinks, etc... 
  wihtout having to chwon the weapon and have a wiz inherit." 

Serrin says "It's easy to fix this, actually. There is a &NOTES field on 
  the guns." 

Morris baps his head, what a brilliant idea! 

Serrin says "Therein is where you put stuff for smartlinks, etc." 

Gallant says "that holds everything important... :>" 

Morris shakes his head, "Not anymore Serrin." 

Gallant says "We shouldnt use dbase space for something so simple." 

Arachnia says "Greate. so then any idiot picking up a dropped gun can 
  just look at it and say, "Huh, look here. This guns registered with 
  the proper people. Guess I dont want it then."" 
Arachnia says "Never mind" 
Arachnia has to look at fingers when she types so misses some stuff 
  before she finishes that might already answer her questions or 
  comments and appologizes. 

Serrin says "Basically, Arachnia, yeah. If they want to play it that way 
  OOCly, that's twinkish but fine...but I'd rather not have to code 
  around that twink crap." 

Morris has to do that to. 

Gallant twists one of arachnias eyes UP and another down... "there! 
  solution! doh!" 

Serrin says "So okay, what's the solve for this?" 

Morris says "There is no easy solve for this." 

Valkyrie says "Have the &registered attribute only visible to Admins and 
  Wizzes." 

Arachnia says "Only IC registered guns should have an OWNER...you can 
  keep the serial number part though" 
Arachnia says "Or Valk's suggestion is better" 
Arachnia says "There is one last soloution..." 
Arachnia says "Instead of being able to buy ANYTHING in character 
  gen...Give them the money and they have to do it ICly" 

Serrin says "OK, a wiz- and admin- visual &registered command, which 
  includes the name of the person whose gun it is and a YES or NO to 
  indicate legal registration." 

Random says "Sorry I'm late." 

Serrin says "So ka, Random." 
Serrin says "How does that sound?" 

Valkyrie says "Umm.. was my idea. I'd better like it. :)" 

Morris says "But happens if they sell it?" 

Serrin says "Then they've sold a gun that THEY know is legally 
  registered." 

Valkyrie says "If it's done legal-like, it gets reregistered..." 

Random says "BTW, Online tells me people are carrying concealed 
  autocannons." 

Arachnia says "Ummm, we realy want to answer a Judge call everytime a 
  player wants to sell their weapon to another player?" 

Serrin says "We'll get to concealment in a minute...that's on the agenda 
  :)" 

Morris says "But you said we needed to track that for OOC purposes, how 
  does that help?" 

Valkyrie says "If it's illegal-like, and thr original owner is still 
  alive, he'd better report it and then we change it from yes/no to 
  yes/no/stolen" 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Valkyrie says "The only person who should be asking for an OOC track is 
  the owner." 

Serrin says "We will still have the ability to track the guns." 

Gallant says "Online is silly... it was a pose." 

Serrin says "Admins and stuff will be able to see the registration 
  attribute, no?" 

Talieson says "why not code a +sellgun command that automatically 
  switched the attributes on the guns?" 

Valkyrie says "Sure...that'd be the best way I think." 

Gallant says "Youve got a mushbomb in your inventory Random" 

Morris says "We're asking for a lot of work, reregistering a gun ebery 
  time it changes hands." 

Random says "Uh, what?" 

Serrin says "we only have to reregister the legal ones" 

Arachnia nods in agreement with Morris 

Valkyrie says "Not every weapon... just every legal one. Illegal ones 
  don't need any staff maintenance at all." 

Serrin nods to Valkyrie. 

Valkyrie says "This also does away with the permit problem." 

Morris says "According to Serrin they do..." 

Serrin says "No, no." 

Morris says "Yes, how else do we track for OOC purposes?" 

Serrin says "Listen. When you buy a gun in chargen, it gets registered 
  to you and is legally or not legally registered as it goes, however 
  that may be." 

Arachnia still doesnt see why we have to track OOCly at all. 

Morris says "That is the whole reason for this discussion" 
Morris says "So unless you are the person who originally bought it, you 
  cant report OOC problems with it?" 

Arachnia says "A 'Change the owner of my gun to ****' machine in OOC 
  would work for legal sales..." 

Serrin says "What I'm saying is that if people lose the guns they have 
  that they got from Chargen, originally, we should be able to find them 
  if the logic behind that is a problem." 
Serrin says "Actually, what Arachnia sez solves it" 

Arachnia says "If they loose it, the simplest solution is they lost it." 

Serrin says "just put a machine in the Chargen room that changes the 
  ownership of the gun" 
Serrin says "I mean the OOC room." 

Arachnia says "Why chargen room?" 
Arachnia nods 

Serrin says "Then we don't have to do drek." 

Valkyrie says "I think I can do all the coding, too." 

Arachnia giggles 
Arachnia says "It would need two inputs" 

Serrin says "And we can track ANY gun that is lost OOCly if we need to." 

Arachnia says "One from the legal owner and one from the person that is 
  buying it..." 

Valkyrie says "We could put that machine in Lonestar to make it 
  official." 

Talieson likes that idea, Val..:) 

Valkyrie says "It will check that the right person is selling the gun to 
  someone with a SIN..." 

Serrin nods. 

Morris says "So people can OOC steal things, go to the machine, and poof 
  its thiers, real owner has no recorse." 

Arachnia says "So this way people dont shoot someone with thier legal 
  weapon and then change the owner to someone else to through off the 
  trail" 

Serrin says "no" 

Valkyrie says "Not by what I just said. :)" 

Serrin says "the OOC room machine:" 
Serrin says "OK, here's the deal." 
Serrin says "I'm an illegal arms merchant." 

Random says "WHAT MUSHBOMB AM I CARRYING?!?!?" 

Morris says "What about people without SINs Val?" 

Serrin says "We set the machine up so that the only person who can 
  change the "name" part of the field is the person whose name is 
  ALREADY IN IT." 

Arachnia says "No SIN you cant legaly purchas a weapon" 

Valkyrie says "Someone without a SIN can't have a legal weapon, sell a 
  legal weapon legally, and thus won't be able to use the machine." 

Morris says "You aren't anymore random, I took it," 

Serrin says "So stealing a gun won't work. If you STEAL one, the admin 
  or judge has to change it." 
Serrin says "If I sell one gun to someone, legal or illegal, I go to the 
  OOC room and change the owner field to them after I have the money" 

Valkyrie says "A stolen gun will still be registered to the correct 
  owner (assuming it was a registered gun to begin with). It's working 
  just like RL." 
Valkyrie says "The proper gun owner can even go to the machine to report 
  it stolen... Now we're really off the hook." 

Talieson nods in agreement with Val. 

Serrin says "and the LEGAL sales machine, changes the YES/NO field in 
  the registration" 

Morris says "Whatever, I though this whole issue was brought up because 
  Serrin wanted a way to OOC trace things." 

Valkyrie says "He still can." 

Talieson says "another can of worms...:)" 

Serrin says "Right. We've got one, I just explained it :)" 
Serrin says "Using Val's machine and registration field idea. Machine 
  has two functions, both accessible ONLY by the person whose name is on 
  the Gun's registration field already (and us admins)." 

Morris nods 

Serrin says "First function changes owner name to new owner name. Second 
  function changes YES/NO legality stuff, for a fee for a permit for 
  people with SINs." 

Random says "What was it?" 

Morris says "There needs to be two names on the gun, the legal owner and 
  the OOC owner." 

Serrin says "And Val boldly volunteered to code it cuz she's a trouper 
  :" 
Serrin says "::)" 

Valkyrie says "Only interesting change I can see is that I might have to 
  set all guns Visual so that the players can see their db#'s to 
  register them." 

Serrin says "everyone clear on how this works now?" 

Random says "How about a Serial Number function that returns the DB#?" 

Valkyrie says "I was just about to say that, Random. :) You beat me to 
  it." 

Morris says "I can put the serial number in the check command." 

Random says "And it's a miracle I did, with this intermittent lag..." 

Valkyrie says "Serial #'s are available for a weapon when you 'check' 
  them, anyway..." 

Morris says "So it already is." 

Valkyrie is eating raisins and her hands were sticky. :) 

Serrin says "OK, to the original point: can we all agree on the 
  following: (1) Nuke policy for people not on prior to Sept 1 (2) Nuke 
  policy for RPAdmins to get rid of all gear, plus the MBOX data object 
  (3) Serrin to go thru huge list of 15000 objects and @dest the garbage 
  stuff?" 

Random says "Morris, what was the mushbomb I had?" 

Morris says "No way to tell." 

Serrin prays you will disagree with 3 :) 

Morris says "It was a mushbomb." 

Random says "15000 objects? Split that up!" 

Valkyrie confesses to definitely not having time for that task... 

Gallant says "Nah, lock serrin in his room till he finishes - no tv" 

Serrin says "heh." 

Morris says "Before 3 is done, have the builders clean out their stuff 
  voluntarily, see if its still needed." 

Serrin nods. 

Gallant says "Oh, its my date..." 

Serrin says "I'm going to have a chat with all the BLDRs I can see about 
  Dbsize and nonessential projects." 

Gallant smiles. 
Gallant blushes and gets all hot all over. 

Serrin grins at Gallant. 
Serrin says "heh." 

Morris says "Lets move on." 

Serrin says "OKay...since I hear no real objections, next bit." 

Serrin says "Player Applications. I'd like to suggest that a stricter 
  policy be setup..." 
Serrin says "...but I'm the first person to admit I've no idea how to do 
  it." 

Random says "OK... is whoever's doing the Matrix interested in this old 
  Claymore prog idea?" 

Serrin says "Talk to Villiers about that later, Random." 
Serrin says "While we talked about Arachnia's quota-for-types idea, and 
  dismissed it, I'm starting to agree with her. Too many bluidy 
  shadowrunners, not enough other types." 

Random is lagging intermittently for some reason, won't be too 
  coherent... 

Serrin says "Perhaps when we reject an application, a suggestion to 
  apply for a different type of character could be included?" 
Serrin says "Anyone want to touch on this?" 

Valkyrie says "I think we do that already, Serrin." 

Arachnia still likes the character type availability ratio idea. 

Gallant says "I uhm... need to go." 
Gallant pulls his shirt back on. 

Serrin says "Have a blast, Gallant :)" 

Random had a bad app experience with GarouMush. Don't be too 
  restrictive. 

Serrin giggles. 

Gallant waves. 

Valkyrie says "Quotas are hard to manage because mush population will 
  fluctuate." 

Random says "Cya Gallant" 

Morris says "I trust our apps people judge the apps." 

Gallant says "Uhm, I just wanted to add that I have two tps in question" 

Arachnia says "Not if we instate the "Inactivity" @nuke claus" 

Gallant says "one needs an evil corp, other needs someone knowledgable 
  in toxic shamans." 

Serrin says "please don't discuss TPs here" 

Morris says "She's talking about active population Arachnia." 

Gallant says "seeya boys and girls." 

Serrin says "I'm not an RPAdmin" 

Gallant says "Dont worry, I wont." 

Valkyrie says "even still, Arachnia. If you just watch net activity in 
  the month of September, you'll see what I mean." 

Talieson shrugs, "I guess I don't see the problem, yet. I think that 
  people will tire of the posturing shadowrunner soon, and will offer to 
  play more interesting roles.." 

Arachnia says "Been months now Tal. and the trend hasnt relaxed at all." 

Morris says "I do to Tal, no need to be any more restrictive than we are 
  now." 

Serrin says "So ka, it was just an idea." 

Arachnia says "This point if funny..." 
Arachnia says "Only Staff seems to disagree with it. But Players love 
  the idea..at least the ones that I have spoken with about it." 

Morris says "What idea?" 

Valkyrie says "Ratios." 

Arachnia nods 

Serrin says "Okie doke..." 

Arachnia says "or, here is another Idea.." 

Serrin says "Move on?" 
Serrin says "Or not, u go arach." 

Arachnia says "Offer some sort of perk to those tht are willing to play 
  something else." 

Random says "Y'know, aside from Aztech, we don't have too many evil 
  corps, do we?" 
Random says "Everybody and their uncle wants to play a DW Medic, 
  f'rinstance. :)" 

Valkyrie says "That's a good idea." 

Random says "AaAaArGh! Is anybode else lagging?" 

Talieson says "I'd be willing to offer extra skill points to more 
  colorful characters..." 

Arachnia says "Even including aaztec we dont have any corps" 

Serrin says "Yeah, Docwagon is getting humongousity." 

Valkyrie says "I like that idea." 

Talieson wonders if HE has anything to do with that...:) 

Morris says "I've allways done that..." 

Serrin says "Ah---skill points." 
Serrin says "Here's my next point that I wanted to bring up, actually." 

Valkyrie says "Also, it's ok to send a letter of denial to people 
  applying for Shadowrunner types simply saying, "We have all the 
  shadowrunner types we can use right now. If you would please apply 
  for, perhaps, a corp exec, or some other role, we can get you into the 
  game pronto."" 

Morris nods 

Random says "How many people do you think would want to play evil corp 
  f****rs?" 

Serrin says "Special Skills that are not in Chargen that apply to one 
  large corporation in specific. All the wonderful reporter-wanna-be's 
  that have no skills that apply to the job, the musical people, etc. 
  How are we doing this? Making them free skills?" 

Arachnia says "Umm random? What corp (In the game genre that is) is NOT 
  evil?" 

Talieson says "I would if I were a player.." 

Serrin says "Halo got her points for those skills for free at 
  inception." 

Valkyrie says "I would guess a good deal... and who says the corp has to 
  be evil? Anyway, just from watching the politics on Vampire ST mushes, 
  there are a lot of people who would probably like the intrigue...if we 
  make it interesting for them." 

Morris says "We have been treating them as free to start." 

Serrin says "OK" 

Random says "Well, DocWagon. :)" 
Random says "But, really, some corps are more blatantly evil." 

Serrin says "So in that case, I'll refer all aps for special skills to 
  RPAdmins and inform the staff at Net23 that they should do so." 

Arachnia says "Right. "Sorry chummer...Looks like your not paid up. So 
  we are gonna just let you die here while we rescue the guy next to you 
  who IS paid up."" 

Serrin says "There's no shortage of people who wanna play bad guys." 
Serrin says "I talk to people alla time dat wanna play insect and toxic 
  shamans and stuff." 

Valkyrie says "None of that..." 

Serrin says "I know--" 

Talieson says "Note: Mantis Shamen are not evil!" 

Serrin says "I added on the JOBS WANTED board a note that said Toxic and 
  Insect Shamans are the only currently totally restricted PC characters 
  on the MUSH, btw." 

Valkyrie says "None of them are evil... just alien. That Mantis spirits 
  like to eat other insect spirits just makes 'em seem less alien." 

Random says "Reminds me... who's hiring besides DW?" 

Talieson says "Good point..:)" 

Serrin says "Net23 is hiring" 
Serrin says "Silhouettes is hiring" 
Serrin says "OK...next point" 

Quicksilver says "Excuse me." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Quicksilver unlags somehow. 

Serrin says "Yeah, Quick?" 
Serrin says "Sup, Quick?" 

Quicksilver says "If whoever is in charge of it can give me permission, 
  I am constructing a number of small companies" 
Quicksilver says "for the yakuza" 
Quicksilver says "I need players for positions" 
Quicksilver says "not good, not bad, just greedy people" 

Talieson says "get the players first, then +mail me and Shardore." 

Quicksilver says "They don't want to comitt. To quote one, "Yeah, well, 
  whatt are U gonna give me? Ik promised me nuyen for helping him..." 
  etc" 
Quicksilver says "and I do _not_ blame them" 

Talieson sigh, "Let's meet privately after the meeting.." 

Random says "Ik got splattered. One less option. :)" 

Quicksilver says "When I think RPG, I think the goal is to come out on 
  top with the best character" 

Arachnia HATES the idea of hiring before the place is built 

Quicksilver says "What kind of "carrot" are we supposed to offer players 
  to run corps or be "goog"?" 
Quicksilver says "goog=good" 

Random built DW AS he was hiring, with their suggestions. 

Talieson says "We'll have to negotiate that..." 

Valkyrie says "They'll get money, perks in chargen, and definite roles 
  in a lot of tp's while the runners scurry like rats for a piece of 
  rotted cheese." 

Morris says "Talk with Tal on that Quick." 

Serrin says "I've no idea what you mean by carrot?" 
Serrin says "But I agree with Valkyrie" 

Quicksilver says "You offer donkeys a carrot to get them to move" 

Arachnia says "The reason I say this is, If people are a member of 
  something (In this case a corp) Then situations arise because of them 
  the insists that the place be needed and often isnt. Aztec as a case 
  in piint" 

Talieson says "quick...we can discuss this afetr the meeting." 

Serrin says "I don't think we need any real incentives to get people to 
  play such characters." 

Quicksilver nods to Tal 

Serrin says "Anyway, let's move on out of the rhetoric, much as we all 
  enjoy it :)" 

Arachnia says "serrins right..They are pooring out of the woodwork as it 
  is." 

Serrin says "Talieson wants ta say something." 

Talieson says "My big problem is with the way characters are seemingly 
  taking advantage of our reletively lenient policy regarding raising 
  attributes (Not skills). I noticed the problem a few weeks ago when 
  Grimraude, a troll, withing a period of 3 days raised his Intelligence 
  from a 2 (underdeveloped) to a 4 (Above average). I saw no IC reason 
  for his sudden enlightenment towards the pursuit of higher knowledge, 
  and nothing can justify that radical of a change within 3 days. It's 
  comparible to a person with a 90 IQ suddenly reaching a 140 IQ in 3 
  days...Impossible. And I can make this same argument for each of the 
  other 5 attributes. At this rate, most characters will have attributes 
  at and beyond 6's across the board within a few months. This really 
  will disrupt game balance and variety. The Old SR rules had a need 
  system whereby characters could not advance their stats past 1 beyond 
  their initial attribute stats. I thought that this was a neat, and 
  workable system, but my RP collegues thought it was too strict...Val 
  offered that we increase the cost of the attributes 
  exponentially...This I feel is workable too. Opinions? Flames?" 

Serrin points to Tal, shines the spotlight on him. 
Serrin says "I know why he did it." 

Quicksilver says "Why askk why, why not ask if his character can be that 
  smart?" 

Random says "Well, an aside, maybe we should build a gym." 

Serrin says "Ercuz chargen for a troll sucks if you want to play a smart 
  troll...not enough points inna priorities." 

Arachnia says "There are two gyms out there already ICly Random" 

Random says "I do agree, though, 90-140 IQ in a few days is very 
  unreal." 

Serrin says "Most people buy up their attributes because they want 
  attributes like they would have had had they built it in the standard 
  system." 

Arachnia nods in agreement with Serrin 

Serrin says "Grimraude buying his intelligence up was done b'cuz he 
  wanted to play a smart troll. Nothing wrong with that except that our 
  low priorities system makes it impractical, so he skimps and moves 
  stuff around." 
Serrin says "And buys things up as he becomes "experienced"." 

Morris says "Thats why Vals limit of two per stat isn't a bad idea..." 

Serrin says "limit of duh?" 

Valkyrie says "say Why don't we put a flat multiplier on the attribute 
  raising costs... like skills... make attributes triple or something 
  like that." 

Serrin says "I disagree with any changes on this matter for the simple 
  reason that we lower the priorities they can start with on the 
  assumptiont hat they will gain karma quicker and become experienced 
  shadowrunners..." 

Random says "That is kinda bad... raising stats is too easty." 

Serrin says "now we're screwing them from the other end too?" 

Valkyrie says "Not when a 4 to 5 raise costs 15 Karma." 

Talieson says "No...Just making things more realistic.." 

Random, in tough-guy talk: "It's 2054, pal, screwing's the way of the 
  world." 

Valkyrie says "SR is the only game I know where it is easier to raise 
  attributes than skills..." 

Serrin says "If you're going to do this then I suggest we change the 
  chargen priorities for attributes to be identical to the ones in the 
  SRII manual." 

Arachnia nods again in agreement with serrin 

Valkyrie says "Unfortunately, Serrin, there's no need to do one or the 
  other." 

Talieson says "Why? You still get Karma quicker here..." 

Arachnia says "If the Charagen is standard then we can make the Karma 
  spending normal as well." 

Serrin says "Val?" 
Serrin says "I don't understand" 
Serrin says "your last comment that there is no need (unfortunately)" 

Valkyrie says "Chargen's not going to change... We've got a lower power 
  curve here. That's staying." 

Serrin nods. 
Serrin says "I don't want Chargen to change" 
Serrin says "but I don't want to see the multipliers for attribute karma 
  buying change either" 

Valkyrie says "As far as what gets done to the raising of attributes, 
  nobody is getting screwed if everyobne pays the same costs. Comparing 
  it to the book has no bearing." 

Quicksilver says "Why don't you simply allow players to only raise an 
  attribute class once a RL month." 

Serrin says "it does if the players are expecting to play the game by 
  the rules" 

Morris says "All rules are simply guidelines..." 

Quicksilver says "IE: Grim can't raise INT for a month, or "evolves" his 
  greater skill at a rate of one per RL week..." 

Valkyrie says "They'll be playing by the rules... everyone will be 
  playing by the rules. There might be a slight change from the book but 
  they're still 'the rules'." 

Arachnia says "Obviouslty though serrin. They arent. Cause the rules say 
  only one point raise ever." 

Valkyrie nods to Morris. "Was gonna say that, too." 

Serrin says "Hell, for that matter, if realism is at stake, why not 
  completely redo the rules for dying so that you die at Deadly, that 
  Docwagon doesn't always come and pick up everyone who is wounded, and 
  that getting shot once (like in Real Life) kills you dead over 50% of 
  the time." 

Talieson nods to Arach. 

Morris says "Every RPG I've ever played has said that in it." 

Serrin says "Rules are guidelines, yes." 

Valkyrie says "As soon as someone makes a ridiculous statement about a 
  compromising statement, they've lost all track of logic in the 
  discussion, Serrin." 

Quicksilver wonders how rules=guidelines, and rummages for his 
  dictionary 

Random says "If you wanna get realistic, have half the folks at Low or 
  worse die of exposure." 
Random says "Or any of a dozen other killers..." 

Serrin says "But as we reduce the power curve, especially in the 
  attributes section, people in order to be survivable have to spend 
  karma to increase attributes." 

Valkyrie says "They still can." 
Valkyrie says "Nobody will stop them." 

Talieson says "just slower." 

Serrin says "I'd MUCH rather see a 2-point-max raise limit, or a 
  once-a-month limit, than an increase in point cost." 
Serrin says "People don't gain karma as fast as it might seem." 

Quicksilver disagrees 

Random says "Well, I think a lot of us agree that that particular SR 
  rule is screwed." 

Valkyrie says "I think Grim's Intelligence raising was ridiculous... no 
  matter what he wanted to play, that much of an increase that quickly 
  says one of two things: either he can raise his stats too quickly 
  because the system allowing him to do so is not working or he is 
  getting too much karma too fast." 

Talieson says "I don't see a problem...The first point costs normal, the 
  second point cost x2, the third x3, etc.." 

Random says "That could work..." 

Valkyrie points to Tal. "My original suggestion. Works in my rl game." 

Serrin shrugs. 
Serrin says "OK, I concede the point." 

Valkyrie says "That was bitten down because there's no way to track 
  original stats right now..." 

Talieson says "That wasn't MY original suggestion, but I would agree to 
  it..." 

Random isn't lagging much anymore, wow... 

Quicksilver says "Ah" 

Valkyrie says "And I've had all about I can of dealing with that object. 
  I don't wanna touch it any more. :)" 

Talieson says "we can keep track of it now via the RP GMnotes." 

Morris says "Anyways, lets continue" 

Serrin says "All Grim did was spend the karma he had gained, all 6 of 
  it, since he started the game" 
Serrin says "I would have done the same t'ing. I hate playing 1st level 
  characters :)" 

Quicksilver whispers "Is it just me, or was Scott(ikarawa)'s application 
  for head of KE approved? (same site/server...)" 

Talieson says "No levels in Shadowrun..:)" 

Random says "OK, what's the next point?" 

Valkyrie says "Rather than needing a whole new system to track something 
  nobody is going to want to track, if we just x3 the cost of attribute 
  raises, we'll have no problem." 

Serrin says "I guess what it comes down to is that I take a look at 
  karma gaining from Halo Jones's perspective, since I think she's still 
  the one with the most karma for active players. Been playing 
  her...since June, and she's gotten 24 so far." 
Serrin says "about 4 per month. Is that average? A good number?" 

Valkyrie says "Remember: we weren't even giving Karma for a lot of that 
  time." 

Quicksilver says "But how long has the nom system been online" 
Quicksilver nods 

Serrin says "True enough." 

Quicksilver says "and like Halo needs more karma" 
Quicksilver snorts 

Random says "She does now." 

Serrin says "Hey, Quick, Halo needs to develop just like anyone else." 

Serrin says "Anyway" 
Serrin says "Next point:"

Talieson says "Did we establish anything for this point?" 
Talieson thinks he missed something. 

Valkyrie says "Tell him no got Tampton... tell him to hold Tampton until 
  Merc is dead/gone/whatever." 

Quicksilver nods 

Valkyrie says "Anyway..." 

Serrin says "I guess yer gonna do it with 1st raise normal, 2nd raise 
  x2, third raise x3, no?" 

Talieson nods. 
Talieson says "Ok...Making sure." 

Valkyrie says "I think we've babbled enough about this point. I suggest 
  we triple costs for attribute raises. No record keeping, fast and 
  dirty." 

Random says "With all due respect, can we MOVE ON ALREADY?" 

Serrin says "I like the recordkeeping one better." 

Valkyrie says "Random, we can move on as soon as we come to a 
  conclusion. Care to offer your opinion?" 

Serrin says "Than x3 cost." 
Serrin says "How hard can it be to make a +gmnote?" 

Random says "OK, 1) the SR book's rule is screwed." 

Arachnia says "Well, only in so far as pertaining to MUSHing" 

Talieson says "which book? SRI or SRII?" 

Valkyrie says "Making it is no big deal. Needing to check it every time 
  someone asks, "DO I have enough Karma to raise my Quickness?" is a 
  pain in the butt." 

Random says "2) doing what Grim did, 2 IQ stat points in one fell swoop, 
  is tres unrealistic." 

Quicksilver whips out a larger brain and *click* installs it in his 
  cranium, turning to Random, "Tres Unrealistic?!" 

Arachnia says "Hudson also made these increases...Both did the same with 
  their Karma..right down the line every point" 

Valkyrie says "Also, it'll be easier to explain a standardized Karma 
  Expenditure rule... it'd be the same for skills and stats..." 

Serrin says "you're going to triple SKILL costs too?" 

Quicksilver claps 

Random says "3) it oughta be tougher to raise stats, which are innate 
  body and brain thingies, than skills, which are learned anyway." 

Arachnia says "Trippling skill costs isnt a bad idea 
  either./..BECAUSE..." 

Talieson says "Exactly my point, Random....I couldn't have put it 
  better..." 

Serrin says "I'll tell you now...you triple skill costs, and the MUSH 
  will lost a lot of players post-haste." 

Arachnia says "Since we are removing the "Time needed to learn" 
  aspect..the increased cost will make up for learning a skill in a day" 

Random says "GANG... I think I know what to do..." 
Random says "Who here knows the GURPS rules?" 

Serrin says "GAH" 

Arachnia Raises her hand 

Morris shoots Random 

Serrin says "Gurps :)" 

Talieson laughs.. 

Serrin says "He said the word, shoot him :)" 

Valkyrie HATES GURPS! 

Quicksilver says "Serrin: Doesn't it boil down to one question? WHY are 
  you here MUSHing, Player? to create a super-char or have fun RPing?" 

Random says "Remember their rules on learning skills with earned 
  points?" 

Serrin says "To have fun playing a character that is powerful enough to 
  be effective." 

Valkyrie says "Guys..." 

Quicksilver says "And Val and Arach's suggestions can do that" 

Serrin says "Are we proposing tripling skill costs too?" 

Random says "Basically, you can get skills for listed cost... IF you 
  have an IC way to learn it" 

Valkyrie says "Let's get back on track..." 
Valkyrie says "I wasn't proposing tripling skills...." 

Serrin says "OK" 

Talieson says "Neither was I.." 

Serrin says "I just wanted to be clear on that." 

Valkyrie says "Arach likes that idea... I'd vote for one thing at a 
  time. People aren't abusing the skill raises." 

Serrin says "Tripling attribute costs--ok, so maybe I do not agree with 
  it, but I can see the point of that." 

Valkyrie says "I have another suggestio..." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Serrin says "Tripling skill costs too? If you're going to do that, then 
  why bother tripling anything? Just stop giving out karma." 

Morris says "I agree with it, People will tend to spend points on 
  skills, which makes more sense." 

Serrin says "I mean, rather, not stop giving out karma, but reduce the 
  awards." 

Valkyrie says "We only accept stat/skill increases each time a character 
  earns 10 points...and you can only raise 1 thing by 1 point." 
Valkyrie says "At a time." 

Arachnia says "Works for me Valk" 
Arachnia likes that suggestion best 

Random says "So you can only use Pool karma to increase stuff?" 

Valkyrie says "This slows down progression, doesn't change reward rates, 
  doesn't change expenditure rates..." 

Arachnia says "No, just as a Time increment measurer." 

Serrin says "Uhm. OK." 

Valkyrie says "No, Random..." 

Random says "Oh, OK." 

Serrin says "I like that." 

Talieson says "Hrm...That would effectively make every increase cost 10 
  Karma...Regardless of what it is?" 

Valkyrie says "Everyone likes that? Anyone not like it?" 

Serrin says "They'll only be able to spend 9 points :)" 

Valkyrie says "No..." 

Serrin says "1 point will go to karma pool :)" 

Valkyrie says "The increases still cost the same but you can't increase 
  anything until you earn 10 karma from your last expenditure." 

Serrin says "there's only one mathematically strange bookkeeping problem 
  with that, though" 
Serrin says "karma spending for spell locks and bonding foci." 
Serrin says "or any instant karma expenditure for that matter that is 
  not to raise things." 

Morris says "No instant karma anymore" 

Valkyrie says "I'll see if I can come up with a way of recording when 
  karma is spent. It won't be hard." 

Talieson says "I don't think I feel comfortable with that 
  idea...Basically because it still places Attributes as easier to get 
  than skills, which is what this whole thing is about." 

Valkyrie says "Instant Karma was a 1st Edition rule." 

Morris says "Either karma pool or good karma." 

Serrin says "It slows people down" 
Serrin says "They can still only raise attributes by 1 per month" 

Random says "I thought it was a John Lennon song... :)" 

Serrin says "rather, not 1 per month but 1 per 10 karma" 
Serrin says "and the RPAds will always have final say on karma 
  expenditure logic anyway." 

Talieson says "But that still leaves attributes as easier to get than 
  skills." 

Valkyrie says "Ok... 2 methods on the table. The 10 point increment rule 
  or the triple cost attributes rule. Who likes which?" 

Talieson says "And it should take longer" 

Serrin says "so if for instance someone wants to raise an attribute, you 
  can ask them to justify it." 
Serrin says "regardless of cost-thingy." 

Random says "3xcost for attribs makes sense." 

Talieson says "3xcost for attr. is the best idea." 

Valkyrie says "I like triple cost." 
Valkyrie says "Beuler?" 

Serrin sighs. 
Serrin registers his preference for the other idea 

Arachnia says "If we 3xcost. Then skills should be raised as well having 
  the same problem." 

Valkyrie says "We're not talking about skills right now... if we want to 
  do that, it'll be a separate issue." 

Talieson says "I haven't noticed a problem with skills, and skills 
  should be easier to advance in than attr." 

Valkyrie says "Moris?" 

Morris says "I agree with Tal, skills should be easier..." 
Morris says "And I like the 3x" 

Valkyrie says "Ok... Triple Cost wins by a landslide... under which is 
  the lifeless corpse of Serrin." 

Morris grins 

Arachnia says "ts NOT a seperate issue though. It is the issue of 
  ADVANCEMENT." 

Serrin says "gee, thanks for that picture" 
Serrin says "I'll tell you right now, and y'all know that I'm not one 
  given to ultimatums--hate giving them and hate hearing them--" 

Random says "One problem I see... bookkeeping for your 10-point rule 
  would be very .... interesting." 
Random says "Oh wonderful, I'm lagging again..." 

Serrin says "but if you raise skill advancement by 3x too, I'm not 
  playing anymore" 

Valkyrie says "Well... I think the idea was brought up because of a 
  perceived problem with the cost of Attribute raises not skill raises. 
  Nobody has brought up any problem with Skill raises at all." 

Random says "we're NOT." 

Morris sighs 

Arachnia says "Fine then serrin. Skill costs stay the same. But we make 
  you actually spend the time required to learn a skill." 

Serrin shrugs. "That doesn't bother me. 

Arachnia says "See what I am saying/ There neds to be a check on this as 
  well." 

Valkyrie says "Unless anyone else wants to raise the cost of Skill 
  Raises, we should note the results and move on." 

Arachnia says "It may not be rearing it's ugly head at this time. But 
  trust me it is going to be a problem as well." 

Random says "Well, that's why I mentioned That Other Game earlier..." 

Valkyrie says "The check is already in place. Skills already cost 
  double." 

Random says "They do?" 

Arachnia looks around confused. "Since when? 

Valkyrie says "Yah... they do." 

Serrin nods. 

Talieson says "They always have.." 

Serrin says "SR advancement rules." 

Valkyrie says "Since page 180 in your SR2 book..." 

Serrin says "General skill raises are x2 new level" 

Valkyrie has that one memorized.. 

Random says "Oh, I thought you meant double THAT, duh." 

Serrin says "Concentrations are 1.5x new level" 

Arachnia says "Me too Random." 

Serrin says "And we don't use specializations :)" 

Arachnia says "Specializations dont matter (Nor concentrations for that 
  matter) after charagen" 

Morris says "Yes they do" 

Serrin says "sure they do :)" 

Valkyrie says "Ok.. any more issues?" 

Arachnia says "All are concidered a seperate skill as far as advancement 
  and learning are concerned" 

Serrin says "I can raise my Therbligs(widgets) widgets concentration for 
  1.5x new level, but it costs me 2x new level to raise my therbligs 
  skill :)" 

Random says "Right." 

Serrin says "I got a question *blush*" 
Serrin says "did I say I had to post something on the BBoard earlier in 
  the meeting?" 
Serrin says "I forgot *blush*" 
Serrin says "something about building, I think, maybe" 

Morris takes a pancake flipper and tries to scrape the current point off 
  the floor. 

Serrin says "Oh, new point:" 

Valkyrie says "Oh! To get the builders to redice bloat beofre you do 
  yourself." 
Valkyrie says "reduce, even..." 

Serrin says "thanks, Val :)" 
Serrin says "I also gotta update the positions wanted board" 

Valkyrie says "And... I guess...post this new Karma change." 

Morris gives up on the pancake flipper since cats dont have hands 

Serrin says "OK" 

Quicksilver whispers "Markus" is Scott(IK) alright...but not a 
  weretiger. (thank somebody)" 

Serrin says "Next point." 
Serrin says "Target opening date: Thanksgiving." 
Serrin says "Questions/comments?" 

Quicksilver raises his hand. 

Talieson says "Not realistic for the Corps at least (unfortunately) :(" 

Serrin says "go, Quick :)" 

Random says "Bleedin' little for folks here to be thankful for." 

Quicksilver says "I have to go to the bathroom. May I be excused." 

Serrin laughs! 
Serrin says "Sure, QUick :)" 

Valkyrie says "Take a hall pass." 

Serrin says "Tal: the corps can get online more, and get more people, 
  once we are officially open and advertising and get more people 
  online." 

Talieson grumbles about Corps. 

Serrin says "The only stumbling blocks for official opening IMHO are:" 

Random says "Need to get folks online before that..." 

Quicksilver returns the hall pass and takes his seat 

Serrin says "Sorting out living quarters (which I will talk to Alicia 
  about setting up), Maglev fixing the telephones (which I am pretty 
  sure he can get done in two weeks), Morris finishing the guns 
  distribution (which I hope he can get done in two weeks, too), and 
  adding Vehicle and Deck Chits to the Chargen thingie, which should 
  also be done within 2 weeks." 

Random says "Speaking of CharGen... can you get DW contracts there?" 

Quicksilver raises his hand, yet again. 

Ptewwwwww...Arachnia shoots Quick in the back of the neck with a 
  spitball and whistles innocently as she looks at the cieling. 

Morris says "Needs to be added too." 

Quicksilver gestures in the drow hand language, "Gee, thanks." 
Quicksilver gestures in the drow hand language, "wants Drow added to the 
  list of languages BTW." 
Quicksilver gestures in the drow hand language, "seeing as Krenn can 
  have Klingonaase." 

Serrin says "Random: no, but hopefully that can be added easily. 
  Quick:yes?" 

Quicksilver says "RE: Living quarters" 
Quicksilver says "Those of you who have ex'd me can see how many keys I 
  carry" 

Serrin says "Actually, Random, coding project for you." 

Random uhohs... 

Quicksilver says "I discussed it with Villiers, and we are going to rent 
  used rooms at a lower rate" 

Serrin says "Make objects for DocWagon cardholders. They have to break 
  the card, which notifies DocWagon." 

Talieson hrms? 

Quicksilver says "That way we get around the ST lack of a checkout 
  command, and help the players" 

Serrin says "They can buy them in chargen." 

Talieson says "Hold on..." 
Talieson says "I thought rent was the Lifestyle cost...Period." 

Morris says "No, no objects for DW." 

Random says "Ulk, major DB bloat if I do that." 

Serrin says "That way, none of this paging DocWagon peoples." 
Serrin says "OK Morris" 

Morris says "There are better ways to do it." 

Quicksilver says "DW clients have screamer bracelets, don't they?" 

Valkyrie says "say Super Platinum accounts get Screamers." 

Random says "Right now, when somebody gets a contract, I just make a 
  note on their char board." 

Quicksilver nods 

Serrin says "lagging here sorry" 
Serrin says "Rent is going to be lifestyle cost" 

Talieson says "Hello?" 

Serrin says "and I am sure that Alicia can code in checkout command 
  structure to a universal living quarters code." 

Talieson says "Ok" 

Arachnia drinks some bouncy bubbly beverage 

Morris says "I've got checkout on the QA" 

Quicksilver nods 

Morris says "When its working. :)" 

Quicksilver says "But I can't always use it for some reason" 
Quicksilver nods 
Quicksilver says "some keys get rejected, due to corruption, I suppose" 

Random says "Wait... I thought Lifestyle included things like food, 
  security, maintenance..." 

Quicksilver says "but I can edit the rental base there 8)" 

Serrin says "I know ya do Morris :)" 

Morris says "It does random.." 

Talieson says "Yes...but we agreed at the last meeting that the only way 
  to get lifestyle was thru rent...It's the easiest way." 

Quicksilver was under that impression, too, Random 

Morris says "Tal is also right." 

Serrin says "Are there any problems with a universal code for *all* 
  living quarters that can be modified to provide more rooms or whatever 
  for higher lifestyle locations?" 

Morris shakes his head. 

Arachnia says "Right Random. But what other TANGIBLE thing do you really 
  pay for that would be included in lifestyle on the mush?" 
Arachnia is lagging

MEETING AGENDA -- Thu Oct 6 10PM EST-?(#12147) 
Obvious exits: 

Staff Nexus <SN> 

Talieson is too. 

Random says "Oh, duh. I'm managing to get both lag AND spam..." 

Quicksilver says "not at all" 

Random finally came back. 

Arachnia eats Talieson's head. 

Morris eats the old agenda. 

Talieson doesn't HAVE a head..He's a suit..:) 

Arachnia says "Yeah, well, NOW." 
Arachnia giggles 

Random says "Anyway, NEXT POINT already?" 

Morris says "Serrin? Anything else?" 
Morris says "While we are waiting..." 

You fire your Morris's AK-97 at Crystal Decanter of Hot chocolate. 

Serrin says "Lifestyle does include things like food security and 
  maintenance, but the easy way to represent that in the MUSH is to just 
  have them pay it as rent" 
Serrin lags. 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Random says "Use that thing on the lagmonster, I think it's got Serrin." 

Morris says "Oh, Serrins back." 

Serrin says "OK" 
Serrin says "nothing else that I can think of" 

Talieson screams as he is splashed by scalding HOT Chocolate..."Time to 
  go to the cleaners again..:(" 

Serrin says "except to pray for less lag" 

Morris says "On Guns" 
Morris says "In case you didn't know, you can shoot at objects and exits 
  now." 

Valkyrie fires her Ares MP Laser III at Crystal Decanter of Hot 
  chocolate. 
Valkyrie says "Cool..." 

Talieson says "Oh! Update: I've come up with a fair system for corporate 
  Security...If anyone is TRULY interested, I can explain after the 
  meeting..." 

Random says "Speaking of which, DW needs duty weapons." 

Morris says "Also I have added an &accessories to the guns, +ex my ak-97 
  to see it," 
Morris says "And for you gun coders, there is a &built_ins attribute." 

Valkyrie says "Cool!" 

Serrin duh's. 

Random says "Hey, I can't +examine for some reason..." 

Valkyrie has to modify a few parents now. 

Talieson can'r ex the gun 

Serrin says "is this anything I need to know?" 

Random says "Oh, there." 

Quicksilver makes a "whishing" sound and waves his hand over his head. 

Serrin says "I've no idea what you're talking about...what Quick said 
  :)" 

Valkyrie fires her Ares MP Laser III at Serrin. 

Serrin says "Ow." 
Serrin says "Can't kill me though." 

Morris says "Goes on the master for each gun type. The built_ins show on 
  all guns of that type, accessories go on the specific gun." 

Serrin says "I've got Star Wars. I'm the Arms race. :P" 

Quicksilver didn't mean it like that, actually it was a poke at Serrin, 
  but he'll let that one go in the intersests of MUSH peace. 

Morris says "I've allready modified all the master guns." 

Serrin says "well, we can't change the accessories as admins" 

Morris says "You will." 

Valkyrie says "You'll be able to soon..." 

Random says "And it's coming from AT&T!" 

Serrin says "Morris ya sound like an AT&T commercial :)" 

Valkyrie says "And guess who'll bring it to you..." 

Serrin laughs with Random 

Morris says "I've got the machine just about finished, where anyone can 
  do it." 
Morris sighs 

Quicksilver sighs and turns his attention back to the Laurence Welk 
  Polka Special on the tube. 

Talieson groans at how easily AT&T takes credit for tech they haven't 
  even created yet.. 

Serrin gives Morris some friskies treats. He's been a busy cat :) 

Morris says "I'll be giving them out to fixers and such." 
Morris says "check97 shows the gun" 

Quicksilver watches the lights in the room flicker as the staff slams 
  the queue. 

Serrin says ""cool" 
Serrin dropped Morris's AK-97. 
Serrin says "I was carrying it :)" 
Serrin says "Here's a question for ya Morris :)" 
Serrin says "Can you make it so that you can load 2 different types of 
  ammunition in the "available" slots of the gun to reduce clip 
  objects?" 
Serrin says "Or is that too hard ta do?" 

Morris says "I'll look" 

Quicksilver absently wonders if cats really do always land on their 
  feet... 
Quicksilver eyes Morris speculatively. 

Serrin says "Halo's carrying around 4 clips of APDS, 2 boxes of loose 
  ammunition and a few Normal clips in the gun right now" 

Valkyrie gets a HUGE slingshot to help Quick test his theories... 

Arachnia dropped Morris's AK-97. 

Serrin says "drop a cat on a glass coffee table :)" 

Morris thinks it could be hazardous for Quick test that theory. 

Serrin says "I bet it doesn't land on its feet :)" 

Morris says "They do, I've tested it." 

Serrin laughs! 
Serrin says "you sick kitty you" 
Serrin says "I'm done" 

Arachnia notes Serrin's cat is at the apex of stupid though and would 
  flopp like a dead fish. 

Serrin says "can we declare our meeting over?" 

Talieson stands up. 

Morris nods 

Valkyrie says "So what does a cat do if it has broken toes? And why are 
  there bumps on my Barbie? and can blind people get handicapped license 
  plates?" 

Serrin says "Yeah, arach, but her 20 pounts of fat will save her :)" 

Morris says "I want to know why there is braile on drive through cash 
  machines?" 

Random says "She's not in jail?" 
Random lagged again, argh... 

Serrin says "There are bumps on your Barbie because they represent 
  breasts, blind people can't get license plates as they can't drive, 
  cats don't have toes," 
Serrin says "there is braille on drive through cash machines because the 
  law says so and some times people walk to them apparently." 
Serrin says "Any other questions?" 

Quicksilver GRINS 
Quicksilver has seen a cat run diagonally along a wall, climbing upwards 
  for twenty feet....hey, it wasn't his fault the dog got loose... 

Random says "What's the emaning of life?" 

Talieson says "42" 

Morris says "If your flying down the highway in your canoe and a wheel 
  falls off, how many biscuits do you put in the mailbox?" 

Valkyrie says "What is the flight speed of an unladen swallow?" 

Random says "African or European?" 

Talieson grins 

Valkyrie says "I don't knowaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" 

Random says "OH... we should talk a little about DW" 

Quicksilver says "UM, cats DO have toes..." 

Talieson says "Itty, bitty ones..:)" 

Quicksilver grins and nods 

Serrin says "The meaning of life is to have lots of fun, it depends on 
  your mailbox and the kind of biscuit, and the flightspeed of an 
  unladen swallow is 23.45 therbligs per nanosecond." 
Serrin says "Cats have PAWS. :)" 

Morris says "Boy, its a good thing I'm logging all this..." 

Talieson laughs..:) 

Valkyrie says "So says your hard drive, I'm sure." 

Serrin says "When you're a helper admin, ya gotta know the answers :)" 

Talieson says "I think we can stop logging and put this meeting to 
  rest..." 

Morris says "Random, you had somerthing about DW?" 

Serrin says "But Random wanted ta talk about DocWagonskie" 

Talieson nods 
Talieson says "Sorry Random." 

Valkyrie says "DocWagon needs competition. I've always like REO 
  Meatwagon, myself. :)" 

Serrin says "Ya gotta love medicos with the name "Meatwagon"" 

Quicksilver grabs Morris and demonstrates, depressing Morris' pads to 
  show clearly the stubby (worthless for tool manipulation) toes that 
  conceal the claws 
Quicksilver grins 

Serrin says "OH YEAH!" 

Quicksilver says "This lack sucks" 

Serrin says "I just remembered something" 

Random says "We got all the Judges here?" 
Random says "HOLD IT... need to sort out a few things about DocWagon" 
Random says "AhHhHhHhHhHhHhHh!" 

Serrin says "I'd like to see the RPAdmins use the rules for cyberware 
  damage after combat :)" 
Serrin says "If you're gonna talk about secret docwagon plot stuff I 
  should leave" 

Valkyrie says "We should wait a bit till we get the means online to 
  repair that stuff IC'ly." 

Quicksilver raisess his hand 

Talieson says "What about Crashcart..?" 

Random says "Whew, back." 
Random says "Anyway..." 

Serrin says "If anyone cares, I'm not going to be around from 10:30AM 
  tomorrow until Sunday" 

Valkyrie shoots a paperclip at Quick's raised hand. 

Random says "Right now, here's how it's being implemented:" 

Arachnia raises her hand for an unrealated point. 

Quicksilver mutters, "Oh God, not again..." 

Random says "I'm using the 'docwagon' channel as the ambulance radio..." 
Random says "I know a few media folk are listening in, HQ for one." 

Quicksilver says "Um, cyberphone code is non-existant currently, aff?" 

Random says "The judges need an easy way to call out the cavalry if the 
  medics are needed." 

Talieson says "What is the problem?" 
Talieson looks around at the frozen people.. 

Valkyrie twiddls... 

Random says "And I need a way to lock the key locker and equipment room 
  to the ever-growing list of DW personnel..." 
Random says "Everybody and their uncle wants in!" 
Random says "Plus, needless to say we need equipment..." 
Random says "We have no duty weaponry, only 3 suits of armor." 
Random says "Who in this group has the Neo-Anarchists' Guide to Real 
  Life?" 

Quicksilver says "I lag, therefore I am." 

Talieson says "I do.,." 

Valkyrie has it. 

Talieson flips thru the Neo-Anarchists 

Quicksilver says "Random, it's easy to create a list to lock that stupid 
  locker" 

Arachnia says "Real quick. The point I wanted to bring up is that 
  Assensing is done. And if anyone wants to look at it before Morris 
  puts it in #4 and takes care of everything with it...t is in Alicia's 
  place." 

Quicksilver is sick of DW people pestering him, frankly. 

Valkyrie says "Great work!" 

Random says "They pester you? Why?" 

Arachnia Looked through the rules and found nothing on assnsing cyber, 
  so if they want that info they are gonna have to call a judge. 

Quicksilver says "They can't get vehicles running" 
Quicksilver says "so they call me and beg for help" 
Quicksilver shrugs 

Morris says "All they see is that the essence rating is lower," 

Quicksilver says "Players forget to put the keys back" 

Talieson says "Cyber is Black in Astral Space." 

Random says "Argh... I gotta yell at Krenn... or do I?" 

Quicksilver says "I am fairly certain some admin +chowned the keys" 
Quicksilver says "and/or the vehicles" 
Quicksilver says "Krenn was going to take a look" 
Quicksilver shrugs 

Random says "Oh... they gonna get that equipment soon?" 

Arachnia nods at Tal, "Which is why I originaly proposed something about 
  it in the automated assensing command. 

Serrin says "Also, +give is ready to go too." 

Random says "Tal, or whoever had the NAGRL... what's standard issue for 
  a standard DW team?" 

Talieson nods. 

Valkyrie says "Gallant said he was working on getting DW all the 
  equipment they needed. Dunno what his plans were, though." 

Morris says "I'll look at it Serrin." 

Serrin says "we can uselock everyone and put +give inna master room" 
Serrin gave you +give object. 

Morris says "Thanks" 

Talieson says "Four paramedics...One equipped with a datajack...in a 
  lightly armored ambulance...Some use helicopters.." 

Random says "Also, for now I'm having them pick up everybody... four 
  medics?" 

Morris says "In a fit of coding this afternoon, I recoded +who, should 
  be much cleaner and less strain on the queue now." 

Talieson nods.. 

Random says "Cool." 

Quicksilver scratches Morris behind his ears. 
Quicksilver says "kewl" 

Random says "Tal, what do they have as far as armor & weaponry?" 

Talieson says "Doesn't say...:(" 

Arachnia says "RP problem with DW...ARe the people that are responding 
  sitting around in the HQ waiting for a call? OR are they going to the 
  call from whereever they are? The latter is unrealistic." 

Serrin says "Oh, Lag....it's bigger...bigger than you, and you are not 
  me....Losing My Connection....(with apologies to R.E.M.)" 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Arachnia says "After 'Whats the frequency kenith' no appologies to 
  R.E.M. needed." 

Random says "Well, Gallant's given us 4 suits Heavy Armor... might be 
  HRT issue. Arach, I've built 'em a dispatch office/waiting room." 

Talieson says "That is definitlt HRT" 
Talieson says "And HRT teams are 7 madics." 
Talieson says "medics" 
Talieson says "3 medics, and 4 HRT-threat support..:)" 
Talieson says "sorry..:)" 
Talieson looks at the lagging people. 
Talieson says "Val...You lagging?" 

Random says "BTW, is it safe to assume corp bigwigs have Gold?" 
Random says "Find me something on this mush that isn't High Threat" 
Random says "Tal... doesn't that say all DW customers have an armband 
  caller/monitor?" 

Valkyrie says "Not lagging...just dealing with 2 windows..." 

Talieson nods. 

Valkyrie says "The meeting is dragging at this point..." 

Talieson says "Let me check, but I don't think so." 

Valkyrie smirks. 

Random says "So, all judges... remember that armband..." 

Arachnia Just found out serrin and I are suffering from local lag as 
  well. 

Morris says "I think its pretty much over now." 

Talieson says "Doc Wagon is connected to a 911 service.." 

Quicksilver says "Are cyberphones available to players coming oout of 
  chargen?"
