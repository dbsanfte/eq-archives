<H5>A Beginner's Guide to MUSH</H5>

The Beginner's Guide to MUSH provides a brief introduction to MUSH, an
overview of the basic commands needed to use one, and a step-by-step guide
for your first connection to a MUSH. The Guide is specifically geared to
TinyMUSH players, but should also serve as a useful introduction for players
of MUX and PennMUSH, as the basic commands are similar, in many cases
identical, on all three game platforms.

<h5><A NAME="intro">An Introduction</A> to MUSH</H5>

MUSH is a server platform used to create multi-player, text-based
environments. MUSH stands for "Multi-User Shared Hallucination". MUSH is
part of a family of similar games. The family as a whole is referred to as
the MUD or MU* family. Other members of the family include MUX, MUSE, MUCK,
MOO, and a few others. The basic function of all of these programs is the
same, but each uses slightly different commands. A comparison would be word
processors. Word and WordPerfect are two different programs with different
commands, but they both serve the same basic function.

<P> The basic function of a MUSH is to allow a group of people to connect to
the same site so they can communicate with one another in real time - like a
conference phone call, or International Relay Chat (IRC) for those that are
familiar with it. MUSH does more than that, though! It also allows for the
creation of detailed worlds with landscapes and buildings you can explore,
and items and people you can interact with.

<P> The world of a MUSH is completely text-based - you don't need a large
program or fancy graphics capability to play. The game world is presented in
a similar way to the old Infocom games like Zork or Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy. Unlike those games, however, you are able to interact with other
real people, and expand the game environment itself.

<P> The originators of worlds built on MUSH tend to create one of two types
of games. One type are social games. People use these games to chat with one
another and relax in a casual environment. The other type are role-playing
games. On these, the purpose is to portray a realistic character that is
part of a specific world. For example, on a Star Trek MUSH, people might
portray crew members on a Federation starship and play out their adventures.

<P> A number of <A HREF="general.html"> MUSH and MUD lists</A> exist to help
people find the types of games that they're most interested in playing.

<P> As with any software program, MUSH has its own commands and concepts.
This document introduces the basic concepts and commands that you need to
know to begin participating on a MUSH.

</DIV>

<DIV ID="content">

<h5><A NAME="basic">Some Basic</A> Concepts</H5>

<H6>What's What</H6>

There are four main types of "objects" on a MUSH:
<P><OL>

<LI>The character that you play is known as a PLAYER object to the MUSH
program. Most games allow one individual to play more than one character if
she or he wishes to. In conversation, people generally use "character" to
refer to the onscreen persona and "player" to refer to the real life person
portraying the persona, but when the MUSH commands or help files refer to a
PLAYER, they mean the character object.

<P><LI>The framework of the MUSH environment is created with ROOM
objects. Characters and things occupy ROOMS, which make up the buildings and
landscapes of the game. A ROOM on a MUSH can be anything that fits its
environment - a tavern, a bedroom, a forest, a planet, the ocean floor, etc.

<P><LI>Rooms are connected to one another through objects called EXITS.
Characters use EXITS to move from one room area to another. An EXIT might
appear as a door, window, road, staircase, pathway, etc.

<P><LI>The final type of object is the THING, sometimes called object or
item. THINGS can be picked up, carried and dropped by players, moved through
exits, left in rooms, or placed within other THINGS.

<P>The THING is the most flexible type of MUSH object. A THING might appear
as a wagon or sleeping bag that players can get inside of, a vase or a
statue to decorate a room, or a pet dog. People THINGS can also be part of
the world, like a bartender or taxi driver.  THING people are "scenery;"
they can't interact with you like player objects controlled by real people.
</OL>

<P>Regardless of type, all objects on a MUSH share two things in common:

<P><UL>
<LI> Every object on the game has a name. The names of player objects must be
unique - there can only be one character named Bob on the game. The names of
rooms, exits and things do not need to be unique.  There can be any number
of rooms named Kitchen or multiple exits named Road. The name of an object
is selected by its creator.

<P> There are two general-use names that are used with common commands.  The
term <I>me</I> refers to your character. The term
<I>here</I> refers to your current location.

<P><LI><A NAME="dbref">The MUSH</A> also designates each object by a
number. This is referred to as the <I>dbref#</I> (data base
reference number). The number of each object is unique to that object, so if
there are two things named Car, you can use the dbref# in a command to make
sure the game knows which one you're referring to.  The number of the object
is displayed next to its name.

<P> You will always see the number of objects you control, including your
character. You will only see the number of objects you don't own if they
have certain properties set on them, but that's not something you need to
worry about when starting out, as you can use the name of an object to refer
to it in almost all commands.
</UL>

<BR><H6><A NAME="admin">Who's Who</A></H6>

All MUSH games have administrators. The top level administrators are usually
called wizards, although they may be called managers or something similar on
some games.  On Shadowrun Seattle, they are called Chiefs or Directors. Wizards 
have access to additional commands and tools to help them administrate the game. 
They are usually people who've been using MUSHes for some time and playing on 
the MUSH in question for quite a while, too.

<P> The wizards are responsible for the game as a whole. They provide the
computer resources and Internet connection the game needs to run.  They
create and enforce the rules of the game, resolve disputes between people,
and help answer questions that people have.

<P> Some games have additional levels of administration beneath the
wizards. On Seattle, these levels are Admins (Player Helpers, Roleplaying, 
Build and Code). These people are also available to help answer people's questions.


<BR>
<H6>Command Types</H6>

There are three types of commands on a MUSH:
<P><OL>
<LI>Built-In Commands<BR>

The most fundamental and commonly-used commands are built-into the MUSH
server itself. These commands will be found on every TinyMUSH, and are the
same on every TinyMUSH. The commands discussed in this document are built-in
commands, so they will work on any MUSH game you try.

<P><LI><A NAME="globals">Global Commands</A><BR>

Global commands are commands that are unique to a particular MUSH.  They
work anywhere on that MUSH, but may not be found on another MUSH. These have
been added to the game by its administration. Most globals are very useful
for play on that game, but aren't essential to know when starting out. These
commands vary from game to game, so this document cannot provide detailed
information about them, but it will tell you where to find out more about
globals.

<P><LI>User-Defined Commands<BR>

MUSH allows its players to <A HREF="#code">create their own commands</A>.
These may be set on a thing, a room or a player. These commands will only
work when you are in the immediate vicinity of the thing, room or player.
These commands can be anything their owner creates them to be. It is not
necessary for you to know much about user-defined commands to begin play on
a MUSH.
</OL>

</DIV>

<DIV ID="content">
<h5><A NAME="commands">The Basic Commands</A></H5>

The following is an overview of the basic commands that you will use in your
first few sessions on a MUSH. There are more commands than these, but these
are all you need to know to begin playing on a MUSH, and you can learn the
rest at your own pace.

<BR><H6>Notation Guide:</H6>

<DL>
<DT><I>command</I>
  <dd>Command phrases appear in text <I>like this</I>. That
  denotes a command you  can type on the MUSH exactly as it appears. All
  command phrases are  followed by a return/enter. Hitting the return key
  sends your command  to the MUSH.
<P>
<DT><I>&lt;variable&gt;</I>
  <dd>Variables are indicated <I>&lt;like this&gt;</I>. Where
  you see <I>&lt;&gt;</I>, you would insert your own text.
  There are examples with the commands to show you exactly how it works.
</DL>

<BR><H6><A NAME="comm">Communication Commands</A></H6>

<I>say &lt;text&gt; </I>
<BR>or 
<BR><I>"&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<P>
The <I>say </I>command allows you to talk to other players in
the same room as you are. <I>"</I> is a short-form for 
<I>say</I>. 
<P>
  you type: <I>"Hello, everyone.</I> 
  <BR>you see: You say, "Hello, everyone." 
  <BR>others see: <EM>Suzy says, "Hello, everyone."</EM> 
<P>

<BR><I>pose &lt;text&gt;</I> 
<BR>or 
<BR><I>:&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<P>
When role-playing, it's nice to be able to have your character make
gestures as well as statements. The <I>pose</I> command
allows you to do that. The pose command can be shortened to
<I>:</I>. 
<P>
  you type: <I>:takes off his hat and bows with a flourish.</I> 
  <BR>you see: Bob takes off his hat and bows with a flourish. 
  <BR>others see: <EM>Bob takes off his hat and bows with a flourish.</EM> 
<P>

<BR><I>;&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<P>
Sometimes you might want to pose without a space following your
name, the <I>;</I> lets you do that. 
<P>
  you type: <I>;'s eyes flash in anger.</I> 
  <BR>you see: Alia's eyes flash in anger. 
  <BR>others see: <EM>Alia's eyes flash in anger.</EM> 
<P>

<BR><I><A NAME="page">page</A> &lt;name&gt;=&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<BR>or 
<BR><I>p &lt;name&gt;=&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<P>
Sometimes the person you want to talk to is on the MUSH, but not in
the same room as you are. The <I>page</I> command lets you
talk to someone else no matter where else they are on the MUSH. This is
especially useful when you're starting out and you need to ask someone
for help.
<P>
  you type: <I>page steve=Hi, could you help me with something?</I>
  <BR>you see: You page Steve, 'Hi, could you help me with something?' 
  <BR>Steve sees: <EM>From afar, Mary pages, "Hi, could you help me with
              something?"</EM> 
  <BR>others see: nothing
<P>
You can use the <I>pose</I> command with the 
<I>page</I> command, if you want to make a gesture in your page.
<P>
  you type: <I>page sajeev=:waves. "Hi!"</I>
  <BR>you see: Long distance to Sajeev: Juanita waves, "Hi!" 
 <BR>Sajeev sees: <EM>From afar, Juanita waves. "Hi!"</EM>
  <BR>others see: nothing
<P>

<BR><I>whisper &lt;name&gt;=&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<BR>or 
<BR><I>w &lt;name&gt;=&lt;text&gt;</I> 
<P>
The <I>whisper</I> command allows you to communicate privately
with someone in the same location as you. As with page, you can use the
<I>pose</I> commands to make gestures in whispers.
<P>
  you type: <I>w marie=:winks at you when no one's looking.</I> 
  <BR>you see: Marie senses "Olav winks at you when no one's looking."
  <BR>Marie sees: <EM>You sense Olav winks at you when no one's looking.</EM> 
  <BR>others see: nothing 


<P><H6><A NAME="move">Movement Commands</A></H6>

<I>&lt;exit name&gt;</I> 
<BR>or 
<BR><I>&lt;exit alias&gt;</I> 
<P>
Typing the name of an exit moves you through that exit and into the
area it connects to. Most exits have a short form name, or "alias" so
you don't have to type the whole name.
<P>
Example: Your character is in the following room:
<P>
<PRE>
Kitchen
  A stove stands against one wall, a fridge against the other.
  Cupboards and counters line the other walls.
Obvious exits:
Dining Room
</PRE>

If you type <I>dining room</I>, you'll move into the Dining
Room area. You can also probably get there by typing <I>dr</I>
alone.
<P>

<BR><I>@tel me=#&lt;number&gt;</I> 
<P>
The <I>@tel</I> (teleport) command instantly transports you
to the indicated room. The <I>@tel</I> command doesn't care
if the two rooms are joined by an exit or not, or whether the two rooms
are at opposite ends of the MUSH's landscape.
<P>
Only certain rooms are set to allow you to do this. The <I>@tel</I>
command requires the <A HREF="#dbref">number</A> of the destination
room, it doesn't work with the room name. (There might be 100 rooms
named Bedroom on the game, and it has no way to tell which one you
want to go to.)
<P>
This type of movement is not realistic on most role-playing games.
For instance, if you're playing a game set in Medieval France, there
are no teleportation devices in Medieval times. Many role-playing
games discourage excessive use of <I>@tel</I> to keep things
believable. Most games don't mind if new players use <I>@tel</I>
to explore the game world a little, however.
<P>
Shadowrun Seattle has disabled this capability for players as we are
a very In Character game.
<P>

<BR><I>home</I>
<P>
The <I>home</I> command is a short form for 
<I>@tel me=home</I>. Typing this command moves you to the
room designated as your "home" by the MUSH. All player and thing objects
have a home room. It is possible to set a new home for yourself, but
that's not something you need to worry about when you first begin play.
<P>
The <I>home</I> command is very useful to remember! If you
get lost, or get stuck somewhere odd, the <I>home</I>
command will always bring you to your home room.
<P>

<BR><I>enter &lt;object&gt;</I> 
<P>
Some thing objects on a MUSH are set up to allow you to go inside of
them. For example, a Wagon or Bus. Also, you can always enter things
that you own.
<P>
To go inside of an object, use the <I>enter &lt;object&gt;</I>
command. Sometimes the object will have an alias or shortform you can
use to enter it. For example, the Bus might have an alias of
<I>board bus</I> to get inside of it. The 
<I>enter &lt;object&gt;</I> command will always work, unless
the object isn't one set up to allow people inside of it, or if it's
locked so that only specific people can go inside it.
<P>

<BR><I>leave </I>
<P>
The <I>leave</I> command allows you to leave an object
you've entered. So if you were on the Bus, you would type
<I>leave</I> when you wanted to get off of it. Objects may
also have aliases for leaving them. For instance, the Bus might have an
alias of <I>get off bus</I> that works in the same way as
the <I>leave</I> command.


<P><H5><A NAME="item">Item and Money Commands</A></H5>

<I>inventory</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>i</I>
<P>
The <I>inventory </I>command displays a list of all the
items that you are carrying, and the amount of MUSH money your character
possesses. You are paid more money each day you log onto the MUSH.
MUSH money is charged for the use of certain commands (but not any of
the commands listed here). You don't have to worry about MUSH money
unless you <A HREF="#build">build</A> or <A HREF="#code">code</A> a
lot. The name of MUSH money varies from game to game. On a role-playing
game, money may also be used in role-played economic exchanges
between players.
<P>
On Shadowrun, the money that you carry in your inventory is 'nuyen' and 
IS considered to be in character.
<P>
You type: <I>i</I>
<BR>You see:

<PRE>
You are carrying:
Newspaper
Briefcase
You have 200 dollars.
</PRE>

<BR><I>take &lt;name&gt;</I>
<P>
The <I>take</I> command allows you to pick up an object
and carry it in your inventory. For instance, you could pick up a
newspaper by typing <I>take newspaper</I>. Sometimes the
game will not allow you to pick up an object. If this happens, the
object is "locked" so that only certain people are allowed to pick it up.
<P>
<EM>NOTE: It is considered rude on most games to wander around picking
up objects that don't belong to you. If you aren't sure, don't pick
it up.</EM>
<P>

<BR><I>take &lt;name&gt;'s name</I>
<P>
If an object is within another item, you won't be able to pick it up
with the standard <I>take</I> command, you'd have to use the
above. For instance, you could get your keys out of your backpack with
the command <I>take backpack's keys</I>.
<P>

<BR><I>drop &lt;name&gt;</I>
<P>
The <I>drop</I> command allows you to put down an object
that you're carrying in your inventory. The object is deposited within
your current location.
<P>

<BR><I>give &lt;name&gt;=&lt;object&gt;</I>
<P>
The <I>give</I> command allows you to transfer an object
from your inventory to <I>&lt;name&gt;</I>. 
<I>&lt;Name&gt;</I> can be an item or a person. For example,
to put your keys into your backpack, you'd type 
<I>give backpack=keys</I>, and to give the flower you're
carrying to Juanita, you'd type <I>give juanita=flower</I>.
<P>

<BR><I>give &lt;name&gt;=&lt;amount&gt;</I>
<P>
You can also use the <I>give</I> command to transfer some
of your MUSH money to a character or item. For instance, to buy a
sandwich from Olav, you might type <I>give olav=2</I>.

<P><H6><A NAME="other">Other Useful Commands</A></H6>

<I>look</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>look here</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>l</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>l here</I>
<P>
The <I>look</I> command shows you the description of your
current location and a list of the other people and objects within it.
If your current location is a room, you'll also see the name of the
exits leading out of that room. The game displays the description of
a location when you first enter it, as well. The <I>look</I>
command can be abbreviated to <I>l</I>.
<P>

<BR><I>look &lt;name&gt;</I> 
<BR>or
<BR><I>l &lt;name&gt;</I>
<P>
You can also use the <I>look</I> command to see the
description of exits, things and characters. You could
<I>look me</I> to see what your character looks like,
<I>look painting</I> to see what an object named Painting
looks like, or <I>look road</I> to see what the exit Road
looks like, and where it leads. The <I>look</I> command only
works on objects in your immediate vicinity. Reading the descriptions
of the people, places and things on a MUSH helps you visualize the
world of the game.
<P>

<BR><I>look &lt;name&gt;'s &lt;name&gt;</I>
<P>
When you look at a player or thing object, you may see a list of
items contained inside of it. Because these items aren't in your
immediate vicinity, the standard <I>look</I> command won't
work on them, but the <I>look &lt;name&gt;'s &lt;name&gt;</I>
command will show you their description. For example, if Karl is
carrying a briefcase, you can <I>look karl's briefcase</I>
to see what it looks like.
<P>

<BR><I>WHO</I> 
<P>
The <I>WHO</I> command shows you a list of all the people
currently connected to the MUSH. The command is case sensitive (you
have to type it in capital letters). The list also indicates how long
each person has been "<A HREF="#idle">idle</A>" (how long its been
since that person last typed a command on the game).
<P>
  you type: <I>WHO</I> 
  <BR>you see: 
<PRE>    
    Player Name           On For   Idle   Doing
            Sue            00:15    45s   New, please be gentle.
            Tom            01:33    6m    To be, or not to be...
         Saidar            03:29    2m    Wizard, page if you need help.
</PRE>

<BR><I>@doing &lt;text&gt;</I>
<P>
You may see a short message next to some of the names on the WHO
list. This is called a "doing" or @do. You can set a message next to
your name on the WHO by typing <I>@doing &lt;text&gt;</I>.
Doing messages are a useful way to give a message to everyone on the
MUSH, since almost everyone looks at the WHO from time to time.
<P>

<BR><I><A NAME="listmotd">@listmotd</A></I>
<P>
MOTD stands for "message of the day". The <I>@listmotd</I>
displays important announcements from the MUSH's administrators. These
may include scheduled events on role-playing MUSHes, notices about new
commands, etc. It's a good idea to look at the
<I>@listmotd</I> each day you log on.
<P>

<BR><I>QUIT</I>
<P>
To log off the MUSH, use the <I>QUIT</I> command. This command
is case sensitive.


<P><H6><A NAME="info">Information Commands</A></H6>

Once you're familiar with the basic commands, you may want to learn
more about MUSH in general, and the particular MUSH that you're
playing. All MUSHes provide the following resources to help you do
that.
<P>

<BR><I>help</I>
<P>
The MUSH server has built-in help files to remind you of how to use
certain commands and help you learn about new ones. Type
<I>help</I> for some useful general information about using
the help system.
<P>

<BR><I>help &lt;command or topic&gt;</I>
<P>
Typing <I>help &lt;command&gt;</I> displays the help file
for a particular command. The help page will explain how to use the
command, and show you some examples of how it might be used. Try it
out with some of the commands mentioned in this guide to get a feel
for how it works.
<P>
Examples: <I>help look</I>, 
<I>help @listmotd</I>, <I>help give</I>.
<P>

<BR><I>help commands</I>
<BR><I>help topics</I>
<P>
These two commands will display lists of all the commands and topics
the help files contain information about. A lot of these may seem
confusing when you're first starting out. You do not need to learn 
all these commands and topics to play on a MUSH! Many of them are
related to <A HREF="#code">coding</A> with the programming language
built-into MUSH, and you do not need to know coding to play on a MUSH.
<P>

<BR><I>+help</I>
<P>
The <I>+help</I> command is similar to the help command. It
displays a list of global commands, or <A HREF="#globals">globals</A>.
These are commands that are specific to a particular MUSH. Each of the
listed commands or topics has its own +help information page.
<P>

<BR><I>+help &lt;command or topic&gt;</I>
<P>
The <I>+help &lt;command or topic&gt;</I> command displays
a help page for the named global command or topic and explains how to
use it. Global commands vary from game to game. Virtually all games
have a +finger command, so you can test the +help out with that:
<P>
Example: <I>+help finger</I>
<P>
Notice that the command didn't include the + in front of +finger. On
most games, you don't include the + when you look up topics in the
+help. 
<P>
(If you get an error message when you type <I>+help finger</I>,
the game you're playing may not have the +finger command or they may use
the + in the lookup. Type
<I>+help</I> for a list of the globals it does have, and try
out the command with one of the globals listed.)
<P>

<BR><I><A NAME="news">news</A></I>
<P>
The <I>news</I> files are an extremely important source of
information on any MUSH. The name is actually something of a misnomer.
The news files are not generally where you go to find out the latest
character gossip or game news. That information exists, but is found
in other places. (One of those places is the <A HREF="#listmotd">
@listmotd</A>.)
<P>
What you will find in the news files is a library of information on
the game's policies and rules, hints and tips for playing that game,
and background information on the setting of that game. While the
other commands we've discussed so far are the same on any MUSH, the
news files on each game are specific to that MUSH, so <EM>you need to
read the news on every new MUSH you try</EM>.
<P>
Typing <I>news</I> will show you a list of the news topics
on any game.
<P>

<BR><I>news &lt;topic&gt;</I>
<P>
To read the information in a particular news section, type 
<I>news &lt;topic&gt;</I>. You can get a list of topics by
typing <I>news</I> alone.
<P>
<I><EM>All players on a MUSH are expected to read the news files,
make note of the rules of the game, and follow them. You don't have to
read all of the news as soon as you log on, but it's important to read
any rules-related news items during your first few sessions on the
game.</EM></I>
<P>
If you disagree with most of the rules on a particular game, or don't
feel you can follow them, you should log off that game and try
another. Each game has its own rules, and you might like those of
another game better. It's of no advantage to you or anyone else to
ignore the rules or deliberately break them. If you do, you'll find
that you annoy the other players of the game, and they probably won't
want to interact with you.

<h5><A NAME="jargon">Terms and Abbreviations</A> - A 
Guide to MUSH Jargon</H5>

People who play MUSHes tend to use some abbreviations and jargon
specific to MUSHing. These are particularly common with long phrases,
for ease of typing. Some are also used in newsgroup or email
messages, but others are specific to MUSH. Many games settings have
their own acronyms for aspects of game play specific to that world.
The following is a list of generic terms and abbreviations used on
virtually all MUSHes.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><I><A NAME="code">coding</A></I>
  <DD>The MUSH server allows all players to create their own commands on
  thing, room or player objects that they own. People do this by
  using the programming language that is built-into the MUSH server.
  When people use the term coding on a MUSH, they're referring to
  programming on the game using that language. For instance, someone
  can create a dog that barks whenever someone comes near it, or a
  bartender that serves drinks to customers.
<DT><I><A NAME="build">building</A></I>
  <DD>The MUSH server also allows all players to create their own rooms
  and exits and add to the game's landscape. Those who do so are
  building. For instance, most games allow people to create homes for
  their characters.
<DT><I><A NAME="idle">idle</A></I>
  <DD>People who are "idle" are not currently active on the the game.
  They probably aren't watching their screens, so they won't 
  immediately respond to any actions or statements that you make,
  although they'll be able to read them all when they return to the
  game. If you are inactive too long (more than one hour on most
  games), you will be automatically disconnected from the game
<DT><I>IC</I>
  <DD>In-character - speaking and acting as a fictional character rather
  than as the real life player.
<DT><I>OOC</I>
  <DD>Out-of-character - speaking as the real life player rather than
  a fictional character 
<DT><I>RP</I>
  <DD>Role-playing - portraying the actions and statements of
  a character in the fictional world of the MUSH.
<DT><I>VR</I>
  <DD>Virtual reality - the MUSH world. Sometimes used for the Net world
  in general.
<DT><I>RL</I>
  <DD>Real life, the world outside of the Net and MUSH worlds. 
<DT><I>AFK</I>
  <DD>Away from keyboard - the person is going to be idle a bit.
<DT><I>BBS</I>
  <DD>Be back soon - the person may be going idle for a short while, or
  he or she is logging off, but plans to log back in soon.
<DT><I>BBL</I>
  <DD>Be back later - the person is logging off and saying goodbye for
  now.
<DT><I>LOL</I>
  <DD>Laughing out loud - the person is amused.
<DT><I>ROTFL</I>
  <DD>Rolling on the floor laughing - the person is extremely amused.
<DT><I>BTW</I>
  <DD>By the way.
<DT><I>OTOH</I>
  <DD>On the other hand.
<DT><I>IMHO</I>
  <DD>In my humble opinion - a variation is IMNSHO - in my not-so-humble
  opinion.

<h5><A NAME="first">Getting Started</A> - Your First
Session on a MUSH</H5>

This step-by-step guide is designed to help you make your first
connection to a MUSH so you can try out all the commands you just
learned about.
<P>
The address of <A title="Shadowrun Seattle" 
href="http://www.dnaco.net/~shadow">Shadowrun Seattle</A> is
used as an example in this guide. There are a number of
<A HREF="general.html"> MUSH lists</A> available that you can use to
find the address of a game you're interested in if it is not to your taste.


<P><H6>Preparing to Connect</H6>

You will probably be using one of the following methods to connect:
<P>

<UL>
<LI><H6>Telnet or MU* Client Program</H6>
<P>
Start up your telnet or MU* client program. How to do this will
depend on your operating system and the program itself.
<P>
Input the address: <I>shadowrun.dnaco.net 4201</I>
<P>
Note that some programs require you to set the port number in a
separate section from the main address. Look for a box named
<EM>port</EM> or <EM>service</EM>. If you see one, the port number must
go there. The port number for Shadowrun is the 
<I>4201</I> section of the address above.
<P>
If you get an error message to the effect of "host not found", try
using the IP address instead: <I>209.251.21.151 4201</I>
<P>
If you find the above confusing, you may want to start with the
<A HREF="connect.html">introduction
of the How to Connect to a MU* guide</A>. Information on
<A HREF="telnet.html">telnet</A> and
<A HREF="client.html">client programs</A>
for a variety of systems is also available. Telnet programs tend to be
simpler to use, but do not offer as many features.
<P>

<LI><H6>Connect Through Your Web Browser</H6>

Start your Web browser, and select one of the links below. Both go
to Tales of Ta'veren MUSH. The first uses the word address, the second
the IP address. If the first one doesn't work for you, the second one
probably will.
<P>
<I><A HREF="telnet://shadowrun.dnaco.net:4201">shadowrun.dnaco.net
  4201</A> </I>
<BR>or
<BR><I><A HREF="telnet://209.251.21.151:4201">209.251.21.151 4201
  </A></I>
<P>
You can also input the address into your browser rather than using
a link. To do so, you would type the following in the same way you
enter a Web page URL.
<P>
<I>telnet://shadowrun.dnaco.net:4201</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>telnet://209.251.21.151:4201</I>
<P>
If your browser gives you an error like "application not found" when
you try either of the above, it means you do not have a telnet 
program set up on your system.
<P>
Telnet is not a feature standard to Web browsers. However, many
browsers can be configured to launch a telnet program when you 
select a <I>telnet://</I> link like the ones above. You
will need to set up a telnet program for this to work. Note that telnet
is completely separate from the Web, once you have a telnet program,
you can use it without starting up your Web browser.
<P>
Information on <A HREF="telnet.html">where
to obtain telnet programs</A> for a variety of systems is available.
There is also <A HREF="web.html">a guide to configuring
the Netscape Web browser</A> to launch your telnet program when you
select a <I>telnet:// link</I>.
</UL>

<P><H6>Connection Established</H6>

Whatever method you use to connect to the MUSH, you will see the
game's "welcome screen" if you have successfully connected. The
welcome screen includes a list of commands you can use at this
stage. It may also include an ASCII picture or title (that's a
picture drawn with text symbols). The following is a sample welcome
screen.

<PRE>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Use create &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt; to create a new character.
Use connect &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt; to connect to your existing character.
Use connect guest guest if you'd just like to look around.
Use QUIT to logout.
Use WHO to find out who is online currently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

If you see something like the above when you try to connect, you can
jump to the next section. If you don't see that, you aren't connected
to the MUSH.
<P>
Sometimes people see the following, and wonder why they aren't able
to login:
<P>
<PRE>
login:
password:
</PRE>
<P>
If you see that, you're connecting to the right machine, but not the
right portion of that machine. It means you've connected to the
default port, port 23. That is the login port to connect to a user
account on a host. Since you don't have a user account on the host
machine, you won't be able to connect. To reach the MUSH, you need to
go to port number, which is 4201 in the case of Shadowrun Seattle. The
machine name is like a street name, and the port number is like the
number of the house you want to visit.
<P>
There are two common causes of this problem. The first is if you're 
either not entering the port number (so your program uses the default
of 23), or you're inputting it incorrectly for your telnet program.
Some programs require you to enter the port number in a separate box
or area.
<P>
The other cause is if your telnet program does not accept
non-standard port numbers. That means it will only connect you to
port 23. Most MUSHes use non-standard port numbers, so if this is
the case, you won't be able to use that program to play the majority
of MUSHes, or other MU* games.
<P>
Information on <A HREF="telnet.html">
telnet</A> and <A HREF="client.html">
client</A> programs for a variety of systems is available if you find you
need to try another program.


<P><H6>Logging In</H6>

Once you see the welcome screen, you should be able to log on to the
MUSH. If you just want to look around but aren't sure you want a
character yet, or if you've connected to a <A HREF="#reg">registration
MUSH</A>, you can log onto the Guest character to tour the game.
<P>
Here's what you'd type to log on to the Guest character:
<P>
<I>connect guest guest</I>
<P>
Once you have a character, you use your unique character name and
password to log onto the game:
<P>
<I>connect &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt;</I>
<P>
If your character is named Sue, and your password is PinkPoodle,
you'd type the following to connect to Sue:
<P>
<I>connect Sue PinkPoodle</I>


<P><h6>Creating a Character on an Open MUSH</H6>

On an open MUSH, you can create a character for yourself at the
welcome screen by typing the following. This command will create the
character for you, and log you onto the MUSH as that character.
<P>
<I>create &lt;name&gt; &lt;password&gt;</I>
<P>
For example, to create a character named Bob with a password of
GoJays!, type:
<P>
<I>create Bob GoJays!</I>
<P>
Sometimes when you try to create a character, the MUSH will give you
this message:
<P>
<PRE>
Either there is already a player with that name, or that name is illegal.
</PRE>

There are some limitations on character names. Every character must
have a unique name, so if someone is already using the name Bob,
you'll have to choose another name for your character. Some games
may also not allow you to choose a name with a curse word in it, or
the name of a character from the book, movie or TV show the game is
based on. If you get that message, just try again with a different
name.


<P><H6><A NAME="reg">Creating</A> a Character on a Registration MUSH</H6>

A registration MUSH is any game that doesn't allow you to use the
create command to make yourself a character from the welcome screen.
On these games, only the <A HREF="#admin">MUSH's administrators</A>
can make you a character. On some games, all you need to do is email or
<A HREF="#page">page</A> an administrator and request a character.
Other games may require an application form, as well.
<P>
If you don't see any instructions on how to obtain a character at the
welcome screen, log on to the game as a Guest character and ask an
administrator or player how to get a character.
<P>
Once the administrators receive your request (or accept your 
application), they will email you the name and password of your
character, and you can log on using the connect command.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dnaco.net/~shadow">Shadowrun Seattle</A> is not
a registration MUSH. More information about setting up a character on Seattle
is available on the <A HREF="../chargen/index.html">Character generation page</A>.

</DIV>

<DIV ID="content">
<H5>Now What?</H5>

If all has gone well, you should now be connected to the MUSH.
<P>
If you're using the Guest character, you'll probably be in an area
set aside as a home for guests. From there, you can explore the game
world, read the news files, and learn more about the MUSH.
<P>
If you connected to your own character, you will be at the starting
room of the MUSH. Where you go from here depends on the MUSH you're
playing. There are a few things you might want to set on your
character before you start exploring, however:
<P>

<UL>
  <LI>You will probably want to set a gender for your character. Your
  character does not have to have the same gender that you do. To set
  your character's gender, type the following:
<P>
<I>@sex me=female</I>
<BR>or
<BR><I>@sex me=male </I>
<P>

  <LI>The next thing you'll you probably want to set up is your character's
  description, so the other players on the MUSH know what he or she
  looks like:
<P>
<I>@desc me=&lt;text&gt;</I>
<P>
Example: <I>@desc me=Andrea is of average height, and looks to
be in her late twenties. She has curly brown hair, and dark eyes.</I>
<P>
Your character's description should fit in with the theme of the
game you're playing - if you're playing a game set in outer space,
a description for a barbarian probably won't fit. Some games have
rules about what your character can and can't be. These will be in
the <A HREF="#news">news files</A>. If you aren't sure what the
game is like yet, describe your character as a generic human and
leave out specific details about clothing style.
<P>
Once you know more about the game and you've finalized your
character concept, or whenever you want to change or embellish your
description, you can rewrite it by typing the command again:
<P>
<I>@desc me=&lt;new description&gt; </I>
<P>
The <A HREF="../chargen/desc.html">How to Describe
Your Character</A> page has some tips for writing a good character
description.
<P>

  <LI>The last thing you should do before starting to explore is to lock
  your character. Locking your character sets it so no one can pick up
  your character and carry him or her around like an object. The
  following command will lock your character so no one can pick him
  or her up:
<P>
<I>@lock me=me</I>
<P>

  <LI>If you want to change your character name, you can do so using the
  following command:
<P>
<I>@name me=&lt;new name&gt; </I>
<BR><EM>** Remember your new name for next time you log on! ** </EM>
<P>

  <LI>You can also change your password at any time. Your password should
  be something you'll find easy to remember, but would be hard for
  another to guess. Do not make your password the same as your
  character name! That is the first password someone trying to "hack
  into" someone else's character will try. Use the following command
  to change your password:
<P>
<I>@password &lt;old password&gt;=&lt;new password&gt;</I>
</UL>
<P>

</DIV>

<DIV ID="Content">
<H5>Role-Playing</H5>

If you're trying a role-playing MUSH, you may want to read over some
tips before you begin playing. The
<A HREF="../roleplay/guide.html">Simple Guide to Online
Role-Playing</A> contains some useful tips for online role-players.
Online role-playing differs from tabletop role-playing games like
Dungeons & Dragons, so you'll find the Guide helpful even if you're
familiar with role-playing in other spheres. 
<A HREF="../roleplay/index.html">Other role-play resources</A> are also available.
