<P><I>The Net23 Evening News logo scrolls across the screen, shimmering until it fades into the Net23 newsroom. Sitting at the desk is Art Arturo, not the usual news anchor. He taps his papers in front of him and looks up to the camera.</I> </P>

<P>Arturo -- We're back. In local news this evening, the Kent Street Clinic continues its tradition of helping out the needy. We go now live to the scene of the Kent Street Clinic with Jason Haldane reporting. </P>

<P><I>The newsroom fades into a frontal view of the Kent Street Clinic. There is a line up of assorted people awaiting the free food and vaccinations provided there. The camera zooms back to picture a young clean cut ork of about 22, wearing a full business suit. His breath comes out in little clouds as he speaks.</I> </P>

<P>Haldane -- The scene here is grim. The people at Kent Street Clinic do their best every day to provide food and warmth for the citizens in the underground that can't afford it, but their cash flow is falling short once again. The workers here need nuyen to buy clothes, food, and medical supplies to those in need and are desperately seeking contributions. On behalf of one of the employees here at Net23, a 2000 =N= credstick has been donated in Net23's name. Anybody with any skill in the fields of nursing, radiology, pharmaceuticals or pediatrics is encouraged to roll up their sleeves and give a helping hand. Without donations, volunteers, and a kind heart, places like Kent Street would not be open today. <Jason looks at his clipboard> If anybody can volunteer or donate nuyen, food or medical supplies, the number to contact is LTG6347-55264. Please, show some love. This is Jason Haldane, Net23 news, reporting. </P>

<P><I>The scene fades back into the Net23 newsroom and Art Arturo. Arturo taps his pages and begins.</I> </P>

<P>Arturo -- Thank you Jason. I'd like to personally thank the Net23 employee who donated the nuyen to the Kent Street Clinic. If you want to make a donation, but are afraid to go to the underground, Net23 can take donations for you. We will have a drop off box for non-perishable food items and a drop box for money. Please be generous. We'll be back right after this short commercial break. </P>

<P><I>With that, the Net23 news music plays as the logo reapears. It shimmers and spins momentarily before going to commercial.</I></P>
