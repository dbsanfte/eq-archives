<P><I>A young elven lady is standing in front of a large screen. The screen behind her begins to cycle through realistic photographs of crime scenes. Familiar scenes are shown again as the gutted ruins of a Furniture Store, a Hardware Store, Misty Towers and a Street corner become visible in great detail. The young lady begins to speak.</I></P>

<P>"For the past two weeks, a horror has walked the streets of Seattle disguised as a man. A terrorist has been plaquing the MetaHuman population with violence and death. Before yesterday, Only Lone Star and 23News stood against him. But now, a new hope has come to light."</P>

<P><I>The background scene shifts to a picture of the 400 block of East King Street in the International District. A small crater can be seen blasted in the cement on one sidewalk. Blast marks mark the surrounding area as well to a distance of 30'. None of the buildings though are damaged</I></P>

<P>"This is all that remains of the terrorist who has been identified through anonymous sources as Cobian Walton, AKA The Realist. A band of Vigilantes put an end to him Sunday evening through a execution style hit envolving magic and high powered weapons sources say. Though the vigiilantes have no been identified, rough sketches have been provided by a bum. These sketches show that 4 female's and a dwarf are responsible. After dispatching the terrorist, a implanted 'Cortex' bomb went off. The resulting blast complete obliterated the terrorist leaving metal fragments and blood to rain for the sky. " A smile breaks out on the reporter's face, "For now, Metahuman's can rest a little more, safe in the knowledge that this most recent outbreak of violence has been destroyed. "</P>

<P><I>The scene pans out showing all of Seattle from a high altitude plane</I></P>

<P>"23News offers it's condolances to the families and friends of the desceased. We shall keep on our vigil and bring you ground breaking news as it happens. Once more, This is 23News Reporting."</P>
 
<P><I>The scene slowly fades out and regular programming begins once again</I></P>
