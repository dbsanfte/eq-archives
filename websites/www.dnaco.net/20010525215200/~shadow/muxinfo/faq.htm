      <p><b><a name="tt"></a>How is playing Shadowrun on a MUX different than 
        playing a TT game?</b></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The most obvious difference is that there are many, many more people 
          involved on the MUX than in your average TT game. Most TT games have 
          around three or four PCs and one GM. </p>
        <p>On Seattle MUX, there are often more than thirty or even fourty PCs 
          online at once! Another obvious difference is that there is no single 
          GM in charge of what happens to your character. RPS is responsible for 
          guiding the actions in the world of Seattle MUX; they fulfill all the 
          duties that a GM would handle in a TT Game. </p>
        <p>Another fundamental difference: in a TT game, you and a few other PCs 
          are usually the stars. If your game was an action movie, one of you 
          would be Arnold Schwarzenegger, another would be Sylvester Stallone, 
          a third might be Van Damme (if he wanted to play a total sissy). On 
          the MUX, everyone has their own agenda, every PC has his or her own 
          goals, and sometimes the goals of MUX players are opposed. Nobody is 
          the star on Seattle MUX, everyone holds a place in the game. Sometimes 
          you'll come into conflict with another player on Seattle MUX; in some 
          cases, you may even enter into a life-and-death situation, and one of 
          your characters might bite the dust. You rarely see a PvP conflict in 
          a TT game.</p>
        <p>Along this line of reasoning, another difference you may notice is 
          that your character won't have a dozen skills at rating 6 or higher. 
          On Seattle MUX, you won't be playing an action star who doesn't need 
          to reload, racks up a triple-digit body count every weekend and can 
          use any type of weapon he stumbles upon. If your character has combat 
          experience, it will be easy to justify him knowing how to fire a pistol, 
          how to wield a katana or a submachine gun, but everything is in moderation. 
        </p>
        <p>Read the skill ratings table at the end of the Skills chapter in the 
          SR3 sourcebook for a good measure of how hard it might be to reach a 
          level of mastery in a field that <br>
          can be represented with a rating 6 skill, and you'll understand why 
          it would take some serious justification for your character to have 
          Pistols, Rifles, Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles, Heavy Weapons, Launch 
          Weapons, Edged Weapons, Unarmed Combat, and Gunnery all at Rating 6. 
          It would take many, many years to develop such a mastery of all these 
          types of weapons; perhaps a grizzled Green Beret veteran who continues 
          to sign up for more combat tours despite his failing health and advancing 
          age might be at this level, but he would be one of a truly elite few 
          in the world.</p>

      <p><b><a name="whyapprove"></a>Why do I have to get so much stuff approved 
        before I can play?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Some say that Seattle MUX is an elitist place, that the people there 
          don't <br>
          want you to play with them. Why do they say this? The chargen process 
          has a <br>
          few hoops you have to jump through.</p>
        <p>Now, let me be the first to tell you, anyone who says that I don't 
          want you <br>
          to come play on Seattle with me is a liar! The chargen process isn't 
          in <br>
          place to intimidate you or scare you off, it's there for another reason: 
          to <br>
          make sure that every PC who hits the IC grid is a fully balanced, <br>
          believable, fleshed-out and ready-to-go character.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="whyreject"></a>Why wasn't my background approved?</b></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Before you get an answer to this question, you have to understand why 
          you write a background in the first place. In some TT games, an emphasis 
          is placed on &quot;rollplaying&quot;, or succeeding against something 
          by using the numbers on your character sheet and rolling dice. On Seattle 
          MUX, roleplaying is more important than rollplaying, and while a character 
          sheet may give you some idea of what your character looks like, what 
          he can do, how strong or intelligent he is, it doesn't offer up much 
          more information than that. </p>
        <p>A background will give you (and any RPA's that want some information 
          about your character) a good starting point to begin roleplaying intelligently. 
          It's important to know where your character has been, why he's in Seattle, 
          what his motivations are, and, if he's a criminal, why (this is a particularly 
          important thing to know). If you don't know this information, you're 
          not going to have very much fun trying to make it all up on the fly, 
          and those you roleplay with won't have much fun either. The <br>
          background approval process ensures that when you hit the grid you won't 
          have to worry about any of that.</p>
        <p>Now, on to the vital question: what makes a background &quot;good&quot; 
          or &quot;bad&quot;? First of all, it has to be readable. If a PHA loads 
          up your BG and can't make sense of it due to poor grammar, spelling 
          and editing errors, or lack of coherence, there's little chance that 
          he's going to make it all the way through it. Make sure your BG is easy 
          to read and understand! Don't switch tenses like they don't matter or 
          use pronouns that are unclear. </p>
        <p>Another important point is that your BG is consistent, or more specifically, 
          that your character's actions are consistent. The actions your character 
          takes in his lifetime need to make sense; if he was raised in an affluent 
          family and happy all through his childhood, why would he suddenly become 
          a criminal, rather than following in his parents' footsteps and becoming 
          a corporate lawyer? Things need to be explained clearly and sensibly. 
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important thing to explain: why is your character 
          a criminal? If he is a member of the Yakuza, the Humanis Policlub, the 
          Mafia, an independent shadowrunner, or even a gang member, he lives 
          outside the law, and it's not enough to simply gloss over your character's 
          descent into a lawless <br>
          lifestyle. One decker might run the shadows because he grew up in a 
          poor neighborhood and couldn't make a break in life; he was seduced 
          into crime because it offered him an easy way to make a buck. Another 
          decker might run because he saw a friend murdered at the hands of a 
          Mafia don and turned to the Matrix to uncover enough dirt to send the 
          don to sleep with the fishes. These two characters could have the exact 
          same character sheet, but they're very, very different people, with 
          different motivations and experiences.</p>
        <p>One more thing to keep in mind: you're not the only person who can 
          see your BG. Even six months after you start playing, an RPA who wants 
          to know how to hook your character into a plot might load up your BG 
          and check our your character's history, personality and motivations. 
          It's possible to create a BG that will pass through the approval process 
          and not offer anything to you or RPStaff, but it's not going to benefit 
          anyone in the long run.</p>
        <p>A final hint: don't just make your background a laundry list of justifications 
          for your cyberware and skills. It's nice (and required) to know why 
          your character has certain abilities and equipment, but the background 
          isn't just that: it defines who and what your character is in every 
          way. The more information you include, the more believable and defined 
          your character will be in the long run.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="whyapprejected"></a>Why wasn't my application approved?</b></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Once you get through the background submission/approval process, you'll 
          go through the automated chargen process and create a character sheet, 
          complete with attributes, skills, cyberware, gear, and contacts. After 
          this is all complete and your application is submitted to the appropriate 
          queue, an RPA will load up your background and +sheet and check them 
          both out. </p>
        <p>The RPA is really looking for one thing in particular: does your +sheet 
          match your <br>
          background? If your character has wired reflexes 3, does your background 
          explain why he has such expensive, uncommon cyberware? If your character 
          has the Pistols skill at rating 6, does your BG explain why he can use 
          a handgun better than most SWAT team members? If so, everything's cool 
          and you're good to go. </p>
        <p>Frankly, most applications that are denied fall into one of two categories: 
          they don't make sense, or they're just plain overpowered. In the first 
          case, the RPA may find glaring inconsistencies between the background 
          and the +sheet: expensive cyberware isn't mentioned at all in the background 
          (he's got a VCR 2? why? when did this happen?) and/or skills that are 
          conspicuously not justified in the background (why does a former television 
          reporter have Assault Rifles 5?). </p>
        <p>In the second case, the character is just too combat-oriented. I'll 
          be the first to admit, I groan audibly when I grab an application, load 
          up a background that reads well and defines a well-rounded character, 
          and then look at a +sheet with five rating 6 skills. There's a news 
          files (<a href="../news/rules/skills.htm">news rules skills levels</a>) 
          that should give you a good idea how the rating number's translate to 
          ability levels. If a street cop can use his Pistol at rating 3, then 
          there's just no good reason that a teenage gang member should have Pistols 
          at Rating 5. It's going to be hard to get me to believe that a teenage 
          gang member can handle a pistol as well as a 20 year veteran policeman. 
          Perhaps if his life has been a nightmarish whirlwind of constant gunfights... 
          but individuals fitting this profile are few and far between. </p>
        <p>Having too many high-level skills is just as bad as having unjustified 
          skills: even a SWAT team member won't have Pistols, Submachine Guns, 
          Shotguns, Rifles and Assault Rifles at rating 5 or 6, or even have every 
          one of these skills at all. Rating 5 and 6 skills represent a near-mastery 
          of the skill. Just how much time does your character spend training? 
          Enough to master five different classifications of firearms? I sincerely 
          doubt it. Even a SWAT member might only have Submachine Guns at 5, Pistols 
          at 4, and perhaps Assault Rifles at 3, and those guys spend several 
          hours a week training, training, training.</p>
        <p>In short, if you want to play a character who's defined by his character 
          sheet, go play a tabletop game! Nobody's going to hold it against you. 
          I enjoy TT games very much myself; it's a different experience altogether. 
          If you want to play on Seattle MUX, be willing to conform to the standards 
          that have been set up there. With this in mind, submit a +sheet that 
          meshes well with your background and doesn't force the RPA to reject 
          it with the &quot;Not Another Cookie-Cutter Combat Monster&quot; stamp 
          of disapproval.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b><a name="findrp"></a>What am I doing here? Why can't I find anyone 
        to roleplay with?</b></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote>First of all, the commands +ho, +map and +directory are going 
        to prove very useful to a new player. +ho lists bars, restaurants and 
        hangouts that have players in them, and you can head there to look for 
        someone to roleplay with. +map will show you where you are and where you 
        can get to, and +directory will help you find the establishments you're 
        looking for. 
        <p>Why isn't anyone looking for you? Simply put, this isn't a tabletop 
          game. On Seattle MUX, there's dozens of players, not three or four, 
          and you're not the only important person. Everyone else is already out 
          there, they've already made friends, established contacts, gone on shadowruns 
          and gained a street rep. You're the new guy, nobody knows you or even 
          cares about you.</p>
        <p>But wait! It's not so bad as all that, that's just in the game! While 
          your character doesn't matter to anyone yet, you do! We want you to 
          enjoy yourself, we want to roleplay with you. Get out there and meet 
          people. Put your name out on the streets, maybe a fixer or a Johnson 
          will pick it out of a hat and hire you for a job. </p>
        <p>If you're completely unable to find anyone to roleplay with, page someone 
          for advice. Seattle MUX is often daunting to new players because it 
          can be difficult to find places to RP if you don't know where everyone 
          tends to be. The worst thing you can do is idle in your apartment and 
          wait for someone to come find you--be proactive! Go grab the bull by 
          the horns and show Seattle what they've been missing by not having you 
          around!</p>

      <p><b><a name="lifestyle"></a>How do I buy a lifestyle?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>On Seattle MUX, your lifestyle is determined by what apartments you 
          live in. If you type &quot;+check housing&quot; you'll get a list of 
          coded apartments where you can rent rooms. Using the +directory will 
          help you locate these apartments, and there should be a help file or 
          OOC sign to explain the commands to rent a room.</p>

      <p><b><a name="newgear"></a>How can I get a new car (armor, silencer, laser 
        sight, suprathyroid, cellular phone)?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This depends a lot on whether your character has a SIN (real or fake). 
          If you're a SINless character, tough titties, pal. You're going to have 
          to go through a fixer to get anything you want illegally, no matter 
          what it is. There are PC fixers out there on the grid, you just have 
          to go find them. This can be exciting in and of itself.</p>
        <p>If you have a SIN, there's options available to you. Vehicles, guns, 
          cyberware, computers and all kinds of things can be obtained legally. 
          There's a coded car dealership for vehicles and a coded electronics 
          shop for computers. Guns and armor, you'll have to get an admin to create 
          those for you. Legal purchases, however, can be easily traced, and you'll 
          have to get a permit for every gun you want to own or carry, as well 
          as every piece of legal cyberware you want installed. Your legal car 
          will be registered with the DMV.</p>
        <p>And then there's always stuff that's just plain illegal... so, even 
          a character with a SIN might decide to go through an illegitimate source 
          for certain things.</p>
        <p>How do you get a SIN? If your background calls for it, the RPA that 
          approves your application should set you up with one when you go IC 
          from the appropriate country. If you start out as a SINless character, 
          you can walk right up to any Lone Star station, pay a fine for being

      <blockquote> 
        <p>How do you think? This question gets asked a lot, and frankly, the 
          answers are just what you'd expect. If you're a shadowrunner, find a 
          shadowrun, go on it and get paid. If you're a ganger, go beat somebody 
          up and take his credstick. If you're in an org (legal or illegal) or 
          running a smallbiz (heh, legal or illegal), you're probably earning 
          money anyway.</p>
        <p>How do you earn money in a tabletop game? Apply this to the MUX. It's 
          one concept that transfers pretty well.</p>

      <p><b><a name="earnkarma"></a>How can I earn karma?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>In a TT game, the GM hands out karma after each shadowrun. On Seattle 
          MUX, an RPA hands out karma for good roleplaying. Remember that background 
          you wrote? It defines your character's personality and motivation: stick 
          with it! In a TT game you don't get the chance to act out your character's 
          daily life, to meet new people, to chill in a bar or restaurant and 
          just relax, to call someone up on the phone, to work out in a gym. </p>
        <p>These and more are all things you might do on Seattle MUX, and if you 
          stay in character while doing them, you're going to impress RPS. They'll 
          hand out the rewards you deserve. Here's a hint: if you want to know 
          if a RPA is watching your scene, use +edcheck and see.</p>
        <p>If there's nobody watching your cool, cool RP, how can you earn karma 
          for it? Log it! Most MU* client programs support logging, and if yours 
          doesn't, get another one! Log the good stuff, edit out all the unnecessary 
          OOC babble, and mail your log to an RPA. Check +staff/all to see who 
          might want it, and look in their +finger to see if they accept RP logs. 
          If you participate in a scene that you think is RPed well enough to 
          deserve karma, chances are a RPA might think so too. Don't let it go 
          to waste, log away!</p>

      <p><b><a name="spendkarma"></a>How can I spend karma?</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Pretty much the same ways you spend it in a tabletop game. Raising 
          attributes, raising skills, learning new spells, bonding spirits. The 
          only differences, and these are only differences if you happen to do 
          it differently in your TT games, are:</p>
        <p>1) You need some kind of justification to raise a skill or attribute. 
          If you go to the gym four nights a week and pump mega iron, then you 
          can justify raising your strength from 3 to 4. To raise your strength 
          from 6 to 7 might require heavy steroid use and several hours a day 
          at a fitness center. For raising skills, similar justification is required. 
          It's not enough to just say, &quot;My character is getting better with 
          a gun,&quot; and raise your Pistols skill from 1 to 2. Is he actually 
          practicing with the weapon? Is he getting real combat experience with 
          it? If so, then your request is justified. If not, go do something about 
          it.</p>
        <p>2) &quot;Training&quot; takes time. After you raise a skill or attribute, 
          the very soonest you can raise it again is a number of weeks equal to 
          the new skill rating. For instance, after raising your Pistols skill 
          from 2 to 3, it will be, at the very least, three weeks before you can 
          raise that skill again. Generally, it's going to take longer than that, 
          unless your character devotes a truly significant amount of time to 
          improving his abilities in <br>
          that one area.</p>
        <p>What exactly should you do to spend karma? @mail Roleplaying (which 
          is a queue, not a character) with your request. If you want the process 
          to go smoothly and quickly, include the skill or attribute name, its 
          current level, the desired level, the linked attribute (for skills) 
          the calculated good karma cost, and a justification for the raise. In 
          some cases it may be necessary to provide an actual RP log to back up 
          your claims that a skill raise is justified (e.g. your Pistols skill 
          isn't going to raise from 6 to 7 just because you go to the firing range 
          every other weekend).</p>

        <p>Magic characters on Seattle are subject to more stringent regulations, 
          because there is a high demand for these PCs, but realistically, you 
          can only have so many of them on the grid at once.</p>
        <p>As a result, Magic PCs are only open for applications when the RPC/Magic 
          (that's Roleplaying Chief/Magic) posts openings, and those openings 
          will generally be for a specific type of magically-active character. 
          Look on bb1 for current openings.</p>

      <p><b><a name="acronyms"></a>What do all those three-letter acronyms by 
        the staffers' names mean?</b> </p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The first two letters of the code denote the department, and the third 
          denotes the position within the department. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There are three staff departments here on SeattleMUX:</p>
        <p> 
        <blockquote><b>BCS - Build/Code Staff: </b>BCS is the branch of staff 
          that makes the grid exist. The BCS folks build all the places you love 
          to hang out in, all the objects your PC owns, the special MUX-specific 
          commands you use, and much, much more. 
          <p><b>PHS - Player Help Staff: </b>PHS folks are in place to help new 
            players. They approve character backgrounds, answer questions, and 
            are, in essence, the Welcome Wagon of Seattle. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p><b>RPS - Roleplaying Staff: </b>RPS is the group in charge of the 
            roleplaying on the MUX. They run plots, approve final character sheets, 
            make rules decisions, and provide karma, among many, many other things. 
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are three staff departments here on SeattleMUX:</p>
        <p> 
        <blockquote>A<b> <b>D</b></b> denotes a <b><b>Director</b></b>, a person 
          in charge of one of the three departments. 
          <p>A <b>C </b>denotes a <b>Chief </b>within one of the departments, 
            who heads up a subdivision of the department. RPS, for example, has 
            Chiefs devoted to Magic, Organized Crime, Gangs, and more.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An<b> A </b>as the third letter signifies an<b> Admin </b>who works 
            under a Chief. </p>
          <p>Occasionally you will also see a four-letter code prefaced with <b>A</b>. 
            This A denotes an <b>Assistant</b>. The ARPD, for example, is the 
            Assistant Roleplaying Director.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Please note that staffers in one area cannot do things that are the 
          province of another. A BCA (Build/Code Admin) cannot approve your character. 
          A RPA (Roleplaying Admin) cannot implement code changes. And so forth...</p>

      <p><b><a name="staffchar"></a>Can MUX staff play characters? </b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>All divisions of staff except RPS can, and often do, have player characters 
          in addition to their Admin logins. RPS cannot have active PCs, as this 
          is regarded as a conflict of interest.</p>
