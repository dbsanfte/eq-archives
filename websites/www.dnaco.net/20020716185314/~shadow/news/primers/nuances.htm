      <p> It's the little things that bring a character to life. Blink sometimes. 
        Sneeze. Smile. Talk too loud intentionally at your table as a player but 
        not as a character, and let some TINY TIDBIT slip. Eat food sometimes. 
        Step off to the bathroom. Take showers. Walk around the city, don't type 
        home all the time (NOTE: Typing 'home' is BLATANTLY OOC. You just should 
        NOT use this command except in case of emergency.) Don't spend all your 
        time in bars, go out and do things that normal people do. Visit a pizza 
        shop instead of a posh restaurant for a few slices. When you take the 
        cab, don't assume just because it's coded to be instantaneous, it is instantaneous 
        to drive across downtown Seattle. 
      <p>Get drunk. Get unruly. Babble sometimes. Cry, laugh, emote. Be a racist. 
        Make ribald comments to members of the opposite sex that are cute. Interact 
        and comment on the "assumed NPCs". Some of the best RPing I've seen has 
        been around NPCs that "aren't there". The players are free to (as long 
        as they keep things in character and inform roleplaying of any MAJOR occurances 
        they do) roleplay Joe Clubber or Bob Pedestrian or Jane Nurse, as much 
        as they want. Use these things to add color to the world and your character. 
        Have your character's boy/girlfriend or employer/employee get an email 
        or phone call from an NPC in your background that the Judges don't play 
        accusing him or her of having some venereal disease, warning him or her 
        away from you because you are a philanderer, starting an argument, or 
        something like that. ADD COLOR TO YOURSELF AND THE WORLD THIS WAY! You 
        can only enhance the universe and your own character if you do this well. 
      <p>Another point that should be addressed as far as nuances are concerned 
        is spelling, punctuation, and grammar. It's a common point on the Internet 
        that most people should be able to convey their ideas well via writing--the 
        medium is entirely text-based, after all. I know that there are those 
        of you out there who cannot spell--some of them are on staff, and they're 
        good staffers--but for your OWN sake and the sake of the RPers out there 
        who (like me) sometimes can't stand to RP with someone who doesn't capitalize 
        or punctuate, who says everything like this: "i went to aztechnology and 
        killed the dragon and got the cool stuff chummer", put some time into 
        learning how to convey yourself properly. Your experience here will be 
        all the better for it.
