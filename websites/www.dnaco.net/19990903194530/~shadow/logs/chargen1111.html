Wildcat arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Wildcat arrives on long leggy strides. 

Shepard arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Revver takes Weaver's SR3 book and kicks him in his seat. 

Weaver says "ow." 

Theo baps Revver. 

Wildcat sits down in a perfectly ladylike fashion. 

Morris says "Ok, Lets get this started. I would like to reiterate my 
  announcement that we will not be discussing how we will be 
  implementing any new system, but only what changes may need to be made 
  to SR3 to work in a MUX setting." 

Revver @thwaps Theo. 

GridIron says "now play nice kids" 

Bert wanders in looking somewhat lost. 

Shutter Waves 

Morris says "This meeting will be discussing the chargen system, but 
  will not be talking aout magic." 

Revver has a question already. 

Meg raises her hand, too. 

Morris says "Yes?" 

Revver says "We talking about what needs to be changed on PCs for SR3, 
  or what? If we're not, why we talking about CG?" 
Revver says "Ignore the back English." 

Theo says "Only for chargen, NOT how we're going to impliement on 
  existing chars." 

Revver says "So, we talking about CG for new PCs?" 

Morris says "Ok, all we are doing is looking at the rules as printed in 
  SR3 and taking our experience with implementing SR2 in a MUX 
  environment and trying to prevent having to make up 6 million house 
  rules later to cover things the SR3 designers did whne they created a 
  game for the TT." 

Theo says "We're talking about what rules/whatever from SR3 we'll be 
  using." 
Theo says "Not magic magic or matrix (right Morris?)" 

Revver says "Rigging?" 

Amber changes one of those magics to combat. 

Morris says "Thats right Theo, and not the combat system either." 

Meg says "Rigging hasn't changed really." 

Amber says "Just chargen, just chargen." 

Shepard says "to Revver, Yep that would be SR3 of PCS in CG. LNMOP..." 

Weaver likes the opposed stealth rule. Don't know how to implement it 
  though. 

Wildcat says "Are we converting the playerbase at the same time?" 

Lawson says "I can share with you all what 5 or so years of making 
  characters combat effective sees in the sr3 system, where I see easily 
  exploiable breakdowns. That's my strong suit, and I ave notes prepped 
  on just that subject." 

Kristin sobs 

Revver says "Ok, you gonna state a rule and and we comment ni time, 
  Morris?" 

Morris says "For now just chargen, we will also be covering skills, but 
  that may have to be a later meeting." 

Shutter says "So what is the first obvious problem for characters in CG 
  as posed by SR3?" 

Morris nods to Larson, "I dont however want this to be a stream of 
  concoiusness meeting, nothing will get done." 

Onigoroshi says "The priorities system in SR3 makes for a slighly 
  inbalanced player base..." 

Lawson says "They broke some skills down into several sub skills, but 
  not others. And it's clearly designed to hamper the muscle type 
  characters." 

GridIron says "I would say the more meta thing" 

Lawson says "ANd yes" 
Lawson says "The dwarf now rules all it surveys, with trolls a close 
  second." 

Ento arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris hold on. 

Meg offers Morris a gavel. 

Morris swings it around wildly., 

Meg dropped Gavel. 

Amber says "First section of chargen rules deals with priorities." 

Meg says "enjoy. I'll @destroy it later." 

Morris says "Ok, I am here to keep things orderly. Amber will be 
  announcing the sections we are looking at." 

Taken. 

Amber says "Everyone has a copy and can see the chart? Master Character 
  Creation Table pg 54 (top)?" 

Morris says "One final thing, I am logging, so I will be able to review 
  everything." 

Meg nods 

Wildcat nods. 

Revver says "ok" 

Morris says "Ok, and finally again, page me when you want to make a 
  comment and I'll announce the order." 

Amber says "Ok, there are differences in both that and sr2 and what is 
  implimented here for sr2. Probably the first area of discussion. And 
  to make it even more simple. Let's start it off with a discussion ont 
  he first category of that chart. Race." 

Morris says "OkWeaver" 

Weaver ahems, "I don't see a problem with the priorities in general... I 
  see the monsters that can be creaetd, but all characters are 
  reviewed... if the trolls/dwarves get out of hand, shut down the race 
  till it calms down, like the mages." 

Morris says "Next is Wildcat, Meg." 

Wildcat thinks having limited Meta apps might be the best idea, as much 
  as I hate to admit it... 

Ento pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Morris says "Meg, Gridiron, Oni, Theo, Shanghai" 

Meg says "This is more a question, but... I don't know how many of you 
  noticed, but racial mods for Dwarves and Trolls changed from SR2 to 
  SR3... unless the errata fixes that... we should also be considering 
  that here, too." 

Morris says "Yes, does the priority match the 'value' of the race." 
Morris says "Grid, Oni, Theo, Shanghai" 

Shepard pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

GridIron says "My thought on the Prioritys is: If we keep them the same 
  everyone who picked race as A before might feel cheated" 

Morris says "Lets not worry about implementing it yet, does it make 
  sense from a rules point of view." 
Morris says "Oni, Theo, Shanghai, Lawson" 

Onigoroshi says "THe problem I see with the low priorities for metas, is 
  the higher chances of meta mages, rich metas, and highly educated 
  metas (High skill priorities). Since the meta percentage of the 
  populus is reletively low, then the chance of those metas getting 
  magics, or lotsa money are lower. It seems to me that the metas outta 
  chargen would be overly rich, or otherwise unbalanced..." 

Morris says "Theo, Shanghai, Lawson, Kristin, Meg" 

Theo says "I think that all races are somewhat restricted and I think 
  metas have a very low percentage. I've seen very few of them around. 
  Esp dwarves. As to having richer or mage-metas? I don't see ANY of 
  those now (except AFTER) chargen. But I'm no expert either." 

Shanghai says "Well, does it skew the metas from a beginning character 
  POV, definately, but IMO the Karma Pool rules take back whatever other 
  advantages are gained....and if you use the Racial Attribute Limit 
  table on pg. 245, a human can have some pretty huge physical stats 
  (9s) with enough karma investment eventually as well." 

Morris says "Lawson, Kristin, Meg" 

Lawson says "This is gonna be a tad long, sorry all. What I am saying 
  here is purely froma game rules design point of view. Meg is right, 
  the new priorities are different AND so are the stas for metas. They 
  have removed some of the major balancing factors to both trolls and 
  dwarves. Dwarves, much like the armor jacket, are clearly better than 
  everyone else, and therefore the effective thing to be. Now, I don't 
  advocate major rules changes. I think making all metas a c would be 
  fine. No quota limit, no major house rules. Just make them all a c, 
  and review each char intelligently before sending them IC." 

Eldritch arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris says "Kristin, Meg, Revver" 

Kristin says "(A) PCs as a whole are unique individuals, and thus, we 
  SHOULD see more rich, cybered, or the like. In fact, this is the one 
  place that they would be common, the shadows. (B) As far as a by the 
  points breakdown, dwarves could be argued to be on the same tier with 
  Trolls/Elves, as they have little in the way of disadvantages. (C) We 
  ahve always goverened the number of meta characters in the game, and i 
  see no reason why this would alter in the future. The numbers are low 
  here because metas have always gotten the short sticky end of the 
  stick." 

Morris says "Meg, Revver" 

Meg says "Ok... as far as rich metas etc, go... I don't really think you 
  can take that kind of 'the meta percentage is lower, so...' outlook... 
  look at orks. Orks don't live as long, so mebbe they can't get 
  terribly rich... but they inherit... and they do one thing, hands 
  down, better than any other race... they breed. They breed a lot. SR3 
  doesn't have hard data on the races, just essays by race members... 
  but SR and SR2 told us that orks have like, 2-6 kids at a shot... 
  that's gonna increase their numbers fast, and so, the percentage we 
  see here ICly might well be the lucky few... other rationalizations 
  can be taken for each of the other races as well... as far as dwarves 
  being clearly better... well... mebbe, but they're still the most blah 
  race this side of humanity to play... they weren't exactly crippled 
  under SR2, but no-body played 'em. ;)" 

Revver says "From the point of view of a Dwarf, I would like to say 
  this: First, adding back the -1 Quickness might be a good idea, maybe 
  not. Sure, dwarves get better in SR3, but you're forgetting that there 
  is IC racism, which has to be reflected in the RPAs' reading of the 
  apps. Plus, it costs money to convert every single piece of equipment 
  you have so you can use it. Same with the Trolls. Normal bredder crud 
  don't fit us. I personally like the changes, since if you have a 
  dwarf, you're prolly be a mage, rigger or decker. Sammies are better 
  as orks or Trolls. But if yer a rigger, decker or mage, then SR3 split 
  up yer skills, so you need the increased skill pts to compensate." 

Mike arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris says "Lawson." 

Shutter thinks that everyone has a good point. And doesn't know why he 
  is not showing as being here when in fact he is. 

Lawson says "Sure, there are IC things that go with being any race, or 
  any style of character. What I was saying was merely that the stats 
  behind dwarf do not warrant it being a D priority. They are very 
  effective. So are trolls, Trolls should probably be higher than c. But 
  to avoid massive changes, I submit a nice, simple, flat, rating C for 
  metas and we all play on." 

Morris says "Ok, I agree with Shutter that some really good points were 
  brought up. Amber, lets move on." 

Amber says "Ok, next is the magic column and it's change in priorities." 
Amber says "its too" 

Revver thought we avoided Magic 

Amber says "We can. Though this section was not covered in the magic 
  meetings. No biggie. Major changes there." 
Amber says "Ok, next section is attributes." 

Morris says "Yes, I think this was covered by their meeting. I will 
  however give anyone the opportunity to talk as to how this may effect 
  making a PC, not how it may make mages more powerful." 

Amber backs up to Magic. 

Morris says "It wasnt, damn them. Ok, Meg." 

Amber says "easy enough for us to go back and cover if need be. We 
  basically had no objections with it." 

Morris says "Meg has a comment." 

Meg says "I just wanna say that the change in priorities is obviously 
  necessary if the Race Priority changes are kept. Hard to have an elven 
  physad if you need C in both... as far as the Force Points being more 
  fixed... I dunno if I like the 'buy more FP with cash!' but it does 
  make some sense IF the cash amounts are kept as is... otherwise, the 
  cost of additional FP would have to be addressed.... I -do- like that 
  the aspected mages are better, in their focus, than full magicians... 
  that's something they've been claiming since Grimoire I... but that's 
  all I've got to say." 

Morris says "Me, Kristin." 
Morris says "We normally keep a tight reign on mages, so in most cases a 
  PC is going to put E for Magic. Its really up to the Magic department 
  to approve the magic based PCs." 
Morris says "Kristin, Amber." 

Kristin says "Magic was left understandibly a little hazily defined in 
  the overall scheme of things, as FASA anticipates releasing "Magic in 
  the Shadows" sometime before the turn of the century. As for the rest, 
  they have cleaned out a good deal of the obvious holes they left in 
  the first 2 versions, and hopefully the new sourcebook will address 
  the rest. As it stands, the current SR3 base rules are more than 
  adequate for chargen needs." 

Amber says "Just pointing out, C is not used in SR for anything to do 
  with magic. Just A & B. Spell points are 25 for full mages, 35 for 
  aspects, 0 for adepts. They are bought at 25,000 per point, max of 50 
  for all mages." 
Amber says "SR = SR3" 

Morris says "Ok, mving right along." 

Amber says "Next is Attributes." 
Amber says "Moving on?" 
Amber says "After Attributes and the racial modification table is...." 

Morris says "Ok, no comments on the values assigned to the attributes." 

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database... 

...Database saved, play on. 

Revver says "Next" 

Amber says "Skills. Specifically Types of skills." 

Morris says "Lawson, Oni" 

Shutter says "As an example Amber, What do you see as a specific type of 
  skill that might be a point of contention?" 
Shutter says "I guess I field that question to the floor." 

Lawson says "Ok, I know already this will draw a lot of other comments 
  and that's ok. I really, with all my heart and soul, believe that the 
  sr3 method of using concentrations is silly, but it's the rules so ok, 
  I can live with it. Now that said, the skills shoul _all_ be broken 
  down into concetrations. Computer for example should become at least 
  hardware ad software. As is, some skills remain a catch all, and 
  others get splintered 5 ways from Sunday. IMHO, that's not good game 
  design." 

Hiroo arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Onigoroshi says "SR3 etiquette system is horrible for a mux type 
  enviroment. +info is worthless, channels eligibility is gone, and 
  basically it takes away the ability to make a char that moves in more 
  than one circle. Thats what I took it as anyhow..." 
Onigoroshi says "But the firearms breakup is good!" 

Morris says "Meg, Shanghai, Eldritch" 
Morris says "Meg, Shanghai, Eldritch, Kristin, Wildcat" 

Meg says "My comment is really just a 'something to be aware of'... SR3 
  talks about Read/Write skills being lax because everything is 
  iconography.... it's VERY hard to teach any hard sciences, or even any 
  advanced math or linquistics w/out reading and writing in your native 
  language... I think the read/write ratings should be at speech levels, 
  not at half." 

Shanghai says "The way skills are done means that street sams are now 
  just as karma-intensive as magicians... They need 6 skills now... 5 
  different Firearms skills, and Unarmed Combat. That's a lot better 
  than just Firearms and Unarmed Combat IMO....realistic? maybe not, but 
  neither is Hellblast. And you don't HAVE to get all the skills, you 
  can always default to one of your other skills which I like. Breaking 
  all the skills like Lawson suggests *might* confuse people coming to 
  the Mux though. And while I'm rolling, I dislike the ettiquette skill 
  too. And I have issues with Stealth as well....it will wrap in 
  disguise and some other none 'Stealth'-like things if let stand as 
  is." 

Morris says "Eldritch, Kristin, Wildcat" 

Onigoroshi applauds softly. 

Eldritch grumps, because Shanghai stole his comment, but repeats it 
  anyway, "I don't see there being any real problem with the new 
  breakdown in skills. The only character type it really affects is the 
  violence-for-hire type, which (by virtue of the breakdown of the 
  firearms skill) is now just as karma intensive as all of the other 
  character types... As far as etiquette, well, the purpose of etiquette 
  has changed. What we now use etiquette for is in SR3 covered by the 
  numerous and sundry Background Knowledge skills. As for Read/Write... 
  If your character is really smart enough to learn hard sciences or 
  math, he is also smart enough to use his Intelligence*1.5 points of 
  language skills to buy fluency in his native tongue, and full literacy 
  as well." 

Kristin says "With all due respect, +info and channels can be adjusted 
  to fit in with the new paradigm. It is a matter of changing some 
  attributes on a bit of code. The breakdown of the social skills 
  allows, IMVHO, a richer, more diverse character. the active skills 
  were broken down to prevent folks from becoming Gods with every known 
  item simply with a few skills. While i can understand the concern with 
  the technical skills, and Stealth has long been the workhorse of the 
  "theiving" skills. These COULD be broken down, if there was some need 
  felt. To work off what shanghai said, the further we go away from the 
  base rules, the more confused the player and/or staff base becomes." 

Morris says "Wildcat, Lawson" 

Wildcat says "Knowledge skills are way too general as presented in the 
  book. We either need an exhaustive list of valid skills or need to 
  allow some customization in CG with approval at the far end of the app 
  process (i.e. choosing the skill by area -- Street, Sixth World, 
  yaddayadda -- as many times as you have skills in the areas, with 
  proper points assigned, then a blank to fill in). Germany ported them 
  a little too directly from the book and the points were more or less 
  wasted. A valid skill not in the book, like, oh, I don't know, say, 
  Seattle Shadowrunner Teams, wasn't available for PCs in CG there." 

Cyman arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris says "Lawson, Shanghai, Kristin" 

Lawson says "Even if you don't think a lot of street muscle or hired 
  guns, they are still out there and they still care about their 
  characters. It's not easy to Rp well, but it is easy to rp poorly. I 
  accept having to sped karma like mad, and this new system, I simply 
  feel that hammering one character type, and leaving it relatively easy 
  for another isn't fair. That is why I would like to see skills broken 
  down all across the board. I don't wanna make my life easier, I just 
  wanna make everyone's road the same. Mages already have it tough. And 
  that's pretty much all I have to say on it." 

Shanghai says "To comment on Wildcat's comment.....An exhaustive list 
  makes me tired to think about....however any skill you wanted could be 
  added by an RPA at final approval as the current system stands...no 
  new code needed." 

Kristin says "Knowskills can be set up to accept virtually anything, if 
  needs be. or an admin can change whatever needs to be, much as we can 
  do today. The code shouldnt be any sort of constraint on the character 
  as long as the bg allows the skills." 

<<ADMIN>> Meg says, "but that's getting into implementation and code, 
  and that's not this meeting, remember?" 

Cyman pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Meg says "Lawson, what makes you think current rules don't already 
  present other character types with as many skills as you're looking 
  at?" 

Morris says "In this case we can talk about it only in that it can be 
  done. One valid isuue is do we want to create a list or have it have 
  be entered and then approved before IC." 

Hiroo pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Meg says "Have the PC enter it. it's more flexible and less code 
  bloating." 

Morris says ""Wilcat, Weaver" 

Wildcat says "The only reason I suggested hard coding the categories and 
  allowing the PC to fill in the blank is that it takes work off the 
  hands of the RPAs who deal with the apps at that stage." 
Wildcat says "But anyhoo, that's code. And I'll be quiet. :)" 

Weaver says "At the same time, the RPAs would have to insure that the 
  knowskills weren't too broad or too unbalanced..." 

Wildcat nods and agrees. 

Morris says "Ok, lets get moving, I do plan on covering specific skills 
  later." 

Amber says "Next would be... Resources...." 
Amber says "Which includes Gear, Cyberware, Contacts, and Lifestyle, I 
  believe." 

Mike tips his hat. "'Scuse me - turns out I'm a little busy, and as I 
  have few opinions on SR3, I'll leave you all to it :)" 
Mike pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Revver thinks SR3 did a bda job with gear. 

Morris says "Without getting into implementation, what are opinions on 
  the values asscoiated with the priorities." 

Revver oopsies. 

Father Nate arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 
Father Nate pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Morris says "Kristin" 

Kristin says "i think first we must determine if we are going to 
  continue scaling back the resources?" 

Morris says "Yes we do. I'm not going to answer that now, but thats 
  obviously what my comments was seeking comments concerning." 
Morris says "Edritch, Shanghai, Amber, Meg" 

Eldritch says "Resource values are fine as is. I think they should be 
  left alone, but with a special BG review process for A priority 
  resources, just like for magicians and deckers." 

Onigoroshi says "; couldnt imagine a brand new characters need for 
  priority A resources..." 

Morris says "Shanghai, Amber, Meg" 

Onigoroshi acks. 

Shanghai says "I second Eldritch" 
Shanghai says "Riggers need resources...in my experience" 

Amber says "I think the table as it stands in SR3 is good, including 
  resources. It may go a bit of a way to giving the Sammie his edge back 
  if he decides to head in the direction of cyberware via resources (ok, 
  so there is no other way to get cyber in chargen :P), and hopefully 
  round out the character a bit in their choice of cyberware , having 
  more to spend. All of it subject to final approval in any case. Matrix 
  and Riggers come to mind as also needing lotsa money at times <Yeah, 
  what Shanghai said.>" 

Meg says "I don't see a problem with the resources as their listed in 
  the chart.... I also don't see any reason to force A priority 
  resources to undergo a special reivew process... I was under the 
  impression ALL BG's underwent review, and if you tried to get 
  something in CG that conflicted w/the BG you'd app'd you'd be refused. 
  So why have -another- review just to see if your BG (which was 
  reviewed) justified your priorities (which were also reviewed)... it's 
  silly." 

Todai arrives in the Meeting Room from the OOC Nexus. 

Morris says "Ok. Moving along." 

Amber says "The last section is Finishing Touches." 
Amber says "Dice Pools, Karma, Starting Nuyen, etc." 

Morris says "Eldritch" 

Eldritch says "I think that the change in how Karma pools are handled 
  can go either way. It really depends on your philosophy, but I see it 
  as being a bad thing. It flattens out the edge of experience, by 
  limiting the amount of a person's luck or however you like to think of 
  KP. I really dislike the idea that humans are twice as lucky (or 
  whatever) as metas, but only up to a certain point. Sure, a more 
  experienced character might have more skills, or higher ratings, but 
  that all becomes immaterial when someone with possibly as much as 
  1/3rd less career karma has the same sized pool. I like the way we 
  handle KP now. The staggered pool works just fine." 

Shanghai says "Second Eldritch" 

Lawson says "Third Eldritch" 

Morris says "Gridiron" 

GridIron says "but if you look at it the other way... if Meta start with 
  the "Race goodies" this is just a way humans catch up so if we limit 
  the Race goodies per sey then this to will change" 

Morris says "Meg" 

Meg says "Well... kinda second Gridiron... meta's lose the KP to pay for 
  the reduced Priority cost... so in effect, the KP is paying off for 
  the extra skills, or money, or stats, or what have you... that you 
  got." 

Morris says "Eldritch" 

Meg says "As someone who's playing a meta, I can say I've got no probs 
  w/losing some KP... if I need to use it all, I'm screwed." 

Eldritch says "The KP thing isn't an effective way of handling that, 
  because they're only penalized up to a point. After they've got so 
  much karma that their pool stops growing though, the "paying for the 
  starting goodies" is gone. Yeah, that's a lot of Karma, but there has 
  to be a better way of making metas pay for the attribute bonuses, and 
  vision mods." 

Onigoroshi pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Morris says "Meg" 

Meg says "Ok, Eldritch... how much is fair for 3 points of stats and a 
  vision mod?" 

Morris says "Eldritch, Amber, Gridiron" 

Lawson pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Eldritch says "Trolls get 5 extra attribute points (if you count the 
  dermal armor, which I can't see why you wouldn't), thermo vision, and 
  a point of reach. That's the best deal of any of the metas, but it 
  still isn't that great, since it's balanced with lower maxes for a few 
  attributes. Having to earn 200 career karma to get a lousy 10 KP seems 
  like a bit of an extreme cost for balancing that. I would lean more 
  toward a percentage reduction to their Resources (to reflect them 
  paying more for oddly sized/shaped goods), and let them earn KP just 
  like anyone else." 

Amber says "In re to Finishing Touches. Dice pools. Just to point out 
  changes (how we handled it in the magic meeting)... Spell (used to be 
  Magic) Pool is calculated differently, and the addition of an Astral 
  Pool (which used to be limited to Initiates). Going back to resources. 
  Purchases are limited to Rating <6 and Avail of <8. At no SI index 
  when you purchase in chargen. In re to Karma Pools. It's probably the 
  single most important aspect of this game." 

Morris says "Gridiron, Meg" 

GridIron says "Eld has a good point I can see the Cash shave and maybe a 
  smaller KP cut like 3/2 or 5/4. but while we are on Meta things, what 
  is the ruling about alergies are they still only for meta?" 

Morris says "That is the current rules." 
Morris says "Meg." 

Meg says "Eldritch, you said: "The KP thing isn't an effective way of 
  handling that, because they're only penalized up to a point." But then 
  said: "Having to earn 200 career karma to get a lousy 10 KP seems like 
  a bit of an extreme cost for balancing that."... make up your mind. Do 
  you want harsher penalties, or lesser?" 

Eldritch apologizes for bowing out, but has to call it a night 
Eldritch pops back out to the OOC nexus. 

Morris says "Ok, lets not get personal here. Are there any other issues 
  especially related to the points Amber brought up in finishing 
  touches?" 

Kristin says "Contacts" 

Morris nods to Kristin. 

Kristin says "That is to say, will the mux be adopting a more structured 
  Contact System ala SR3, or....?" 

Morris says "I dont know that. Are there any problems with the contact 
  system in SR3 that would prevent it from working?" 
Morris says "Kristin." 

Kristin says "other than some minor work that an Admin might do, wrt set 
  NPCs, players could also be introduced into the ladder that is the 
  main structure of the SR3 Contact System. I know several years back 
  players in chargen here could buy a current PC as a contact, and this 
  seemed to work well in many cases. I see this as being a valuable 
  resource for a beginning character, more so than karma pools. This is 
  a game of who you know, and Contacts are often the lifeblood of any 
  good information system" 

Amber nods and gives out player names if I get approval from both 
  parties on contacts. "It helps them out a lot and generates RP." 

Morris nods, "I believe that system didnt work out for reasons other 
  than how valuable it was. 

Shanghai says "Second Kristin" 

Morris says "Gridiron" 

GridIron says "on the PC contacts I like the Idea, I even found the 
  thing to sign up (not working)" 

Morris says "Ok, anything else?" 
Morris says "Otherwise I'm going to call this over." 

Weaver opens a can of tuna and sets it on the floor. 

Meg says "Just gimme back my gavel ;)" 

Morris says "Ok, thanks for all the input, I'd like to think this went
