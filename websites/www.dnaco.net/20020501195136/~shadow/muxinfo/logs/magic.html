<TITLE>SR3 Conversion Meeting - Magic Part 1</TITLE>
<BODY>
<PRE>

Log file from Shadowrun.

Goldeyes has arrived.

You say "Who are we missing?"

Amber says "Lisa. About to grab her."

Lisa Cooper has arrived.

Goldeyes says "Hello roy, how areyou doing? Liz! :)"

Roy waves

You say "Ok, I'd like to welcome you all to the SR3 Magic Conference and thank
  you all for putting the time in to be here (Especially Lisa since I know it's
  late for her)."

Hjal thinks maybe it's early for her instead :)

Bert grins

Lisa Cooper nods to Hjal :)

Goldeyes pats Liz, for bein a trooper

You say "I don't have a set agenda unfortunaely due to RL constraints, but I
  don't want to go about this haphazardly either. Do all of you have a copy of
  SR3?"

Roy says "Yep"

Amber nods.

Lisa Cooper has

Hjal has as well.

Goldeyes does not unfortunately.

You say "Ok, leave Goldeyes."

Bert grins, "JK"

Goldeyes sniffles

You say "What do you think about this...Going through each section of the Magic
  Section, in order, and discussing their ramifications on the MUX."

Hjal says "Okie"

Lisa Cooper would also add the magic-related parts of chargen to that list

Hjal says "Quick question first tho.."

You say "Actually, Chargen is going to be discussed, as a whole, by the
  Logistics team"

Bert nods to Hjal.

Hjal says "Is the general plan to integrate everything except that which we
  designate, or integrate only what we designate?"

[Suspect] Todai has connected.

Roy says "Probably what we decide to adopt, but it can't be a static list from
  tonight on"

Amber says "Well in that case, how about we start with one thing that's not in
  SR III that is in SR II?"

Roy says "I bet I can guess what that is"

You say "Well, we're going for the simplest solution possible without screwing
  the MUX or the players. The simplest solution overall would be to accept all
  of SR3 as canon and be done with it. However, I don't think that's in the
  best interests of the players or the MUX. So, we'll accept as much of SR3 as
  we can, and the parts that pose concerns, we can modify"

You say "Hold on guys"

You say "I thought we decided to go with each secion of the Magic chapter in
  order?"

RPMeeting Room(#34136RIh)

  simple white board for people to write on with some colored pens on the base
  of the board.

Roy(#23403PXUc)

Amber(#38896PXOUZci)

Hjal(#49424PXOUZci)

Obvious exits:

Out &LTO&GT


Amber says "Right, except this section isn't in SR III."

Lisa Cooper agrees with Bert then and also suggest we should have something to
  prevent us all to talk in once :) what was it that they had to hold in order
  to speak in lord of the flies? :)

Hjal whispers to Lisa, raising your hand and waiting to be called on would
  prolly work swell :)

You say "That usually works.:)"

You say "Ok."

&LTOOC&GT Goldeyes says, "it wa a conch"

&LTOOC&GT Goldeyes says, "a fancy shell"

You say "Page 158-160 starts off the chapter by defining magic and it's
  different aspects."

Hjal would like to add something.

You say "We no longer have adepts (excpt physical). all others are 'aspected
  magicians'"

You say "Go Hjal"

Hjal says "They also changed the definition of 'Awakened'. It means what the
  Sr2 term 'magician' means."

Hjal says "And now 'magician' means a non-physad magician :)"

Goldeyes says "what about physical mages? :)"

Goldeyes:P

You say "Actually."

You say "Not to get bogged down in semantics, but the book mentions
  non-magicians (phys ads) as being 'awakened' as well."

Hjal nods. "They're awakened, but not magicians.

You say "Separates Awakened characters into magicians and Adepts"

Bert nods

You say "Ok...Let's move on.:)"

Hjal says "But mundane metas are no longer 'awakened' apparently"

Hjal says "it's important to me :)"

Hjal is done tho. :)

You say "We no longer have adepts (excpt physical). All others are 'aspected
  magicians'."

Goldeyes says "Or aspected shamans i assume?"

Goldeyes says "Although a medicine man doesn't view the world quite the same"

Roy says "Let's not get into all that..there are full magicians, and aspected
  magicians. Period."

Goldeyes says "For instance from a shamans view, if you see astrally you can be
  a "medicine man." the nan has plenty of spirit way physads of this type"

You say "All Aspected magicians (Hermetic or Shaman) have the capacity to
  Astrally Perceive but not project"

Goldeyes says "I see."

Goldeyes says "This is a new situation"

Bert nods

Goldeyes says "I expect this could injure the way some aspected types operate"

Goldeyes says "But it makes sense"

You say "They also can bond and use any foci which aid the skills they use."

Goldeyes says "Finally balances with the astral adepts..."

Goldeyes says "An Aspected Astral magician? (correct term?) can bond foci as
  well I assume right?"

Roy says "No more Astral Adepts"

You say "The book then talks about Drain, which is ssentially the same from SR2"

Goldeyes wows

Goldeyes says "they got rid of astral adepts? that sucks. Ok go on. btw if we
  have any pc astral adepts... i'd keep them, as an anomaly or something. It
  would seem rather unfair to dump them."

Hjal says "They might give rules for them in Magic in the Shadows... this is
  after all the basic rulebook"

Goldeyes nods

Goldeyes says "I assume there are sorcery, enchanting and conjuring adepts?"

Roy says "No enchanting adepts as of yet"

Goldeyes nods

Lisa Cooper says "aspected magicians, not adapts :)"

You say "Those are Aspected Magicians, Goldeyes"

Hjal says "There are also Elementalist Aspected Magicians"

You say "anyway, to move forward"

Goldeyes says "I'm using sr2 terms to make sure i say it properly"

Lisa Cooper says "and Shamanist"

Hjal smiles to Bert :)

You say "The book then talks about Drain, which is ssentially the same from
  SR2. And goes into Noticing magic. Anyone have anyhing to add about these
  rules?"

Hjal says "Not sure about something off the top of my head.."

Lisa Cooper thinks you skipped over Exclusive stuff, which is important to
  discuss, imo

Hjal says "Sr3 says drain from spells while projecting is always physical,
  which I don't remember from Sr2"

Roy says "It was Hjal"

Bert flips back.

You say "I did. Excuse me."

Hjal says "Okies to Roy, and smokes more crack."

You say "Lisa, you have something to add about exclusivity of magic?"

Huh?  (Type "help" for help.)

Huh?  (Type "help" for help.)

Lisa Cooper nods. a little. exclusive stuff are a little more restricting now
  than in SR-II, especially since spell defence is added

Roy says "Only Spell Defence for others"

Goldeyes says "As in, if a spell is exclusive, you can not use dice to defend?"

Lisa Cooper says "if you're casting an exclusive spell"

Hjal says "For Goldeyes' benefit, I'll list the exclusive actions"

Hjal says "Sorcery: Casting Exclusive spell 

 Casting a spell for a sustaining focus 



 Conjuring: Summoning 

 Calling Elementals 

 Controlling 

 Banishing 



 Other: Engaging or ending Astral projection"

Lisa Cooper says "Or in the state of being projected, I think"

Roy says "That can't be exclusive"

Roy says "You wouldn't be able to cast spells"

Hjal says "You could cast an exclusive spell while projecting, you just can't
  sustain it past returning to your body"

Lisa Cooper says "err.. no, it's not exclusive, sorry. but you can't cast
  exclusive spells while doint it"

Roy says "I would think you could cast exclusive spells while projecting"

Amber says "You can't engage in any exclusive actions while astrally
  projecting, right."

Lisa Cooper quotes: "Remining is astral form requires no effort, but is
  considered a magical activity and so procludes any Exclusive Actions while
  you are astrally projecting"

Hjal looks to Bert. "Tie breaker? :)

Lisa Cooper says "p 172"

Roy nods

You say "Think of the bridge to astral space as a door."

You say "You can't sustain a spell through the door."

Amber says "Exclusive Actions: Some acts of magic are considered Exclusive.
  These feats require great concentration and cannot be performed while using
  any other magical skill or maintaining any other magical ability."

Hjal says "Ah. Lisa is right."

Roy says "Yeah, she is"

Goldeyes says "So one can not banish when astral eh?"

Hjal says "yep"

Hjal says "both are exclusive"

Amber says "Just the Banishing is exclusive."

Lisa Cooper says "you can't even banish while precieving"

Goldeyes says "Gotcha, ok thats no big deal"

Amber says "A spirit/elemental needs to manifest to get banished now."

[StaffChat] Shane connects with his band of Royal Canadian Mounted Police

Goldeyes says "I like that rule"

Goldeyes says "Astral combat is cool"

Goldeyes rummages through his Pelt Backpack.

Shane has arrived.

Shane goes home.

Shane has left.

Hjal says "I think we're ready for next topic?"

You say "Are we done with exclusivity?"

Amber says "Let me check something first."

Lisa Cooper says "well... you'll need to decide what to do with PCs with
  exclusive spells, since they are much more problematic now"

Roynods

Goldeyes says "once the spell is a spell lock tho its not a problem neh?"

Lisa Cooper says "people may wanna drop them, or take them instead at higer
  levels (withoug exclusivity)"

Lisa Cooper says "no spell locks :)"

Roy says "There are no more spell locks"

Hjal likes the 'too bad so sad' approach.. it's not like they can't use them..
  just new rules on when. :)

You say "You mean we should give them a choice as to whether they want to keep
  the spell exclusive?"

Goldeyes acks!

Roy says "Yes"

Goldeyes says "No spell locks!"

Bert looks at Roy

Hjal nudges Amber. "That section isn't for a while yet ;)

Lisa Cooper says "no... but substaning foci's are way cooler :)"

Amber says "I'm not sure if shifting your perception is a sustained magical
  activity."

Bert looks at his book and the current topic.:)

Hjal ers, and nudges Roy. "Whoever brought up spell locks :)

Lisa Cooper says "it's not, but you're talking about banishing while
  perceiving? it says so specifically in the banishing section"

Roy says "I didn't"

Goldeyes says "So I couldn't use my sustaining focus while astral?"

Goldeyes rummages through his pouch.

Goldeyes rummages through his Pelt Backpack.

You say "You mean we should give them a choice as to whether they want to keep
  the spell exclusive?"

Roy says "Yes"

Hjal doesn't agree.

Roy says "I'm not suprised :)"

You say "Let hear both case."

Hjal raspberries Roy.

You say "Let hear both cases too."

Lisa Cooper says "also.. notice that a 4(6) exclusive spells now becomes a F6
  exclusive spell with reduced drain"

Roy says "You can't change the rules out of the blue and not allow for PCs to
  adjust. If you made wired reflexes suddenly half, or even less effective,
  you'd have to allow people to get money back or something"

Amber says "The choice will be mute."

Goldeyes says "Well they've already ruined wired reflexes, but thats a
  different story"

Roy says "What if a spell is used in certain situation, but now it can't be
  used that way? Would the PC have learned it in the first place?"

Goldeyes says "Roy does have a point"

Amber says "That will be mute too."

Roy says "Mute?"

You say "Moot.:)"

Amber says "Yeah, moot. :)"

Roy says "Oh. Not sure I follow that :)"

Goldeyes says "When the purpose of a spell changes, oh heh heh i was wondering
  what you were talking mute about :)"

Amber says "That's a different topic. How to implement the changes."

Hjal says "Everyone knew taking limited spells was going to be less useful than
  not. If you wanted to be able to use the spell all the time, shouldn't have
  taken it with a limitation :] Also..."

Roy says "That is true, this is more of an implementation problem"

Lisa Cooper says "I know I couldn't cast an exclusive spell while invisible,
  for example, but I also knew I could still cast it while projecting"

Hjal says "implementing Sr3 is gonna mean the entire playerbase is going to
  need to do alot of converting, and keeping the changes made to a minimum I'd
  think would be a high priority."

You say "This is a point I'll pass on to the Logistics team, ok? :)"

Goldeyes says "You can't be invisible in the astral... thats a metamagical
  premise if anything"

Roy says "I don't think so Hjal..if you start thinking like that, then nobody
  will want to switch :)"

Lisa Cooper wasn't talking about that, Goldie

Hjal says "if we do let ppl un-limit their spells, we gonna make them pay the
  karma for the force they gain?"

You say "This is a point I'll pass on to the Logistics team, ok? :)"

Roy says "Who is the Logistics team anyway?"

You say "Morris, Tracy, a few RPA's, and a few Players"

Roy would like to know who exactly is on it :)

Lisa Cooper says "so this team is basically powerless? :)"

You say "Don't know, Roy..Sorry"

You say "Hell no."

Roy says "I can wait"

You say "We just aren't here to talk about chargen."

You say "We're here to talk about the Magic rules"

Lisa Cooper says "and my that you mean anything that effects a PCs sheet?"

Amber says "Or how to convert. We're interested in the magic rules."

Lisa Cooper says "my=by"

You say "Lisa, everythings effects a character's +sheet"

You say "Lisa, everything effects a character's +sheet"

Roy says "I'm interested in it all, and who can change what we come up with
  tonight especially :)"

Lisa Cooper says "I know... so I don't really get what falls into "chargen"
  then"

You say "Chargen=Conversion & New Players."

You say "That isn't what we're here to talk about."

Lisa Cooper says "well.. since you said everything effects a players +sheet,
  everything counts as converstion, no?"

Goldeyes says "Metamagic is an obvious big hole in this debate until the new
  book comes out. I'll get magic in the shadows and sr3 at the same time i
  suspect"

Bert sighs

Amber says "We want to discuss the implmentation of magic rules. Which ones to
  use, which ones not to, and which ones to modify."

Amber says "Not how to do it."

Amber says "The other teams gets the headache of figuring out how to do what's
  decided."

You say "Not how to convert the current character's +heets"

Lisa Cooper nods, okey... although I think magic related changes to the PCs
  should also be brought up here. but it's your meeting

You say "Thanks for giving the meeting back to us, Lisa.:)"

You say "Ok. Now that we're clear that we are not going to talk about the HOW's
  of converting +sheets, can e move on?"

Goldeyes says "Sure what is the next issue?"

You say "We have plenty of ground to cover tonight. Let's move on"

You say "The book then talks about Drain, which is essentially the same from
  SR2. And goes into Noticing magic. Anyone have anything to add about these
  rules?"

Hjal says "One small thing"

[Admin] Shane says, "Hjal.. when you have time I need to talk to you please :)"

Hjal says "The formula for calculating the TN is different, but shouldn't be a
  problem for anything"

Amber says "No, I like those fine."

[Admin] Shane says, "Seeing as your the top ranking magic person I know ;)"

Roy says "Note drain for a spell while sustaining another spell is at +2 TN"

You say "Formula for noticing magic?"

Hjal says "Actually, never mind. Rules wise, nothing is different that I could
  see. Just a piddly change in the tn calculation"

Roy says "We will need guildlines for what causes a shamanic mask to be visible"

Goldeyes says "Ah that is new isn't it roy?"

Lisa Cooper says "the shamanic mask was also in SR-II"

Roy says "Yeah, but there were never any real guidelines for it"

Roy says "It probably will never matter, but just so we're aware I brought it
  up"

Lisa Cooper says "SR-III has nothing new along these lines... but are we in
  that section yet?"

You say "Do we ned to add guidelines?"

You say "Need rather"

Lisa Cooper thinks it's a RP thing

Amber says "Simple? When magical skills are used, it's a flavor thing. RP it?"

Lisa Cooper says "I think you maybe need guildlines for the entire shamanic
  people :) too many of them are playing shamans as if they're hermetics"

Roy says "Yep"

You say "Taking notes, Magic Staff? :)"

Hjal smiles sweetly.

Amber was hoping Shamans knew how to play shamans.

Goldeyes still t hinks that shamanic spells can be chipped at least some of
  them. The shaman's learning process is what is different. as for the mask, i
  believe it is based on the power of hte magic involved

Goldeyes says "when i cast something at like force 5, my eyes tend to glow,
  maybe little whisps of sand around me, it depends on the spell"

Goldeyes says "And the force"

Amber has only seen a shamanistic mask in use by one player.

Goldeyes says "At the same time, a hermetic gets simmilar "glows" and effects"

Goldeyes says "thats why magic can get noticed"

Lisa Cooper says "I've seen the mask used a few times"

Goldeyes oh's? "I do it all the time, and I think i've seen roy do it."

Goldeyes says "Truth is, i don't know too many shaman tho"

Lisa Cooper says "but I was talking more about the way they *relate* to magic,
  talking about it as if it was science, while Shamans shouldn't, imo, care."

Bert looks at his book,

Lisa Cooper knows way too many shamans, not enough hermetics :)

Goldeyes takes that back, i know a buncha shamans but never see them :P

Goldeyes says "As for not caring, shamans have their own way to gather
  knowledge... its more inspiration based"

Lisa Cooper says "right.. that's how it SHOULD be, but not how I see it done"

Goldeyes says "Look at the way spirits are cast, hermetics form and design
  them. Shamans call them from places or things..."

Bert flips through his book.

You say "Well, if we all agree that the rules for drain and noticing
  spellcasting is fine, we'll continu.:)"

You say "Totems:"

Goldeyes says "I agree with you liz, although I don't deal with shamans or see
  anyone do magic but me, so its not a big deal to me."

You say "Book goes into a common definition of totems and their spiritual
  symbolism for the Shaman."

Goldeyes says "I think the only thing you might want to enforce is the actual
  shaman/mage creating effects too match their noticeability"

You say "Adds a few gamemaster and Player tips for Roleplaying the Shaman"

Goldeyes says "If a mage casts a f10 fire spell, i imagine his hands would glow
  for instance."

Amber sees no problems with those.

Bert ahems.

Lisa Cooper says "as far as I saw, they're almost the same as in SRII"

Bert nods to Lisa

You say "A list of the totems...Some old, some new...Anything particularly
  interesting?"

Goldeyes says "However... thats the same across both boards I imagine."

Hjal likes that there's a Dolphin totem. :)

Goldeyes says "Dolphin? cool."

Bert chuckles, "any issues?"

Hjal says "I didn't notice any totem modifiers being changed, but I didn't
  study them. May be one or two."

You say "The book then goes into a description of the Hermetic tradition and
  the Hermetic Mage"

You say "Seems the same as SR2"

Hjal says "go back :)"

Hjal says "I have a couple medicine lodge things"

Bert rewinds

Hjal says "One, Goldeyes will like this:"

Hjal says "Medicine lodge ratings *are* cumulative. So that'll be different :}"

Goldeyes says "You mean theory doesn't reduce its relative effectiveness
  anymore? woohoo! :)"

Hjal says "And my other thing, is it could be argued either way that medicine
  lodges need to be set up in their proper environments, or just an artificial
  representation. Which we gonna do?"

Lisa Cooper says "well, the rules say it should be in the proper enviromenet"

Roy says "It should be at least partially that way. Plant some trees in your
  back yard or something"

You say "Hard for a Wolf Shaman"

Roy says "Of course..there are problems with some, because no areas are coded"

Lisa Cooper says "kinda sucks for all these Shark/Lion/Eagle shamans :)"

Hjal nods. "But we have wilderness totem shamans setting up artificial
  environments in the sprawl, putting lodges in them. We're gonna have to make
  exceptions, or kick them out :)

You get back your 10 Nuyen deposit for RPTracker #52511(#52511).

You say "If we're doing it now, I don't see why that needs to change."

Hjal says "Because it's somewhat nonsensical for magic to work from a fraud? :)"

Roy says "Let's not get into what's nonsensical :)"

Hjal says "but, as changing would be a super headache, I can agree that it's
  not a big issue that has to happen."

You say "Well, it's the price we pay for diversity, neh? otherwise we have just
  City Totems which would make for a dull game.:)"

Hjal nods. "There's that too."

Hjal says "That's what I had on lodges. Ready to move on :)"

Roy says "We need to fix medicine lodges so that the owner can pass through
  them astrally :)"

Goldeyes says "and do you really wanna make a place that i have to go fly on a
  plane to get to? cuz i'd do it but that'd be pretty dry. I know in my case i
  had to go through a lotta mechinations to make it just right, but i'd assume
  where i have it is a desert foxhole of sorts :P"

Bert nods, "Move on?"

Goldeyes says "Sure."

Roy says "I'm good"

Goldeyes says "The primary changes are with how sorcery and the various magic
  pools work right?"

Lisa Cooper says "before that... there's the Hermetic Tradition"

Goldeyes nods

You say "The book then goes into a description of the Hermetic tradition and
  the Hermetic Mage."

Amber says "That's fine."

Lisa Cooper says "there's a Conjuring library"

Lisa Cooper says "that's the only diff I see in that part"

Hjal thinks there always was seperate Hermetic libraries

Bert nods to Hjal...

Roy nods.

Lisa Cooper says "in SRII you needed a library for Conjuring?"

Roy says "Uh..yeah"

Hjal says "Each skill has its own library"

Goldeyes says "Conjuring, Enchanting, Sorcery and Theory libraries"

Lisa Cooper hmmms

Roy says "Equal to the spirit you wanted to summon"

Lisa Cooper doesn't recall that

Goldeyes says "I think Aura Reading doesn't haev a library tho :)"

Roy says "Not to mention a seperate Hermetic circle"

Goldeyes says "that kinda fits with theory"

Amber says "Circles are easy, and dynamic if need be, just take time."

Roy nods

Hjal says "And room :)"

Amber says "And spray paint. j/k!"

Hjal says "on to adepts?"

Lisa Cooper says "not yet..."

Goldeyes says "If i was a mage my favorite brand would be magi-graffiti brand"

Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database...

...Database saved, play on.

Goldeyes says "I have a general question about magical items d'art"

Lisa Cooper says "anyway... it seems that in SR-III there are two kind of
  libraries: Sorcery and Conjuring?"

Hjal says "That'll be another section Goldeyes :)"

Goldeyes says "Mage paint, fetishes, etc etc... the talismongering skill."

Goldeyes nods and okays

Goldeyes says "3 libraries in sr2"

Hjal says "Well, they'll prolly come out with Enchanting-equivalent, and you
  could prolly have a Magical Background Library as well"

Goldeyes says "Theory, sorcery, conjuring"

Hjal nods. "Magical Background replaces Magical Theory

Roy says "SR III does not mention a Magical Theory/Background Library I don't
  think"

Lisa Cooper says "the same way there's no 'history' library, although ICly
  you'd need one, I guess"

Hjal nods. "I can't think of a need for it off the top of my head, but if you
  had money to burn, why not :)

Amber thinks the needed basics in magical knowledge will be in the specific
  Sorcery and conjuring libraries till SR III additions include the need for
  more libraries.

Goldeyes thinks that history would be interesting for all... although a shaman
  would likely learn that from visions and totems

Hjal nods to Amber.

Goldeyes says "Makes sense"

Roy says "A shaman would most likely learn history from oral histories, but
  yeah, no since adding things onto the huge pile we"

Roy says "we'll already have :)"

Goldeyes says "what about weapon foci? which are now karmically cheaper?"

Roy says "Not yet"

Hjal says "Later section Goldie ;)"

Goldeyes has glanced at the book at least :)

You say "Are we ok with Hermetic Libraries? :)"

Hjal nods.

Lisa Cooper says "circles:"

Lisa Cooper says "there are new rules of making a permanent hermetic circle..
  although I see no problem with that"

Bert holds up his conch.:)

Hjal says "Small thing on cicles:"

Amber says "Go go go. :)"

Bert says smartly, "There are new rules of making a permanent hermetic circle..
  although I see no problem with that."

Hjal hees. "Sorry bert..

Bert grins at Lisa

You say "Sorry...Go ahead Hjal."

Hjal says "Rules text says you can use simple chalk or paint for circles, so
  what's up with the conjuring materials for elementals in the gear section?
  Permanent circle materials?"

Lisa Cooper says "you use chalk for the CIRCLE"

Goldeyes says "Well conjuring an elemetanl still requires materials"

Lisa Cooper says "but conjuring materials for the elementals themselves"

Roy says "It takes extra to summon the spirit"

You say "Nope...The matrials -are- the chalk, paint, etc...They are not normal
  chalk or paint...And it also includes other items."

Goldeyes says "for instance they draw the circle but need to make a bonfire"

Goldeyes says "for a fire elemental"

Hjal says "Ah, ok. See what you're saying. I'm done :)"

You say "Adepts: ?"

Goldeyes says "btw, when i kill a vampire or a cockatrice or something.. i wish
  it had some magical value like fetish materials"

Hjal raises his hand.

Roy says "permanant circles take longer to make and cost more"

You say "Hjal?"

Goldeyes thinks we need guidelines on enchanting better than what the grim set
  down, but i'll shuttup.

Hjal says "Fist and foremost for me, is that they've lowered the cost for
  physad powers. We gonna keep Jennifer's house rules giving discounts?"

You say "Well, Jen's biggest argument was that Phys ads could not advance
  really beyond thir 6 magic points. that's no longer the case in SR3"

Hjal nods.

Goldeyes says "Thats a good question."

Amber says "I would drop them, use the new costs in SR III and if the power is
  not in SR III continue to use the costs in Grim and Awakenings till MITS
  comes out."

Hjal says "You can simply expend karma in Sr3 to buy more powers, don't need to
  technically initiate."

Roy says "Bleh"

Amber says "The major change there is Adepts can buy a magic point for 20 karma
  now."

Roy says "Not a magic point, just a Power point"

Roy says "It's hard to sort things out here until the new book comes out"

Hjal says "I'd also agree we should scrap the house discount. Does anyone else
  have an opinion?"

Lisa Cooper says "well.. if adapt powers are cheaper AND you can more easily
  advance... why give the discount?"

Goldeyes agrees.

Goldeyes says "but keep geasa"

Roy says "If they are allowed to purchase Power Points at 20 karma, then yes, I
  think so"

Goldeyes says "Geasa are cool"

Lisa Cooper says "there're no physical adapts to speak for them..."

Roy grins.

Lisa Cooper says "here, I mean. It seems a little unfair that we all want to
  scrap something that's only good for them, without a representive to say
  his/her views"

Amber will put it this way, Kami would have had about .... 7 magic points if
  that rule was around. That's assuming I didn't get greedy and make it 8 and
  skip the 30 some odd karma I spent on foci

Hjal nods. "In this case, I think it's fairly a no-brainer. Fasa went about
  correcting the same problems we did, just did it different.

Goldeyes says "weapon foci are powerful"

Amber says "Which is far more than what I got out of a package deal."

Roy says "Maybe instead of a flat 20 the scale should be sliding."

Roy says "Keep it lower, but in the area of what it takes a full magician to
  advance"

Amber says "We haven't seen the new init rules yet."

Hjal says "I dunno about mucking with the 20pt cost tho."

Hjal says "Why make it slide?"

Goldeyes says "can physads still initiate?"

Hjal says "There are no Sr3 initiation rules."

Lisa Cooper says "unknown yet, Goldi"

Goldeyes says "MITR gotcha"

Roy says "Because as a mage advances, the costs rise..I'm assuming, since there
  are no rules for initiation yet"

Amber would assume all magicians can still initiate.

Goldeyes says "That is a dangerous situation then..."

Goldeyes says "You can't very well plan magic if you dont know how it will
  change"

Amber says "We don't have much of a choice."

Goldeyes nods

Amber says "Use the old rules till they are overwritten."

Goldeyes says "So we stick with grim 2?"

Goldeyes nods gotcha

Hjal says "I'd think that at the least, we shouldn't toy with the 20pt thing
  until we see the rules that come out in Magic in the Shadows."

Amber says "That would be my guess."

Roy says "So, leave it as is, but don't let anyone go nuts with getting more
  points for now :)"

Hjal says "At 20pts a pop, I don't think many ppl have enough saved up to go
  berzerk :)"

You say "Magic in the Shadows is slated for january...We prolly won't convert
  until then..No worries"

Roy says "You'd be suprised how fast some people come across karma :)"

Amber thinks they will, Hjal.

Roy says "But yeah, the book should be out before it is a problem. Let's hope"

Bert nods

Amber says "Adepts (aka PhysAds) have the biggest arguement for retconning
  initiations."

Amber says "Depending on how the init rules turn out, me thinks."

Roy nods

Amber says "Anyways, those are good as they are?"

Amber says "Use SR III when can, powers in old books use old costs?"

Hjal says "Well, karma they put towards initiations could be considered to be
  put towards extra power points I'd think."

Roy says "Works for me"

Hjal nods to Amber.

Amber says "Once MITS comes out, eliminate old books and do further discussion."

Hjal presses his 'Vote for Moving On' button.

Bert nods

Amber says "Next is the Astral Plane..."

You say "No issues with the phys ad powers themselves?"

Amber says "Pretty much the same."

Lisa Cooper says "except one major differance: aura's can pass through one
  another"

Hjal says "What changes to poweres there are, are fairly simple.."

[StaffChat] Shane connects with his band of Royal Canadian Mounted Police

Hjal says "Just some +sheet mods in some cases :)"

Amber says "I wouldn't limit PhysAd Attribute Boost and Increased attribute to
  physical attributes."

Goldeyes says "woah auras can go through each other? wow"

Lisa Cooper nods. Also... things like living walls don't block astral people now

Goldeyes says "wow, ok but wards do block them"

Goldeyes says "I take it that river rock still works?"

Goldeyes says "or fab?"

You say "Why not Amber?"

[StaffChat] Shane connects with his band of Royal Canadian Mounted Police

Goldeyes says "I agree with amber"

Goldeyes says "Particularly for more anlytical/social adepts"

Goldeyes says "or adepts of the spirit way"



Amber says "Because it's magic inherit in the character. They may well express
  it differently. Artistically, Inspirationally."

Lisa Cooper says "well... *physical* adaps by definition are physically adapt
  :)"

You say "The ky word in Physical Adept is 'Physical'. They use their powers to
  enhance thmselves Physically. Hence why they aren't Mental Adepts.:)"

Amber says "They are not Physical Adepts anymore. Just Adepts."

Goldeyes agrees with Amber still

Goldeyes says "Look at some powers... they are mental"

Goldeyes says "Pain resistance comes to mind"

You say "Pain resistence could be debated."

Goldeyes says "but there are other better examples like perception"

Hjal says "I dunno. I can't say I agree with you Amber."

Lisa Cooper says "you let physical adaps add to mental attribs and pretty soon
  the MUX will be filled with physiads with WIL 9"

Goldeyes says "enhanced centering, and the skill upgrade is an obvious one."

Hjal nods to Lisa.

Roy says "Perception is a sense, which is a physical thing"

Roy says "There is no centering in SRIII"

Goldeyes says "I doubt taht roy"

Amber says "perception is purely mental"

Amber says "Senses are physical"

Goldeyes says "No centering? sounds like another MITS thing"

Amber says "A blind mage can still perceive fine."

Bert wonders at the reason why they excluded Mental Attributes. "There could be
  an underlying balance issue we're missing here."

Hjal says "Well there's the theme.."

Roy says "Maybe they are saving it for a new book. Something to sell :)"

Goldeyes says "Probably"

Lisa Cooper says "willpower comes to mind, as I said"

Bert looks at the book.

Goldeyes says "well said physad could potentially get willpower 12 for all we
  know"

Amber says "There is no way for one to buy it that high at the moment."

Goldeyes says "but that'd make sense for an adept of the spirit way i'd
  imagine..."

Bert quotes, "..Adepts focus their magic on the improvement of the body and the
  mind."

Goldeyes says "Sure there is, its only 4.5 points"

Amber had an adept of the spirit way, will power didn't enter into her concept
  much.

Roy says "There is no spirit way in SRIII Goldie :)"

You say "I guess Amber has a point there."

Goldeyes says "Yet it should amber"

Amber says "Yes there is, old rules apply till initiation rules change."

Lisa Cooper says "Bert... pretty soon you'll have adapts that are perfect in
  both mental and physical attribs"

Roy hasn't seen that stated anywher

Hjal says "if physads were meant to be able to spend power points on mental
  attribs, it'd already be listed."

Goldeyes says "An adept of the spirit way could battle sorcerors, spirits, and
  oother astral oddities through sheer adept power."

Amber says "How about this."

You say "One or the other?"

You say "Not both?"

Amber says "An adepts concept is either going to be in one direction or the
  other 90% of the time. One of the other set applies."

Hjal says "Why make the change at all? How is it needed?"

Amber says "On or the other, rather."

You say "I think that's fair."

Hjal shrugs. "Okie."

Lisa Cooper still thinks that it's rediculus that an adapt can spend 3 magic
  points in chargen and get immuned to magic

You say "If you want to improve Physical...fine...Mental? Fine...Both? Uh-uh"

Amber says "Immune?"

Hjal nods. "You can pump up the will,

You say "No on is immune."

Lisa Cooper says "yea.. raise your Wil 6 points"

You say "Good point Lisa"

Amber says "Explain?"

You say "Maybe that was FASA's angle"

Hjal says "You can buy the awakenings astral shround type stuff"

Hjal says "Now if we want guys being able to focus on being mojoproof, ok.
  Actually, it'd put the fear of God into the magicians out there.. but we'd
  have to be prepared for that :)"

Amber says "Not gonna help them elemental spells."

Goldeyes says "manipulations would still work just as good"

Goldeyes says "we are talking about mind control/combat spells here tho"

Hjal says "Armor works quite nice on those elemental/manipulation spells now."

Roy says "They always did Hjal :)"

Amber says "Raising your will 6 points btw, would most likely cost you 6 points
  if you were already at 6."

Hjal says "Well I emphasised the elemental."

Amber says "There goes your points."

Lisa Cooper says "Amber - if you want your adapt to be an artistical adapt, for
  example, why not just buy improved ability?"

Goldeyes says "Physad costs are based on the racial maximums, not on current
  stats"

Amber says "Because Improved Ability doesnt cover anything but combat now."

Hjal says "There's a difference between fair, and game balance sometimes."

Amber says "And the way the attribute/skill system is in SR III...attributes
  have more meaning."

Lisa Cooper says "any active skill"

Amber says "Why aren't they mentioned in the table?"

Goldeyes points out what i just said... physad point costs are not relative

Lisa Cooper says "atheltics is mentioned, and driving"

Hjal says "Diving.. :]"

Roy says "Those are on the table though :)"

Roy is kinda unhappy to see buying that power for firearms stuff is cheaper now

Lisa Cooper says "err, yea :)"

Amber says "Any active skill would include Etiquette."

You say "We could add to that table you know."

Lisa Cooper says "maybe it'd be right to allow improved skill for BG skills?"

You say "No reason why we have to stick to just combat for improved ability"

Roy says "My problem is that the Attribute Boost power specifically says metal
  attributes cannot be raised."

Roy says "mental"

Amber says "Aura Reading is an active skill."

Hjal thinks they just took the list from Sr2 and updated the per-die costs.

Goldeyes points out Paco the Centering Weaver physad

Bert nods to Roy.."I personally find that ominous."

Amber says "Sorcery (ok, so he could only use it in astral combat)"

Lisa Cooper says "adapts can't take Sorcery, I think"

Goldeyes says "that is my only problem with it too.. but fasa has plenty of
  inconsistencies"

Roy says "Maybe it's going to be a new type of adept"

Hjal says "And while Amber has a point in that the text says 'a specific Active
  Skill' and not 'Any active skill' I don't see why it has to be limited to the
  list of examples."

Goldeyes says "Adepts can take Sorcery(Astral combat)"

Amber says "Actually, Improved Ability doesn't give you the skill, just extra
  dice."

Bert nods to Hjal.

Lisa Cooper says "anyway... I think they left out improved mental attribs for a
  reason. It takes less effort to write "improved attribute" so adding the word
  "physical must have ment they thought about it first :)"

You say "We could easily add to that table. .25/die for artistic skills would
  be cool."

Hjal nods to Lisa.

Roy says "Um, I think adepts with the perception power can learn Sorcery"

Hjal says "I can't articulate my opposition to it, just seems 'wrong'."

Hjal says "To let physads buy extra mental attrib points, that is :}"

Goldeyes says "Um isn't it already .25?"

Roy says "Let's leave it for further discussion and move on? Everybody can take
  a good look and organize thoughts"

You say "Not in SR3, Gold"

Goldeyes says "that sucks"

Lisa Cooper has an adapt in my TT, we're just converted to SR-III. I can let
  you know how it turned out after we play a couple of more sessions

Hjal says "We going back to astral space? :]"

You say "Groovy.:)"

Goldeyes takes us all to the Unseelie court

Goldeyes says "What else is a problem between sr2 and sr3 astral space?"

Goldeyes says "I like the changes in travel and auras passing through each
  other"

Hjal says "Well auras don't pass through each other"

Lisa Cooper says "they do in SR-III"

Goldeyes says "What do they do then?"

Hjal says "An astral only body can pass through a living object"

Hjal says "But two astral only forms still can't pass through each other"

Lisa Cooper says "right.. I ment that - you can pass through auras of
  unperceiving people"

Amber says "Who actually have a chance of detecting you."

Lisa Cooper nods

Lisa Cooper says "so basically, living walls won't work any more"

Hjal sighs.

Goldeyes says "What about river rock?"

Goldeyes says "Fat Airborne bacteria int he walls... etc"

Roy says "River rock?"

Hjal says "if the body has an astral presence, you can't go through it."

Goldeyes says "like a shapeshifter"

Hjal says "So, if you have a wall of astrally percieving ivy, it'll block
  passage :}"

Amber says "Like perceiving, dual, astral."

Amber says "A focus, etc."

Roy nods. "But a tree for example no longer blocks ya

Lisa Cooper nods.. basically the question I see is earth - they say you can't
  pass through it... can you fill a wall with dirt?

Amber says "No, it's the earth itself that blocks."

Lisa Cooper says "however... wards are easier to create"

Hjal says "I'd think 'Mother Earth' has an aura.. the Gaiasphere.."

Lisa Cooper says "even Adapts can create them"

Hjal says "So, if you pile dirt between walls, it's not part of mother earth,
  unless you dig down into the ground, or such."

Amber says "I believe anyone who can perceive can"

Lisa Cooper says "right"

Amber says "And multiple people can join to make it easier/stronger."

Lisa Cooper says "or bigger"

Amber says "Right Hjal."

Hjal says "ooh, I have some questions."

RP-ED:#13672/Intersection of Spring and Church&GT Ford-Canada Bison (OIH-1GNB)
  wanders in from the south.

RP-ED:#13672/Intersection of Spring and Church&GT Ford-Canada Bison (OIH-1GNB)
  cruises along the road into this area.

RP-ED:#13672/Intersection of Spring and Church&GT Ford-Canada Bison (OIH-1GNB)
  has arrived.

Goldeyes says "You can make a subterranean home and ward the exits"

RP-ED:#13672/Intersection of Spring and Church&GT Ford-Canada Bison (OIH-1GNB)
  wanders north.

RP-ED:#13672/Intersection of Spring and Church&GT Ford-Canada Bison (OIH-1GNB)
  has left.

Hjal says "One. Damage to the meatbody. Does this damage apply to the astral
  body? If you deal deadly stun damage to the meatbody, does it snap the astral
  body back?"

You say "Shoot"

Amber says "No"

Lisa Cooper says "no"

Lisa Cooper says "you can be killed while out of your body, and your aura still
  stays"

You say "Any damage will snap the astral body back"

Lisa Cooper says "at least until it fades away"

Hjal errs. "Bert, I don't think so, and Lisa, I'm talking stun, not physical :)

Roy says "I don't think anything 'snaps"

Roy says "You back"

Hjal says "it used to, if only in Sr1. :]"

Lisa Cooper says "well.. you know that you were damaged"

Lisa Cooper says "but I don't think you are 'snapped' back"

You say "From what I understand, someone slapping the mage hard will bring the
  mage back to the meat body"

Lisa Cooper says "you'll need to locate your body if it was moved, for example"

Roy says "No..then why would you not be able to automattically return to your
  body?"

Hjal nods. "Apparently, when the body takes physical damage, all that happens
  is you're aware damage is done. If you're killed, it doesn't even call you
  back.

Bert thinks back.

You say "Mmmm...I might be thinking of SR1...Dating myself.:D"

Amber says "While you were out.... While in astral space you are unaware of hte
  environment of your physical body unless you can see it. You know instantly
  if it suffers any damage, but you are otherwise unaware of what happens to
  your body while you are out. If someone (or sme thing), moves your body while
  you are in astral space you will not know it unitl you return and discover it
  gone."

Lisa Cooper blinks. SR-I?

Hjal says "but, it used to be damage to one, affected both. So, if you knocked
  out the body, the astral form went unconsious too. Hence, the snap back."

Lisa Cooper says "damage to astral effects body"

Roy says "Damage to the astral body is kept when you go back I think"

Lisa Cooper says "but I don't think it goes the other way around"

Hjal nods. "But...

Hjal says "I can't find where it says if damage to body affects the astral form
  or not."

Amber says "Astral damage manifests ontot he physical body as well."

Roy says "Hm, SRII is different I believe. Because you could heal the physical
  body would affect the astral form"

Amber says "It doesn't."

Amber says "Unless it dies."

Hjal says "Healing goes both ways, but doesn't say if damage does."

Amber says "Then you have a problem on your hands and about 6 hours to live."

Hjal says "If healing does, I'd argue damage must as well."

Hjal says "And if damage goes both ways, does stun as well?"

Hjal says "My position is yes, it does."

Roy says "Well..the SRII rules is that any wound to your physical body would
  kill it"

Roy says "Physical wound"

Goldeyes says "butrrcians till you die die"

Goldeyes says "And you can return to the dying body and it can be healed by
  someone..."

Lisa Cooper wait... there are rules about it in page 176

Goldeyes says "but that doesn't give a lot of time"

Amber says "Actually it says the physical body manifests any damage inflicted
  on the astral form and vice versa."

Lisa Cooper says "The phyiscal body manifests any damage inflicted on the
  astral form and vice versa"

Lisa Cooper says "right :)"

Roy nods. :)

Roy says "Ah, I see, the new rules for being disrupted"

Goldeyes says "But it also says the physical body can by and the spirit can
  roam free for 6 hours (12 if yer a vampire or something weird )"

Hjal says "Ok, settled. If you inflict deadly stun on the body, the astral form
  is disrupted."

Amber says "Solves that. D Stun damage distrupts an astral form, forcing it
  back and unconscious."

Roy nods

Lisa Cooper doesn't see how that adds up with the possibility for the meat body
  dying and the astral form staying alive, though

Roy says "No..body dies, you die"

Hjal says "Disruption only applies to stun damage."

Hjal says "Death is physical damage :)"

Lisa Cooper says "well.. roy, read the end of the "while you were out""

Roy says "The only way you wou;d be wandering around for 6 hours is if someone
  moved your body"

Goldeyes says "Personally i don't think the spirit ever dies..."

Goldeyes says "But that is a shamanic viewpoint so call me nuts"

Roy says "Hm."

Lisa Cooper says "you know at once your body dies. You astral form survives
  until it would have normally used up its essence"

Roy says "Well, ok, doesn't make much sense, but ok"

Amber says "They are saying a helpless body can be killed instantly. IF that
  happens, you aren't going back to it to die, just yet."

Roy says "Yeah, but it also says the damage is applied to both forms :)"

Hjal says "But if they knock out you, then kill you, then they prevent having
  your astral form running around setting forth revenge."

Lisa Cooper doesn't think stun damage should move to the aura

Lisa Cooper says "only physical"

Hjal disagrees.

Roy says "True..how do you stun an empty shell?"

Lisa Cooper says "you can't know-out an unconcious body :)"

Amber thinks a person would have a very hard time guaging whether a body was
  knocked cold (especially considering it looks that anyways).

Hjal says "While it is somewhat silly, in that only a moron would kill a
  meatbody without 'knocking it out' first."

Roy says "Kinda like knocking out a coma victim."

Lisa Cooper says "right... stun damage is mental damage. No mental to apply the
  damage to :)"

Roy nods.

Hjal says "But..."

Hjal says "There should be a fail proof way to recall the astral form, if you
  have the body."

Roy says "Why?"

Roy says "There should be a fail proof way to cast spells too then"

Hjal says "That's no correlation."

Roy says "Sure it is"

Roy says "Not fair, balanced"

Hjal says "Ok, fine. We'll use that argument."

You say "While your astral form is out and about, the meat body is incredibly
  prone to damage in that any sort of damage to the meatbody would be physical
  damage."

Lisa Cooper says "do damage to the physical body. That'll get the attention of
  the mage"

Lisa Cooper says "then negotiate with him. Threated to kill his body, etc."

Hjal says "There is a failproof way to cast spells."

Roy was under the impression all damage to the body while projecting was
  physical

Amber says "Where did you read that, Bert?"

Lisa Cooper wound think so... sort of like overflowing stun damage

Goldeyes is dizzy :)

Hjal says "Ok, well that pretty much settles it. You can't 'knock out' a
  meatbod :)"

You say "I'm paraphrasing from While you were out...Read the last sentence on
  173

Hjal says "Thinks it's awful nice for projectionists now tho.. not being able
  to be recalled from astral space."

Amber says "This is the way you can do it."

Lisa Cooper says "of course, that still doesn't explain the contradiction in
  the 'dying while out of your body' thing"

Lisa Cooper says "well, Hjal, you can't be called back - but they can do to
  your body whatever they'd like"

Lisa Cooper says "it's not THAT nice"

Amber says "There is no mind to stun, so it become automatic overflow. From
  body to Astral. Vice versa occurs normally."

Goldeyes says "But."

Goldeyes says "When you are dead the spirit is free."

Hjal says "Makes it impossible to hold a mage prisoner against his will, unless
  you simply keep him unconsious."

Goldeyes says "and it can fly around for 6 hours - time you've been out"

Amber thinks we have another topic to come back to.

Roy nods

Bert makes a notes.

Bert makes a note to.

Roy says "Drug him up..projection takes great concentration"

Lisa Cooper says "threaten to kill him or chop limbs off him :)"

Hjal says "Perhaps a spell could be designed to be cast on the body that
  disrupts the astral form."

Roy says "Besides, you can't take all the benefits away :)"

Hjal says "There should be a way to make the projectionist leave astral space
  against his will, by affecting the body."

Goldeyes says "Spells can do almost anything"

Roy says "That would be one hell of a spell"

Roy says "Very very difficult to design for one thing"

Hjal says "have it do stun damage. Once you take 10 boxes, you're disrupted."

You say "There is similar stuff in the Lone Star Book."

Goldeyes nods

Amber says "You could move the body into a circle or other warded place. They'd
  either choose to die or bargain to get back in, or fight back in. If they
  can't do that, it's back to bargain, in which case, you let them in then
  close the wards back up."

Goldeyes says "Spells can be pretty versatile"

Lisa Cooper thinks we should move on to the next subject

Amber nods.

Roy says "Yep, getting kinda late"

You say "As far as I can tell, these rules are not different from SR2 to SR3
  save for the ability to travel thru living beings"

Hjal says "wants to come back to the astral recall thing at some point."

Lisa Cooper says "astral signatures rules"

Amber says "Sorcery...."

Amber says "?"

Goldeyes nods

Amber raises her hand :)

Goldeyes says "Sorcery is a good question. As i recall its vastly different"

You say "Astral Signatures are from Awakenings"

You say "Nothing new"

Amber says "There is an entire section missing in Sorcery for SR III. Ritual
  Sendings."

Lisa Cooper says "right"

Roy says "Yep :) You caught it too"

Hjal says "use preexisting rules for it, as in other situations?"

Amber says "My guess is that they will cover those rules in MITS. So we should
  just keep them as is, till then."
Goldeyes nods

Goldeyes says "For voodoo pc's rituals are important i imagine"

You say "Ok, leaving them as is...next? :)"

Hjal says "Barriers!"

Hjal says "one quickie"

Hjal says "You can permanently defeat an astral barrier, and pass through it at
  will, however it'll stay up against other ppl. Question: Can the owner tell
  if someone has defeated his barrier?"

Roy says "I think so"

Lisa Cooper says "as far as I remember, the owner feels when the barrier is
  attacked"

Roy says "Because barriers are linked to the creater astrally"

Goldeyes says "how would that relate to quickenings?"

Hjal says "So, any time in a timestop or plot someone crashes through a
  barrier, the owning PC will be @mailed letting him know that yet another
  person has made a hole?"

Hjal says "if the crasher makes his secret hole permanent that is :)"

Goldeyes says "Can't you attune?"

Hjal says "What do you mean?"

Goldeyes says "You can attune to a ward to pass through..."

Hjal says "The owner can, yes. But people can crash through, and permanently
  render the barrier inneffective against them."

Goldeyes says "No, a non owner should be able to attuen someone elses ward as i
  recall?"

Hjal says "If you defeat it."

You say "If the object's force is reduced to zero in astral combat, the object
  is overcome but not yet destroyed. The force of the object will refresh fully
  in one combat turn. A character that has overcome the object can keep it
  'surpressed' by spending a complex action each combat turn. a surpressed
  object cannot regain its force until it has been left untouched for a full
  combat turn."

Roy nods.

Hjal says "Read on bert"

Hjal says "You can permanently open it up to you"

Bert nods.

Goldeyes ahhs and gotcha

You say "Wait."

Bert nods to Hjal..

Hjal says "So, @mail to owning PC whenever that happens to a barrier, or gmnote
  and tell the pc only when he asks?"

You say "With regards to Perm astral barriers (Herm circles, lodges, wards)
  Hjal is right. It's ineffective only against the person that defeated it"

Lisa Cooper says "@mail him/her."

Lisa Cooper says "'cuse they know when it's attackewd"

Roy nods

Hjal nods.

Lisa Cooper says "they can even add their spell pool to it, I think"

Amber says "And as for knowing about the attack, the creator and/or bonder will
  know."

Amber says "That the barrier has taken an attack or damage, etc."

Hjal says "If the owner is a PC and not online at the time of attack, will
  policy be to limbo, and give him a chance to project out and defend, or just
  play on?"

Amber says "I'd say stop."

Roy nods.

Bert groans

Roy says "Especially if it is a lodge"

You say "That could be problematic either way"

Amber says "The repercussions could be bad for them."

Hjal says "Well, it'd be a major pain for all involved, but I'd think it'd be
  rare enough (and going to be a pain anyway)"

Hjal :)

You say "Could be bad either way"

Goldeyes says "An ally can be granted access i assume neh?"

Goldeyes says "PC on PC killing is sucky most of the time, but when it happens
  should be done right"

Amber says "Anyone can be granted access to barriers your created or bonded."

Lisa Cooper says "right.... I mean otherwise people will just twink and wait
  for the mage to logoff before attacking their barrier"

Hjal nods. "Someone busting through a barrier doesn't happen often, and once
  it's know that ts' will stop until owner can login, they'll even be rarer.

Amber says "And they don't affect you. Most barriers by the way, also impair
  visually on the astral level (actually all do)."

Bert thinks. "We could ask mages to put a note on the barrier (we could put it
  on for them) that lists a contingncy plan if the barrier is breached and they
  are offline

Hjal says "Ah. swell idea."

Amber figures (read: Hopes) anyone who puts a barrier up will have other
  magical defenses waiting.

Lisa Cooper says "not good... in a lot of cases you'll also try to negotiate,
  for example"

Lisa Cooper says "see how the attack goes, then decide if to call a spirit or
  not..."

Lisa Cooper says "it can be turned into an entire combat between the two mages"

Hjal says "Well, icly thats what could happen."

Lisa Cooper says "so unless you'll also want to create rules for attacking
  offline PCs, I think you'd have to wait"

Hjal says "If the owner knows that his barrier is being attacked, the attacker
  only has a few rounds to do it before the owner will arrive if he has the
  inclination."

Amber says "Rounds equal what? 10 seconds each phase?"

Hjal says "3-5 seconds"

Hjal says "Maybe a house rule will be you get 1d6 combat rounds before limbo."

Lisa Cooper says "depends on where the caster and the wards are"

Roy says "I think the whole thing should be put on hold as soon as the attack
  is declared"

Lisa Cooper says "if it'd a lodge in the next room, or some ward you built up
  for a corp in the other side of twown..."

Lisa Cooper says "What I don't want to see when I login is a @mail like this: 6
  fire elementals attacked your ward. Since your OOC note said you'll try to
  defend it, you attacked all these elementals and died."

You say "Guys, I hate to do this but I need to head offline now. Can we meet
  again within the next few days? Or start of next week?"
