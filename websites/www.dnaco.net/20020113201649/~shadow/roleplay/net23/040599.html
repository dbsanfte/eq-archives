<P><I>The word Net23, encased in a shimmering, glossy corporate logo appear on your tridscreen. It fades out and zooms into a newsdesk, at which Net23 anchor Ali Harambee X is sitting. He smiles at the camera and begins to speak.</I>

<P>"Saturday night, in front of the high-society Seattle apartment complex known as the Starlight Towers, a pitched gun battle began. A group of six criminals began to fight Ares Security. The criminals took cover behind two armored sports cars, and the Ares Security team took cover behind an armored van. The battle began, the criminals using deadly, illegal weapons such as flame throwers, grenades, assault rifles, white phosphrous cannisters, even arrows. The better-equipped Ares Security team fought back with assault cannons, grenade launchers, and assault rifles. The gun battle continued until both sides ran out of ammunition, where an Ares Security officer used a monosword against an ork criminal with a monoaxe." Ali continues with, "All the criminals were killed in the fight with Ares Security. In additition, their cars were destroyed and all was taken into Ares Security vans. An member of the Ares Security team was left to talk with LoneStar."

<P>Ali's face puts on a excellent-looking mask of sadness. "During the shootout with Ares Security, innocent bystander's cars and bodies were wounded. DocWagon was on the scene, and let loose a barrage on LMG fire on the criminal's vehicles. Ares Macrotechnology has no comment at this point, and LoneStar believe that it was effieciently handled by law enforcement authorities." 

<P><I>Ali goes on to other news, and the trid fades to commercial again...</I>
