      <p> R. Talsorian's <b>Cyberpunk</b> game has a lot of problems IMHO, but, 
        one of the things they include in their maxims for the game is the simple 
        phrase, "STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE". I feel that this basically captures a 
        great deal of the outward essence of the Cyberpunk/Shadowrun genre. In 
        this world, appearance means a lot. I don't mean just being beautiful. 
        I mean, basically, your entire <b>PRESENCE</b> can make or break a situation. 
        Whether or not you can back up what you say or act like means little compared 
        to the fact that you <b>LOOK</b> like you can. Nowhere is this more present 
        than in the standard Mr. Johnson in the ShadowRun realm. In a recent adventure, 
        after it was all over, I had the real Mr. Johnson show up to meet the 
        runners, who had before that time been dealing through a fixer. His name 
        was Lars. Where the players had felt free to argue, discuss, and bicker 
        terms with the fixer, when Lars cut them down with a mere glance, they 
        shut up and sat down. He wasn't nothin' but a normal guy who worked for 
        a corp, but he exuded power like it was nobody's business, and I did my 
        best to portray that style in his speech and mannerisms. The same thing 
        applies to your character, too.
      <p>Some of the best characters I've had the pleasure of seeing played or 
        role-played are those whose style is innocuous, and they can convince 
        you of that with a great deal of ease. To be frank, this is a refreshing 
        change from the standard "I-eat-people-like-you-for-breakfast" attitude. 
        That latter attitude has gotten, and still gets, people killed. A lot 
        of people like to believe that, just because they think they've all gone 
        through the same chargen, they can get away with this sort of brass-balls 
        attitude because they figure their opponent is on the same level. Just 
        ain't true. Some characters, both PC as well as NPC, are more powerful 
        than you, and you can't see their character sheets, chummer. The characters 
        that are innocuous (and some are even what they appear to be) are fun 
        to play with. Walking into a room filled with attitude isn't as fun as 
        RPing with a college student at UWash, or a nurse at Seattle General, 
        sometimes. 
      <p>By the same token, attitude and style also mean a sense of timing, tact, 
        and location. Timing means, the REAL non-posers don't have to always be 
        in your face about it. They're not cocky and they're not easily upset--they're 
        cool. The posers tend to be the ones who feel they have something to prove, 
        and will try to provoke you all the time. Tact means the decision as to 
        when to judiciously apply your presence. Intimidating people like a Mr. 
        Johnson isn't something you should do right off the bat. This ties in 
        with location. All of those of you who pose outrageously in Silhouettes--think 
        about where you ARE. This is not only the poshest, hippest nightspot in 
        town, it's also a major shadowrunner/corporator meeting place. And if 
        you walk in there wearing a pair of torn jeans, and a lousy t-shirt, you'll 
        get thrown out. If you're well dressed and come off with an attitude in 
        a place where the Mr. Johnsons frequent, you'll wind up not getting hired. 
        You never know who it is you might need to impress. 
      <p>As I mentioned earlier, "style" does not mean that you are beautiful. 
        One of my biggest pet peeves in the game is that characters tend to be 
        described as perfectly as possible. They move fluidly, they have large 
        breasts, or huge muscles, they're sexy, enticing, alluring, handsome, 
        what-have-you. This is fine to a degree, but it gets old after a while. 
        Even worse, in my opinion, are the players who don't play their Charisma 
        or social skills worth a damn. The Charisma statistic might not directly 
        be interpretable as physical beauty--I believe it is about a half and 
        half mix, actually--but that argument washes thin when I see beautiful 
        people with 2 Charismas who justify themselves by saying Charisma is not 
        appearance doing their best to appear seductive, witty, amusing, and possessed 
        of all the social graces for whatever situation they are in. 
      <p>Further, social skills <b>are</b> important, though there is no really 
        simple way to integrate them into PC-PC interaction. If a player tells 
        you, "I have X skill, and am trying to get you to think Y", or somesuch 
        like that, give them the benefit of the doubt. There's an interesting 
        dichotomy here. On the one hand, we don't want to see people thinking 
        that if they have Negotiation 6, they can sell shoes to a snake with no 
        roleplaying skill whatsoever; but on the other hand, having bought that 
        skill SHOULD mean something, especially if the player's "opponent" in 
        the social situation is resisting all attempts to simply roleplay it out. 
        Try to work things out ICly with the person you are dealing with, and 
        if you feel you need to use a skill, talk to the player first, then call 
        a judge.
