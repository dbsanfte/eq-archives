<H5><A NAME="telnet">Telnet</A> and Client Programs</H5>
Telnet is an Internet protocol that allows your machine to connect to a
remote computer and make use of resources, like a MUSH, that are located
there. A client program incorporates the telnet protocol with the addition
of commands and features specifically designed for playing games like MUSH.
<P> 
These are the most commonly-used methods of connecting to a game like a
MUSH. To use these, you must have a telnet or client program installed on
your end of the connection. There are free and low-cost versions of telnet
and client programs for virtually all types of operating systems - you do
not need to be using Unix to play on a MUSH.
<P> 
Your Web browser does not come with telnet installed, but most Web
browers can be configured to lauch a telnet program that you have installed
on your system. Once you've done that, you'll be able to connect to a MUSH
directly through the telnet program or through Web links.

you step-by-step through your first connection session on our game. Even

If you're having trouble connecting to the MUSH, please read and try 
the following suggestions.
<P>
Read through the information on all of the pages linked above. 
Saidar spent days researching and creating those pages specifically
to address the common questions and problems that people have and
help them get connected. Your question is probably answered there.
<P>
Try consulting your system administrator or service. If you pay to
connect to the Internet, you have every right to ask your service to
help you make full use of what you're paying for. The people who run
your service more experienced and informed about how it works than
we do. Your service providers get paid to help you, we don't.
