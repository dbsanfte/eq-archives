<P>Saturday noon marked the launch of the Humanis policlubs soup kitchen project. Locating it near the homeless shelter downtown, Humanis members and a group of volunteers promised a hot mean for anyone who needs it.</P>
<P> A small group of security as well as an astral watch, were supposed to discourage any troublemakers, expected due to the public image of the policlub, without arising too much discomfort with the attendees.</P>
<P> An estimated number of 500 people came to the event, a bit more than anticipated, filling the hands of the small team running the oepration. As expected, most of those coming for the promised hot meal were of the homo sapiens sapiens subspecies, a small percentage of metahumans could also be seen waiting patiently in the line. Hunger is a need common to all.</P>
 
<P> At first, the event went smoothly, but as the line grew bigger, and the wait grew longer, unrest began through the crowd that climaxed when a motorcyclist passing by announced, falsely, that a shorter line was forming around the corner, causing a small rush toward the said direction. The result of this incident was the arrest of several squatter by Lonestar forces, and the wounding of several more from passing cars.</P>
<P> However, order was quickly restored, only to be disturbed again a short while later when it became apparent that the amount of food will not be enough to feed all the remaining squatters. The unrest grew, as more people demanded to have their share of the promised food, fearing they will be deprived of it.</P>
 
<P> At this point, network 23 took it upon ourselves to make sure that the situation doesnt deteriorate even more and that not a single one of the gathered squatters will leave the place hungry and disappointed. A supply van to supplement the soup kitchens resources was quickly and efficiently arranged, and after a short delay, things returned to normal, in the supervision of the trained net23 security forces.</P>
 
<P> Network 23 would like to state that by these action we do not side ourselves with humanis, as we do not put ourselves against them. The act was the humane thing to do, and as such - was behind any political arguments.</P>
