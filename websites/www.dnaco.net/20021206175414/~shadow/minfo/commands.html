<H5>Basic MUSH Commands</H5>

As with any other computer game, you will have to learn a few commands to
move around and talk with other players. The basic commands used to
participate in the game are few and fairly easy to learn. The following
resources will introduce you to the basic commands. Please return to the <A
HREF="index.html">main MUSH Resources page</A> for links to other types of
MUSH resources.

MUSH Reference</A></DT>
   <DD>Nick Gammon's MUSH Reference guide is a good place for newer MUSHers
   to begin. It currently covers the basic commands and concepts, building,
   and a few additional topics such as locks and substitutions.  The guide
   includes material specific to the PennMUSH server, but the majority of
   information applies to most MUSH servers. Additional information will be
   added in the future.</DD>
