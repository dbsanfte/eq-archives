Chargen was changed in the later months of 2001 so that we don't require a background before you generate the 'numbers and gear' phase of your character. These steps are now interchange able and you can submit your background before or after you go through 'Chargen'. In the examples below we'll assume you did it before you went through Chargen. This is sometimes better because there are resources in the room before your 'numbers' phase.

There are THREE STEPS to chargen, since the term 'chargen' means many different things in our world you might be better off asking for help by the 'step' name you are in. 

The steps are: Background, Numbers, and Approval. All of which will be explained better below. Steps 1 (Background) and 2 (Numbers) are interchangeable.

</DIV>

<DIV ID="Content">
<h4>Step 1</h4>
Write your <A title="Background Help" href="background.html">background</A>, please see news chargen how-to for more info, your background should contain all the pointers and as much detail as you can provide about your character as laid out in the how-to guidelines. For further assistance, you can read our <A title="Background Help" href="background.html">background primers</A>.
</DIV>

<DIV ID="Content">
<h4>Step 2</h4>
Go through chargen. In the Character Generation: Backgrounds room you'll see an 'exit' named Character Generation Start <CGS>. Typing CGS will get you into this room and to the room called 'Priorities' this is where you begin the 'numbers' phase of your generation.  Within this phase, you set your <A title="Numbers Phase Information" href="numbers.html#attributes">Attributes</A> and your <A title=""Numbers Phase Information" href="numbers.html#skills">Skills</A>, as well as purchasing gear.
</DIV>

<DIV ID="Content">
<h4>Step 3</h4>
Finishing Touches and Approval. This is the room directly after you get 'done' with Chargen, in this room is some final code additions and where you await your application approval. Once you finish your background and are ready to be 'approved' you submit your application to the 'Application Device', looking at it will provide you with the instructions you need to use it. If you get confused at any point feel free to page an on-duty admin.
<P>
At this final, stage you'll be waiting in the 'queue' that you submitted to. A PHA or RPA (see news admin for details on those positions) will look over your background, your 'numbers', and character concept. They will either approve you, or reject your application. If you are rejected you should work with them on the commends they made and changes they believe you need to make in order to play. This process should be short and hopefully fairly painless. Keep in mind that your character is 'new to Seattle' and loading yourself up with gear and 'ware might restrict the growth of your character in your later life.
