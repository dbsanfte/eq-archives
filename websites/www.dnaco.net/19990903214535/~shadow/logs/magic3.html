<TITLE>SR3 Conversion Meeting - Magic Part 3</TITLE>
<BODY>
<PRE>

You paged (Johnny Goldeyes, Reemul, Roy) with 'Ready?'.
Roy has arrived.
Bert grins
Roy has left.
You say "Roy's going on a run instead."
Bert says "Okie"
Bert says "And Reemul?"
You say "Not here"
Bert says "Let's start then."
Bert wants to get this done tonight
Hjal removes heavy objects and things with sharp edges from Bert's vicinity.
Bert is having serious problems like Sunday...So I won't be as active again,
  though I'll chime in when appropriate.
Bert Got his MRI report back today..."Not good."
You say "I think we were just recapping old problem areas, and or bringing up
  anything new thought of."
Lisa Cooper sits on the bed, crossing her legs, and listens.
Bert says "Instead of one herniated disc, I have three now. Serious drek."
Bert says "Anyway, enough of my sob story."
Bert says "Let's start.:)"
Hjal says "Astral form and deadly damage a good place to start?"
You say "Anything new before we rehash old stuff?"
Lisa Cooper says "hmm.. maybe"
You say "?"
Lisa Cooper says "we did some more SR-III converting in my TT and saw some more
  problems... for example - the way spell defense points are allocated is not
  entirly clear"
Hjal says "What part isn't clear?"
Lisa Cooper says "ok.. It says that allocating spell defense points is a free
  action. How long does it last? until the begining of my next turn? until the
  first free action I get on the next turn?"
Hjal says "it lasts until you drop it, or use it"
You say "It says next combat turn"
Hjal says "if you use it, you get the dice back after your next combat action
  after that"
Hjal says "Once you use it."
Lisa Cooper says "yes amber... but when exactly?"
Hjal says "You use your spell defence dice, then start of your next combat
  action, they refresh."
Lisa Cooper says "but WHEN in that turn? at the start of it? or only when I get
  to move?"
Lisa Cooper says "if at the start of it... does it mean I have no spell defence
  points until my first action?"
You say "Free actions can be taken on anyone's turn, so long as you have
  already acted that combat turn. It says ~your~ combat turn"
Hjal nods, and notes Lisa has a point. "Says turn, not action.
Lisa Cooper says "Yes.. you don't seem to get my question"
Lisa Cooper says "let's suppose it's my turn. I rolled 7 on my init. X rolled 9
  and Y rolled 5"
You say "First round?"
Lisa Cooper says "when it comes to 7, I cast a spell using 3 points of sorcery
  and 3 points of pool. Then on 6 I allocate the remaining 3 points of sorcery
  to spell defence."
Lisa Cooper nods. First round.
Lisa Cooper says "Okey.. then Y acts - round over."
You say "ok."
You say "You can change them before Y acts."
Lisa Cooper says "new round. Once again, X rolled 9, I rolled 8 and Y rolled 6"
You say "It's a free action. You;ve already acted. Anyone can take a free
  action on another person's round."
Lisa Cooper says "X casts a spell on me. Do I have spell defence?"
Hjal says "You only get the dice back, after you use them."
Hjal says "if you allocate, and don't use, and don't drop, you have the spell
  defense until the cows come home"
Lisa Cooper says "so basically I can allocate 12 points in the morning and have
  them up all day until I decide to use them?"
You say "You can reallocate on any person's turn."
Hjal says "if a gm were stupid enough to allow, yes."
You say "As long as you have already acted."
Hjal says "But spell defense is exclusive, so you'll have to drop sometimes."
Lisa Cooper says "I'm hearing two different voice who say differnt things :)"
You say "Nor are you forced to use spell defence dice."
Hjal thinks we're answering different questions :)
Lisa Cooper says "so your answer is: Yes, I still have the 3 points of spell
  defence when X casts the spell on me?"
Amber nods.
Hjal nods.
Lisa Cooper says "okey.. do I still have 6 points of sorcery?"
Hjal says "no"
Hjal says "points you allocate are removed"
Amber would say yes and snag them from your spell pool, since it doesn't make a
  darn difference.
You say "You just go, Hey gm.. on x's move I wanna take a free action."
You say "Those 3 I had on me? I want to make sure they are spell pool. Gimme
  back my sorcery. They are interchangeable. I don't know of a sorcery activity
  that can't use spell pool dice, or vice versa."
Hjal thinks that since it says 'allocate from Sorcery pool, plus any spell pool
  dice desired' you have to allocate at least one from sorcery.
Lisa Cooper says "well.. it doesn't make sense this way. What prevents me
  (other than the GM) from allocation more and more spell defence pool every
  action I don't cast a spell in, then have 1000 points of spell defence ready"
You say "Because your pool refreshes and while they are allocated you have not
  the use of them"
You say "Pool refreshes one way or another."
Hjal says "you don't get the dice back to your pools until you use or drop the
  defense"
Lisa Cooper says "not pool.. Sorcery"
You say "They just stay locked, and not available for other actions."
Amber hmms.
LiquidChromeMBLDR has arrived.
Lisa Cooper says "okey.. so until I decide, in a free action, I don't want it -
  3 points of my sorcery go to spell defence?"
Hjal nods.
Bert says "LiquidChrome?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR=Gold
You say "That's Goldeyes"
Bert says "Oh..Okie"
Hjal says "We done with Spell Defense?"
Amber thinks so.
You say "Did I mention non-initiates now have an Astral pool yet?"
You say "Anything else new?"
You say "Ok, Astral &LT----&GT Physical Damage?"
Hjal says "What about just giving +4tn to the form when the body takes deadly
  damage, but has not died?"
Amber is inclined to bo with any damage to the physical body is physical and
  may kill on the spot as per sr2. "There really isn't much of a change from
  sr2 to sr3 on this."
Hjal says "Or, simply not give meatbodies physical overflow. prolly makes more
  sense that way."
LiquidChromeMBLDR thinks from physical to astral that makes sense
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "if the meatbod gets wiped out, the spirit should still
  have its 6 or fewer hours"
Hjal says "But what penalties does the astral form suffer for that time? Amber
  suggested saying the stroke that kills the meatbod, is not applied to the
  astral form."
You say "Just about any stroke will kill a meat body according to sr2."
LiquidChromeMBLDR agrees with amber, that a dead meatbod doesn't affect the
  astral form
Hjal says "But, damage goes both ways. So, if the body dies, does the form
  still suffer the damage the body had?"
You say "Not on the attack that kills."
You say "Which is almost assured to happen if you attack a comotose projecting
  body."
You say "hence why the strategy is to move them if you want to talk to them
  alive."
Hjal says "Why not beat the body gradually then?"
You say "A simple blindfold makes just about any magician helpless in the ways
  of magic."
Hjal says "if you put the astral form at +3tn because the body took serious
  damage before it died, you're better off because the astral form is hurt
  while it gets its revenge."
You say "How would you determine what would and would not kill it?"
You say "Sr2 says any damage to the meat body is likely to kill it."
Hjal says "takes 10 boxes to kill. Less than 10 boxes, didn't kill."
Hjal says "Sr3 says stun damage is physical damage."
Hjal says "On the meatbod."
You say "And that you will probably kill it in the process of doing that."
Hjal nods. "But, consider the scenario:
Hjal says "You've got the meatbod of a projecting mage."
Hjal says "You wanna geek him. So, do you slit the throat nice and quick, and
  deal no damage to the astral form? Or, beat it to death over the course of a
  minute, and frag up the form as well?"
You say "You beat on it, the shock will kill it."
You say "This not a sleeping form. It's a comotose one. With it's life force
  abroad."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "right stun damge is physical on him to those rules"
Hjal nods. "But, it'd transfer the damage to the form.
Hjal says "Before the body died."
You say "HOw are you gonna guage that?"
Hjal says "When the body was at 6 boxes, for example, so is the astral form."
You say "And what point is too much and it dies?"
You say "It's not like a normal attack."
Hjal says "10 boxes"
You say "No way, that's assuming a healthy awake, body, not one in a coma state"
You say "You want to take the chance of killing it by punching it?"
Lisa Cooper sighs
Amber waves.
Lisa Cooper says "what did I miss?"
You say "Astral damage"
Hjal says "I see nothing saying any damage kills the meatbod."
You say "sr2"
You say "The wording is almost identical to sr3"
Hjal says "it only says stun damage is automatically physical damage."
Amber will find it.
Hjal shrugs, and knows you wont :)
You say "p 147 top left paragraph"
Hjal says "We're talking Sr3,not Sr2"
You say "It's not in sr3, everything else is however. even damage flowing back
  and forth."
You say "That's like tossing out grounding because it's not in sr3."
Hjal says "it says stun damage is considered physical damage"
Hjal says "That means that 'any damage kills' is no longer true."
You say "It says: A magician's enemies could simply kill the physical body.
  Almost any wound to the comatose form will drive it into fatal shock."
Hjal says "They gave a new rule that renders 'any damage kills' obsolete."
Hjal says "If any damage kills, why bother keeping track of damage?"
Hjal says "if any damage kills, a projecting mage would kill himself first time
  he took drain."
LiquidChromeMBLDR hmms
You say "I see nothing that says stun damage is considered physical damage in
  sr3."
Lisa Cooper says "they said 'wound' not damage"
Hjal will point it our.
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "I think the old rule of any damage kills was based off
  the idea that a comatose astral form has no way of defending itself. Any
  attacker would easily hurt it because you are just a jellowy bag of flesh.
  All it takes is a stab to the throat, through an eye, an easy slit of the
  throat what have you. The spirit of the rule was that it was -easy- to kill
  such a body."
Lisa Cooper agrees with LI
Hjal grumbles. "It's wherever it says you take physical damage from drain while
  casting spells while projecting.
LiquidChromeMBLDR has a personal opinion
Hjal nods to LI. "The point I was getting at, is it's silly to make the
  distinction.
LiquidChromeMBLDR thinks that the astral form should be fine if the body is
  healed
if the body is killed imean
Hjal says "you can't heal a dead body."
LiquidChromeMBLDR meant to say that the system was set down so that mages could
  "ghost" around
You say "Well, then just make the transfer normal, though how in the world a
  person guages their damage, I don't know."
You say "The killing blow just wouldn't carry over."
You say "You slap him, you do x stun damage (they don't know how much)."
You say "How would you know when the body was knocked out? Bring a doctor?"
Hjal says "Well Amber, you'd have the scenario I gave you. If you wanted to
  kill the mage, why would you do it clean? You know his ghost is gonna be out
  there. You want to rack him as hard as you can, while you have the chance."
You say "Another mage could care less if there is a ghost out there. what's it
  gonna do? Cast a spell on me?"
Hjal says "Ghost around to all his buddies, spilling beans, and yea, maybe
  casting spells on things."
You say "It's astral, I'm physical. Let it fear the end of it's existence for
  the next 6 hours."
You say "Assuming it knows who killed it."
Hjal says "I'd be plenty scared of the damage it could do. it knows it won't
  live, so it has no consequences to fear."
You say "I'dmove the body before I killed it."
You say "Just treat damage transfer both ways, except that killing blow. No
  biggie."
LiquidChromeMBLDR hms
Bert says "Lisa? Chrome? anything o add?"
Lisa Cooper shrugs. "What's the point of arguing if you should or shouldn't be
  scared of a ghost? obviously some poeple will, some poeple won't.. arguing
  about it won't help us solve the problem"
LiquidChromeMBLDR will look it up, but doesn't the damage from physical blows
  wipe clean if they were physically based?
Hjal says "Ok, reasonable, but I have one question."
You say "Slap that mage back into his body (dunno when you figure you will
  realize)."
Hjal says "Why not say the form is at the full damage, but not dead yet?"
Lisa Cooper says "Basically I think what Amber suggested last time should work.
  Damage (and healing) interchanges, but when you deliver D damage, you cut the
  link."
You say "No, it says damage on the astral forms confers to the meat and vice
  versa, as well as healing."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "here's an interesting question, can an astral "ghost"
  heal itself?"
You say "Right, killing blow is going to kill the link, the astral form goes on
  no matter how much damage it's taken (even if the body is nuked), for x
  hours."
Bert says "No Gold"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "But then how is such a "ghost" disrupted?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "Aren't they disruptable?"
You say "Sure, won't do much good. It will still ceases to exist in x hours."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "The problem is, if the ghost gets attacked or attacks"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "How do you decide that its dead?"
Hjal says "if you deal deadly stun to the ghost, it'd still disrupt it."
Hjal says "And since it has no body to go back to, it dies then."
You say "It already has damage. just treat it normally."
You say "If you deal D physical damage to an astral form the body would die
  anyways. if you disrupt one without a body it dies, or whatever, either way
  it's removed from PC hands."
Hjal says "Disruption is from stun damage"
Hjal rereads and nods. :]
D.GOBACK.MAGIC: Adept, astral damage, Grounding, Healing
Amber checks the list. "Grounding and Healing, did we finish those?"
Lisa Cooper says "I don't think we spoke of Grounding"
Lisa Cooper says "I think we just said we do it like SR-II until MITS comes out"
Hjal nods, the last I remember as well.
You say "Grounding is one of those wait for MITS. If we convert before remove
  it, because it breaks too many existing rules in SR3."
You say "Healing?"
Lisa Cooper says "well.. you do have to have SOMETHING to prevent mages from
  walking with all their locks activated"
You say "Yeah, you walk up to them and attack the focus."
Hjal shakes his head. "Not good enough :}
You say "There are no conduits from astral to physical anymore. They make that
  plane and clear."
You say "plain too :)"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "thats good"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "It was too damn easy before"
Hjal says "If they can change that, we can change the way grounding works too."
You say "It's not worth discussing till MITS comes out."
Hjal nods.
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "you could make an anchoring for 1 die and pretty much
  kill anyone at ease"
Lisa Cooper nods too.
LiquidChromeMBLDR recalls Sarifa's enhanced cheese tasting example
You say "I think those are issues for higher mysteries that they will handle or
  just havent figured out how to handle so left them out."
You say "They'll get to them, I'm sure."
Hjal says "healing?"
Bert says "Anyone logging BTW?"
Hjal isn't..
Amber is logging.
Bert says "Thanks...I need to log out for a bit...I'm sorry."
Bert will be back.
LiquidChromeMBLDR waves
Bert has disconnected.
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "I agree, the new astral rules for wiping out a focus
  are also fitting"
Lisa Cooper says "what about Healing? As far as I recall the only problem we
  had is whether pros can heal you magically after someone already healed you"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "You can now just "dispel" a focus as a mundane right?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "or at least astral adepts can"
You say "Not exactly."
LiquidChromeMBLDR acks i'm sorry have a big headache, as a mage not a mundane
You say "You have to attack a focus like yuo would a barrier."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "I heard aboua method of draining the focus?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "And if they do it so many turns it is completely
  destroyed"
Hjal says "Basically attacking it."
You say "Right"
You say "Something along those lines :)"
You say "Healing. I think the players are usually better off leaving it to pros
  if they have the option. No set of wounds can be magically treated more than
  once."
You say "That's not a change from sr2 to sr3"
Hjal sighs, and doesn't relish going into it again.
Hjal says "The only one try per wound is a rule specific to Heal/Treat spells."
Lisa Cooper nods
Hjal says "If fireball text said this fire spell is learnable by water
  elementalists, doesn't mean all fire spells are learnable to water
  elementalists."
Hjal says "Same thing. It says these spells are usable once only, doesn't mean
  all healing spells are usuable once only."
You say "The rule doesn't apply to just Heal"
You say "Because it says: A character can only be magically healed once for any
  single set of injuries."
Hjal says "Where does it say that?"
You say "If I interpret that your way, I can do treat , then heal."
Hjal says "under the text of that spell, right?"
Hjal says "you're gonna make a gamewide ruling on the basis of the text of one
  spell?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "I elieve treat/heal are one and the same, only treat
  operates sooner rather than later"
You say "Absolutely. It applies to health spells. Those are the only two in the
  book that deal with healing damage."
You say "Oh, I agree, Gold, but not if you interpret it the other way. It
  didn't say teat or heal magically. it said heal magically."
Hjal says "The way I read it, it only applies to heal/treat."
You say "It was not naming a spell. It was giving a magical process."
Lisa Cooper hmms.. "Once again... I don't think anyone has anything else to
  add... I think we should leave it as a ruling..."
You say "In either case, it's not a change from sr2 to sr3 and the mux already
  handles sr2."
Hjal says "If it's a categorical rule, don't you think it should be in a place
  other than the text of the spell?"
Hjal says "YOu don't make rules about all pistols in the description of the
  ares predator, for example."
You say "That's like saying page 129 only applies to the Heal spell (Using
  Biotech)."
You say "Same term: magical healing"
Hjal says "where on pg 129?"
You say "2nd paragraph"
Hjal says "Under biotech?"
Amber nods.
Hjal says "So your point here is since the term was used in a place other than
  the text of the spell, the term applies to things other than the spell?"
You say "No, I am basing it on the reading of sr2, and sr3 and noting that no
  difference was intended, irreguardless of how it's interpreted."
You say "Sr2 says what you want, and it wasn't ruled that way."
You say "Sr3 is more blanket in it's phrasing."
LiquidChromeMBLDR will have to concede on this one, i don't know
Hjal says "Would you say that biotech is the only form of healing available? No
  professional medical care? Why only 'first aid' mojo then?"
You say "I would say Biotech is the only mundane healing skill in the game,
  yes."
Hjal says "But, mundane professional care, cumulative with, and better than,
  first aid is available to NPCs."
Hjal says "Why not same with mojo?"
You say "Because Biotech has a page and a half discussing the stages of that
  care."
Hjal says "Ok, and?"
You say "Healing simply says no set of wounds can be healed magically more than
  once."
Hjal says "I read it one way, you the other. Who's to say you're the one who's
  right?"
You say "Why describe a spell name as magically? It makes no sense in English
  Grammar."
You say "Names don't get adverbs."
You say "nouns can, but not proper nouns like names."
Hjal isn't even gonna go into grammar. That's splitting hairs.
You say "Splititng hairs is declaring it only works for heal and treat."
Hjal says "FASA is notorious for bad grammar in their products, anyway :)"
Lisa Cooper says "well... they did say "any set of wounds can only be magically
  healed once" I think it's quite clear what they ment :)"
You say "It's more blanket than what sr2 said, and the ruling on sr2 has
  already been made."
Hjal says "No, it's putting magical healing under the same idea as mundane."
You say "Either way it's not a change that I can see. It would be a house rule
  issue, not an SR3 issue."
You say "The wording is too similiar to make it an sr3 issue."
Hjal sighs. "Don't make this a pissing contest."
Hjal says "If I'm the only one who sees it my way, so be it."
Hjal says "But, you won't be sliding this off the agenda."
Hjal would prefer Bert to make the final call, since we don't agree, but since
  he's not back yet, and settling would be better than letting it linger..
You say "Beating it into the ground is not going to help"
Hjal nods.
You say "Don't have our adept to speak, but I can make a call for one."
Hjal says "Lisa, you think one heal per wound is across the specrum? Gold?"
Lisa Cooper says "I agree with Amber on this one"
Hjal nods. "Gold?
LiquidChromeMBLDR nods
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "One heal per wound"
Hjal says "Ok, settled then."
&GT&GTAnnouncement&LT&LT Amber says, "Any Physical Adepts online, please page me."
You paged Pitbull with 'You busy?'.
Amber grins as she gets a lot of "I wanna be" pages.
Lisa Cooper says "that's a new concept... physiad wannabe's!"
You paged Pitbull with 'We need a physad to speak for them discussing SR III.'.
Hjal says "What is next?"
You say "Only thing left is adepts"
LiquidChromeMBLDR likes adepts
Hjal says "What is the question? Whether or not to drop house rule on paths?"
You say "Paths I like"
You say "That's not really a house rule, that's just creativity"
Hjal says "To include discount on powers?"
You say "Package deals and New abilities."
You say "Reemul wanted to speak about it and we aren't really represented by
  one."
Hjal thinks package deals aren't necessary any more.
Hjal nods.
Lisa Cooper agrees with Hjal
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "sr3 rules make that old news"
Lisa Cooper says "for new abilities... I think it's a good thing. Add interest
  to the game"
Lisa Cooper says "as long as they're moderated"
You say "Well mage concepts in general have to be monitored."
You say "Alright, well... Reemul will do an @mail when he can. Tonight or
  tomorrow."
Hjal says "The problem physads had was not enough buying power on abilities.
  problem solved in sr3, makes our house rules to address that sr2 problem
  moot."
You say "Reemul doesn't think so"
Hjal grins. "Well, I'm looking forward to seeing his reason(s) then."
You say "Here's an interesting Geas on an adept ability: Exclusive."
Hjal says "You'd have to be careful allowing it."
You say "They'd have to be a bit more specific, explaining for me."
Hjal says "If someone got incr reflexes, or attribs, I'd think you couldn't do
  it."
Hjal says "Those are always active."
You say "I'd make them lose those while they did the exclusive (channeling
  their chi or something)."
Hjal says "It's be cleaner to just not let them take the geas if they have
  always active powers."
You say "And right, it wouldn't make sense in some circumstances."
You say "I think that's about it, till we hear from an Adept"
Hjal says "not to be derogatory to Reemul, but don't you think an argument from
  a physad for the 'double dip' should be taken with some serious salt added?
  :)"
LiquidChromeMBLDR understands physads pretty well
You say "Not sure I follow you?"
You have left channel StaffChat.
Hjal says "We give them the candy of the paths and package deals in our Sr2
  House rule. Sr3 gives them more candy, in that the costs of powers are
  lowered across the board."
You say "Well, it started when he asked me about initiating."
Hjal says "If you use paths, cutting the already lowered (sr3) costs, that's
  double dipping :)"
You say "He wanted to buy combat mastery with a geas and put in his already
  there package deal."
Hjal says "Rather, using package deals, on top of the already lowered costs."
Hjal says "Paths, I don't have a problem with."
Amber objects to combat mastery as a power, personally. it's more powerful than
  Centering, which is an initiate ability.
Hjal says "you shoulda seen Sorcery Mastery :P"
Hjal says "but anyway back to physads :]"
You say "Objects to people choosing existing skills to center with."
You say "Different issues, though. Reemul wanted to speak. We wanted physad
  representation, I oked it with Bert, he missed the meeting do to irl
  situation."
Hjal nods.
You say "Pitbull isn't inclined on package deals, but like the new powers."
You say "Soooo, want me to @forward his @mail when I get it?"
Hjal says "Have him send it to alla group."
Amber nods.
You say "Well, not sure where we will go from there, but we'll figure it out.
  Either save your responses for one more meeting or @mail them to me and I
  will compile them. Most likely both."
You say "UNless you guys wanna talk with Jiro?"
Hjal says "about physad stuff?"
Lisa Cooper shakes her head
Lisa Cooper says "ahh.. you mean with Jiro... ask him :) I thought you asked if
  we had anything to add. misread you"
You say "He's willing."
You paged Jiro with 'Sure, ready?'.
Hjal says "bring him on in"
&LTOOC&GT Jiro says, "Wussup kids :)"
Amber grins "This is our partial panel.
You say "We don't have a phyad represented, felt it better if we did for this
  part."
&LTOOC&GT Jiro waves.
Lisa Cooper waves back. Look ma! no +ooc! :)
Jiro chuckles.
You say "Anyways, we're looking at the new sr3 rules and evaluating if we still
  need the house rules."
You say "Do you have a copy of SR3?"
&LTOOC&GT Jiro pats his tome, "Right here."
You say "Ok, the general consensus here is to remove package deals."
Bert says "The idea hereis to start anew. I don't want to keep any old house
  rules that we don't have to."
LiquidChromeMBLDR likes the initiatve increase for physads... pretty groovy
Jiro nods to Liquid.
Jiro likes package deals, and thinks they add to RP. However, I can see why
  you'd want to start as close to SR3 as possible.
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "As a general rule i like some of the new house
  powers... except for the gills"
LiquidChromeMBLDR isn't sure how he feels about gills
Jiro thinks most, if not all, should be transferred from Awakenings as well.
You say "What about the powers posted?"
Jiro hrmms, and never paid much attention to them.
Hjal says "Do you think paths could work without a package deal associated with
  them?"
You say "And the issue of boosting or improving mental attributes?"
Jiro doesn't htink so, as Paths mean little.
&LTOOC&GT Jiro doesn't like Combat Mastery...
Amber objects to it as well.
Jiro says "It would be cool, but it's just too much rules/number-crunching."
You say "It is more powerful than Centering,which is an initiate ability."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "The gills power kinda sucks"
Jiro says "People spend too much time on that in Melee anyways."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "Maybe some kind of amphibous power that allows transfer
  through the skin"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "but gills, i can't buy that"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "thats a mutation"
Jiro nods, "Gills are bad."
Jiro says "It's not very 'magical'"
You say "Water breathing, maybe."
LiquidChromeMBLDR nods
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "exactly"
Jiro says "Or just have them convert it via a focused manifestation in their
  lungs or something."
LiquidChromeMBLDR nods
You say "Bit off track. So we toss the house rules in favor of sr3 and cover
  powers on a case by case basis for concept?"
Jiro nods, "That is a double-edged sword."
Hjal thinks it's best that way.
Jiro says "I think limiting the powers to what is in SR3 and Awakenings is
  good."
Jiro says "Those should pretty much cover everything, although I do like that
  Leaping power :)"
Hjal nods. "Don't need to throw out powers, just house rules regarding
  discounts.
Jiro pictures all the old Chop-Saki stuff.
Jiro says "Well, what was the intent of the package deals?"
Jiro says "To keep PhysAd's on an even keel with easily advancing mages?"
You say "I don't want to say nothing outside the books. SOmebody may come up
  with something very reasonable. I noticed increased reaction is not in there
  anymore."
Jiro says "Or on-par with fresh from CG Sammies?"
Bert says "No Jiro"
Jiro says "Amber, Increased REaction & Reflexes are combined."
Bert says "The purpose was to diversify Phys ads from the same 4-5 powers that
  they all seem to take."
Amber nods.
Jiro ahhs.
Jiro says "Well, did it work?"
You say "Sorta."
Jiro says "Do you think that would carry over to SR3?"
Jiro says "So you don't want cookie-cutter PhysAds, yes?"
Amber likes unique concepts.
Jiro wonders if his ranks :)
Bert nods
Jiro doubts it.
Jiro says "Well then, that sounds like an App-level thing, not a rules on."
Amber agrees. "The major disagreement I had was not allowing boosted mental
  stats for certain concepts."
Jiro ahhs.
You say "Or the range of improved abilities."
You say "Which we agreed we could enlarge."
You say "Most are opposed to increased mental attributes."
You say "I'm opposed to both on the same character."
Jiro says "Uh....OK."
Jiro says "Not sure what that has to do w/PhysAds in general though."
Jiro says "That sounds like it might come up once a year or maybe less."
Jiro can see very few instances where enhanced intelligence would fit any
  PhysAd concepts.
You say "Talking as a power."
Amber can think of a few.
Hjal grins to Amber, and thinks this all seems rather familiar to an argument
  not too long ago :)
Jiro says "It seems to sit outside the range of the definition of PhysAds IMO."
Jiro says "They're about pushing their BODY's, nottheir minds."
You say "They aren't physads anymore. Just adepts."
Jiro says "Whatever."
You say "Say improvement of body and mind."
Jiro says "Though the definition is a bit braodened in SR3, as you just pointed
  out :)"
Bert has reconnected.
Jiro just has a problem with adept-level magic enhancing something like
  Charisma or Intelligence.
You say "Some mental abilities come to mind. Combat Sense"
Lisa Cooper says "soo... why didn't they have it in the normal adapt powers
  then?"
You say "Phermones?"
LiquidChromeMBLDR agrees with amber here
Jiro says "Yeah, that doesn't fit an Adept concept to me. That's a mutation."
Jiro says "A la cyber-ware."
Hjal says "Combat sense isn't mental. Its a 6th sense."
Jiro says "Yeah."
Hjal says "It's precognition. Not mental."
You say "Which is mental"
LiquidChromeMBLDR points out for instance that paco guy who weaves badass
  cloth, or the physad musician superstar
Hjal says "It's precognition. Not mental."
LiquidChromeMBLDR could see an adept orator
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "or an adept writer"
Jiro says "THat's a SKILL, not a mental attribute."
You say "precognition? It's awareness beyond the norm. As is astral perception."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "these are skills of intelligence, creativity and
  technique"
Hjal says "Astral perception is not mental either."
LiquidChromeMBLDR disagrees
Hjal says "It's its own sense."
Jiro says "I think that attributes, mental ones specifically, are FAR to broad
  to fit under most concepts."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "Speaking well is a skill and requires intelligence to a
  degree, particularly negotiation"
Lisa Cooper says "what's I remember that last suggestion was is to let adapts
  to by improved skill to almost all skills"
You say "Even boosted temporarily?"
Jiro says "Yes Amber."
Bert nods to Lisa
You say "So willpower is not something a physad would develop?"
Jiro says "I think that instantly becoming an Einstein level genuis for a short
  time is a bit off the wall."
Hjal says "Perhaps under a house rule, but we're talking Sr3 :)"
You say "An iron will?"
Bert says "I'd have very serious concerns about game balance with Mental
  Adepts."
Lisa Cooper says "I told you what'll happen then... hoards of wil9 physiads
  will roam the streets"
Jiro says "Isn't there an Iron Will in Awakenings? (Don't have my copy here.)"
Jiro says "What's the big deal about Wil9 Adepts?"
You say "Hoards of 9+ mages are already roaming the streets"
Hjal says "there's pain resistance, which sounds the same kinda sorta"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "it should be one or the other"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "if someone has mental adept abilities i wouldn't allow
  physical powers"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "and likewise"
Lisa Cooper says "well.. at least the mages are using a focus... you can attack
  them through it or something if they just keep it on"
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "Ie either get that +3 intelligence or +3 quickness...
  not both"
You say "I'd have to say no m ental attributes."
Bert says "Ironwill is extremely specific to certain situations...It isn't a
  blanket +X willpower"
You say "Unless it's bought in a power, justified, like pain resistance or some
  such."
Lisa Cooper has a deja vu
Jiro nods to Amber.
Jiro says "Yeah, like I said. Specific applications, sure. Broad attribute
  boosts, no."
Lisa Cooper says "we had the *exact* same argument last meeting... with the
  exact same reasonings... let's just hear Jiro out then, because that's the
  only thing that changed :)"
You say "Settles that. Are we dumping the posted powers. I want to be clear on
  that."
Jiro says "I think powers should be kept, save Gills and Combat Mastery."
Jiro says "That borders on Mind Control."
Bert has partially disconnected.
Jiro says "I don't buy too heavily into Ad's being able to affect OTHERS with
  their powers."
Hjal says "Maybe a reevaluation of costs, to make them comparable to other sr3
  powers, but I don't see a need to drop them"
Amber has to agree adept powers were never made to directly affect another.
Jiro says "Back to the Concepts/Package deals then."
LiquidChromeMBLDR says "except for combat"
You say "That's indirectly"
LiquidChromeMBLDR points to delay damage, killing hands, distance death
Jiro says "Even then, they don't DIRECTLY affect someone else."
Jiro says "Whatever."
Jiro says "All of those are coming FROM the adept."
Hjal says "Jiro, you were saying?"
Amber gets a drink.
Jiro says "I think Package Deals should be maintained for CG, but only for VERY
  TIGHT concepts."
Hjal says "why so?"
Jiro says "And deviation from it AT ALL removes the deal bonus entirely."
Jiro says "Think about it like this."
Jiro says "If a person's powers are manifesting in accordance with this
  'concept' than that must be your frame of reference for EVERYTHING. Your
  world centers around THAT, and so does your magic. Deviating from that seems
  akin to changing totems, or an Aspected Magician switching elements or from
  Sorcery to Conjuring."
Jiro says "At least, thats how I play Jiro."
Hjal says "OK, not quite what I was asking why so about :)"
Jiro says "That's why I think only tight concepts should be allow the package
  deal."
Jiro says "If people want to slap togethor a hodge-podge combat monster, let'em
  at full price."
Hjal says "Why keep package deals? Sr3 already lowers the cost, makes more and
  thus different powers available."
Jiro says "If they wan't to RP a devoted practitioner of some way of life, than
  more power to'em."
Jiro says "The prices are lowe?"
Hjal nods.
Jiro says "How so? I thought they were pretty analogous."
Hjal says "In Sr3, compared to Sr2."
Hjal says "And up-powered, to boot, in some cases."
You say "Not by much and not in many places. Only at the higher ends."
Jiro ahhs.
Jiro says "With that knowledge, I still stand by my previous statements."
Take a break chummers, we're dumping the database...
...Database saved, play on.
Jiro says "Package deal applies in CG, after that, same for everyone."
You say "Define a tight concept? I could say... center it around channeling of
  chi"
Hjal says "Why apply a bounus to CG, and no-one else?"
Hjal says "Are Sr3 costs still too restrictive?"
Bert says "I think he's talking about the different Way's...Way of the Artist,
  Invisible way, Spirit Way, etc.."
Bert says "Those are tight concepts."
Jiro says "I don't think they're tight enough for me."
LiquidChromeMBLDR just listens
Jiro says "Not for package deals anyways."uld be a ShaoLinn Monk, or in my case, a
  Kendo Master."
Jiro says "Not a 'Silent Way' or a 'Warrior', those are too broad."
Jiro says "Those are just categories that Adepts gravitate towards through
  specialization and the need to be good at something."
Lisa Cooper says "well, ppl... I'm out. I gave my views on adapts and it's
  really late for me, so I see now point in staying, since this is our last
  subject for this meeting/... goodnight"
Jiro says "Adios Lisa."
You paged Lisa Cooper with 'Either or :)'.
Jiro says "Feedback on my suggestions?"
Amber tends to agree.
Bert says "Just confused on what you'd define as tight then."
Jiro says "As a unifying framework for their magical manifestations, a
  DEFINABLE, LIMITING framework."
Bert says "Give an example.:)"
GAME: Lisa Cooper has disconnected (21:36)
Amber Based her entire phyad on one concept. "Karma."
Bert laughs
Jiro says "OK, I'll use myself then."
Bert says "Everyone does, Amber.:)"
You say "Not that kind of karma ;)"
You say "Karmic balance."
You say "And broader than that she was of the Spirit way."
Jiro says "That's my package deal submission. That's my definition of a
  defining, limiting, unifying concept."
Jiro says "Questions?"
Bert says "Lemme read"
Jiro says "OK :)"
Jiro wows as he sees the market running high today.
Bert says "How does that diffr from the Way of the Warrior?"
Jiro says "Because it's a SPECIFIC application, not just 'Battle'."
You say "He took the time to develop the path, a lot don't."
Jiro says "A warrior could have a smattering of Armed, Unarmed, Increased
  Reflexes, Killing Hands etc."
Hjal would think that if someone tried to take a path of the warrior, the admin
  would make them think out their idea to a similar level.
Jiro is kinda' proud of his package submisison :)
Bert nods, "Hold on a second though."
You say "And he wouldn't be able to get something like say Killing Hands with
  that concept."
Amber nods, "I sure hope so Hjal"
Bert says "Look at the powers he's chosen and remove the name of his path."
Hjal says "So, if we're gonna make ppl do work, what's wrong with Way of the
  Warrior? :)"
You say "Or missile mastery, etc."
Jiro says "And I'm saying you SHOULDN'T be allowed to buy outside."
Bert says "Couldn't you put any specific Fighting-style and call it that?"
You say "You could, but it wouldn't be tight enough."
You say "Anybody can dream up a style and say it does everything."
Bert says "Why not? The powers aren't specific to Kendo."
Jiro says "Are there any that are MORE specific?"
Bert says "Exactly my point Jiro."
Hjal says "Apologies to you Jiro.. as I'd imagine this wouldn't be a popular
  notion to physad players.. but why not just make such 'path' definitions
  mandatory, instead of optional, and rewarded with cost reductions?"
Bert says "The powers themselves don't lend themselves tobeing that tight."
Amber thought they were mandatory. At least to get to the initiate level they
  are.
Jiro says "For initiation they are, but not for fresh-outta CG&GT"
Hjal says "So why do we give discounts then?"
Bert says "I could take the same powers you chose...Call it "Way of Jujitsu"
  and it'd be a tight concept..."
Hjal says "Rather, why continue to give them :}"
Jiro says "No, it wouldn't."
Jiro says "The Armed would become Unarmed, the Reflexes I wouldn't buy, I'd amp
  up the SKILL more than the speed, wouldn't buy the body-hardening either."
You say "Jujitso might center around other aspects, like some unarmed, some
  stealth, some climbing (maybe athletics in general)."
You say "And probably fit more under the invisible way"
Hjal apologizes and lost track of things. "What are we trying to resolve now?"
Jiro says "That's Ninjitsu Amber :)"
You say "Duh"
Jiro says "Bert's wondering how my concept/package helped specify my powers."
Bert nods
You say "Jujitsu... basically using the opponent against themselves. Defensive.
  They don't use swords."
Bert says "I think tat's Judo, anber"
You say "Same base, I believe."
Bert says "God, I need to fix my thumb"
Bert says "Hold on.:)"
Jiro says "Yeah, Judo is the sport-version of Jujitsu."
Jiro wonders what's wrong with Bert's thumb?
Bert says "Ok, Fixed."
You say "Did you put that thumb back on right?"
Bert says "I sliced it open on Sunday, and it's all bandaged up"
Hjal says "I see two problems I see with hyper-narrow paths. One, powers are
  rather broad, as Bert pointed out. And 2, you have 'experts' arguing
  endlessly about whether something should fit :)"
Bert says "The band-aid was slipping.:)"
Hjal says "If I know nothing of kendo, and Jiro gives me a proposal, all I care
  about is making sure he doesn't go twink wild."
Jiro nods to Hjal, "That would be a problem."
Jiro says "I'm sure that the admin could ask around though, and dig up some
  other opinions and use them to aid his decision."
Bert says "In an ideal world, Jiro"
Bert grins
Hjal says "Or, even worse:"
Jiro shrugs, "Mebbe."
Amber is curious to see how initiation affects Adepts with the rule changes
  they have already.
Hjal says "I consider myself an expert on kendo, and needle over differences of
  opinion :)"
Jiro doesn't see why a public channel inquiry would be all that hard :)
LiquidChromeMBLDR still has to read what jiro wrote ;)
Jiro says "In those instances, you gotta go with the Admin. They should
  consider game-balance before concept, and go from there."
You paged Bert with 'Sure. Have to clean it up a tad.'.
&GTFrom afar, Bert nods
Amber is going to poof and take care of a couple of magic rpa matters :)
