        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING ASTRAL </b></p>
        <p>When creating auras for Rooms and Objects there are a few simple things 
          to remember: </p>
        <p>1) Astral space is made of moods, emotions, textures and tones. It 
          is perfectly alright to include feelings in your astral descriptions. 
          For example: A person on the astral plane looking at a letter or sign 
          would see the emotional content of the item, not the actual words. </p>
        <p>2) Manmade objects show up on the astral plane. They are generally 
          shadows of the real thing, with magical influences showing up. </p>
        <p>3) Background count is important. A Room can have a general emotional 
          feel to it based on past events that have influenced the etheric space. 
          However, permanent background count is very rare. Please consult a magic 
          admin prior to placing a permanent background count on a room. </p>
        <p>Well thought out astral descriptions will add to overall quality of 
          the MUSH, and you never know when you'll want to play a magician. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING COSTS </b></p>
        <p>Having a building built for you by a construction company on the MUSH 
          (there are two, find them) costs the following amount in IC funds: </p>
        <p>LOW LIFESTYLE AREAS: </p>
        <p>Simple, one-story structure is 50,000 =Y=<br>
          Rooms for buildings are approximately 20x20x12' and are 1,500 =Y= each 
          <br>
          Additional stories are 10,000 =Y= per floor. If a building already exists, 
          adding to it has a 10,000 =Y= charge, plus room costs, etc. </p>
        <p>RENTAL </p>
        <p>Rental costs are ten percent of the building's total cost PLUS any 
          IC security a player wishes. </p>
        <p>EXAMPLE: Joe wants to build a two-story house with four rooms. </p>
        <p>50,000 for the building<br>
          10,000 for the second story <br>
          6,000 for the four rooms <br>
          Total is 66,000 PLUS any security costs. Rent for this building would 
          be 6,600 nuyen per month plus any security. This is for LOW LIFESTYLE 
          CONSTRUCTION. The following are price increases for other lifestyle 
          areas. </p>
        <p>MIDDLE - LOW cost + 40 percent<br>
          HIGH - LOW cost + 80 percent <br>
          LUXURY - LOW + 160 percent. </p>
        <p>Please remember that the staff of the MUSH will work with you on prices, 
          and financing is available. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING EXITS</b></p>
        <p>All Exits MUST HAVE: </p>
        <p>@Desc, @Succ, @Osucc, @Odrop, &AURA. </p>
        <p>If an exit is lockable no matter what the reason, it must also have: 
          @Fail, @Ofail, and &Lock-Rating. </p>
        <p>If an exit is to blocked against Astral Movement, it MUST have: &Barrier. 
        </p>
        <p>Hidden Exits must be justified, and clues should exist in the room 
          for PCs to find the exit. Lock rating is the rating of the maglock or 
          other system. Please put a note in the &SECURITY of the rooms on either 
          side of it, or in an attribute called &NOTES on the exit, details on 
          the lock or system. </p>
        <p>No One-Way Exits. </p>
        <p>Exits should not be aliased to the letters H or L (which are used for 
          help and look). Exits that lead a person out of the building, should 
          all be aliased to out;ou;o. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING INSPECTIONS</b></p>
        <p>To ask for an inspection of a building, @mail Inspection. As the subject 
          of the mail, list the name of the exit leading into the building as 
          it appears in your nexus. In the body of the text, give a short explanation 
          of what the building is, what its purpose in the game will be, and list 
          any special information about the place. Be sure to list any dark exits, 
          and YOU MUST mention who assigned or approved the project. Also, be 
          sure to list the specific IC location you wish for the building by Dbref# 
          (if you have a place in mind) or let us know that you have no preference. 
        </p>
        <p>A Building Staff member will then inspect the building, to be sure 
          it has all the required attribues, and that your spelling and grammar 
          are okay. If there are no problems, it will be linked, and you will 
          be notified. If there are problems, you will get a @mail, detailing 
          what alterations need to be made to bring the building up to standard 
          for linking. </p>
        <p>Buildings will be chowned to City_Builder after being linked. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING MASTER ROOMS </b></p>
        <p>All of the attributes in 'news building rooms' can be a pain in the 
          butt to set for every room you own in a building. Luckily, TinyMUSH 
          has an easy way around this.</p>
        <p>Rooms can be @parented to other objects/rooms. The room will share 
          every attribute of the parent object, so it is possible to create a 
          single object with default attributes on it, so you don't have to enter 
          all of the required attributes in every room. Just create an object, 
          put the attributes like &Security_rating, &Where_zone, etc. on it, and 
          @parent the rooms in your building to it. </p>
        <p>Two attributes--&AURA and &SECURITY--must be added to every room (same 
          with @descs, but you know that already). One way of coding security 
          easily is to set the &SECURITY on every room to, "type securitylist". 
          Then, on your parent/master room, you can code something along the lines 
          of a menu system: &securitylist master=$securitylist:@pemit %#=this 
          is a list of all the rooms and the security in them and stuff about 
          the NPC security guards. </p>
        <p>For more detailed information, contact a Building Staffer. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING POLICY </b></p>
        <p>All building is to be done by special Builder characters. Player Characters 
          may not own ANYTHING. All Builders must append their name with the letters 
          BLDR. </p>
        <p>Builders may NOT build residences for their PCs, or other PCs without 
          direct permission from the Head Building Wizard. Builders may not make 
          personalized items, nor may they create restricted items, such as guns, 
          armor, credsticks, vehicles, etc. </p>
        <p>Construction is by assignment ONLY. If you have a good idea, contact 
          a member of the Building Staff, to see if the idea is workable. </p>
        <p>All building will be done off of the Building Nexus. No JUMP_OK or 
          Floating rooms are allowed. PERIOD. </p>
        <p>Before becoming linked, all locations will be inspected by a member 
          of the Building Staff. If the building meets standards, it will be linked. 
          If not the Builder will be given a list of corrections that need to 
          be made in order to have the building linked. Linked buildings may not 
          be altered without permission of the Building Staff. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS BUILDING ROOMS </b></p>
        <p>All rooms MUST have: </p>
        <p>@Desc <br>
          &Aura <br>
          &Security <br>
          &Security_Rating <br>
          &Where_Place <br>
          &Where_Zone </p>
        <p>Descs should be clear, concise (less than one full 24x80 screen including 
          all exit info) and fall within the ShadowRun genre. Use a dictionary, 
          and watch your grammar, please. </p>
        <p>Auras should be clear, concise, and give an accurate idea of the emotional 
          content of the room. Remember Aura IS the ONLY Desc an astral person 
          sees, so make the main features of the room clear for them as well. 
        </p>
        <p>Security is a listing for the Judges that explains in relative detail 
          the security and other features of the room. Considering that Shadowrun 
          is a violent world, this attribute is useful in the event combat or 
          other nastiness occurs in your room. Statistics should be cleared with 
          the appropriate RPAdmin. Remember, the more detailed you are, the better 
          the chance of the Judge handling the call as you believe your building's 
          personnel would. </p>
        <p>Security_Rating pertains to the Lone Star response time and Docwagon 
          time of the room. General levels of security (rated from AA to Z) can 
          be denoted within buildings by using the "Z" as a preface for this THREE-LETTER 
          attribute. I.E., a high-security building would be ZAA. </p>
        <p>Where_place and Where_zone delineate for the admins at a glance where 
          exactly you are. Where_place should be the name of the building you 
          are in (i.e., one Bedroom looks much like any other on the +who. If 
          you are building, say, a bedroom in Joe Blow's office, the where_place 
          attribute should read, Joe Blow's Office). Where_Zone should delineate 
          where you are in Seattle--i.e., Downtown, Elven District, Barrens, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>No rooms may be set JUMP_OK, under any circumstances. </p>
