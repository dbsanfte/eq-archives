<P><I>A quick flash of imagery is displayed along the screen as the words below roll by quickly, and in random directions, 'Newsflash'. Quickly, a shot of Kyoto, Japan, a large metroplex, obviously computered altered for ultimate in an Urban Beauty, the most predominant of the buildings there is the 340 story 'the Yamtetsu Corporation' Headquarters. Slowly the words of a woman with a highly Japanese accent are heard, flow as it shows pictures along with her words. The lens slowly rotating to stop with the Headquarters of the corporation stopping in perfect center. It begins to zoom in on it, without a single loss of clarity or pixelation.</I></P>

<P>        "Early this morning, it was annopunced that the CEO ahnd Chairman of the Board and CEO of Yamatetsu Corporation Tadamako Shibanokuji died after a prolonged hospital stay, at the age of 74."</P>
<P><I>A quick flash of a Photo of the CEO is shown in the corner of the field of vision, as the zooming in continues towards the corporation at an agonizingly slow pace, slowly people begin to be visible through windows, and the mist that made it look so enchanting begins to clear, as it watches the top floor.</I></P>

<P>        " He will be missed by family, friends and employees. The feeling of him being the father of all of those he employed will never be forgotten." The woman pauses for emphasis before continuing, the sloy zooming continuing, as she begisn to speak once more. "His death, the result of cardiac arrest, is just one of many health problems which had befowled the elderly businessman."</P>
<P><I>The zoom slowly begins to fixate on the 336th floor, and on the alrgest window visible, strangely, it is not reflective, and you are able to see inside, about 20 men are inside of it, all along a business table, with a large projection screen, and other neccesities for a meeting of some sort along one long table.</I></P> 

<P>        "Believed to be the darkest of this mans secrets, was his son, Yuri Shibanokuji, a 29 year old resident of Vladivostok, who gained all his fathers stock within Yamatetsu Corporation." The image clears, and you see that strangely, the man slowly rising to a stand is in fact an ork, in a tailored Gucci suit, and underneath it reads, as it zooms unto his face, 'Yuri Shibanokuji'</P>

<P>A more Englishized voice becons in, most likely synthetically made, "What will happen to the newly traded Yamatetsu? Watch Net23 for the updates, 24/7. For when you want the news, when you need the news."</P>
