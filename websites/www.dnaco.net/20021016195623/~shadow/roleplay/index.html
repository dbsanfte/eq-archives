<h3>What is Roleplaying?</h3>

<h3>Shadowrun Aspects</h3>
Shadowrun is filled with a massive variance of different types of characters.  At Seattle, we allow almost all archetypes to be played to their fullest potential. There are organizations to join, shadowrunning teams to work your way into, legal businesses to run, and entertainment to be had by all! We do <strong>highly</strong> suggest that everyone has at least some sort of tie to the illegal world of the <a title=Shadows href="shadows.html">Shadows</A>, but it is not required.  Within Shadowrun, the different types of characters are called <a title=Archetypes href="archetypes.html">Archetypes</A> though many characters can fit multiple different ones.
