<P><I>The display lights up with a scene of someplace in Redmond... It's a 23News van with a reporter in the foreground, and a massive pile of rubble, debris, and construction materials in the background. The reporter speaks up</I>
<P>"This is Sally Vaccuum, on scene in the Redmond district of Seattle." 
<P><I>The camera pans across a more close-up view of the wreckage. It looks like the remains of some sort of destroyed building.</I>
<P>"Network 23 News was first on the scene here at the sight of what appears to be the collapse of a condemned building... It appears that around thirty squatters were killed in this tragic event... Lonestar forensic technicians have examined the scene, and they've determined that the building just collapsed... They confirmed that the building was condemned, and that going inside was an act of criminal tresspassing. The deaths of the SINless squatters will not be investigated."
<P>"Local Seattle charities have many outreach programs for helping with the SINless living here in Redmond... More information on charities can be found attached to this news file."
<P>"Network 23 News mourns the loss of all of the SINless lost in this tragedy... Brian? Back to you."
