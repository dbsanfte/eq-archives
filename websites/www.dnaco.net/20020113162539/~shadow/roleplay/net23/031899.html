<P>Early sundy morning, a glowing ball of light was seen leaving the roof of Atomic Med and Cyber on Madison Street Downtown. The glowing ball was seen to originate in the sky hover down into the clinic and depart a few minutes later. Squatters swear that there was a winged person inside the ball of light, but Lone Star has no comments on it. Hours later, a Security guard for Atomic Med and Cyber found Dr. John Summers, Part owner of Atomic Med and Cyber laying dead on the floor.<BR> 
Cause of death has not been identified except for that it is believed that he died of Natural causes. A funeral will be held for the deceased in a few days hence once all the details have been finalized.

<P>A boat was found washed up on the shore of the sound after a Lone Star Coast Guard unit found large pieces of debris clogging one of their ships inlet pipes. The boat has not been identified to any owner yet. Lone Star has called the case closed.

<P>A news helicopter was turned away from flying over a known weapons testing range owned by Ares in the Pacific Ocean about 2 miles off the coast of Vancouver Island. The news helicopter reported that they saw Ares testing a new type of ranged rocket weapon on a floating target, but nothing else has been found.


<P>Redmond Studios CEO has announced that the R&D devision has created a highly fluid and quick motion Simsense Product. He has been quoted as say, "This is the new way for simsense to go." Obviously he has high expectations of his companies newest product. While still experimental, it should prove a hit.

<P>Analysts have found that of the Yamatetsu owned stock, the only company to actually rise in value has been Redmond Studioes. The most recent drop in stock of Yamatetsu Corporation is attributed to the recent death of the former CEO.
