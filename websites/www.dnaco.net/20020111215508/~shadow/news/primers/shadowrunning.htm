      <p> The following are a few specific tips for those of you who want to try 
        to run the shadows of Seattle: 
      <p>Getting a run is a skill in itself. To start with, you're going to have 
        to do some leg work, roleplaying with other characters to find out who 
        does the hiring and making yourself known to them. Fixers, corporate 'troubleshooters', 
        and organized crime members are the most likely sources of employment. 
        Try to be subtle and professional, and don't expect them to offer you 
        the big jobs (or any job for that matter) right away. Although it is possible 
        to page an on-duty judge with a request for a simple run (be prepared 
        to except a 'no' if and when you do this, as the judges are usually quite 
        busy), it will pay off much more in the long run to build up a network 
        of contacts and a reputation as a professional who can get the job done. 
        Remember, even the best runners will rarely get more than one or two runs 
        a month, so don't expect to have a job awaiting you each time you log 
        on. 
      <p>Organization is the key to a successful run. Keep your team small and 
        try to have all the 'bases' covered (magic, matrix, and mundane). Check 
        out the situation carefully before you decide how to tackle the job -- 
        scan the matrix, check with contacts, and/or make an astral recon of the 
        target. Once you've gotten as much information as you can get on the target, 
        make a plan of action. Although shooting everyone in sight may let you 
        accomplish your goal for the run, it's the runners that can pull off a 
        run <b>without</b> firing a shot that attract the big league employers. 
        Don't walk into a run loaded down with LMGs, avoid unnecessary killing, 
        and don't stop to loot -- these will only earn you a reputation as a gutter-punk 
        and wanna-be runner. If you do find yourself in combat, end it as quickly 
        as decisively as possible and get away from the scene before the authorities 
        show up. 
      <p>After the run's finished, your best bet is to hide out for a while and, 
        more importantly, keep your mouth shut. Don't tell anyone what you did 
        for any reason. It may be fun to brag, but doing so is asking for trouble. 
        When word gets back to your latest 'victim' about who burned them, you 
        can be sure they will be happy to come make an example out of you.
