Morris says "I dont think Rock has seen it either." 

Shayd mails to Inu 
Shayd says "Give me email addresses" 
Shayd says "It'll make this quicker, cuz the issues we are here to 
  address are there outlined" 

Rock says "where is this log?" 

Shayd sends it out so you can watch 
Shayd says "er read it" 
Shayd says "Let me know when you get/read it" 

Rock says "Got it" 

Norainu does too 

Mojo whips out his toga. "Party?" 

Shayd says "In the middle of the log there is a lsit of four major 
  poitns that need to be addressed" 
Shayd says "The four major things that we want to achieve" 
Shayd says "Followed by a long and arduous list of obstacles" 
Shayd says "The purpose of this meeting" 
Shayd says "In essence, is to decide whether or not these obstacles can 
  be overcome" 
Shayd says "If they can, how and how much work it will take" 
Shayd says "And to perform an objective cost-benefit analysis of whether 
  or not we want to try to do this" 
Shayd says "Does that sound fair?" 

Norainu nods. 

Zygmunt nods 

Lucifer wiggles. 

Rock nods absent-mindedly trying to read a large chunk of text 

Mojo says "Yah." 

Morris says "That about covers it." 

Rae nods 

Norainu can read as we go on, don't want to hold everyone up. 

Shayd says "Okay, let's start with introductions and then see where this 
  goes" 
Shayd says "If no one objects I'll start and be the "bureaucratic 
  meeting-organizer jackass"" 

Morris says "Ok, you type faster than me. :)" 

Norainu laughs. 

Zygmunt chuckles. 

Shayd says "I'm Shayd, well-known, former RPD Seattle, current RPD 
  Detroit. PCs have included Halo Jones (before she became an NPC on 
  Seattle) started in 1994, and then later after I retired there, Dylan 
  Sergesson on Seattle (former Detroit PC Victor with a neew name). Now 
  I'm RPD on Detroit and I play Andrew, a PC here." 

Lucifer nods, "I'm the irrational micro managining dictator that 
  everyone loves to hate. 
Lucifer smiles. 
Lucifer says "I've played 5 PC's now. 4 dead. 2 deaths worth it. Two 
  more that sucked. The last still alive but in a comotose state. :>" 

Shayd goes !dark and says by default, we do things in room order :) 

Lucifer says "I admin'd on Seattle for about a year and a half. Then 
  started this place." 
Lucifer says "Next. :>" 

Mojo looks around. "Um. I'm an admin here. Before being an admin, I had 
  never played on an SR MUX, although I have a good deal of MU*ing 
  experience." 

Morris says "Ok, you type faster than me. :)" 

Conference Room(#8966Rgh) 

This palatial suite offers the best in magical and technological 
  convenience for administrative personnel on the go. Light shines in 
  from the broad (and bulletproof) picture window on a lavish display of 
  all things material. The finest mahogany wood makes up the long and 
  beautiful conference table, while the chairs are covered in plush 
  crushed black velvet with gold trim, comfortable to sit in. Magically 
  bound air elementals serve the wishes of those in the room with a 
  variety of beverages, foods, and recreational chemicals or chips. A 
  datajack link in every chair hooks the attendees up to the state of 
  the art AI computer system.

Obvious exits: 

Out <O> 

Zygmunt says "I've only been on the MUXes since last November. I play 
  Ichi on Seattle (My first PC there) and I play Zygmunt on Detroit. 
  (Also my first PC)" 
Zygmunt says "Uh, I can't really see myself." 

Norainu doesn't know who he follows either 

Morris says "Can, we get a quick list of room order?" 

Shayd says "No, okay, I forgot about the room thing :)" 
Shayd says "OK, the order is gonna be Rock, Morris, Lucifer, Rae, 
  Norainu, Zygmunt, and Shayd." 
Shayd says "I apologize, I syuck at this job." 

Morris says "What about Mojo?" 

Rae giggles 

Shayd says "He's DARK" 
Shayd says "the dork" 

Morris says "Just stick him in there somewhere." 

Shayd says "OK, the order is gonna be Rock, Morris, Lucifer, Rae, Mojo, 
  Norainu, Zygmunt, and Shayd." 
Shayd says "Rock, tell us about you :)" 

Rock says "I have played and GM'd TT for about 18 years, but I am only 
  about one month old on MU*'s. I only have a single character, the 
  Dawrf PI Gabriel Stone on Seattle. RL stuff?" 

Shayd says "Up to you :)" 

Rock says "OK, here goes" 
Rock says "Army Airborne Combat Medic then nurse, now Grad student 
  working in Dr. Smalley's lab at Rice University on carbon nanotubes 
  and molecular electronics towards a PhD. Married too." 
Rock says "Morris?" 

Morris dohs, "Talk about a tough act to follow." 

Shayd says "Well, don't I feel like I have an intellectually small penis 
  now." 
Shayd grins. 

Morris says "I'm Morris, cat extrordinaire. I've been doing this for a 
  while and can actually confirm the rumors that I have never had a PC 
  on a SR Mux. I have actually played PCs on other MUSHes." 
Morris says "I'm the President and general tech support for DNACo in 
  RL." 
Morris says "Not married but living with someone." 
Morris says "Next. :)" 

Rae says "Did Lucifer go already?" 

Shayd says "Lucifer already went, that'd be Rae" 

Rae has played on the 2 SR muxes for about 2 years. Adminned ans then 
  was actually a semi RPD here on Detroit for about, what, a week? Went 
  back to playing, then got persuaded to admin again on Seattle. 
Rae is IRL married with 2 kiddies. 

Rock says "Congratulations" 

Shayd says "Mojo?" 

Mojo is a senior at Brown University, getting degrees in Biology and 
  Computer Science. "I work in the Cognitive Vision lab, researching 
  minimalist representations for visual computer navigation. I've been 
  gaming since age 7, that is, for two thirds of my life. I've been an 
  admin for three months here on Detroit, and it's my first experience 
  on any SR MUX. However, I've been MUXing for about a year and a half 
  now; my regular PC haunt is Dark Metal. I live with someone." 

Shayd says "Inu?" 

Norainu plays on both Seattle and Detroit. Started here around December, 
  and has had two PC's. Blacky and presently Norainu. On Seattle had the 
  short lived Blackthorn, then went to Akindo the Yak Fixer, from there 
  went to Blacky former Ganger turned Decker, who wasn't ported, but 
  went through Chargen as a new character, and just wants to say what a 
  /great/ matrix admin Rae is, and hopes she remembers that next time he 
  triggers. *Grin* 

IRL I'm a Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist who's looking for people so 
  I can mess with their minds....eeer, help them with their problems, so 
  please form an orderly line towards the couch. 

Shayd says "Zygmunt?" 

Zygmunt says "I play Ichi on Seattle, Zygmunt in Detroit. Started MUXing 
  last November. RL I have a wife and two kids, and work for a living 
  running a paper mill." 
Zygmunt says "Been gaming for 24 years now." 

Rock says "Congrats (on the kids that is)" 

Lucifer says "24 years?" 
Lucifer says "Mother of god. I'm not even that old. :>" 

Zygmunt says "Yup. I'm 34" 

Lucifer says "Wow" 

Mojo notes that Zygmunt was gaming before he was a twinkle in his 
  daddy's eye. 

Shayd grins. "Last is me--RL I'm a 28 year old computerconsultant who 
  has been an RPD on one MUX or another for the last 5 years, with no 
  experience elsewhere on other MUXI. I do tech support and other 
  things, and I'm a professional writer when I'm not telling people how 
  to fix their macintoshes at work, doing business writing and such. And 
  I'm single, perhaps notoriously so. 

Zygmunt says "Living proof that you don't have to stop gaming when you 
  (theoretically) get a real life and job." 

Shayd says "Okay, now that we know where everyone comes from, let's get 
  down to brass tacks." 

Lucifer notes he found the real life and the real job and the real PAIN 
  IN THE ASS girlfriend. I lucked out all around for 23 

Shayd says "How do we want to handle these discussions? There seem to me 
  to be four major issues, but those can be further broken down into 
  three distinct issues: (1) Porting, (2) Cross-MUX Plots, and (3) IC 
  Concurrency." 
Shayd says "The third meaning, basically, do events on one MUX occur on 
  the same world in the other MUX?" 

Norainu says "I think 3 is the best way to start, cause if we dont' 
  agree on that, the others are moot really." 

Shayd says "All of these items are exclusive of one another--that is, in 
  my mind, you can have any one without haveing any of the others in 
  effect." 

Zygmunt says "How do you want to handle comments? Same order? Or raising 
  hands?" 

Shayd says "I think we can start--with this huge august body of smart 
  old people--by doing it free-form" 

Rock says "Seems 3 would be a necessity or at least a really good idea" 

Shayd says "If it gets too chaotic we'll move to raising hands and 
  stuff." 

Zygmunt says "O.K., then I'd say that without 3, the other two are 
  moot." 

Lucifer says "i concur. :>" 

Zygmunt says "If the 'world' events are not concurrent, then it wouldn't 
  make sense for characters or plots to cross, since they would be 
  existing in alternative realities." 

Rae says "3 is the easier, for certain." 

Mojo thinks 3 is trivial as long as there aren't world shattering events 
  in either MUX. 

Rock says "If you really want to be IC, it seems complete concurrency 
  would be necessary and agrees with Mojo that it should not be a real 
  problem" 

Zygmunt says "It should be trivial. I think that the events on the MUXes 
  surrounding Dunk's death indicate that it is not." 

Mojo says "That's a world shattering event. I would argue it's more 
  problematic that a player, reading the books, learns about a very 
  different world than is present in the MUX." 

Morris says "It will require at good communication between the staffs 
  and a willingness to talk to each other about general strategic plot 
  information." 

Shayd says "Who gets veto power?" 

Norainu nods in agreement with Morris. "I think that's pretty key to all 
  of this, communication." 

Shayd says "That's an obstacle. If an admin here wants to do something 
  and an admin there doesn't want it to happen--" 
Shayd says "Who vetoes it? Who decides?" 

Zygmunt says "It requires that the RPDs stay in touch with each other so 
  that the timing of the world events is handled properly. And, if 
  something of significance happens in Seattle, it should make the news 
  in Detroit, and vice versa. Plots run on either MUX that could have 
  world shaking consequences need to be talked about as well. I'd say 
  that either RPD would have veto power. And it should almost never get 
  used." 

Mojo would assume each MUX gets veto power over the other. "Veto would 
  be in the hands of the RPD." 

Shayd says "Okay." 

Morris says "I dont think there is a veto per say. If its gets to a 
  point where a veto is neede, then communication has broken down." 

Norainu says "The problem is that if you're dealing with concurrancy, 
  how can you Veto?" 

Shayd says "So, are you now saying that the RPDs need to have access and 
  keep up to date on the plots on both MUXI?" 

Zygmunt says "If either RPD disagrees, then the two should talk about 
  it, and listen to what the reasons are. If they still can't disagree, 
  then I'd suggest asking Morris to arbitrate. Yes, that's what I'm 
  saying." 

Norainu says "Event A is going to happen to the SR World, isn't it 
  rather moot to have this if we then say that Event A can be vetoed on 
  one Mux?" 

Mojo says "Vetoed that it *will* occur, not that it *has* occured." 

Norainu takes Veto as the event won't occur. 

Shayd says "Okay, the issue is not vetoing the basics." 

Morris says "Just at a certain level, this doesnt involve joe runner 
  hits an arms shipment in Seattle. If the RPD or Admin thinks they are 
  going to do something earth shattering that would have ripples on the 
  other MUX, then that is shared and discussd." 

Zygmunt says "Inu, I think that what we are saying is that all such 
  events would happen on both MUXes simultaneously. Or not happen, as 
  the case may be." 

Shayd says "An example would be the assassination of Dunkelzahn or the 
  elimination of Aztechnology." 

Mojo nods at Morris. "Exactly. The problem is additionally made simpler 
  if global, epic events are avoided, except in extreme cases." 

Shayd says "Or to be more realistic, the timing of events in sourcebooks 
  such as Blood in the Boardroom." 

Morris says "Those would be major." 

Norainu nods and understands now. =) 

Mojo says "Elimination of Aztechnology? What?" 

Zygmunt says "I don't think that those events should be avoided. I think 
  that the dynamic setting of the SR world is part of the appeal." 

Shayd says "If I wanted to run a plot that wiped out every first born 
  male child" 

Morris says "In the past we have not jumped on the bandwagon if FASA 
  puts out a supplement that has plot info, I dont think that should 
  change." 

Shayd says "I'd need Bert's agreement on it. :)" 
Shayd says "Aztec was an elimination thing :)" 
Shayd says "Well, Morris, see, there's an obstacle" 

Mojo thinks the books should be followed to the letter, whenever 
  possible, but that's just him. 

Shayd says "Aztechnology Elimination was a plot that I was going to run 
  but abandoned on Seattle." 
Shayd says "If we want to follow a book but you don't, what does that 
  mean?" 
Shayd says "Who decides, if we are going to cooperate?" 

Morris says "Um, who decides if we are going to cooperate? Thats 
  contradictory." 

Rae doesn't have most of those books. 

Shayd grins. 
Shayd says "Who decides in the case of a disagreement on an issue?" 

Rae has no clue for instance what blood in the boardroom does. 

Shayd says "BitB outlines events including Fuchi's disbandment" 
Shayd says "The creation of Wu-Xing as a mega" 
Shayd says "The creation of Villiers International" 
Shayd says "Renraku's fall" 

Zygmunt says "I think that the Blood in the Boardroom is a good example. 
  It details the rise of a new megacorp and the death of another. There 
  are a lot of plots involved, and would probably be a lot of fun for 
  players on both MUXes." 

Shayd says "A bunch of big events." 

Morris says "Is this a book or supplement?" 

Shayd says "Many of them (especially goings on at Ares)" 
Shayd says "Supplement" 

Rock says "Why not have both MUXes follow the FASA timeline?" 

Shayd says "With Aurelius going to Cross Applied Technologies" 

Norainu says "If there's a disagreement about events, /hopefully/ the 
  people running the events can come to some decision." 

Shayd says "And Arthur Vogel being more important than Damien Knight" 
Shayd says "Being key to Detroit's milieu" 
Shayd says "We pretty much advocate following FASA's timeline through 
  2060/year 2000 real life" 

Zygmunt says "In the case of the MUXes, and BitB, I'd suggest dividing 
  the plot threads between the MUXes. Share out the plots, especially 
  since some are based in Seattle and others in Detroit." 

Shayd says "With alterations for PC events" 
Shayd says "(such as Tara Winters and the Draco Foundation HQ'd in 
  Detroit instead of Nadja Daviar as head of Draco Foundation)" 

Morris says "Ok, I think thats fine, most of that does not effect the 
  admining of either MUX. I would say as an example if I was in the 
  middle of a Aztech plot that Aztech is destroyed after it falls." 

Rock says "If both MuXes agree to that standard, it would seem there 
  would be less disagreement" 

Mojo thinks that both MUXes should agree for any alterations to occur. 
Mojo says "With disagreements following the party line of FASA output." 

Zygmunt says "That makes sense to me, for the most part, excepting where 
  PC events contradict FASA." 

Rock says "If FASA is used as a backbone, then I expect global 
  extra-city events would likely be concurrent" 

Shayd nods. 

Morris says "I think Major events, like the fall of a MegaCorp would be 
  best if they are from a supplement. If a admin wanted to remove a 
  MegaCorp that would probably some under closer scrutiny from the other 
  MUX." 

Shayd says "Yes, Morris, absolutely. :)" 

Rock says "Not to mention that people coming from TT to MUX have less to 
  unlearn" 

Rae agrees 

Mojo says "And, at the very least, the Megacorp might just be removed 
  from the city the MUX is in; it doesn't have to fully collapse.... it 
  might just cut down on some 'extraneous assets'." 

Morris says "Though many PCs dont have all the supplements, so dont know 
  half the stuff." 

Shayd says "I'll note for the record that speaking on behalf of 
  Detroit's "long-term strategy", we'd prefer to go with maximal 
  reliance on FASA supplements, with just enough variation to keep the 
  PCs guessing. Major changes won't be occurring for the next two years, 
  they'll be playing out in the FASA universe, HOWEVER, with permission 
  from both RPD's, I would allow a major change. But it would have to be 
  a unanimous agreement." 

Rock says "Well, if they're ignorant, then there is nothing to 
  contradict" 

Zygmunt says "Out of curiousity, does anyone think that having the two 
  MUXes be concurrent with each other is a bad thing?" 

Rock says "Concurrency is good" 

Rae doesn't. 

Norainu shakes his head. "I don't, as long as it doesn't create 
  problems." 

Rock says "I think there is an anticipation of creative disputes and 
  thus we should establish a standard to work from" 
Rock says "Who needs to change to become concurrent with whom, 
  basically. If FASA is the tiebreaker, then we should be able to 
  usually solve such disputes." 

Shayd says "Morris? Opinion?" 

Zygmunt says "There might be disputes about who is going to run 
  world-shaking plots, etc. That's where the RPDs need to sit down and 
  try to keep a balance on things, so that each MUX gets their fair 
  share of the big things." 

Rae stamps out the yakuza. *squash* Those kinna plots? 

Morris says "I agree with Rock, if we use FASA as a basis for 
  concurrency on the global level, then that will make it much easier to 
  implement and put less stress on the admins of each mux to keep track 
  of whats going on at the other MUX." 

Shayd says "Back when I was RPD Seattle, and Detroit was RPD Dan, we 
  hashed out certain "hunting grounds"." 
Shayd says "An example was: He had Chicago plots. We had Aztechnology 
  plots. What he decided for Chicago, worked for both MUXes." 

Mojo thinks that, unless the local events affect global events in a 
  serious way, then each MUX should have complete autonomy on what 
  occurs within. 

Shayd says "And vice-versa. That might work for this too." 

Zygmunt says "That would make sense." 

Shayd says "And I too agree with Rock." 

Rock says "I agree with Rock too 8)" 

Zygmunt says "We ready to move on to one of the other topics?" 

Lucifer says "Makes sense." 

Rock says "Sounds like we may be in agreement here." 

Norainu shakes his head. "Can't be that easy!" =P 

Rock says "Just wait for the next topics . . ." 

Zygmunt says "Or both? I think that cross-MUX plots and character 
  porting face some of the same pitfalls that should be resolved or at 
  least discussed." 

Shayd chuckles. 

Zygmunt says "The biggest one looming being the implementation of SR3" 

Shayd says "The third one is the easiest." 
Shayd says "It's simple to say: concurrance, with some problems that we 
  work out." 

Rock says "Woo-hoo SRIII rocks!" 

Shayd says "Porting and cross-MUX plots are another issue, and hand in 
  hand." 
Shayd says "Let's get to the meat of the matter by presenting the most 
  problematic issue first." 

Zygmunt says "O.K." 

Shayd says "I am a player on Seattle, and I have pissed off Fred." 

Norainu nods 

Shayd says "I port to Detroit--let's say that we allow porting for the 
  nonce. I fly there to hide." 
Shayd says "What then occurs? Must Fred port to get his revenge on me? 
  Because here on Detroit, we don't allow pkilling without a very good 
  reason." 
Shayd says "Much stricter thann Seattle's rules on same. Does Detroit 
  not port me because of this?" 

Mojo has thought about character porting for a long time, and has 
  concluded that he believes it to be a bad idea, for the exact reason 
  that Shayd presents. 

Rock says "There are two inversely related points to consider : 
  filtering to protect IC reality and admin sanity vs. accessibility to 
  generate richer RP." 

Zygmunt says "I think it would depend on his reasons, wouldn't it? If, 
  for example, you pissed Fred off by killing his whole family, and Fred 
  happens to have IC ties to an organized crime syndicate, then sure, we 
  port you. And the Detroit admins get the lowdown on the whole affair 
  and it becomes a plot that you might or might not survive. Using the 
  other MUX as a way of hiding from IC actions should be discouraged." 

Rae shrugs. I disagree with it for a different reason 
Rae says "the chargens are too drastically different." 

Norainu says "That would give Fred the choice to either let it die or go 
  after you IMO. I think that porting should be like borders to a 
  country. The MUX allowing the person into their game should be the one 
  to decide if they want them. In the case of Admin PC's, I think it 
  should be up to the RPD, if it's his/her character then someome 
  suitable to decide if that character is acceptable to teh Mux." 

Mojo disagrees with it because neither MUX should, in the eyes of the 
  players, become a haven from the other. 

Shayd says "Let's remove the issue of admin PCs" 
Shayd says "Forget the "I" in the example above, assume I'm just Bob the 
  Player." 

Norainu says "In addition, the approving admin can and hopefully will 
  get some of the lowdown on the porting char prior to approval." 

Rock I think porting sould require an admin intervention and have the 
  irght for disapproval of the port, i.e. it should not be as simple as 
  driving to another district. 

Rae says, "Take a player who dies on Seattle. Gotta write up a bg 
  anyway...why not go through CG on detroit, get all the goodies, higher 
  resources, and THEN port? 

Norainu says "The chargen is differn't, but that doesn't mean that it 
  can't be done simply on a karma basis. Rechargen and have XX number of 
  Karma points that the person spends. If you go to SEattle that deals 
  with SRII then that's what you go by obviously." 

Rae says "be easy enough to make up a generic reason for porting." 

Morris says "Actually, in regards to porting, I would like to see it as 
  an automatic feature, not something hand done. But in regards to the 
  actuall killing, that would fall into the area on the other MUX." 

Zygmunt says "Or, what if Fred ICly finds out where you went. And he has 
  a couple of hundred kay to hire an assassin to hunt you down. Should 
  the Detroit admins accept this plot and try to hunt down the PC? A lot 
  depends on who you are running from, IMHO. If you are running from a 
  gang, I'd say let them go, the gang is not going to chase them. But 
  the yakuza, or the mafia? I think that if the situation warranted it, 
  they would." 

Morris says "As to chargens, they would need to be similar and with the 
  conversion to SR3, that could be happening." 

Rock says "After SRIII is installed in both MUXI will they not agree in 
  priorities?" 

Zygmunt says "I think that the staffs of the two MUXes need to get 
  together and work out as close to the same thing in chargen as 
  possible, preferably SR3." 

Norainu says "In reply to that Zyg, that's why I say the approving Admin 
  should fidn this information out. If the character is the subject of 
  Yak/Sepoula/Mafia retaliation then the char should know that the 
  chance for retribution is there." 

Rae wold be much more inclined to allow porting if the cg's were the 
  same. karma rollover policies should also be the same. 

Shayd says "I have no intelligence as to whether or not Seattle's SR3 
  conversion will be to full priorities." 

Norainu says "I thought Seattle wasn't going to SR3 for some time? Until 
  they looked through it etc etc?" 

Zygmunt says "I think that resources is the real issue, isn't it?" 

Morris says "I dont know either, I'm the one who's going to be reviewing 
  that." 

Rock says "I wold suggest no porting until both MUXi are on the same 
  system." 

Morris says "And since you have allways said it takes a good bg to get A 
  resources, is that going to change?" 

Mojo says "What about the situation in which a player wants to rechargen 
  a character on the other MUX, because they were cacked, and were 
  unhappy with that?" 

Rock says "I need to go home. I will log back in about 25 minutes from 
  there, 'kay?" 

Zygmunt says "I think that dead is dead, Mojo. If you want to use a 
  similar background and play a similar PC, then that is your own 
  business if it is approved, but it would not be the same character. 
  And, if you ask me, is a little bit boring." 

Rae says, "Well, it matters anyway...a sam with resources b over here 
  kicks a sam with resources a over there... 

Shayd says "OK, pause on this for a minute, please...I think we're sort 
  of basically running around in circles and bringing up lots of 
  different issues all at once." 

Morris says "Mojo, I would feel that doesnt fit into the world of 
  cooperation. The can chargen on the other and not use the Porting 
  features." 

Rae nods. Dead is dead. 

Mojo says "But, the character died on the other MUX. How can they be 
  alive?" 

Zygmunt says "They're not. They are dead, and the player is playing a PC 
  who is similar, but different, from the dead PC." 

Morris says "No old karma, contacts, etc," 

Zygmunt says "Exactly. No gear, spells, no nothing." 
Zygmunt says "I have a suggestion to handle the difference in resources 
  between the chargens." 

Morris says "But Shayd is right, these are all detail that will needto 
  be worked out, but with what we have heard here, is this possible or 
  just forget it?" 

Norainu says "Just to comment on resources. If you were to use a Karma 
  Rollever system of Bob the STreet Sam ports to Seattle from Detroit 
  with 50 Karma. Well he goes over there startes through Chargen and 
  get's his 50 Karma to spend." 

Shayd says "So far we've broughht up the following issues: Priorities 
  and chargen systems. Karma rollover. Differing PKill and in fact--any 
  other differing policy/house rule that might be questionable or 
  different. Pursual of plots cross-mux. Pursual of PC plots/vendettas 
  cross-MUX. Dead PCs." 

Rae would agree to that Inu 

Shayd says "Let's pick one and see if we can't stick to that." 

Zygmunt says "Let's deal with priorities and chargen first then, if 
  nobody else minds." 

Shayd says "I'm going to say this:" 
Shayd says "If we aren't going to port, and we aren't going to have 
  cross-MUX plots, then I don't want to be concurrent." 

Morris says "Makes sense to me." 

Shayd says "I don't see enough of a tangible benefit to having to go 
  through approving world-events if we aren't going to have any other 
  parallel lines." 

Norainu says "Understandable." 

Shayd says "So okay, Priorities and Chargen." 

Zygmunt says "That makes sense. What doesn't make sense is a PC moving 
  from Detroit with certain cyberware, and showing up in Detroit without 
  it. There needs to be some kind of mechanic to handle that. I have a 
  couple of ideas." 

Mojo thinks that stats are utterly irrelevant in comparison to IC event 
  concurrency. 

Shayd says "Morris, I know that Seattle is still iffy on what they're 
  doing. Detroit is embracing SR3 as the book has it, and we're going to 
  still have two things from our original MUXI rules: Availability Cap 6 
  on items in chargen, and approval for magical and resource A 
  characters. We are probably going to allow alphaware in chargen." 
Shayd says "Do you know anything at this point where you can even 
  comment with any assurance on which way Seattle is going to jump?" 

Norainu says "THe only differnece then is SR2 vs. 3 rules and Resources 
  in Chargen right?" 

Morris says "Well, right now the plan is to look at SR3 chargen and 
  decide if we are goin gto use it as written. Since I just got SR3 
  yesterday and havent had time to read it, I cant comment on it." 

Zygmunt says "The easiest one would be for that character to have to 
  ICly give up the difference in nuyen from the chargens in gear in 
  order to make the move. That means if I am going from Detroit to 
  Seattle, and I have an A resources priority, I better figure out how I 
  am going to lose that much gear. If I've been playing for a while, 
  then maybe I have built up those kind of resources, if not, maybe I 
  have to sell off some of my cyber to pay for the move. If someone is 
  moving from Seattle to Detroit, I guess the only way to balance it is 
  to give them the nuyen when they chargen." 

Shayd waggles his fingers. "Depends on which things they are going to 
  do." 

Zygmunt says "Or, it's possible that the PC from Seattle has to suffer 
  the loss as a cost of porting. I just don't know if that's fair or 
  not." 

Shayd says "Okay...let's assume for the sake of discussion, that a rule 
  or series of rules or whatever are different between the two MUXI." 
Shayd says "It doesn't matter what rule it is. Let's just assume there 
  are chargen differences. Say alphaware is allowed here, and not 
  there." 
Shayd says "What happens when somoene wants to port from here to there? 
  Does the alphaware go away? Do they get more money in chargen to buy 
  other ware?" 

Rae says "Are we deciding those things now?" 

Mojo thinks the porting policy can be determined by each MUX. "As long 
  as it's not so restrictive as to make porting a worthless endeavor." 

Zygmunt says "I think that we are discussing how to resolve issues like 
  this, aren't we?" 

Mojo says "Detroit can have its porting policy, and Seattle can have its 
  own, as well." 

Norainu says "Basically, the way I see it is that you want the 
  privilidge of porting, you follow the rules of it, that's why I go 
  with the Karma Rolloever idea. If someone has to explain why they 
  don't have their Wired 32's and more, then they need to figure that 
  out as a PC." 

Rae nods. Gainging mux should be consistent though 

(New PL message (9/1) posted to 'Carnifex' by Carnifex: Nazis Update and 
  Finale) 

Zygmunt says "Here's my take on it. Both MUXes are going to be redoing 
  their chargens for SR3. I'd suggest a cooperative effort to try to 
  make the chargens as similar as possible, if not identical. Perhaps a 
  compromise on the resources would be in order?" 
Zygmunt says "And any other issues?" 

Norainu says "They may switch to SR3, Seattle that is, it hasn't been 
  decided." 

Rae would like the policies on karma rollover to be similiar 

Shayd says "Zygmunt, they'll never go for that." 

Zygmunt says "Have you asked them?" 

Norainu says "What about splitting the difference?" 

Zygmunt says "If, for example, they were willing to split the 
  difference, would you?" 

Shayd says "Yes, indirectly. Geoff is working with Dan on the SR3 
  conversion there, and well, it just isn't going to be a joint effort 
  from all indications. They have the right to self-determination." 

Zygmunt says "Even if Bert tells them otherwise?" 

Shayd says "I have no desire to do anything but start with SR3 and keep 
  going with SR3." 
Shayd says "It's not a matter of the BCAs." 

Morris says "Geoff and Dan are not the only ones working on the SR3 
  chargen." 

Shayd says "It's a matter of the desire they have to go over everything, 
  etcetera, and decide what they want to implement and what not." 

Mojo says "Perhaps runners in Detroit just are, on the average, more 
  affluent than those in Detroit? Sure, there's the issue of someone 
  making a character on Detroit then trying to port immediately to 
  Seattle, but I think Seattle admins are smart enought to notice such." 

Shayd says "I don't KNOW that they aren't going to do it one way or the 
  other." 

Zygmunt says "My question is, if they said they were willing to go with 
  resources A of 750,000 =Y=, what would you do? Would you agree to the 
  compromise?" 

Mojo thinks he just doesn't understand this big hang-up on stats. "More 
  important than any resources question, in my opinion, is the 
  possibility that some really old skool characters from Seattle might 
  move to Detroit, and dwarf the most experienced Detroit PCs." 

Shayd says "But, to be perfectly honest, I have no desire to wait for 
  the committees on Seattle to reach their discussion ends and wait for 
  them to figure out what they want to do. I want Shadowrun 3 
  implemented as soon as humanly possible, and furthermore, the large 
  majority of the players that I have talked to want to implement it 
  virgin and make house rules /afterwards/ instead of /beforehand/, 
  which is what I want to do." 

Rae would rather make em afterwards too. 

Zygmunt says "Well, until the two are running SR3, there isn't much to 
  talk about. And you didn't answer me, Shayd. Would you compromise?" 

Shayd says "Doubtful." 

Norainu says "I have to run, if somone could log this I would appreciate 
  it." 

Shayd says "It would depend on the arguments marshalled for compromise." 
Shayd says "On the other hand, I don't expect Seattle to implement our 
  rules on (for example) playerkilling, or our rules on Admin PCs, or 
  our rules on XYZ." 

Zygmunt says "Then I doubt that there is much hope for concurrency. What 
  if the only argument was to make the chargens the same? The rules that 
  you just listed have no bearing on concurrency." 

Shayd says "I can't make a committment based on a hypothetical." 

Norainu waves, and poofs. 

Shayd says "I would need to hear the reasons behind it. If the only 
  reason was to make chargen the same, the answer would be no." 

Mojo thinks that if there is no hope for concurrency because the two 
  MUXes want to have different resources values at chargen, something is 
  very wrong. 

Zygmunt says "I'm not asking you for a commitment. I was asking for you 
  to place yourself in that hypothetical, and make a decision. I'm sure 
  that you are familiar with the reasons why Seattle keeps resources 
  down. Are any of those reasons valid? Mojo, it's not about the 
  resources, it's about the unwillingness to compromise. Without that, 
  there isn't anything to talk about. Both sides are going to have to 
  give things up in order for this to work." 

Shayd says "I'm well aware of the fact that compromise is necessary and 
  am more than willing to engage in compromise as it becomes necessary. 
  The fact, though, is that on the SR3 conversion issue, we have certain 
  goals here that will be tough indeed to compromise on, if they become 
  sticking-points over there." 
Shayd says "I'm not interested so much in making sure that the chargens 
  are identical." 

Zygmunt says "Why do they have to be tough to compromise on? I'm sure 
  that the staff in Seattle has similar goals. Should they be forced to 
  abandon them in order to make concurrency work?" 

Shayd says "I'm interested in finding out how we are going to work 
  around the differences when they occur." 
Shayd says "No." 
Shayd says "I'm not saying that either. I'm not saying they need to be 
  identical to our chargen." 
Shayd says "I just want to know how we're going to handle any 
  differences as they occur if they exist." 

Morris says "One, we may be arguing over a moot point, and Two, if the 
  chargens do end up different, then it will come down to the porting 
  policies." 

Shayd says "i'd be glad to sit on one of the Seattle committees on SR3." 
Shayd says "Porting wise I'd say it should be pretty simple:" 
Shayd says "The receiving MUX should decide whether or not it is going 
  to take the character, and work out with the character and the staff 
  of the other MUX what exactly they will allow and/or disallow." 
Shayd says "In the event of plot conflicts such as Fred and Bob above, 
  the answer to that would be that Detroit wouldn't take the character, 
  because I don't approve of using the pkill policy as a shield." 

Morris says "Unless we get into extradition. Which really falls more 
  into cross-mux plits." 
Morris says "plots even" 
Morris says "So in all cases its the recieving MUXes choice on how to 
  handle it, just if there are identical chargens it makes it easier to 
  figure out." 

Rock says "Back"" 

Shayd says "That would seem to me to be the most logical course of 
  action, Morris." 

Rock says "Would someone page me a synopsis?" 

Zygmunt says "What you suggest is fine, Shayd, unless one MUXes policies 
  on porting inhibit it, where the other's encourage it. It's a hard 
  line to walk." 

Shayd says "Well, here's the thing." 
Shayd says "Not to put too fine a point on it, nor to disparage either 
  MUX's admins, but I am certain as my nickname is Shayd that there are 
  admins who have approved real stinkeroos on both MUXI." 

Mojo hehs. 

Shayd says "Despite Bert's statement about trusting Detroit's admins to 
  approve good PCs, even I have been known to accidentally approve 
  someone who looked good but turned out to suck balls." 
Shayd says "The converse is also true." 

Mojo says "Players have approved you, only to find that you suck balls?" 

Shayd swats Mojo :) 
Shayd says "You know what I mean :)" 

Rae laughs. :P 

Morris blinks, "Lets not go there. :)" 

Rock says "All this talk of ball sucking will kill any hopes of a PG 
  rating . . 8P" 
Rock says "Accidentally approving goobers does not seem unique to any 
  one MUX . . ." 

Shayd says "I think that we ought to leave it up to the receptions." 

Morris says "Thats true, but its allways the problem of you cant allways 
  tell a good RPer from the background, but usually you can tell a bad 
  background means a bad RPer." 

Shayd nods. 
Shayd says "The receivers, that is." 
Shayd says "Officially and publically, I think both MUXI will encourage 
  porting to their own MUX and away from their own MUX. 
  Cross-fertilization is good. Individual characters may be rejected or 
  modified." 

Mojo hunts down all Gworg variants. 

Shayd says "But I believe in doing that on a case-by-case basis, not on 
  an overall decision." 

Mojo nods in total approval. 

Morris says "As long as both MUXes feel the other has a good background 
  approving system and trusts the other to filter it, then thats all you 
  can ask. Bad ones will get through." 

Mojo says "And then will be shot." 

Shayd chuckles. "Another issue comes to light, then." 

Morris says "" 

Rock says "I still think crossing should be handled by an admin, not as 
  simple as entering the airport or something."" 

Shayd says "Detroit is in the process of deliberating--the early 
  staages--how to implement multiple characters on the MUX." 

Morris says "Thats one way to handle it Mojo, I usually find that 
  evolution in action works particularly well on them." 

Mojo says "It will have to be handled by an admin; the two MUXes are run 
  as different processes." 

Shayd says "As far as I know this is a staunch no no on Seattle and will 
  remain so." 

Morris says "Yes, but that would just mean they cant port both their PCs 
  over at the same time." 

Rae nods. I don't see that being a problem. 

Zygmunt says "I don't see why you would want to let people do that, 
  Shayd. I think it's a really, really bad idea. But that has nothing to 
  do with the conversation at hand." 

Shayd says "Okay, I just wanted to bring it up right now. Zyg, we can 
  discuss that later, it's still in megaplanning phase. :)" 

Zygmunt says "And I agree with the others, that it doesn't really affect 
  porting." 

Mojo smiles, and will happily argue with Zygmunt on that point for 
  hours. 

Zygmunt says "Happily." 

Shayd says "It's just something that comes up, basically. It affects on 
  Detroit more than on Seattle, but that's neither here nor there, you 
  are right." 

Morris says "But it is a good point, and I dont see it as effecting 
  relationship of the two MUXes/" 

Rock says "This may make some groan, but perhaps a nusiance factor in 
  crosses would work well. Say, a one- to three-day delay in transfers 
  or a week? This would reduce admin workload, I think, as people would 
  not be swapping back and forth with impunity. Of course, this would 
  make people cross only when they think it is important, but perhaps 
  that would defeat the purpose as some see it." 

Shayd says "Issues that become more of an issue are the ties to another 
  MUX's contacts." 
Shayd says "The NPC issue. This came to a head in my own case of Dylan @ 
  Seattle, and support/repercussions for whatt happened when he was 
  there and when he died." 

Mojo thinks that porting would be handled like apping a character. 

Shayd says "A Yak PC comes to Detroit, we accept him, he plays here, he 
  gets killed. Does the Yakuza there send other people over, or use its 
  NPC influence here to affect that?" 
Shayd says "Can PCs call upon external resources from NPC contacts 
  and/or organizations on the other MUX?" 
Shayd says "What mechanism do we use to decide this sort of issue?" 

Morris says "Thats handled by the admin running the plot on the mux 
  where it is being run. It could, but thats up to the mux that has that 
  on it. I think its a matter of being reasonable and fitting in with 
  the MUXes policies." 

Mojo would think that if PCs on Detroit could convince Seattle Yaks to 
  port over the issue, more power to 'em. 

Morris says "Basically the RPD of the hosting MUX has final say. If a 
  Seattle Mafia PC was killed on Detroit, the Detroit RPD would have the 
  say as to whether the Detroit mafia would take action." 
Morris says "Thats part of concurrency to, what the relations between 
  the Seattle and Detroit families." 

Zygmunt says "I disagree, Mojo. A PC porting from Seattle to Detroit 
  should not have any contacts unless he has ICly gone about obtaining 
  them, like if he is part of an org, or maybe his background has him 
  coming from Detroit originally. I'm not sure I agree, Morris. I think 
  that NPCs are up to the admin running the plot, unless there is the 
  potential to cause problems on the other MUX as a result. In the case 
  that Shayd is referring to, what if the admin in Seattle decided to 
  use NPC RussMaf to avenge Dylan's death? If that was a decision made 
  by the admins in Detroit, so be it. But the admins in Seattle should 
  not be making those decisions, since they affect PCs on both MUXes. 
  The question becomes a Seattle PC killed on Seattle by Detroit NPCs." 
Zygmunt :doesn't even want to think about an inter-MUX org war. 

Mojo laughs. 
Mojo says "Dakka dakka. Boom." 

Morris says "A cross continent org war." 

Rock says "IN the case of the Yaks, I would say that the Yak admins 
  would simply decide that between them . . . or not, depends if they 
  think it owuld be fun an interesting. I agree with MOrris on final say 
  resting with the MUX where the game effect is being considered. 
  Seattle could say 'your message was received and understood, proper 
  actions will be taken (or not)'" 

Shayd says "That was indeed the issue, the fact that the Russians here 
  /MIGHT/ have done something but that the administration on Seattle 
  denied that." 

Rock says "ICly there could be plenty of reasons for an intercity thing 
  to not occur." 

Zygmunt says "In this instance, the RM taking action in Seattle would 
  have ramifications between the RM and the yakuza in Detroit. Now who 
  gets to decide?" 

<OOC> Rae must go. 

Shayd says "G'nite, Rae." 

Morris says "I would also say that an org on one mux cant effect a PC on 
  another without approval of the RPD of the PCs MUX." 

Shayd says "There are issues here below the surface." 

Mojo thinks it would be really weird if he could log on to Seattle and 
  start killing PCs because of slights made against the Seoulpa Rings. 

Rock says "Perhaps if all admins agreed to view their Head 
  Wizard/Director as an court of appeal. Perhaps if the Detroit Yak 
  admin felt strongly that the Detroit Yaks would take a noticeable 
  action, then said admin could appeal 'up the chain' if the Seattle Yak 
  blew him/her off?" 

Shayd says "Part of it is, in essence, /caring/." 
Shayd says "If I may illustrate an example?" 

Mojo performs the Care Bear Stare. :) 

Zygmunt says "Think of it this way, Mojo. A PC in Detroit does something 
  against the Soh, then ports to Seattle. Should your org have any say 
  in if/what type of retaliation took place?" 

Shayd says "There was a situation involving a Yak Oyabun here who was a 
  member of Clan Jade Panther that was pissing off the Russian Mafia 
  here." 

Zygmunt says "We should have killed him. :P" 

Shayd says "Some action was being taken by the Russians here the 
  involved the higher management of Clan Jade Panther." 
Shayd says "And so I called up voice the admin of the Yakuza on Seattle, 
  to ask him what they would do, conceding ultimate authority on such 
  matters in this case to him." 
Shayd says "His entire reaction was, It's your MUX, do whatever you 
  wwant on it." 
Shayd says "Concurrency .must. have some caring to it." 

Mojo says "It" 

Morris says "Well, there was no concurrency when you called him. His 
  answer was correct." 

Mojo says "It's up to the Soh PCs in Seattle." 

Shayd says "Ah. but nominally, Morris, there was." 

Mojo says "And the Soh Admin on Seattle." 

Shayd says "There was concurrency up until two months ago when I 
  suspended it." 

Zygmunt says "You can't expect every admin on each MUX to care about it 
  to the same degree, with or without concurrency. And if there is no 
  Soh admin or PCs there?" 

Rock says "In that person's defense, if no crossing is expected to 
  occur, i.e. no relation between the realities of teh MUXes, then it is 
  a reasonable answer." 

Shayd says "But there _was_ that was my point." 

Mojo would never have NPCs appear in Seattle, on the request of a Detoit 
  PC, if the PC thinks it's not important to port him/herself, and would 
  advise that nothing in Seattle be done about it. 

Rock says "With the advent of porting, I suspect people would care 
  more." 

Shayd says "The point actually becomes somewhat moot that the CJP is 
  eliminated here and there is no concurrent organization on either 
  place." 
Shayd says "But it does open up the issue of what happens in the future, 
  and what the cross-MUX position on NPC backing is." 

Rock says "how specific does such a policy need to really be?" 

Shayd says "Anyway, with Rae and Inu gone and Bert and Greg missing, I 
  move that we close the meeting on this point and consider it strongly 
  between now and when next we meet." 

Morris says "Handle it like the org would, the Detroit org admin 
  requests something from the Seattle org admin." 

Shayd says "Which meeting I propose for next week at 9PM." 

Rock says "Sorry, I can not normally make Sunday evenings due to a TT 
  game."" 

Morris says "Can we make it earlier in the afternoon? Do we have west 
  coast people here?" 

Zygmunt says "I can't be here earlier next week, sorry." 

Rock says "Satruday?" 

Shayd says "Saturdays are bad for me, same problem you have on Sundays, 
  a TT committment." 

Morris says "Actually, never mind, I'm out of town next weekend." 

Zygmunt says "No good, I'll be away on Saturday." 

Mojo says "Perhaps next weekend is a bad time." 

Rock says "Is there a good weekday?" 

Mojo thinks email is a good way to discuss the matter, as well, but hey. 

Shayd says "Yeah, we can coordinate through @mail." 

Zygmunt says "sounds good." 

Rock says "BTW, when will SRIII chargen be up and running here?" 

Zygmunt says "Good question. And I'd like to object to doing anything 
  alphabetically. :)" 
Zygmunt grins. 

Rock says "I agree how about by PC height? I was going to try a PhysAd 
  Troll . . . 8)" 

Shayd presumes that SR3 will be up within 3, 4 months. 
Shayd has heard as many as six. Coding work begins shortly. 

Rock sets his watch alarm for 6 months 
Rock says "Goodnight everyone, it was a nice, calm, intelligent 
  discussion." 

Shayd nods. 

Zygmunt says "Seeya, Rock" 

Shayd says "A good start--gnite" 
Shayd says "Returning you to playerstart" 

Zygmunt says "You want to send me back to, Shayd?" 

Shayd says "Well, taht was a start" 

Mojo nods. 
Mojo thinks that this is a bad job for him. 

Morris nods, "Not too bad"
