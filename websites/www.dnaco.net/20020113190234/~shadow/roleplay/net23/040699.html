<P><I>The word Net23, encased in a shimmering, glossy corporate logo appear on your tridscreen. It fades out and zooms into a newsdesk, at which Net23 anchor Ali Harambee X is sitting. He smiles at the camera and the words "NET23 SPECIAL UPDATE" play across the screen. He begins to speak.</I>

<P>"A scant few minutes before the attack on Lone Star covered earlier, a mysterious magical phenomenon occured at the intersection of Union and Alaskan."

<P><I>The clip begins, showing that above the Aquarium Plaza at the Intersection of Union and Alaskan, a glow can be seen. It slowly floats higher and higher into the sky, all while growing larger in size. After several moments, this glow appears to be a replica of the Sun. It illuminates a two city block radius like it is noon, and can be seen almost at the edge of the International District. It hoves in the air for a minute before it winks out of existence.</I>

<P>"The ball left a huge heat signature, apparently emanating off the sidewalk and heading up, finally dissipating. A magically active observer commented that it was a "big reflection," a "shamanic spell signature that reflects the Sun." It is not known at this time if this is connected in any way to the attack on Lone Star."

<P><I>Ali goes on to other topics, and Net23 fades to commercial again.</I>
