        <p><b>NEWS ADMIN APPLICATIONS </b></p>
        <p>When a position in the administrative staff is open on Shadowrun MUSH, 
          we will post job openings on the General bboard with instructions on 
          how to apply, and who to apply to. As a general guideline, in addition 
          to other qualifications, potential staffers must have a minimum of three 
          months' experience as a player on Shadowrun MUSH. If there is no opening 
          posted, and you still want to help, you'll want to contact the appropriate 
          director (in 'news admin directors') and inquire if they need any help. 
          Also, something to note, that MIGHT discourage some of you: ROLEPLAYING 
          STAFF CANNOT PLAY PLAYER CHARACTERS! It is advisable to speak with the 
          Directors personally before applying.</p>
        <p><b>NEWS ADMIN DIRECTORS</b></p>
        <p>Here is some additional info on our Directors... </p>
        <p>MORRIS: Bosscat and Site Dude since 9/94. Shadowrun MUSH hardcode and 
          a decent softcoder, too. Likes being scritched behind ears, dominating 
          universes, and saucers of milk. </p>
        <p>MATT: Director, Roleplaying. Admin since 12/94, originally a member 
          of PHStaff but has bounced about, doing the PHA/Judge thing for several 
          years, did the RPC thing twice. Yadda yadda, makes a mean chili, yadda 
          yadda. </p>
        <p>DAN: BDirector, Admin since 5/96. Between the Seattle and Detroit Shadowrun 
          sites Dan has held the positions of Matrix RPA, Magic Chief, Roleplaying 
          Director, Head Wiz, BCAdmin and BCChief. Likes candlelight dinners, 
          long walks on the beach, and insanely lengthy connect times. Approachable 
          and friendly, unless you made him miss Babylon 5. </p>
        <p>JASON: Director, Player Help. Admin since ca. 3/94. Softcoder and question 
          answerer, scholar, gentleman, and really huge Klingon-type with a neat 
          battlecruiser. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS ADMIN CHIEFS</b></p>
        <p>Here is some additional info on our Chiefs... </p>
        <p>LYAM: Plots Chief, Roleplaying. The guy to talk to about Shadowruns, 
          sorting out teams and getting jobs from Mr J. Known to be a storytelling 
          freak and to dislike excessive dice-rolling. Sarcastic English bastard, 
          grammar freak. Loves good RPers, milk and cookies and Cricket. Hates 
          twinks, Sunny Delight and Beavis and Butthead. </p>
        <p><b>NEWS ADMIN STRUCTURE </b></p>
        <p>At the very top of the administrative structure here is Morris (aka 
          "Bosscat"). He is the gentleman responsible for the site (http://www.dnaco.net 
          for more information on this company). As the Head Wizard, Morris is 
          Where The Buck Stops. </p>
        <p>Underneath Morris, there are three major administrative departments 
          on the MUSH: Building/Coding, Player Help, and Roleplaying. Each has 
          one Director, and the Roleplaying staff further divides its leadership 
          amongst three Chiefs. There are also a large number of admins who form 
          the majority of the volunteer staff which makes Shadowrun MUSH the great 
          place that it is. </p>
        <p>BUILDING/CODING staff is headed up by Dan. It is the department responsible 
          for everything which is created on the MUSH code-wise, in addition to 
          being the group that all Builders deal with regularly. This department 
          is what created the very ground you are walking on. Virtually, at least. 
        </p>
        <p>PLAYER HELP is the "public relations" group of the MUSH and so much 
          more. Responsible for everything from screening backgrounds and assisting 
          newbies to maintaining communications paths throughout the staff and 
          fielding complaints and questions, without this department the MUSH 
          would collapse under its own weight. At its head is Jason, with Scott 
          backing him up. </p>
        <p>ROLEPLAYING is the department responsible for all aspects of the MUSH 
          which revolve around the Shadowrun universe and roleplaying issues within 
          it. Because the world is so diverse and complex, this department is 
          broken down into several divisions. </p>
