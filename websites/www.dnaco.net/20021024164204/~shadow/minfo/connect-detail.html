<h6>What do you need to connect to a MU*?</h6>

In the past, people learned about MU* games from friends, who could show
them the ropes, or through certain newsgroups, where people were available
to answer questions. The majority of people used Unix (or similar) systems,
so a question like "How do I connect to a MU*?" could easily be answered in
a Usenet message or a FAQ (frequently-asked questions) document.

<P> With the proliferation of WWW information and use, many people are now
learning about MU* games through Web pages. These pages usually have a
"Connect to the game" link, but people unfamiliar with how to connect to MU*
games often get an error message when they try to use such links. People now
access the Internet from a variety of systems, not just Unix. Many of them
are new to the Internet, and may need more detailed help on connecting to
MU* games.

<P> There are two methods of connecting to a MU*: telnet, or a client
program specifically designed to play these games. Versions of both exist
for most operating systems. Most Web browsers do not incorporate the telnet
protocol into their programming. However, most Web
browsers can be configured to launch a telnet program</A> when you select a
<strong>telnet://</strong> link.

<P> Most client programs can't be used with a Web browser. But as they are
specifically designed for playing these games, they offer many useful
features that are unavailable in a telnet program. It is suggested that you
read all of the following information before deciding which method you'd
prefer to use.

<h6><A NAME="whattelnet">What is Telnet?</A></h6>

Telnet is a multi-use protocol that has been around for over a decade.
Telnet makes a connection between your machine and another, remote
machine. For instance, if you have a user account on that machine, telnet
allows you to access it as though you were directly connected to the remote
machine. While telnet began as a Unix function, versions now exist for most,
if not all, other types of systems (Windows, Mac, Dos, etc.)

<P> Telnet can be used for much more than just MU* games. Prior to the
advent of the Web, it was the main way to access resources like library
catalogues and other databases of information, many of which are still in
use. It can also be used to connect to Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), and
other types of games servers. Telnet allows multiple people to be connected
to the same resource simultaneously.

<h6><A NAME="needtelnet">Do I Need Telnet to Play a MU* Game?</A></h6>

As there was already an existing, commonly-used Internet protocol that
allowed multiple people to connect to a resource on a remote machine, the
programmers of MU* games incorporated the telnet protocol into these games
when creating them. Telnet, or a client program that makes use of the telnet
protocol, is required to access a MU* game.

<h6><A NAME="yourtelnet">Telnet For Your System</A></h6>

As mentioned above, versions of telnet exist for most, if not all, operating
systems, such as DOS, Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, Atari, Unix, VAX and
Linux. If you're only interested in telnet to play MU* games, you should
first read the section on client programs, as you might prefer one of those.

<h6><A NAME="deftelnet">Other Definitions of Telnet and its Uses</A></h6>

The following links provide other definitions of telnet and how it's used.
Most assume the use of a Unix system and are not specific to MU* game use,
but they might help you understand telnet a little better. Versions of
telnet exist for systems other than Unix.

Most Web browsers can be configured to launch telnet when you select a
<strong>telnet://</strong> link. Just having the software installed on your
computer isn't enough, you need to tell your Web browser what software you
have and where it is, so it can start up the appropriate helper application
when you select a link.

<h6><A NAME="whatclient">What is a Client Program?</A></h6>

Players of MU* games use the term <STRONG>client</STRONG> to refer to
programs specifically designed for the play of MU* games. MU* clients
incorporate the telnet protocol for connecting, but include features that
are particularly useful for MU* players.

<h6><A NAME="whyclient">Why Use a Client Program?</A></h6>

Because MU* client programs are specifically designed for playing MU* games,
they include commands and features that make play easier or more enjoyable
than when using straight or "raw" telnet.

<P>Some of the features a MU* client might provide:
<UL>
<LI>simultaneous connections to multiple worlds and/or characters
<LI>separation of input and output (the screen is divided so that what you 
      type is in one screen area, and what you see is in another)
<LI>formatted input and output based on individual preferences (highlighted
      with colour or bold text, indented paragraphs, wrapped lines, etc.)
<LI>output formatted into pages, so it doesn't scroll by too fast to read
<LI>creation of macros (key sequence "short forms") for your frequently-used
      commands
<LI>save copies of code or description to your account as text files
<LI>upload code or description text files from your account
<LI>save records (called logs) of meetings, role-playing sessions or 
      conversations to your account as text files
<LI>repeat the previous X lines of output to allow you to reread
<LI>repeat commands to save typing the same thing over and over, or to fix
      errors

<P> These are a few suggestions for where to get more help connecting to a
MUSH, setting up software, etc.

<h6><A NAME="readall">Read All These Pages</A></h6>

For the sake of length, the information on this topic has been split into
several different Web pages. Please skim them all to check if your problem
or question is covered. A complete list of topics is provided in an <A
HREF="connect.html">index page</A>.

<h6><A NAME="sysadmin">Consult Your System Administrator</A></h6>

For questions specific to your network connection (such as whether your
service provider's telnet accomodates port addresses), the best person to
consult is someone who knows your network. There are hundreds, maybe
thousands, of providers and ways to connect to the Internet, it's impossible
for this document to cover all the possibilities.

<P> Most service providers have a department or contact person who handles
user questions. This might be called Help Services, Technical Support,
Customer Support, etc. If you pay a service provider, you have every right
to ask for assistance in making use of all the services you're paying for.
