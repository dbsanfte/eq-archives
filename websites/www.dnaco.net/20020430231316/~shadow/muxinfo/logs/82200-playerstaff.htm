  &lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Note for the new folks: Page me when 
  you want to 
  speak, I'll tell you who you can speak after. Try to address the topic 
  that's currently being discussed, though, and after it's been discussed 
  for a bit, I'll close that topic and we can move on to another one. The 
  general idea is: Staff-player relations. Problems with Staff? How can we 
  improve them?&quot;</p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I think our largest problem here is the same as ever. The 
  relations between player and staff boil down to this: the staff views the 
  majority of players as lazy twinks and cheaters, and the players view the 
  staff as being lazy, and fear that the RPAs are out to get them. It's been 
  like that since I've been here. Is there a way to fix it? I don't know. 
  Maybe crack down on making fun of or complaining about PCs on the admin 
  channels? Maybe do things to build trust in the playerbase? I mean, it has 
  to come from staff first, and then the players can follow. You guys 
  volunteered to take up a position in which you make yourself responsible 
  for players enjoying this place. Is this a player-centric view? Of course. 
  I'm a player. But I was staff once too. I know how it goes. Someone 
  +judges. Staff makes fun of them on the StaffChat channel. Or it gets 
  ignored. Rarely, it's answered. Staff complains as PCs all idle in their 
  apartments. Staff maintains that dropping plots in people's laps is not 
  their job. Then PCs all get together in bars, and idle... Which is worse? 
  Idling in their apartments, or idling in someplace where they think they 
  might have a chance of getting a plot, only to never see one come?&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I dont think thats it at all.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;How can staff be lazy and to fear that RPAs are out to get 
  them?&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Perhaps have more specialized staff positions. Hire people 
  specifically to answer +Judges, and nothing else. Hire people specifically 
  to run plots and nothing else. Hire some folks just to handle queues, and 
  nothing else. Then hire people who are willing to do it all, like we 
  expect all of our current RPAs to do.&quot; </p>
<p>Brujo says &quot;You know how many +judges we get in a day?&quot; </p>
<p>Brujo says &quot;No more than 4&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;So much for any sort of order.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;For my part, I think a lot of the P/S relations could be 
  improved by 3 important steps. 1)Players have got to understand that we're 
  here on a volunteer basis, and we can't get to everything right away. In a 
  standard game, it's 1 GM per 4-6 pcs. Here, it's more like 1 per 20-40, 
  most of the time. So please, cut the RPStaffers some slack. 2)Staff's 
  gotta, in large part, do the same, and much of that goes through gangs and 
  orgs. In the time I've been in or worked closely with multiple orgs and 
  gangs, one thing keeps cropping up: Staff hits one group, largely ignoring 
  that group's ability to defend itself, then uses that group's NPCs to hit 
  another, and so on, and so on... no offense, guys, but if we're so 
  pathetic as to be the easy targets we are when a 'neat' plot comes up, how 
  are we expected to do anything but shine runners' boots? Orgs, even 
  'pissant' orgs like gangs, can be an avenue for runners to get hired, and 
  they can be a foil for the abilities of a runner team... but to do either, 
  we need to be both respected as the group that runs those particular 
  streets (and there's a reason it's us and not some other schmoes) and 
  b)given the leeway to do it. 3)RPS has to remember 1 thing, above and 
  beyond all else: You guys are the ones the players see most. Honestly, how 
  many BCStaffers you think they interact w/a day? You guys are the MUX's 
  public relations. PLEASE remember that.&quot; </p>
<p>Eclipse says &quot;Re: Specialized staff positions: One of the largest problems 
  with this is burnout. It is very difficult to keep interested in just 
  doing things like judges or queues. It would be possible if you could do a 
  PC and a queue or +judge person since then you have a way to burn off 
  steam (unlike most RPAs who can run plots). The problem at that point 
  becomes concern about IC/OOC crossover and cheating.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;And I'm telling people when they can 
  speak, Dorn. 
  I don't really mean for it to be -just- one person talking, I just don't 
  want -everyone- talking at once.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; Airashii says, &quot;The biggest problem we have is communication. 
  We 
  have players who sit idle waiting for runs to come, and we have staffers 
  who sit idle waiting for players to come.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;A few days ago, I +judged needing to do some basic electronics 
  repair rolls. It said 2 judges were notified, and on +staff all the staff 
  I saw was on duty and availble. I waited two hours that night (technically 
  several days at this point) and got no response ever. Today, another 
  player who has been here longer and is more active than myself, logged on 
  got someone to come and do the rolls in under 5 minutes...Now, I'm pretty 
  calm and reasonable, and I've staffed elsemu* and know how trying being 
  staff can be, but that really bothered me. And so as not to annoy staff, I 
  didn't keep pushing the issue. That's one example of why there's 
  'perceived' favoritism here. I'm new and got nothing. The other is 
  old-school and got it done immediately. That's a problem imho. And to 
  bring up what Brujo said about getting 4 +judges a day...if it's 'only 4' 
  a dya, why do they so often go unanswered? And maybe people have stopping 
  using +judge for that very reason.&quot; </p>
<p>Brujo says &quot;Most of us log on at work, so if we dont get its cause we 
  are 
  bussy :(&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Anna. I try to respond with at least a 
  'Sorry, no 
  one can take that right now,' if I can't. That's something that staff 
  needs to do, it's a good point, at least acknowledge that the +judge was 
  seen. </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I know I don't +Judge as often as I'd like to because I think 
  it's pointless to bother.&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;A lot of the problem has to do with the perceived: He/she/it 
  has 
  the admins in the pocket and I can't ever hope to do anything about it. 
  People are afraid that if they even ask or talk to someone about something 
  that bothers them that they'll get in trouble &amp; sitebanned or @nuked or 
  be 
  labelled a troublemaker. Also, a continuing problem that seems to come up 
  is the GM-railroad factor. Now, some Because I say so, is needed. But a 
  lot of times, I've been on plots &amp; runs where the only real decision I can 
  make is who to shoot and how to allocate my KP &amp; CP. And that no matter 
  how well the players do, we'll end up exactly where and how the GM wanted 
  us. And I agree with Meg, that so often Orga &amp; Gangs are used &amp; abused 
  as 
  a deus ex machina. Thats what corps &amp; LStar is for.. not PC groups.. </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;Usually, I end up waiting until an admin I know comes on and 
  asking them to do the rolls.. so I know the feeling. </p>
<p>Eclipse would suggest only using +judge for things that require immediate 
  attention. Use the queues through means of +jmail to facilitate aynthing 
  such as B/R and other such things. Yes: there are problems with teh queues 
  at the moment, we need to handle additional queues per staffer. I'm guilty 
  of the same (not handling queues). This is something that we, as a 
  staff-group, need to resolve. However, +judges should really be utilized 
  primarily for immediate needs and not things such as &quot;Hey. I need to do 
  a 
  healing roll&quot; or &quot; Hey.. I'm gonna be doing B/R as of today until 
  two 
  weeks from now. Can I do my rolls?&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I'd have to say that, although that might be you 
  personal opinion Dorn, thats not what I think is the clog in the 
  player-staff relationship (even though in my opinion there isnt a real 
  problem). I think you're talking about alot of misconceptions regarding 
  staffers and players. I know that I've been busy all day doing IC stuff 
  even though I havn't RP'd once. I know that the staffers have been busy 
  this morning with scenes and with building new areas for our wonderful 
  city. To address the idle problem you're refering too (again, I try to 
  find things to keep me busy instead of watting for something to start) The 
  problem is that no one wants to initiate anything. No ones really lazy. 
  Just they're not really out-going, or have created a 'Hack n' Slash' 
  character who isnt designed for roleplaying outside of his ShadowTeam or 
  gang, and have imprisioned themselves in a lack of RP. I'd suggest those 
  people set up a TinyPLOT of something simple like a pit fight in Banshee. 
  I think we need more activity from the majority (IE: Players) before we'll 
  see more activity from the staffers. If you get 4 +judges a day, why do we 
  need 30 judges? If there was a greater demand for there legitamite 
  services....&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;The reason is because the majority 
  of admin work 
  isn't +judges. It's @mails, queues, fallout from previous plots. For 
  example, I have 158 messages in my mailbox. If I don't log on for a day, I 
  can expect about 15 at least when I log back on. That's what most of our 
  time is spent handling.&quot; </p>
<p>Sprite says &quot;Ok..here's what i've seen. I've seen three or four different 
  admins come into my characters world dropping really neat plots...and the 
  plots have taken a really long time to go anywhere in every case. I'm not 
  sure if there is a way to wrap up a plot in under a month. I think a month 
  cap on time for wrapping something up is a reasonable expectation on the 
  part of players. With occasional exceptions of course...but having plots 
  be introduced and then just waiting for them to go somewhere for a quarter 
  of a year...three months seems to be more of a rule at this point than an 
  exception. ////////On the staff side of things I have also seen one 
  staffer absolutely gone after by a player with both barrels blazing when 
  they tried to introduce a little action and plot into myself and another 
  characters lives. I was up for it. The other player didn't want the hassle 
  and decided that calling the staffer names was a good way to get out of 
  it. I think that sucks. Perhaps players should take it on the chin more or 
  jump into plots more aggressively and that would solve part of the problem 
  as well.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Alright...Let me start with the 4 +judges a day. IF there are 
  only four,why are they hardly ever answered?Maybe there are so few of them 
  because they know it would take a long time or it would never be answered 
  at all. Now...about plots,I try to start my own by doing whatever means 
  necessary. I've talked with people about doing anything..messing with a 
  gang,robbing a electronics store,just any kind of miscellaneous stuff 
  because mostly,the only plots your gonna get are the ones you create for 
  yourself. I'm not good as a GM so I prefer to think up the ideas and 
  distribute them instead of running them. Its hard for me to meet up with 
  people because most of them spend their time inside of a hotel room where 
  I can't locate them at all.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I'd do anything that a runner could think up..&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Eclipse says, &quot;One suggestion for those people in 
  line: Try to 
  have your comments typed up and read to go when it's your turn.&quot; </p>
<p>Sprite says &quot;Maybe some kind of requirements for what a staff is required 
  to perform and someone to manage the staff is in order. A list of maybe 
  one plot a month done from start to finish and so much work on the 
  queues..nothing heavy duty. Maybe staff positions need to be staff 
  positions and not a status symbol to wear on your lapel rather than 
  actually having to do something. Anyway...thats all. And I love plots. I 
  will always drop what I am doing to mjump into them even if it means bad 
  things for sprite as long as its IC. And the plots I am waiting to get 
  wrapped up with I am very excited about. Anyhoo thats about it.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;On what Sprite said: The one time I my team tried 
  to 
  start something ourselves due to a complete server-wide lack of plot a 
  little over a year ago, it was met with harsh and brutal consiquences from 
  the judges. Now, we did have 3 judges come to our +judge, but at the same 
  time, even to this day I get a little edgey when I think of trying to 
  initiate something myself.&quot; </p>
<p>Jane says &quot;What I think would be helpful with the +judge command and 
  @mailing various queues is to develop some sort of guide to explain to 
  people more fully what is and isn't appropriate to ask for. People ask for 
  outlandish things that aren't reasonable in the queues. For every simple 
  and well justified skillraise there's two to three requests for something 
  more technical that may or may not involve into a plot or might have to do 
  with a cybersurgery, b/r request, etc. When asking for complicated things, 
  if you want your request handled immediately you have to decide a few 
  things first... can the admin do this when you're not online? If yes, note 
  that. If no, list what you think your availability will be over the next 
  few days. If it's something out of the ordinary, cite a bit of SR 
  reference material with page numbers. Like you're doing legwork. Write up 
  how much you're going to spend with bribes. Let the admin know which 
  skills you think are relevant to be rolled. Do you insist on rolling them 
  yourself or do you trust the judge enough to roll for you and send you the 
  info? That's just a little thing. Reduce your request to the simplest 
  level possible. Give background information. One thing that slows the 
  queues down more than anything is the admin having to stop and write out 
  an @mail to the PC to get info to sort things out.&quot; </p>
<p>Jane says &quot;And give dbref #'s too. Admins aren't omnipotent. ;)&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan interjects two comments: Sprite: Very good idea. 
  I think 
  I'll push for that to be implemented; minimum staff requirements, what 
  -must- be done in order to keep the position, because you're right, we 
  shouldn't have people on staff that are just sitting there and chatting. 
  Jane: That would help too, to make sure things go to the right places to 
  get processed the fastest. I know for me, when I'm a PC, though, I like 
  rolling for myself. I don't really know why, and it's not a matter of 
  trust. </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Problem: Staffers idle, waiting for players to do something. 
  Players idle, waiting for staffers to do something. Solution: Staffers, 
  do something. Take the initiative. You're a volunteer. You volunteered to 
  do something. So do something. Ultimately, the responsiblity for plots 
  lies with staff. If players could give out Karma or some other sort of 
  reward, then yes, I could see an argument being made for PCs having 
  responsiblity to do stuff. With them being able to establish an immediate 
  reward, they really have no strong incentive for other PCs to get involved 
  in their player-run plots. I think another immediate thing that could be 
  done to improve player/staff relations would be to remove the Player/Staff 
  Relations staff position. It's been my personal experience that the 
  mediation of player/staff disputes amounts to the decision that the 
  staffer is right, and the player is wrong, and if the player doesn't like 
  it, they can play somewhere else. That is the strongest detriment to trust 
  between players and staff I've ever heard of. We need to ditch the &quot;go 
  play somewhere else&quot; as a tool for &quot;winning&quot; arguments. Staff 
  sholdn't 
  think of that as a way to &quot;win&quot; arguments. I think that if staff looks 
  at 
  an argument as something they can &quot;win&quot;, they've already damaged 
  player/staff relations. If a player has a problem, it should be staff's 
  job to see why they have a problem, and try to come up with a reasonable 
  middle ground, rather than just labelling that person a whiner, or twink, 
  and telling them to go play someplace else. Nathan has a real talent for 
  this. People suggest things to him, and he suggests reasonable compromises 
  or alternatives. People suggest things to other staffers, and it turns 
  into a yes/no, I'm right/you're wrong battle.&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;One suggestions is: Communication. Have staffers tell people 
  in 
  general what is going on.. kind of like a state of the MUX. Get the 
  players to see that you are doing things... We coded this.. changed that.. 
  worked on this.. this is what we want to do within the next month.. this 
  is what we want done within six months. It helps opens up the lines of 
  dicussions about things.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Without the players having the ability to establish a reward, 
  blah blah blah. One typo makes the whole thing senseless.&quot; </p>
<p>Amber says &quot;Players do give out karma. +nom.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I think another problem revoloving around idling 
  for 
  players is what I was saying earlier. Alot of players feel that its 
  against the rules to start there own IC things, and if they do the admins 
  gonna look down on them because of it.&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn doesn't think adding specialized admin is the way to go (refering to 
  Dorns suggestion) &quot;But at the same time, I agree with the +judge calls. 
  I 
  have tried twice to +judge, neither were answered, so instead I wait to 
  page-bother an admin I know is approachable (and that is all of them) 
  usually trying to stay in their areas of work. The concern I see, and what 
  makes me unwilling to jump full steam into plots I see trailing out there 
  or scenes...is I have yet to see a single plot finish. Staffers need to 
  make a solid commitment of time when they start to be an admin...Make sure 
  they are very aware of what they are walking into. Never seeing an end of 
  a plot frustrates me.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Right... Be in my plot, and I'll give you a half a point of 
  Karma. Whoopee.&quot; </p>
<p>Amber says &quot;Better than spending it on a cliche I haven't rped with this 
  week. :) Fit me in.&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn notes also she has been involved in several PrP's...also dropped due 
  to approving admin's disappearance. :( So some players are trying. </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I'm trying my best to start plots but I don't have staff 
  acknowledgement..&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik watches a bit. As one of the most-around Admins 
  and RPAs, 
  with regards to the various +judge's, part of the problem is that a lot of 
  us are on from work. A lot of it is that some things RPAs don't want to 
  touch. PvP in the evening before you go to dinner isn't fun to anyone. 
  While Dorn, RPAs need to listen, the problem is that sometimes the PCs are 
  too convincing. I can give you many staffers that just give up and walk 
  away. Eventually, there has to be a point where a PC is a PC and a RPA is 
  a RPA. An arguement and yelling should not be a reason to abandon your 
  better judgement as a RPA. Giving in because people whine is what makes 
  RPAs disparate and burns them out. </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;So I'm basically wondering if I should try and do it..because 
  if 
  I do,I prolly won't get any rewards like karma points,yen and the like for 
  spending my time to RP it all out.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Flynn. That's true. I'm guilty of that 
  recently, 
  as I started a couple of plots before I had to be gone for a couple of 
  weeks, but I do plan on finishing them now. As far as PrPs, you don't 
  really need staff acknowledgement just to run a PrP; the only point where 
  you need that is if you want money as a reward. You can log it and send it 
  in just for karma without needing to get approval ahead of time. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;And also, RP is its own reward. There 
  shouldn't be 
  a reason to &quot;get&quot; something for your RP. There are tons of MU*s just 
  based 
  on people RPing. No dice. No karma. No nuyen. No winning. Just the 
  enjoyment of RP.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I dont see why everything has to be a drawn out plot 
  either? Whatever happened to the shadowruns that get wrapped up in a solid 
  7 or 8 hours? Who says a plot has to take forever. I'd personally like to 
  see alot more little tiny stuff for just a couple karma but if fun, IC, RP 
  and eats up time.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Bannik, that was the &quot;go play somewhere else&quot; argument 
  in 
  disguise.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Nah, he's not saying to leave.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;He's citing them as an example, saying 
  that RP 
  should be its own reward.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;If he was saying to leave, he'd say 
  there are lots 
  of MU*s based on just advancement, not RP.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;As in, well, MUDs. :P&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn nods and has done that...&quot;I am talking about detailed PrP's . 
  Scenes...done easy and I have been involved in several of those where 
  night ends, scene finishes...done, good rp and some new contacts. When 
  admin volunteer, can there be...I don't know, I don't want to see admin 
  stuck in place hating their job, but at the same time...those messages 
  &lt;Hey I'm your new admin BLAH and I am here to kick ass&gt; and then a week 
  later &lt;Frag this...I'm outtie&gt; get real frustrating to the player 
  population. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan also adds quickly to Ban's words, a big reason 
  I think 
  many +judge calls are avoided is because staffers know that often picking 
  up a 'brief' timestop ends up taking 7 or 8 hours because the PCs question 
  every TN, every judgement call, in order to make sure they 'win.'</p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;And then the losers whine until it's retconned.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I think that depends on the PC. I dont really care. 
  I 
  can compute a TN as good as anyone. If its outrageous then I might be 
  like, you wanna rethink that. But I'm swearing right now, if I can get 
  involved in a plot that takes like 7 hours once a week, I wont complain 
  one way or another.&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn thinks players need to learn to stop whining. &quot;Most mistakes are 
  made in our error, and if it is borderline, the favor goes to us. If we'd 
  as a group stop bitching, our admin would likely stay in place longer than 
  a week. Return to kindergarten...think before you speak.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy nods towards Nathan. &quot;I know...I generally don't care what the TN 
  is 
  as long as its something outrageous. Like I failed a search roll for a 
  item because the TN was too high,I respected that and I didn't complain or 
  whine just because I couldn't wait another day or two so I can do some 
  legwork to lower that TN. &quot; </p>
<p>Grim says &quot;Unfortunantly not everyone, very few in fact that I have 
  encountered are so willing to be flexible like Guy. If they cant have it 
  yesterday then your not doing your job as an admin and are incompetent. 
  according to them.&quot; </p>
<p>Grim appologizes for jumping in there, I have to go and just wanted to say 
  something before I go. ;) </p>
<p>Penta would like to agree with QD's suggestion....A sort of 'status 
  report' periodically from staff, especially BCStaff (for whom there's, in 
  a lot of cases, a LONG leadtime betweeen &quot;Hey, this is what I'm planning 
  on doing&quot; and &quot;It's Done!&quot; simply by way of how coding is.), 
  and then a 
  wrapup every so often from the RPD and BCD (I doubt PHS needs to do much 
  here, they mostly do stuff that IC players don't see), with a semi-annual 
  or so BIG &quot;state of the MUX&quot; from Morris. Nothing big on the regular 
  ones. 
  Just 15-20 min every month or so. Grim: That's a sucky attitude. Then 
  again, virtually every player is occasionally like that. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;YOu're forgiven Grim.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; Airashii says, &quot;Players need to take responsibility too. The 
  hardest 
  thing I did as staff was getting a team together to do /anything/. People 
  accuse the staffers of favortism, well damn right. What would you do in 
  this situation. Go with the tried and tested group of players who are easy 
  going, easy to get together, and aren't +judging because someone muttered 
  something about someone elses mother. Or option two, spend at /least/ a 
  week trying to get a group of people together on the same night, then deal 
  with all the fighting and arguing when one player in the group can't 
  //win// and make himself look like big bad runner man.</p>
<p> Solution? We as runners need to take some of the work off the 
  staffers. Don't hang out in a bar expecting a run or plot to come 
  knocking. Get a team. Get a fixer. And for gods sakes, get some IC 
  freinds. Get some people to hang out with, who will fight for you and 
  defend you, and risk their tail with you to knock up first seattle for a 
  robbery.</p>
<p> So in short Make it easier on staffers to give you runs.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik also thinks people have to realize that RPAs are 
  not 
  walking rulebooks. Even I, after a year here, have to consult SR3. I can 
  run most combat without a book, but if I mess up your +1 TN modifier for 
  your Super-Gun, well, live. In the end, Shadowrun is about telling 
  stories, not rolling dice and some people have to respect when a RPA is 
  more focused on telling a fun story rather than engaging in drawn out 
  combat with people flipping pages and debating over simple and complex 
  actions and how many meters away an object is and where standard trig will 
  alow them to triangleate a shot on a target or elementals can materialize 
  in a fuel tank. </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Guys and gals, I have an easy solution to the TN problems. 
  Just a lit'l bit of code...&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; Shiva's standard TmS info blurb: This PC has enhanced articulation, 
  so all skills other than Social have an extra dice applied to their rolls. 
  I also have two spurs, so at current strength this PC does 9M Physical 
  damage base. Also has a full Smartlink I system, so this PC has the -2 TN 
  for all weapons excluding the PB-120. </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I think they other problem is the heirarchy of 
  admins. You have admins for everything, each with there own little section 
  of playerbase, but what about a team of admins for running plots. Fuck it, 
  make me an admin right now and I guarantee I'll have a plto running by the 
  end of the night. Im not talking history altering shit here, Im talking 
  something to chew up all this wasted time. Not ever plot has to make the 
  front page of the New York Times. What ever happend to the random liquor 
  store holdup's, or someone breaking into your apartment. It might only be 
  worth a couple karma, but thats more than you make sitting on your ass.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;This makes it easy for any admin to deal with you. Have all 
  your TN mods coded into a quick attribute. If anyone wants help, I'll show 
  them how to do this.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;There's also a point where an RPA's &quot;story-telling&quot; 
  becomes a 
  train-ride for the PCs. They just get to sit back, and wait until they 
  have to tell the RPA where their combat pool and karma pool are going.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Hire Chi right now. Do not wait.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Do not discuss it in committee. Get him an RPA, and get him 
  on 
  the grid running plots.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Find more people motivated like that, and hire their asses 
  too.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Aye... freedom of movement is something that makes 
  these types of games so exciting. I think too many judges forget that, and 
  dont have the will to make it work on the fly.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Chi: Go on. hold up the random liquor store. Whatever org runs 
  the area will want to know why you ignored their people keeing an eye 
  out.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan isn't sure that would fix it, though, Shiva. Many 
  characters with very simple sheets, no mods at all, standard TNs, I find 
  still challenge things. And it's not just TNs; lately, the biggest problem 
  I've seen is an unwillingness to accept that some information is OOC, and 
  sometimes you just need to trust. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;And then, in most cases, they will hunt down that runner team 
  and kill them all.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Especially in PvP. There is, 99 of 
  the time, much 
  more going on behind the scenes than you know about. Everybody knows a 
  piece, no one knows all, so when the staffer tells you, 'Trust me, it's 
  IC,' try your best to just trust them and accept that there are things you 
  don't know.&quot; </p>
<p>Sparrow says &quot;I have a hypothetical. Hypothetical because I don't know 
  if 
  this would work or not... Maybe it has been tried elsemu*, so just pipe up 
  if you've seen this work/fail elsewhere. </p>
<p>How about if players form themselves into shadowrunner teams of 8-12 
  players, and then each team gets an admin? It seems like we have enough 
  manpower but the problem is distribution. This would create a situation 
  more like TT, where each PC feels like he has &quot;his&quot; admin. Any comments?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Meg just hit a problem too. Orgs are all convinced that their 
  org can lock down their entire district of the city, and see everything 
  that goes on there, and dole out immediate punishment with their 
  corporate-sized paramilitary force. Why is that?&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I lurv that idea Sparrow!&quot; </p>
<p>Anna is apping on a Champions mu* that does exactly what Sparrow 
  suggested, and it seems to work VERY well. </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I think we have a wiener...&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Except for the fact that when RPAs 
  burn 
  out/retire, we leave 8-12 PCs in the cold.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods. ANd that would bring more complaints; the 
  more 
  active admins would have their teams getting a -ton- of karma and money. </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;And then one of those 8-12 has to step up, and take over as 
  the 
  team's staffer.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;And...what happens if you're not a runner? Like me? Who do 
  I go 
  to?&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;With the playerbase/admin ratio, can't it work out?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Eclipse spams with his thoughts on the matter. </p>
<p>Player -&gt; Staff: </p>
<p>* Players need to understand that staffing is NOT an easy thing. </p>
<p>* Players need to understand that staffing is a thankless position and, 
  very often times, it is a job that receives a lot of flack. How often have 
  -you- chatted with your friends saying &quot;Admin X is an ass! I don't want 
  to 
  deal with him/her&quot;? </p>
<p>* As a whole, the staff are not out to get any players. This causes more 
  headache than it is worth. </p>
<p>* Staff are not here to, specifically, make your lives more fun. That is 
  part of their responsibility. However, you need to think about the fact 
  that all staff are volunteering their time and efforts to make the game 
  more fun for the game as a *whole*. I will, without hesitation, sacrifice 
  the fun of a single character to enhance the play of 5. There is no doubt 
  in my mind on this. </p>
<p>Staff, as a whole, are on staff because they ENJOY making the game come 
  alive, enjoy running plots, handling scenes etc. Once the enjoyment goes 
  away, so does the drive to make the game more fun for everyoen else. </p>
<p>* Players need to realize that they are just that. Players. How often do 
  you argue with your TT GM? I can guarentee you that you do a LOT less 
  arguing TT that you do on the MUX. This is because of the environment. 
  Players NEED to accept RPA decisions. </p>
<p>* Realize that staff DO MAKE MISTAKES. I'll put it out there simple and 
  easy. There should be very little reason to whine about &quot;Damn.. you gave 
  me S Damage instead of M.&quot; Does it REALLY matter? I can understand 
  verifying stuff if it has killed your PC in a plot or in a PvP situation. 
  But if it's just inconvenienced you, there should be little to no reason. 
  It's much mroe of a headache than it's worth! I've been staffing on 
  Shadowrun-online since '95 in some incarnation or another. There's times 
  that I have NO clue and need to make something up to keep the game going. 
  Or I make an error. All need to realize that people aren't infallible. </p>
<p>Staff -&gt; Players: </p>
<p>* Staff need to remember what it was like as a player -- how frustrating 
  it was when the +judge's weren't asnwere, when the queues weren't done, 
  etc. </p>
<p>* Staff need to make sure that they are running things (more or less) by 
  the book. </p>
<p>* Staff need to be MUCH more firm in saying &quot;I'm sorry. This is how it 
  will be done. You can argue after the fact, etc&quot;. </p>
<p>* To answer someone's comment about staff griping on channels, I agree. 
  Griping needs to be cut down, though griping about a particular incident 
  with a particular player is, IMO, fine. This is the equiv of a player 
  griping to another player to remove frustrations. It only becomes an issue 
  when things continue and continue. </p>
<p>* Staff need to run more one nighters and stop trying to run these 6-8 
  week plots with 20-30 people. Those plots tend to cause more frustrations 
  across the board -- player and staff alike -- because they cause many more 
  problems. </p>
<p>* Staff need to trust the players more. Players are, in general, NOT out 
  to cheat. They are out to make the game more enjoyable for themselves. </p>
<p>That's basically my thoughts in a nutshell. From both sides, we need to 
  take more time to look at the other side. Take more time to understand 
  what's going on and not point fingers all the time. Don't complain all the 
  time. Enjoy the position you're in, whether player or staff, and simply 
  work within the systems and _PLAY_. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Okay, let us all have a moment of 
  silence while we 
  read Eclipse's Master's Thesis.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Actually..I have never called an Admin an ass...&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I agree with Chi. I try to do everything even if it is small. 
  Hell,I got a great idea now to do something if only a couple people felt 
  the same way as Chi does about plots. Nothing huge or big,just something 
  to make a couple nuyen and have a little fun. Doing serious big runs 
  aren't that fun!&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Another thing you guys aren't considering is the fact that 
  not 
  everyone is EST. There's quite a few people on here that are playing in 
  foriegn countries. The admin for team concept just couldn't work with the 
  disparate schedules.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Chi about freedom of movement. &quot;I always remember when, 
  while trying to run SR tabletop with a group of players...Instead of 
  simply picking the door lock (which would've brought down the automated 
  systems), they used on the roof and rappelled in. Freedom of movement is 
  your friend.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Shiva. &quot;Big problem. Or admins that're in England, some 
  players in CA, some in Taiwan, etc.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;When I railroad...I really railroad. 
  I take the 
  PCs and stick them on a yacht. A maglev train. If I want to tell my story, 
  I do it in such a way that railroading actually makes sense and IC. :)&quot; 
</p>
<p>Eclipse says &quot;One other thing that I forgot -&gt; RPD/ARPD need to post 
  what's going on regularly (once a month or something).&quot; </p>
<p>Long distance to Gemini: Flynn was looking over the new webpage...want the 
  rigger meet linked/ I got the addy.. </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;I really agree with the one-nighter things. The plots that 
  stretch out for months are good and ll, but they should be rather in the 
  minority, let's say 30 percent?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Incidentally, I'm about to open up 
  a new staff 
  position, just to let you all know.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;The only problem I have with the administration is 
  the lack of plots, short or otherwise. I find the services aside from the 
  to be excellent and can honestly say that (aside from the time my 
  ShadowTeam went AWOL and stirred up shit) I've never had a complaint 
  against any of them. The plot issue though seems like a common problem to 
  everyone (idling)...could we focus on that for a minute or two?&quot; </p>
<p>Amber says &quot;Does that include limitting the time for foot/leg work for 
  a 
  plot?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Someone that will -just- run shadowruns. 
  No huge 
  plots.&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;What position is that?&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;Cool&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;And for one-nighters, we should shoot for 4 hours as the time 
  table.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;WHERE DO I SIGN UP&lt; NATHAN?&quot; </p>
<p>Guy nods a little bit. &quot;Long plots usually only involve maybe...4,3 
  people?And only one plot will a staffer do at a time.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan will post about it. You'll just need to @mail 
  me and 
  Odin. I might hire two for that job to get a large amount of runs flowing. </p>
<p>Eclipse says &quot;A one nighter runs, normally, between 6-8 hours. Depending 
  on PCs on board.&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;Historically, I've been a leader. Either a gang leader or a 
  team 
  leader. What I do with teams, is organize them in loose configurations. I 
  try to have gaps and duplicates of as much as possible. And I make sure 
  that all players realize that not everyone will be on all plots. We'll try 
  to share. That way, if someone is missing, we get a replacement. I also 
  try to network, so that we have fixers &amp; specialists to take care of our 
  needs. The trick is to network. As for plots.. PLayers love their PCs.. 
  they don't want to lose them. And because they don't trust staff not to 
  screw them for failing to pose somehting that was fairly common sense, 
  they spend hours and hours planning simple jobs..&quot; </p>
<p>Eclipse says &quot;Standard Timestops run as follows: &lt;Player Number&gt; 
  + 1 = how 
  many hours the timestop will be. And that's with medium level of TN 
  arguement etc.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;That's my formula, Eclipse.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Four hours in, out, done. Karma awarded, money doled out, rep 
  points added. I have an RL job. Six hours is the entirety of my free time 
  for one day. I like to use some of that time to eat, or wank, or do my 
  bills, or things that are not MUX-related.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods. And especially with whoever takes on those 
  positions, guys, trust to just -trust- their word. If you don't, they'll 
  get burned out real quick. If you do, the plot will run faster, and be 
  nice for everyone. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Okay, let's slow down the speech again. 
  Job, go 
  ahead. Other than that, I have no one on the list, so page me if you 
  either want to keep on this topic, or open up a new one that's on your 
  mind.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I have a few questions.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Could we have a test run? I'd really like to be a 
  'runner admin. I'll have something rollin in a couple hours...&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan waits for Job's questions. And Chii: Go ahead 
  and @mail 
  me and Odin your staff app, and for tonight, feel free to run a player 
  plot. I can't make you staff just yet, but if you run a PrP as if you were 
  an admin, just +rolling all the stuff, asking them their stats, and e-mail 
  me the log, I'll get to it ASAP. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;There are a number of things which in my opinion--I am not 
  advocating or damning these ideas--could be revisited in terms of 
  improving numbers of plots available, reducing player-staff tension, and 
  improving relationships for PCs. These are admittedly thought of as 
  &quot;radical&quot; ideas by a conservative and large number of people, but 
  they may 
  be worth exploring by the staff. In a nutshell: 1) Allowing RPAs to play 
  PCs actively; 2) Allowing alt characters as &quot;normals&quot; or color characters 
  in areas not often populated; and 3) removing organizations and gangs from 
  the game to allow a more focused presentation towards Shadowrunners. Have 
  these been explored, are there any intentions to explore them, and do 
  people have any BRIEF thoughts on them? (Not interested in argument, just 
  curious.)&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Heh. Funny you mention those things, 
  Job, as 
  Bannik, Eclipse, and I were discussing both 1) and 3) right before 
  calling the meeting.&quot; </p>
<p>QD suggests making an example, publicly of one or two bad cases on both 
  sides of things. Admittedly, I can be a hassle to play with, because I 
  know the rules fairly well (I've taught enough people and quoted enough 
  when asked) and try to have things clearly thought out. Why? Because one 
  or two admins who run unchecked make everyone paranoid of all admins. Dion 
  comes to mind for one. </p>
<p>Meg has 1 thing to add re: 1 and 2. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;It is unproductive to insult the administrative talents of the 
  game. While it has been proposed in the past to give out tests or 
  implement some sort of quality control for administrative skills, nothing 
  ever came of it that I know of due to high numbers of admin turnover and 
  difficulty of accurately judging the game.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;In response to Admin PCs: I'm not 
  willing to let 
  that happen. I was strongly against it back when Detroit was first 
  considering it, but of course I was the only RPA that voted against it. 
  What I -will- do is let RPAs that are feeling burned out return to their 
  PCs temporarily, and come back to staffing whenever they want. The most 
  recent example is Aphrodite; her staff character is in stasis. The moment 
  she decides she wants to come back to staffing, she can.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;That's a good stance to take on RPA burnout.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Go ahead Meg.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik also would like to interject that the level of 
  PC -&gt; 
  Staff paranoia on these games would get many people diagnosed. Not 
  seriously, just wanted to characterize it. Staff isn't out to 'get you' 
  unless you do something quite stupid. Shoot five Lone Star cops in broad 
  daylight and yes, well, we're out to get you. But we want to make it fun. 
  Not hassle people. What does it boil down to? The theme of the night: 
  Trust us. Please. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Bannik. As a note, from the player side, 
  occasionally there is a staffer that's practically out to get people, and 
  that's what sours some PCs to all admins. Just like the few PCs that 
  complain and demand to know every TN sours some RPAs to taking +judge 
  calls. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Ok. Re: RPS PCs: It doesn't work. You've got people already 
  looking at minimum levels of job performance issues. Staff PCs will just 
  split the RPA's time more. 2)Alt/Color characters... last time the issue 
  of multiple PCs was raised, it was killed. By Morris. I won't go into why, 
  I'm just saying: Morris sed no. Put that thought outta yer heads, folx.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods. I say no to Alts also. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;That's a whole discussion in and of 
  itself, 
  though, which is why I'm not going into too much detail.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Maybe next meeting we'll address those 
  3 items. 
  :)&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;As for #3...&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I think we need a better showing of Lone Star...the only time 
  lone star happens is if something big goes down or there like a big force 
  backing something up...I think there should be like an admin that only 
  wants to work with Lone Star.&quot; </p>
<p>QD wasn't insulting staff in general. Just pointing out how one specific 
  admin raises the level of paranoia for everyone. People can tell you that 
  Dion PLayed To Win. It was so bad that two or three of us invited admins 
  to 'audit' scenes run by this admin. Stuff like that makes us nervous and 
  whine about target numbers. At least me, anyway. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;you can have my ganger when you pry it from my cold, dead 
  fingers.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg doesn't WANT to be a shadowrunner. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Meg, that ain't really an argument, 
  considering 
  staff could just kill you and pry it away if we decided to remove 
  orgs/gangs from the game. :P&quot; </p>
<p>Meg doesn't really have the time. So I play a ganger. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;If anyone has been waiting to talk 
  and hasn't been 
  paged by me yet, page me again, 'cause I'm all through the list.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Nathan...&quot;Active RPA with PCs on the grid BREEDS problems. 
  As per alts: Morris killed it. Need I say more? As per 3...Agreed with 
  Meg. Some of the best RP I've ever HAD was with, say, the Jive Kings back 
  in its beginning, or having to pay air tax to Mallik of the Rusted 
  Stils...Bannik...some of us are diagnosed already. More of us should be. 
  PROZAC FOR EVERYONE! </p>
<p>Meg doesn't wanna be the 'star' of the show. I know we're basically 
  backdrop chars. It's nice if we can evolve some and grow, but honestly, 
  the ganger PCs who wanna grow up to be runners... do. </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I've always been wanting LS PC's...then there presence could 
  be 
  felt and people would have to stop carrying there Assault Rifles,SMGs,and 
  military grade body armor out of the barrens.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I have visited this place many times in the last few years and 
  now I play here. Probably the single most controversial thing that happens 
  here--what causes more unrest than admins &quot;twinking&quot; and billion-karma 
  characters put together, and always has, back to when I was RPD--was the 
  proliferation of powerful organizational PCs. And there have been more 
  than a dozen different attempts to reorganize them, none successful in 
  eliminating the complaints.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Just something to consider.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Job. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Job: There's no powerful PC on the grid a falling chunk of 
  Daedalus Space Station can't cure.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Lonestar PCs don't work. It becomes 
  them vs. 
  EVERYONE else, because their job is to screw the entire PC populace 
  nearly, since nearly everyone is an illegal shadowrunner.&quot; </p>
<p>Job isn't arguing; is just trying to bring up points to ponder. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;However, staff can play more LS NPCs. 
  Make it a 
  more active force.&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;Am not, I'm a very legal shadowrunner&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;I've got permits for everything :)&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Yea?That would give a lot more RP with Them vs. everyone else:)&quot; 
</p>
<p>Snake says &quot;Maybe a LS Staffer?&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Nate. Make LS more approachable. Make LS contacts possible 
  for those of us outta CG and on the grid...Set up a cop bar or too! </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;But you forgot about the bands and stuff that aren't runners..&quot; 
</p>
<p>Jones says &quot;Problem with LS staffers is when that person isn't around 
  the 
  place would shutdown&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;K, slow down guys, I'm getting a list 
  again.&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn wants to respond to Job, &quot;Why if a PC has stayed alive to hit 
  300+karma are they suddenly a twink or a badthing (tm) They 
  surivived...now I think they as a choice oughta turn to mentoring new 
  players...but, their choice, their PC, they survived...why are they a 
  perceived threat on the Mux? </p>
<p>Job didn't comment on it as a good or bad thing, but mentioned it as 
  something that people complain about LESS than they complain about 
  uberpowerful orgs. </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;more interesting idea would be to use those senior PCs as 
  the 
  fixer and talismonger/deckemsiter types since they actually would have the 
  connections at that point rather then getting newbies trying to do the 
  same thing&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Ah, but then you're telling the player how his/her PC has to 
  grow.&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;I didn't say force&quot; </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;It doesn't hurt to offer it as an option.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;It's already an option.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;My thoughts on high-karma PCs is that rules on how to deal with 
  them fairly need to be developed.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Jones. &quot;Yeah. Don't force it. Make it worth the guy's 
  while...Give them incentives. </p>
<p>Jones has a personal problem where every decison needs a documented rule 
  or code support, why not just play a dikumud if that is all you guys want</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik offers: &quot;I've tried to run for the karma 
  Gods. Twice. 
  Worked. Neither time. Because no one could coordinate enough to put 
  together the team or the planning or the equipment one would need to 
  execute a run that these people would be doing. Thus, it's hard to work 
  them into runs because nothing is a challenge. Not good. Not bad. Just an 
  aside.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;I'm sorry, but I agree with Job on the org issue. There's 
  far 
  too many uber-killers out there that are funded/built -by the orgs-. I'm 
  not naming any names, but most of us know who they are. This needs to 
  stop. It almost automatically puts the rest of us that just want to have 
  fun into a anti-PKiller mode, where we feel we -have- to max our stats and 
  such so that we don't have to worry as much about getting on one of these 
  PKillers' bad side. I know I've fallen victim to that thinking, especially 
  given my PC's lack of any real cyber or bioware.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;The big problem with Orgs on here is that they're all convinced 
  that they're the kings of their portion of the city. That nothing happens 
  there without them hearing about it. That nothing happens there without 
  their Barrett-armed snipers having their scopes on it. That no insult or 
  perceived insult can go unanswered. And ultimately, they've got PCs who 
  grow, and grow, and grow. Humanis is a prime example. It has been a long, 
  long time since I met a Humanis PC who wasn't capable of killing me, and 
  everyone I know. And that's a bad thing. Same goes for the other guys. 
  Most org PCs are really, really powerful. Because they've got the backing 
  of their org focused on them. Focused on them. How many NPCs get org time? 
  None. Those are the guys who sit on roofs with their Barretts, and see 
  everything that happens, and report to the guys with the 2billion worth of 
  cyber or foci.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta notes...The orgs as a whole are LARGE targets for LS to grab. Why 
  not? Cut the orgs down to size a bit if needed, RPS. Create RP from the 
  fallout. </p>
<p>Airashii says, &quot;Orgs are getting to be a problem here, yes. The problem 
  is 
  that they want too much control and power, and their traditional enemies 
  aren't nearby to do anything. Take the yaks for example. Everyone's 
  favorite one to pick on. The yak /owns/ the ID. Is that ic? No. What about 
  the triads, the sep rings and the freelance gangs? Left to NPCdom. Even 
  the supposed /gang war/ between the Ancients and the Hounds. Each one has 
  thier own little ic turfs allready laid out. Theres no 'neutral zone' 
  where a war might take place.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta NODS to Aira! </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Meg points out that a 'war' does not mean bloodshed and 
  violence. </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;And if you -dare- to say anything about it to them, they get 
  on their high horse about it.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;And if a gang war did take place, all of the PC 
  Tir-Tairngire-Ghost-spies that proliferate among the Ancients would just 
  wipe out the Hounds.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Often, though, the power of org PCs 
  is a 
  misconception. For example: I played Leaphorn, who eventually became the 
  Chairman of Humanis. However, at the time that I -joined- Humanis, I had a 
  ton of ware, self-funded, nearly 200 karma, and was already at a very high 
  status. When I retired him, all the ware I had gotten up to that point was 
  self-funded. Yet I'm sure nearly everyone was convinced that Leaphorn, 
  the CyberTwink, was funded by Humanis.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;It's true, though, it -is- a problem, 
  and it 
  -does- happen. It used to be even more of a problem than it is now.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;In defense of Humanis: A ultimate 
  twink in Humanis 
  would geek any PC meta who comes along. Humanis is /very/ minimal PvP. And 
  PKills even less. Humanis has powerful, but smart, PCs in it. I attribute 
  this to them not having 'turf' to guard. There are no real 'sleights' to 
  Humanis that they need to come out and kill people for.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Meg says, &quot;case in point: The Korean war: It's still 
  not over, 
  folx. there's still no permanent peace treaty. Yet there's been no shots 
  fired for over 40 years. So if a state of war exists but there's no 
  shooting going on, accept it. If you'd like, we can come to your apartment 
  to stage our 'war'.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta meant...there hasn't been any turf skirmishes. No turf to fight 
  over, really. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;That gang war isn't about turf.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Wars happen for lots of reasons. If I start a war over a woman, 
  am I gonna waste time fighting over a pig?&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;Ok, the conversation has severely veered away from this, but 
  someone mentioned it earlier, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents. 
  Someone mentioned about non-runner types and plots. I'm a non-runner type, 
  a parahunter. I really generally stay outta shadow work, and lets face it, 
  who hears of many parahunts? What I wanna say, though, is that while 
  hunters aren't incredibly supported, much as other non-org, non-runners 
  are not supported, it doesn't bother me. This is shadowrun, if I wanted a 
  lotta plots I'd be in a gang or be a runner.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;If I ran a PrP tonight, who would show up? Regardless 
  of what it was, who craves some kinda action?&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Here's the biggie with Orgs: All Humanis PCs are uber-powerful 
  twinks. All Ancients are uber-powerful lesbians from Tir-Tairngire. All 
  Yaks are uber-powerful magically active twinks, except for the ones who 
  are uber-powerful cyber-ninjas. All Mob PCs are... Uh, well, the ones that 
  exist all have a lot of Karma, I guess. Right?&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Now, whether what I said is true or not doesn't matter. Because 
  that's the overall perception.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;That's generally the perception, yeah.&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;Meg, Korean war is over... its just not a declared peace 
  signed on funky paper, hell under that logic the Vietnam war was not a war 
  nor the Persian Gulf War&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;OOC&gt; Airashii says, &quot;But Meg. Teh Korean War still has /tension!/ 
  There 
  is still something there that both sides want. The orgs here have 
  everything they want. Each org has their own training facility, their own 
  bar, their own warehouse, and damn near their own hospitals. So instead of 
  orgs that constantly try to gain power of the city and one another, we 
  have orgs that are content to be masters of their domain. Total masters. 
  And if a fly takes a wiz on the side of a building, the org wants to 
  know.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta grins at Jones. Actually, he's right. Technically, I think we're 
  still at war with Britain.:-) </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I believe we need to increase the Lone Star power. Whatever 
  happened to undercover detective stings and such?Those would be nice 
  annoyances for the orgs. I heavily believe that lone star should be used a 
  lot more because of the fact that they are a major force that we all have 
  to reckon with. Another thing,Paranormal activity I believe should be 
  increased. We need some devil rats running around,bug insects infesting 
  giant craters like the one left from LTD so then UCAS or LS would have to 
  come in and quarintine the barrens. Paranormal stuff and Lone Star should 
  be pumped up and used more.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Hmm. For all the complaining, odesnt look like anyone 
  wants plots.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;No more bug spirit plots!&quot; </p>
<p>Airashii agrees with Dorn. </p>
<p>Meg shrugs, &quot;That's because the orgs don't have room to expand, and they 
  don't have competition. Both those factors are already being addressed and 
  something is in-progress. </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;My point is that one or two bad players and a bad staffer (Don't 
  look for them just wait for them to appear) should be made an example as a 
  Do Not Do This. Daddy and I discussed the restructuring of the orgs once 
  or twice.. making them answerable to something. One of my comments has 
  always been: Org Heads, remember that you are the head of one branch of a 
  For-profit criminal organization. You are not an absolute monarch who 
  rules by divine fiat over a feudal empire. And for gangs: You're not a 
  paramilitary organization with SEAL level training. And there is always 
  someone lining up to take you out. The other gangs.. most of them aren't 
  your friend. Shadowrunners: Don't sweat the small change a gang runs. 
  Gangers shouldn't push Shadowrunners too hard. Don't let them run you 
  down, just don't go out of your way. And Runners.. don't aggravate gangs 
  uncessarily. Things begin to devolve into an US vs Them mentality. And 
  Staffers.. don't baby/shephard a group beyound reason.. I'm not accusing. 
  It's certainly a very human thing to do. But, don't abuse them beyond 
  reason. And, I agree.. I'm getting tired of insect spirits.. We just wait 
  for Darth Jiro to log on and turn him loose on them. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Let's face it, folx... Yaks and Mob can't really -compete- if 
  they're already so firmly entrenched in their own turf that the other side 
  can't crack it open.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;and after 4+ years, there's no reason they shouldn't be 
  entrenched, given that for at least 2 of those, they were told -not- to go 
  after one another.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Organizational PCs: These characters are problematic. The ideal 
  drawing-board vision of them: as enablers of shadowruns, as characters 
  involved in wars or actions against each other, does not work in reality; 
  it's been proven it doesn't work in reality. This is because there are too 
  few of them, actually, and because people target PCs and not NPCs, in some 
  degree (it doesn't matter how many NPC goons are with Yak or Maf A, anyone 
  attacking will go after the PC first. Plots do not occur with these groups 
  that involve shadowrunners, for various reasons that I won't go into now, 
  despite the fact that as factional heads, they're supposed to be of 
  assistance to the staff in fomenting plots, they rarely are--there are 
  some that are, but not many. There's also a fundamental (and large) 
  difference in what a starting PC gets in an org, vs. what he or she gets 
  as an independant, and the downsides don't exist in reality, since people 
  rarely (if ever) order subordinates to do something they wouldn't do based 
  on their BGs, etcetera.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;BTW..What happend to the good ole' parahunters and bounty 
  hunters?&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Secondly, on the matter of high-karma PCs. Even DikuMUDs 
  recognize the need for protecting low-level characters from the attacks of 
  high-level characters. If I whack a 4th level chick on a MUD, and her 20th 
  level boyfriend doesn't like it, he's SOL in terms of killing my 4th level 
  character. This is not the case here. Rules for intra-PC conflict between 
  high karma and low karma characters need to be considered. It /IS/ 
  possible to have high-level and low-level characters co-existing. It just 
  needs some basic rules to protect them from each other.&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;Died out. No parahunts. No bounties to go after.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Time to reinstate their licenses and bring them back.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Eureka! Guy, you're brilliant!&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;It is possible to build trust here. It is necessary to build 
  it 
  anew in the staff, by confident and non-arbitrary but well-reasoned 
  leadership, and some firm rules.&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;some still exist, but most just run the shadows and have 
  'parahunter' tagged onto thier +info somewhere&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I'm done for now.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Job: If I whack the mob boss's daughter IRL, he's gonna whack 
  me. Period. No question. Violent mercenary criminals are at risk of being 
  targets of BETTER violent mercenary criminals. congratulations, it's part 
  of the job. Deal.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I would say that you are correct. But I do not believe that 
  organized crime characters should be PCs.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Or if they were to be, the way they are handled needs to be 
  revamped severely.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;that's not even Org PCs. that's Any PCs. that's your 'high karma 
  PC' arguement.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;If I go and kill some psycho's girl in a brawl that gets out 
  of 
  hand, I can =expect= pain and death.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;I wasn't here to see Leaphorn, Nate. In the nine months I've 
  been IC, I know personally of 8 PKills that have happened to PCs I 
  know/knew. Of them, I think -maybe- 2 of them were done for IC reasons. 
  The rest were because the PKiller woke up on the wrong side of the bed, 
  and decided to come up with an IC reason to take someone out and then went 
  and did it. And that really scares me. I've worked very long and hard on 
  this PC, and I -don't- want to lose her just because somebody had a shitty 
  day at the office. And from what I've seen, the worse PKillers here are IN 
  AN ORG.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Note: protect them from /each other/.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;No. Don't protect them from one another.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;You wanna swim in the pond, mind the sharks.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I'm trying to find a solution that isn't: Mandatory retirement 
  for all characters hitting 400 karma because they become so unreasonable 
  that no one outside of an admin or 20 barret bullets can kill them.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Work with me here.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Because with NO rules, they ARE broken.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Read the boards, you want evidence of that.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Why? Why is -success- a problem?&quot; </p>
<p>Airashii says &quot;Your mising the biggest point meg. The /sharks/ need to 
  be 
  worrying about other /sharks/ and not the bottom feeders attacking each 
  other for the peices. Traslation? this. The gangs and the orgs need to be 
  worrying about /other/ gangs and orgs. But they aren't. The gangs and orgs 
  are killing Joe-schmoe Shadowrunner because he looked at an org member 
  funny.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I think part of our problem is that RPAs don't kill PCs. Org 
  PCs kill PCs. Or, at least, that's the perception.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;I'm sorry, if I survive and do well, if I play my character 
  smart and am successful, why should I be kicked in the teeth for it/&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;No one is saying to kick 'em in the teeth.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta thinks, personally...by 400 karma, you really should be offered some 
  position keeping you OUT of combat..requiring you to branch out. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;airashii: The gangs -do- worry about the other gangs. You want 
  a 
  good reason why the A's don't hit the Hounds every week? NPC gangs. I'm 
  not gonna go THROUGH hostile turf, taking fire all the way, just to attack 
  the Hounds where they're strongest.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;What is being said, and has been seen, is this: Many high-level 
  PCs--or a significantly statistical amount to generate a large amount of 
  complaints from all sides--cause problems by PKing too much, or 
  interfereing too much with lower-level PCs. A solution should be worked 
  out, and one, ideally, that does not punish folk for being successful but 
  rather allows them to play and enjoy the game without generating such 
  complaints.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Just like on a TrekMU* or similar....Once someone's PC reaches 
  flag rank, they either head behind a desk or start a NEW character.:-) 
  There's just not much more to do.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Where does that leave me, Job? I'm not very powerful at all. 
  Hell, I still roll one init dice. Yet I have a KP of 18.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;That leaves you needing an RPA to run shadowruns for you and 
  other folks who have 18 KP, and keep you busy enough so that you don't 
  have the time to kill PCs with 3KP because they farted near your 
  goldfish.&quot; </p>
<p>Airashii nods at Dorn. &quot;Exactly.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva snorts. &quot;The last thing I'm going to be doing is going after other 
  pcs. I HATE PKillers. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;then you'll need a lot more RPAs, Dorn, 'cause you'll hafta 
  segregate ppl down into dinky little groups, and not let 'em RP w/one 
  another.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;As I said, what I am talking about here is developing rules 
  that 
  let characters like Shiva, whom I will take at their word for being 
  non-offensive, and characters like Nadaam, who can threaten an entire gang 
  with impunity and cause them to lose face because someone got shot up that 
  they liked for dissing a gang member, co-exist peacefully without damaging 
  the RP integrity of other people on his whim.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;That's a specific example; it may not be a good one.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn laughs at Job's example, and Nads's complete impunity to ANY 
  repercussions whatsoever. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Because if you can RP w/someone of vastly different 
  capabilities, you can convince them to kill you.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I don't think (to expand on this example) that Nadaam should 
  be 
  killed or retired. I do think that what occurred shouldn't've been 
  possible or even something that he would have considered.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;I think more than rules. More than 
  power 
  reductions and forced retirement is that the 800 CK people need to 
  practice restraint. Restraint in that they know they are the most powerful 
  PCs on the MUX and that they should not be beating up on the other, weaker 
  PCs. Not everyone needs to die for a sleight. Be a mentor. I don't care if 
  your BG says you're a 'psycho death killer'. Beat them down, let them go, 
  and maybe let them know that there's no hard feelings, just be smarter.  
  Take some OOC responsibility that comes with it.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg admits, this is probably NOT a popular viewpoint, but personally, I 
  think when ppl get killed, they should RP beign dead. Corpses don't 
  +whine. </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Job? No offense bud...but BAD example.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Damn straight, Bannik.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Perhaps it is, Shiva; I do not have all the facts.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta NODS to Bannik. With power comes responsibility. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Bannik: That restraint's gotta be a factor of the player and 
  the 
  PC, though. It -cannot- be a staff consideration.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna applauds Bannik's statement. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Why not, Meg?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Nad doesn't have complete impunity. 
  If any PCs 
  want to go after him, they're welcome to. But the problem with PvP, 
  including PC gangers, is that we as RPAs don't like stepping in and 
  telling someone they can't do something because we think they shouldn't. 
  It's up to the PC to practice restraint. UNless it's horribly out of the 
  ordinary, as in, a high-karma PC killing off a bunch of gangers, it would 
  be favoritism to tell someone, 'No. I won't run that because I don't want 
  you to do it.'&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Otherwise you get situations where 1 PC causes another's death. 
  Directly. Abusively.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;And when the 2nd PCs friends go to exact revenge, they get told: 
  You can't kill him. You have to just 'beat him down'. killing him isn't 
  IC.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Maybe we need to set the bar higher on what 
  constitutes a 'reason' for killing another PC.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Only one problem with what you said, Meg.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I'd like to introduce another comment regarding alt characters 
  that may be of interest and pertinant to this decision, regardless of 
  Morris's edict, that might be worthy of consideration.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Now... someone tell me... you're a ganger. You wanna deal with 
  someone on the level of say... Plague, for those who recall... Leap 
  Squared, for those who don't... how do you beat him down w/out killing 
  him?&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Eye for an Eye. He dies.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Too many of the PKillers out there don't feel that restraint. 
  They enjoy offing other PCs, because it soothes their fragile egos. And 
  because the worst of them are in one org or another, they're untouchable.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Job says &quot;One of the larger complaints that people make is that PCs show 
  no fear--they don't do things logically--they always want to be badass, 
  cold, arrogant, and not scared or intimidated by other people. This is a 
  truism. Why is it a truism? Cuz if Im gonna spend 2 weeks in chargen 
  making the one character I can play here, by and large (the majority of 
  folk, there are those who do it otherwise), I sure as hell don't want to 
  play a wimp. I want to be a HERO! And there's no room on this MUX for 200 
  heroes.&quot; </p>
<p>QD says &quot;At one time in the past.. I was specifically told by STaff: No.. 
  I don't want you to do that. And it helped generate a lot more mess.. and 
  establishment of quite a large power-block. And turned the LTD into what 
  it became in the end. Not because I wasn't let.. because it fostered, on 
  both sides a feeling of the group being protected from on high by the 
  prince of darkness.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;When you're the bottom feeder and you're after the shark, you 
  gotta go for overkill. Having an admin stand there saying 'it's not IC to 
  -kill- him'... is insane.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;But if you had two, three characters, maybe one of 'em could 
  wuss out now and again :)&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Just a thought.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg can be heroic. I can also look at a large gun and say 'I want to leave 
  now'. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to QD. Hence the reason I'm unlikely to tell 
  someone 
  'No, you can't do that,' even if I agree with the other side. </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Heh. My PC's no heroine.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;In the case Job mentioned, since I 
  was the admin 
  that ran it:&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;I agreed with the side that lost. 
  If any 
  favoritism was there, it would have been towards them.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Nathan, no criticism was intended. I have no problems with the 
  way you ran that scene, despite what others might've bitched about.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Just so we are clear on that point.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods. Didn't take offense, just going on with 
  that 
  example, as it's happened more than once in the past, similar cases. </p>
<p>Penta nods to Meg. It's one thing to be brave. However, I know full well, 
  just as a GUESS, that me with a pistol should NOT take on Chavez with an 
  AR.:-) </p>
<p>Meg laughs. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Personally, I am in favor of more administrative intervention 
  with regards to motive censoring on PKs and other PC issues. The problem 
  is, there's not enough faith in staff to have that be popular.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;You with a pistol should not take on Chavez hogtied and nekkid.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Job. I'm in favor of less. PKs I'm more 
  likely to 
  censor. </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Someone gimmie the name of an NPC gang and if 
  possible the name of its leader.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;If no death is involved, I'm very 
  unlikely to 
  intervene.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Meg. Exactly. Discretion is the better part of Valor.:-) </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I remember back a long time ago...when the only reason I was 
  allowed to kill someone was because they stole a cyberdeck.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;The original policy (don't know if it's still in effect) was 
  that an admin had absolute authority on a PC judge request to ask for the 
  motivation for the request, and if the request wasn't justified in the 
  admin's opinion they could refuse to judge thescene.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;In the Barrens.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Admins can always refuse to +judge the scene. and the PC can 
  re+judge&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;That's still in effect.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Especially in PKills.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;OK.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Fuck me. Half of the PCs present here shouldn't take Chavez 
  on 
  TOGETHER if he was hogtied, nekkid, had an S physical and S stun, and was 
  unarmed.&quot; </p>
<p>Snake grins</p>
<p>Meg could. </p>
<p>Penta thinks all the hesitation on PKs is because of, well....the old 
  thing of &quot;Oh my GOD! He TSed my RL ex-GF! He DIES!&quot; </p>
<p>Snake says &quot;Yeah but he only kills people when they're stupid&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik also has to say that, unfortunately, those with 
  the 
  highest karmas are not always the smartest. And there's not much that 
  anyone can do about it. Drop a rep? Who pays attention to that? Remember: 
  The most professional PC is not the one that shows the most non-fear, nor 
  the one that kills everyone that sleights him. It's the one that picks his 
  fights wisely and only goes as far as the situation demands. The rep of a 
  professional is the one that knocks his deadbeat client unconscious and 
  only takes the amount of cred owed to him. </p>
<p>Penta hees at Snake. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Do RPAs kill PCs more or less than they did 2 years ago?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Meg would just drop that chunk of space-station on him. It'd give him 
  enough stun to lemme run him over 3-4 times. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;In plots run by GMs?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Quite a bit less.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Some think admins then were too mean, 
  some think 
  admins now are too soft. Or maybe the PCs just got smarter, because the 
  majority of us seem to be the same people just changing names over and 
  over.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik has been one year. Killed one PC in a RPA plot. 
</p>
<p>Job says &quot;That's hard to believe, since there wasn't that much of it going 
  on back then, but I'll take your word for it. That's unfortunate. It 
  turns the game from one in which corporations and the Star is to be feared 
  to one where the only thing to fear are your other PCs...&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Which foments an atmosphere of distrust and revenge-kills 
  primarily.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg has been killed once by an admin in a +judged scene in the past 2 
  years. It was the worst day in those two years... </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I know I fear Nads a lot more than I fear death in an RPA 
  plot.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;And personally.... I think admins should drop the hammer more 
  often.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Hell, I fear Shiva more than I fear death in an RPA plot, and 
  I 
  know Shiva wouldn't kill a PC fly.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;I think there's one thing that should be stressed to ALL PCs 
  regardless of level, and this should be it, end of story. IC Actions=IC 
  Consequences. If I walk into a bunch of A's (for example) and start shit, 
  I deserve to die. If I don't want them to kill me, I don't mess with them 
  in the first place. Likewise, if some uber-mensch walks in and kills some 
  A's, then other A's should be able to gang up and PKill uber-mensch or 
  hire a Shadowteam to do it. For every action there is an equal and 
  opposite reaction. Period. imho.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;On the other hand, having been an RPD longer than I was a 
  player, I can understand the reluctance to kill PCs.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan nods to Meg. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;I think that was me, wasn't it?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Job says &quot;Which is another benefit, IMHO, of alts and multiplaying. Less 
  reluctance to kill a PC.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I heavily agree with ICA=ICC...enough retconning..&quot; </p>
<p>Meg nods. &quot;t'was... when Amanda got hit by the tank battallion and squad 
  of LS specfor mages... &quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Mmmm. Yeah.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;The comment &quot;ICA=ICC&quot; has been used by more people 
  incorrectly 
  than the term &quot;twink&quot; and &quot;OOC/IC crossover&quot; combined.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Did I mention earlier my stance on 
  retconning, 
  incidentally?&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Only problem, Guy, is when an OOCA becomes the motivation for 
  ICAs&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I have never had the problem..know why?I don't know anyone on 
  here IRL!&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan would rather you hadn't said the specifics, Meg, 
  but now 
  that you have, everyone else, trust that it was a prime example of 
  ICA=ICC. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Ok, 1 Banshee and a combat mage w/2 elementals. Christ, can't 
  I 
  pad my dead char's rep some?&quot; </p>
<p>Anna nods to Meg. &quot;Then Admins have the right to refuse to judge the 
  scene...maybe have some kind of concequence for people who try to PKill 
  for OOC motivations?&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I learned my mistakes by dying..this is my first succ. character 
  in..about 2 years or something?&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Probably longer..&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Heh... my first char's mistakes made the evening 
  news 
  ;P&quot; </p>
<p>Penta grins at Meg. &quot;Sure ya can.:-) </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan is gonna have to pull out at this point folks. 
</p>
<p>QD says, &quot;WRT Pkills.. again, there is a perception of favoritism. And 
  simply knowing the situation.. and knowing which admin to page with it 
  because the admin doesn't like PKills. One comment would be to +Gmnote a 
  denied PKill request on somoene and that before they can ask again.. But 
  that's not the point.. If I wanted to pkill someone, I could find a 
  reason.. just a matter of pushing the right way and waiting. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Sorry. Have an adminly duty I need 
  to attend to 
  before I run off for dinner and such.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Oh, cool. in that case, there were a hundred dragons, too.&quot; 
</p>
<p>QD continues, &quot;ICA=ICC is like the catchall used to justify anything you 
  want to justify.. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Y'all can keep discussing. If any 
  of you have 
  questions, or want to talk with me more about something that came up here, 
  feel free to @mail me.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik can also moderate for a bit. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Good night, Nathan.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Alright. Thanks for all your comments, 
  folks. I 
  have a nice list of stuff to do now.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I've one question before ya leave?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;Yeah?&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Have any thoughts been given to my suggestions on board 22 
  regarding concepts bboards, app speeding up, and the like?&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Hire shadowrun-only RPAs. Like Chi.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Never fear. I have a PrP in development even though 
  Im not an RPA.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Should be ready in about an hour.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan doesn't get to read bboard 22 most of the time, 
  so hasn't 
  seen those suggestions. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Nathan says, &quot;If you want me personally to push 
  for anything, 
  your best bet is @mail/page. I don't have the time for bboards most of the 
  time.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;As you wish.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;And keep in mind, all you ppl who wanna know how the orgs think 
  they know all that passes in their domain... most of those neighborhoods 
  are very insular. People are related to made men, gumi, Raen, etc... the 
  gangs and orgs have a lot of support from non-members, on their turf.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Meg says &quot;It's why it's their turf. No prince can rule w/out consent ofthe 
  governed.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I think, one of the best decisions I made when I was a Director 
  at either place--and I made a bunch of stinko ones--was to remove orgs 
  from Detroit entirely as PC options, to remove everything except basically 
  shadowrunners.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;and that's one of the reasons I decided I'll never play on 
  detroit.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;It provided focus on the things that most people came to play 
  for--and allowed RPAs to run more plots spurred by such NPC orgs.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;They don't work here.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta notes..RL example of Meg's statement. My family, in the US at least, 
  was originally from Boston. The North End for the first few years. 
  There...you don't EVER steal a car. Why? Cuz...some grandma's prolly 
  watching, and is horrified. That grandma probably has a grandkid who's a 
  made man....Car thief ends up hurting.:-) </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Yay Digex!&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;The majority of non-organized-crime PCs will agree with that 
  statement, of this I have no doubt. You need only to chat on the public 
  channel or read the boards to see that.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Again: I don't have time to play a shadowrunner. I don't -want- 
  to play a shadowrunner. I'm happy playing a background persona, as long as 
  I'm allowed to grow.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;That was my last.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;and the same goes for most of the ppl playing gangers. If they 
  wanted to be runners, they'd be runners.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna nods to Meg. </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;I like not being a runner.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I'm actually less adamant about gangers, except for the 
  Ancients, than I am about organized crime in my personal beliefs.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Although the way the Ancients are portrayed here they are not 
  so 
  bad.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;But they're not being portrayed the way they SHOULD be portrayed 
  here. The SR canon Ancients are a crapload more nasty.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg shrugs, &quot;That leaves... The Blades? And the Hounds? Gee, Job, thanks 
  for giving us gang-types such options. </p>
<p>Penta nods to Meg/Anna...I LIKE having Orgers and gangers around... </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;It's kinda been a bone of contention since YOU were RPD.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Job says &quot;Make more gangs.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik opens to the floor, this question: &quot;What 
  do you propose 
  be done about the disparity in Org resources and 'Runner resources? No one 
  can deny that the Mafia can call down Fire and Brimstone on a PC while a 
  runner has only his friends. How do we rectify that?&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;you don't&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I know. Hell, I'm the first to tell you I was far from a perfect 
  RPD. I've learned a great deal since then.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Limit their access to NPCs and gear.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;I'm sorry, if some runner team can take on the MAFIA, the mafia 
  needs to pull out of town and close up shop.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Proportional problems? If it's one mobster having a personal 
  problem, that doesn't involve Family business...Nogo on the help.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Same with Yaks, etc.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I like having Orgers and gangers around...they are good 
  resources if you become good friends with them...&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Hello? These are friggin' syndicates, not the Ice Cream Man.&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik plays Devil's Advocate, then, with Meg: &quot;Okay. 
  But why 
  give /PCs/ such access to such power. If you can say that 'You don't stand 
  a chance against them' why let 'them' be PCs?&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;I've heard -numerous- stories of ORG PCs bitching and moaning 
  about how many NPCs/Gear they get to have with them whenever something 
  goes down. That's bull.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Should only get Family/gumi/etc. resources for 
  Family/gumi/etc. biz.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Make all of the organizational PCs accountable directly to staff 
  for their actions. Guide them more in the game towards actions that less 
  directly affect non-organizational PCs in negative ways.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Impose more controls based on the IC effects of being in an 
  organization.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;That sounds exactly like a good reason that we aren't allowed 
  to 
  play Corper's or cops..&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Because they wanna play that org. If people wanna play 
  independant runners, then they should have to deal w/the headaches that 
  independance comes with.&quot; </p>
<p>Anna says &quot;What about the suggestion of having Org NPCs assigned like 
  ganger NPC? When an Ancient walks into a place, there 2-3 NPCs always with 
  them...&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;It's a LOT easier to get a job than to be a freelancer.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Meg says &quot;You wanna be a freelancer, great... just don't bitch about the 
  downside.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Organized criminals feel very lightly the leash that the org 
  is 
  supposed to have on them.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn points to Guy. &quot;Right on.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Tighten it. Make it as much of a challenge to be an orger as 
  it 
  is to be an independant.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I'd like to say: If orgs existance isnt messing with 
  your PCs right to life or his abilities par they type of character you've 
  chosen to play, why do you care about Orgs?&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik tries to control the chaos. &quot;However, Meg, 
  because they 
  /want/ to have power, they should get it?&quot; To Anna, we have that, to a 
  degree. You're assigned people, but if certain circumstances arise, you've 
  got Hell at your fingertips.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Orgs have so many resources so much power that they can take 
  you 
  down..&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Because too many orgers abuse their power.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Lone Star has the law to take you down..&quot; </p>
<p>Anna nods to Bannik. &quot;K&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Personally, I think I have to agree w/Shayd there... Org PCs 
  should be beholden to the org, and on the damn leash. The oyabun should 
  NOT be a PC. the Don should NOT be a PC.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;The A's head is -not- a PC. Keep that in mind.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;The PC Ancients are 1 cell of -4- in the 'plex.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;the overall chapter boss is NOT a PC.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;However, the PC is effectively a head 
  because she 
  can control all within her cell.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;The oyabun of the Yakuza is not a PC right now..&quot; 
</p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;The A's head doesn't matter, because the A's PCs are all 
  commando-kings anyway.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;If you're determined to not eliminate organized criminals as 
  PCs, much tighter control over them must be established if you expect the 
  other PCs to trust you and stop complaining about the disparity in power.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Penta nods to Meg. &quot;AGREED. The top guys should be NPC characters of the 
  Org admin for that Org....At MOST, (using Maf as an example) the PCs 
  should be Captains in the Family. </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;Job, this is beginning to sound like a personal crusade.. 
  are 
  you perhaps upset that previous characters who tried to own portions of 
  town got slapped down by Orgs?&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I think Orgs should be taken down all together..&quot; </p>
<p>Job sighs. &quot;No.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;They're just as powerful as lone star and megacorporations..&quot; 
</p>
<p>Jones says &quot;Because that's really what its been sounding like.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods to Jones. &quot;It is, man. </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Lone star and Megacorps weren't allowed because of that main 
  fact...They're powerful..&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;VERY much sounds like its personal.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;I think you have to have played sa an org memeber 
  to 
  have any idea what you are talking about. And especially right now, when 
  the orgs are weakened ALOT port-war.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I shouldn't be surprised that I'd be assumed to be so shallow, 
  but frankly, that event has nothing to do with my opinions. But folks do 
  tend to believe what they will about me.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Okay. Let's not rally about how orgs 
  suck and 
  point fingers at others. Let's focus on the topic, not the people.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I didn't say orgs suck..&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Bannik: Too late.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;I have good friends that are in their that help me out:0&quot; 
</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Job: It SOUNDS like its personal.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Look, all I'm saying is: read your bboards and feel your 
  players' pulse. Looking at 3 and 22, the /MOST/ argued about and 
  complained about thing is the power and abuses committed by organized 
  crime PCs.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Is that just me?&quot; </p>
<p>QD ,quite tongue in cheek, says, &quot;Hey.. I want power.. I want to play 
  a 
  Corp Covert Ops Section leader.. I demand to play that.. </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Does that make it personal, or is that a simple observation?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Jones says &quot;I seem to remember a lot of people ignored when you were 
  running things as well and there is always bitching on those boards by one 
  greoup or another.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I think Guy has a point that everyone is missing. Lonestar 
  and 
  Corps are restricted precisely because they are too powerful and have too 
  many resources. And yet... Criminal orgs, which have no less in the 
  resources department, are allowed. Why?&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;and if the Orgs behaved as stated then the streets would be 
  running red with blood and everyone would be in chargen right now..&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;If this MUX is going to be continually run as it is--as a 
  quasi-democracy spurred by PC-driven policies, which despite all 
  counterarguments, it actually /is/--you NEED to listen to that 
  &quot;bitching&quot;.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Bannik asked how to fix orgs.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Running an org actually takes alot of work. We don't 
  just GET resources. We have to maintain certain things. They're a monthly 
  evaluation based on activity, RPing and the amount of IC business 
  conducted.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;I think that orgs are like Social Security... There really 
  is 
  no way to fix it.&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;How about consequences for doing things /too/ publicly?&quot; 
</p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Like I said earlier. I havn't RP'd all day, but I've 
  never been idle more then 3 minutes due to the amount of solo IC work I 
  was doing.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta NODS to QD. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Okay. Let's bring this in a bit. Is 
  it possible or 
  feasible to rearrange orgs so that people in orgs coming out of CG are on 
  the level, more or less, with everyone else coming out of CG? I think we 
  can all say that 'fairness' has to be kept within bounds. Sure, one might 
  have Wires III, one might have Wires I, but do you think that deciding to 
  app for a certain thing (org) should grant you special powers?&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Perception is 9/10ths of reality.&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Hell..let me run a megacorporation then...I'll do monthly 
  evaluation based on my activity,RPing and conducting IC business.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;Like I said before...the moment you try to balance things 
  by 
  limiting the orgs, you're gonna get backlash. I don't mean to point 
  fingers, but most of that backlash comes from the Yak PCs.&quot; </p>
<p>Jones says &quot;If it is Yak PCs state such.&quot; </p>
<p>Dorn says &quot;Fuck it. Point fingers. Most of it comes from Mark.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Bannik: Gangers can't come out of CG NEARLY as effective as 
  runners. Why should org PCs be different?&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Bannik: One of the first things you can do is eliminate the 
  6 
  years worth of backlogged back tech and gear that the org crime people 
  still have :)&quot; </p>
<p>Guy says &quot;Gangers are gangers..not runners&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Okay. Away from attacking the PCs. 
  I want to focus 
  on this abstractly, not say how the current orgs are bad, but how they can 
  be made better.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Org members aren't runners -either-.&quot; </p>
<p>Chiisaijin-san says &quot;Fear. I think I've heard all I need ta. Keep your 
  ears open, there'll be a PrP starting soon. Very RP oriantated, I'll be 
  looking for people who know what they're doing.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Job: Another Operation Takedown?&quot; </p>
<p>QD thinks that certain predatory named Oyabuns helped to develop an 
  istitutional bias wrt the Yakuza. Both in how the people inside it conduct 
  themselves. And how outsiders see the Yakuza. </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Yeah, -there's- a good idea.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I'm unfamiliar with Operation Takedown.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Because if we just point fingers, 
  we're never 
  going to make progress.&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;No you're not. We've discussed it. Shinto. Ancients HQ. BOOM.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Penta NODS to Bannik? If I may have the floor? </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Was that before or after I fired his incompetant ass?&quot; 
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;And Meg and Job, if you want to fight 
  a personal 
  war, take it to page.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Penta, go ahead.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;Oh wait, I decided not to be rude earlier ;)&quot; </p>
<p>Meg says &quot;Obviously before. and you're suggesting the same thing.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Guy shrugs his shoulders. &quot;I don't care either way...but I have stuff 
  to 
  attend:) </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;I'll wait til these two shut up.&quot; </p>
<p>Job says &quot;I fired him but he was re-hired. :)&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Job: SHUT UP, DAMMIT!:-)&quot; </p>
<p>Penta beats him and Meg with mallets and types furiously so he can get a 
  word in edgewise! </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;OK. My plan/suggestion...I'm gonna @emit it.&quot; </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik has to get going... </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Meg says, &quot;that's ok. I'm finding myself in a suddenly 
  violent 
  mood, so I think I'm gonna go, myself.&quot; </p>
<p> The Penta plan for Orgs, sort of. </p>
<p>1. Don/Oyabun/Ancients lead (fuck it. They're NOT a gang. They're an org 
  in people and capabilities, for this discussion) are NPC'd. The roles are 
  taken up by the individual org RPAs. </p>
<p>2. Make being an orger count in its downsides. No org toys or people for 
  non-org biz unless you're willing to risk a bullet in the brain pan from 
  an associate of the Don. You should, actually, have to FOLLOW all the 
  Org's strictures. Admittedly, Rispetta for the maf is followed to a 
  ludicrous extent, but...lighten that back. If the person KNOWS the guy's a 
  made man, that's one thing. If they didn't...Whole nother story. Only that 
  ONE maf to go against. </p>
<p>3.Too public actions get the org slapped down. Use LS more against em. 
  Terroristic actions? See the FBI. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;ADMIN&gt;&gt; Bannik says, &quot;Anyhow, you can discuss. But there'll 
  be no one to 
  moderate this. Do this at your own risk.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Good. Opinions, folks?&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;I'm trying to illustrate a point. The problem comes in that 
  people are used to doing things someway.. and they don't want to give up 
  priveleges and the accustomed way of doing things. When Org PCs are 
  attacking and killing people on major thoroughfairs with automatic weapons 
  in broad daylight and getting away with it with no repercussions.. There 
  is a problem. In one case, they didn't get away with it, mostly because 
  the target was Lance. But, it indicates a systemic problem of Protected 
  From On High by the Prince of Darkness.&quot; </p>
<p>Dickinson doesn't know if this was addressed earlier, but the major 
  problem he sees is the fact that it seems like the same people keep 
  recycling themselves into the same org over and over. Namely, yaks and 
  Ancients. </p>
<p>Shiva NODNODS. </p>
<p>QD nodnods. </p>
<p>Dickinson says &quot;But how do you regulate against that?&quot; </p>
<p>Penta NODS to Dick. &quot;Something else...basically, After an org char...you 
  can have an orger again...BUT YOU GOTTA GO INTO ANOTHER ORG!&quot; </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;Basically, if they were a problem causer.. don't let 'em back 
  in 
  until they show they've matured.&quot; </p>
<p>Dickinson says &quot;You can't really say that. That's really relative.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Penta nods to Dick. &quot;That's kinda relative. </p>
<p>Flynn shakes her head and comments...&quot;You can not regulate what a char 
  becomes...else you'd be able to say...you did a TS pkill...no TS for 
  you...one year!&quot; </p>
<p>Dickinson says &quot;I like the other idea, though. If you were an orger 
  (Mafia, Humanis, Yaks, Ancients), you can't have two consecutive chars in 
  the same org.&quot; </p>
<p>Shiva says &quot;This is an argument that'll never get solved, guys, because 
  there's too many people power-drunk with the privileges they get now from 
  being in said orgs, and they'll bitch, moan and whine until the admins 
  drop any attempt to change things.&quot; </p>
<p>Dickinson shakes his head. He refuses to let long odds convince him 
  against trying. </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;The other problem is that you just play a normal, non-org 
  person.. then.. low &amp; behold.. six months after you go IC, you join up..&quot; 
</p>
<p>Flynn does not think it is fair...&quot;How would you like it for an admin 
  to 
  start telling you what you could and could not play...Next comes 
  cookiecutter chars.&quot; </p>
<p>Penta nods. I'm gonna tack that on to my plan, and post the thing to bb22? 
</p>
<p>Penta says &quot;Flynn: We already do. see +cgdenied.&quot; </p>
<p>Dickinson says &quot;How's it any different from telling people they can't 
  play 
  corpers? Or mages? Or law enforcement? Or vampires?&quot; </p>
<p>Flynn thinks that is different...but conceeds the point. </p>
<p>Dickinson refuses to make any distinction between players and admins 
  setting policy. Admins just implement it. </p>
<p>Penta nods to Dick. &quot;There's a difference, but...Anybody can PROPOSE 
  stuff. That's been around since the MUX's beginnings. </p>
<p>QD says, &quot;Even in the military, you can make suggestions. Even if they're 
  not followed. </p>
