              soon after that. And no, no bards claim to have done their fancy 
              work, so we are left with a puzzle of sorts. Of course, we had ogres 
              from all over the zone popping into the pit anyways...jeez. We are 
              having no luck, its always some little thing....grrrr. This is almost 
              getting annoying. Why are we trying? a) few people need the flag, 
              and b) we haven't gotten one Blade of War yet. Anyways, will see

              helm to Kirei, silk hat to Veneal, more chain gloves to Lladar and 
              Perp and Trevian, plate gloves to Felwin, silk bracer to Kyryn,

            Fennin is still kicking our asses, and we are pissed about it. Its 
            one of them 'we know how to do it but just can't do it' sorta things. 
            So, we been working on the other mobs in Fire, since we can do them. 
            Sorry if I sound pissy, its frustration, especially when Ihear other 
            guilds skipping other mini named to do the easier Fennin, and we are 
            the exact opposite! At least we get comfort from the runes, another 
            20 last run. 
            <p>So, what other armor since last time...Ednoon and Rineryen on plate 
              arms, Kaelwyn on Silk Bracer, Mifisto on Chain Boots, Funnies on 
              chain gloves, Krang on silk gloves, Shining Crimson Shawl to Vaine, 
              Rineryen on plate gloves, Sijur on chain gloves, Blazing Horn of 
              Fire to Lycrist, Fire Marked Rune to Zelot, Cord of the Pyre to 
              Kirei and Staff of Eternal Flame to Drezt.</p>

            <p>We also played around in Plane of Air, but ran into some bugged 
              islands, and then screwed up on island 4 with a wipe at the very 
              worst time. Hopefully can add to this tonight after we get done 
              there. </p>
            <p>Just a note, thanks VI for the sweet charm based on flags. While 
              it sucks for those that spent whatever time farming the crappy ones 
              from LoY, its great to have something decent! The AA is purely bonus, 
              maybe it will encourage some people to pay more attention to flagging 
              mobs? Anyways...thank you /bow.</p>

            Ro up, but it seems we have a bit more learning to do on him. Little 
            tweaking of our strat and he should fall. That being said, its a great 
            rune farm, with another 14 runes dropping! We kicked things off last 
            night with the twin birds, grats Onikaze and Saytrion on Shining Crimson 
            Shawls. <a href="images/screenshots/babnoxithespiderqueendead.JPG">Babs</a> 
            then fell next, giving up Mask of the Insightful to Rineryen and Nishi. 
            <p>So, tonight...revenge! <a href="images/screenshots/pyronisalive.JPG">Pyronis</a> 
              fell first, dropping plate molds for Zelot and Satashi. We followed 
              that up with our favorite mob, Magmaton, who dropped leather boot 
              pattern for Poochin, and chain boot pattern for Funnies. Time for 
              the hard stuff, we put down <a href="images/screenshots/generalreparmdead.JPG">General 
              Reparm</a>, and he gave up leather glove pattern to Gorou, and plate 
              helm mold to Yumin!</p>
            <p>Time for a match with one of our latest 'nuisance' mobs, yep, Arch 
              Mage Yozanni! After wiping once with him at 0%, we came through 
              and put him down the next attempt...mana drain sucks. Anyways, grats 
              me on silk turban pattern, and Funnies again on chain glove pattern. 
              No, I didn't get a screenshot as I was too busy laughing and crying 
              and all that. Next time. Anyways, next nuisance mob, <a href="images/screenshots/quavonisfiretaildead.JPG">Quavonis 
              Firetail</a>. I liked this fight actually, I'm sure melee though 
              are just loving all these 'bird' models. He dropped plate arm mold 
              for Muros, and silk sleeve pattern for myself! Of course, to finish 
              the night off, General Druav Flamesinger was put down and Satashi 
              won the sword.</p>
            <p>Heck of a night, cleaned a few demons off our back at least. The 
              armor drops were just great, every piece makes the entire 'farm'(cause 
              thats what it is when you get down to it) just a tiny bit easier. 
              This leaves Fennin, and Omnifiend left for us to kill...honestly 
              I don't know which one will die to us first. </p>

            not to mean we haven't been busy, as we have of sorts, actively raiding 
            while trying to learn the mobs has slowed down loots, but soon they

              a lot of time in Doomfire, attempting to kill the 'mini's' that 
              roam around. Some we have had great success at, while others...not. 
              The scale up in difficulty from VT for example is shocking, but 
              it is a lot of fun and will make seeing the corpse that much sweeter. 
              It just seems wrong that a mob can hit for 3k+ and have have a 2k+ 
              AE, or mana drain grrr. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Well, last night we got our first chance at Fennin 
              Ro, it was sorta early and we had no race, so figured what the hell, 
              we need to learn it...so off we go. Pullers did fine work, and other 
              then someone getting a little anxious with the incoming, we managed 
              to spawn Fennin.</font></p>

              I think our best attempt got him to 85ish percent. Not a problem, 
              we now know him and I expect us to be successful our next attempt. 
              Even with the failure, the loots to that point were quite nice. 
              To start off with, 14 glyphed rune words! As well, Rorchach won 
              these:</font></p>

            <p><font size="2">We still continue to backflag, competition and uncooperative 
              spawn times really make this a real pain in the arse. We finally 
              got to see Mithaniel Marr again, and the guild graciously killed 
              him out of the damn wall so I got a nice <a href="images/screenshots/mithanielmarrdead.JPG">screenshot</a>! 
              We put down Solusek Ro again as well(grats Merro on Gauntlets, and 
              Sything on Rainment). </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">So, how goes the elemental mold farm? Slow, but 
              steady. Plate gloves to Dral, silk bracer to Guurn and Utadin, silk 
              gloves to Guurn, leather bracer and gloves to Kirei. Thanks Babs
