                    <p><font size="2">So, we have another patch from last night 
                      and I guess they did an oopsie on 2 items. What ya think 
                      about <a href="images/screenshots/screwup1.jpg">this</a> 
                      and <a href="images/screenshots/screwup2.jpg">this</a>? 
                      Sweet upgrade huh? Anyways, they got that fixed. Moving 
                      right along.....</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">So the night starts, and people are slowly 
                      logging in. Some are scouting out what mobs are alive while 
                      others are getting some experience, normal patch day routine. 
                      Anyways, word comes from Kael that King Tormax has showed 
                      up, and though we were a bit slim in numbers, we went and 
                      laid the King to rest. </font></p>

                    <p><font size="2">Tormax has now been christened our RIP equalizer, 
                      as the points his drops cost far outweigh the points a raid 
                      earns. What drops you ask? Xorhitus finally gets T's head, 
                      Doljon got Gauntlets, Quickdagger takes the crown, Ashramm 
                      gets the ST talisman and Utadin spent points and got the 
                      Ring. Quick note about Doljon on his cloak from yesterday....remember 
                      how I said Kael had crashed after our SorZ kill and Doljon 
                      won the cloak? Take a guess what happened....yep, his toon 
                      didn't save and the cloak was lost in cyberspace. Maybe 
                      Verant can help the little halfer out, but we ain't holding 
                      our breath.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2">Moving on, Dain was up and since he is always 
                      a fun pull and kill, we moved to ThurgB. Mesos and Danon 
                      have been watching Kirei too much, and it was yet another 
                      fun action filled Dain kill.</font></p>

                      Rhip takes the Wurm Greaves, and Utadin and Jaysonn get 
                      some Shining Pants. Kriez dies easily, and Yumin snags the 
                      Silver Disk. Koi gave up the Net to Samwen, and Orb to Amagones. 
                      Jorrl gives up some Onyx Legs to Candy to match her new 
                      BP, and Modox grabs the Facesmasher. Cekenar drops a Meljeldin 
                      for Kremmel. We call it a night then, its late and well...I

                      of Thievin than a stunt like that. However, Vyemm did die 
                      shortly after, and to under 70 people, too! Who'd have thunk

                      Kirei is a bitch. He took a break, in his quest for man-sex. 
                      He has not yet found his hot man-sex, but rumour has it, 
                      he is looking at Thievin quite longingly. In his absence, 
                      I have usurped the site, and wrote an update. He may be 
                      back, depending on how good Thievin is in bed.</p>

                      kill for us so far. Aary droped Mask for Faviola, Hand for 
                      Modox and at last Ring for Mifisto. As we were preping next 
                      for DtD Lord Fesh suddenly poped so we said oh well one 
                      more dragon who won't drop our loot *cough SSoS*. To our 
                      surprised at the end of the Kill he drop put out a SSoS 
                      for our mage Utadin and BP to twink and Moncole to Mifisto. 
                      DtD droped crap again, tail went to twink and Robe Graz 
                      my destory key. Onwards to Kriezenn who again didn't drop 
                      Kriezenn Flame he put out bard weapon to rott and Arm to 
                      Lendo but we did have some fun with him. I went crazy as 
                      we were preping the for him and made the tank go in when 
                      clerics are all lom, after 2 war went down we finaly got 
                      it stright and went on to a perfect kill. Lady M drop the 
                      Shawl for Krang, Mith Helm for Emmey and emm Mith Gloves 
                      to Manboob err I mean Joxur. Koi drop us his net which all 
                      our melee been dreaming about but Hydn the rogue manage 
                      to ninja it first so Gratz him Bracer went to Enderlm. Jorr 
                      to our surprise droped us a Sprinkler of Spirit Gratz Casu, 
                      Earring went to Hylas. At last we get to Lady Nev, I want 
                      to take a min to rant something about the messed up resist 
                      VI put it. I thought it was made resist to actully matters?? 
                      Well it doesn't Lady Nev is a horror now. I rather fight 
                      THO then her, I sware some ppl were close to pukeing from 
                      the AE. I resisted about 3 time doing the whole fight with 
                      350 some MR and that is just crazy. Anyway she went down 
                      at the end no less and droped Eye for Lendo and Medal destoryed.</p>
