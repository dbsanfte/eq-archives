            <hr> <font size="2">So, Tuesday was a nice little patch I guess. We 
            had decided last night, Bert ring was going to be our top priority. 
            But, while waiting for more people to log on, we went and did a quick 
            little Vallon Zek kill. Grats Selran on the War Maul, and Rhip on:</font> 
            <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/items/obsidianscimitarofwar.JPG" width="398" height="185"></font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Very nice looking weapon /nod.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">We then moved to CoD to give ole Bert a go. Well, 
              we failed, while the clearing seemed to be smoother, we made a mistake 
              getting ready for Bert and wiped with no way to recover while Bert 
              laughed at us. His time will soon end!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Anyways, Wednesday night seen us hit BB, grats Wonda 
              on the Shard and Modox on Ring of Depths. Then IV(Fist to Modox, 
              Wito to Quenthel, Vex Xi to Rineryen) followed by Shei(Crys'Va mask 
              to Trevian, Gossamer Cloak to Kyryrn and Leggings of Serenity to 
              Greylend). We then moved to PoS and finished up some medallions 
              for some members, then hit BoT trying for Agnarr. While we got past 
              Emmerik, we had some probs with Agnarr and well...Agnarr 2, TSO 
              2. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Some random stuff, first, Trevian and Lladars new 
              bow(quickest turnaround for replacing a bow that I can remember).</font></p>

            Zek yet again for some nice loots and spells and in our continuous 
            effort to make these guys trivial. If you have to ask why we feel 
            thats important, then perhaps one should look at the progression list 
            for PoP. </font> <p><font size="2">Anyways, great loot. Vallon dropped 
              2 Pendants woot. Grats to the nuking team of Kaelwyn and Mikeathom. 
              Tallon dropped a bow for Turgeran Zek, and a Visor to the blind

            <hr> <font size="2">Lets start with Friday. XTC was visited by us 
            for the first time in a while. Grats Guardd on slippers, Jervis on 
            the Dirk, and Xorphitus on the Wraps. We then moved to The Deep, and 
            did a quick Burrower kill. Mishakaal and Sijur got some black caps, 
            Rahkyr got Ring of Depths and Thievin got a new poker. Off to HoH 
            we go, lets see how we do. We set up and did the 'Rasco' trial, pretty 
            easy, then moved to RD again. We thought we had this, but nope, didn't 
            work out. We will keep plugging away. For revenge, we went and hit 
            up the Zek brothers, Vallon gave up another Maul to Candarye and Veneal 
            won the Pendant. Tallon gave Orme the Battle Charm, and Mesos the 
            Visor Of Endless sight.</font> <p><font size="2">Saturday seen us 
              hit Grummus, then followed that by hitting CoD for some flags. We 
              then hit up Agnarr again, and this time Lladar and Trevian upgraded 
              their bows(again) to Longbow of the Stormcaller. Time to relax, 
              and go try out HP. We tried it a little different then normal, and 
              seemed to work and at the least...it kept us awake. Grats to Esto 
              on the Mantle, Ailya on Wraths Edge, and finally....Poooooooooooooochin 
              got his shield! </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sunday we didn't do much, most of us exp'ed somewhere 
              or another until our scheduled raid tonight for ... Bert! Man, this 
              thing is a rush. We were doing pretty good, knocking down the mobs 
              left and right. Then, for some reason we haven't figured out yet, 
              we had agro from mobs at the CoD zone in. People were getting summoned 
              left and right and smoked. Things looked bleak. Everyone was either 
              dead or zoned out, and this only an hour since the Ring started. 
              Mobs were still popping downstairs. So...we said hell with it, we 
              rezzed as quick as we could, got minimal buffs(/hugs mgb) and ported 
              back down. We got things under control, kudos enchanters, and we 
              were back in action again. Time was getting short though, we had 
              just gone 20 minutes without doing anything in the ring. We knock 
              down one named, then another, and while the clock is ticking...we 
              can see the goal. The last 3 named were killed and we can hear the 
              clock now..tick tock tick tock...we get pumped to kill the last 
              named and then prep for Bert. We then kill it, and wham, in a doozy 
              of a 'ooops', we got Bert in camp! While we tried, we just weren't 
              ready, and at 80% or so we cleared out. Oh well, disappointing end, 
              but was great fun and intensity. Next time /nod.</font></p>

            done last few nights? Too bad. Wednesday night(infamous patch day) 
            seen us kill Vind, Sorz, AoW and Shei before they did a 'soft repop' 
            of the server. Selras got Vinds boots, Lydian Sorz BP, Kaiylen ST 
            key, Dral got AoW helm, and Morak got a BoC and War Bow. Shei gave 
            up a Sphere to Garthin and Terrek, and leggings to Krogoxx. </font>

              but I'd just end up getting pissed all over again. Needless to say,

            <p><font size="2">Wednesday night seen me take a night off, but the 
              guild down Vallon/Tallon again. Tallon gave Kirei his visor and 
              Kaelwyn won the Charm. Vallon gave up another Hammer to Kaiylen,
