<hr>
            <font size="2">And the fun continues, 2 more crashes/patches since 
            the last update. This is starting to get old. I remember way back 
            when, dreaming of constant patch days and such...now though, most 
            of the guild is ready to cry anytime they see a new file being downloaded 
            via the patcher. I think we doubled our amount of Emp kills this last 
            week alone, yes its been that bad. Of course, the loots hold us interested, 
            as well as that fabled 'man we almost done' tale that everyone claims 
            but never really is true. </font>
<p><font size="2">Of course, we realized that all of our time was 
              being spent in VT and Ssra, and frankly, we are almost ready for 
              that next big step in PoP. We went and smoked Aerin Dar, so fast 
              was it dead that not all the adds came alive. We then put our healers 
              center stage, and had a real tank(no pet tanking for us!) keep Rydda 
              Dar busy while we put him in <a href="images/screenshots/rddeadimproved.JPG">his 
              place</a>. We have tried Mithaniel Marr twice now, the first was 
              really bad, with us getting agro a wee bit early. The second was 
              better, but we ran into a few problems and we lost again. Expect 
              the 3rd to be the charm.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Last night was a tough call, VT or Ssra. When all 
              was said and done, we determined VT would serve us better. So, with 
              that said, what spoils did AHR give us this time? </font></p>

              it seemed to go down at least once a day. So, from the Emperor over 
              the week we got these : <em>Shield of Mental Fortitude</em> to <strong>Seckzie</strong> 
              and <strong>Yumin</strong> and <strong>Guardd</strong>, <em>Shawl

              and our 1st <em>Sword of Ssraeshza</em> went to <strong>Guardd</strong>. 
              We snagged one of the Cursed spawns, which dropped the <em>Claw 
              of Vyzh'dra</em> to <strong>Parawulf</strong>, and <em>Black Runed 
              Pants</em> to <strong>Saytrion</strong>. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Finally, we got a chance at another late Lord Inquisitor 
              Seru and put him down. <strong>Danon</strong> won <em>Yttrium Wrapped 
              Sleeves</em>, and <strong>Merro</strong> and <strong>Lucresia</strong> 
              won <em>Yttrium Wrapped Leggings</em>. His head? Grats to our guild 
              bank, maybe someone will do this pita quest for it. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Thats it for now, lots of nice upgrades went into 
              the guild this week. Lets see how it helps over the next bit. </font></p>
