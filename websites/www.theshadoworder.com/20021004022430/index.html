            <p><font size="2">So, we have another patch from last night and I 
              guess they did an oopsie on 2 items. What ya think about <a href="images/screenshots/screwup1.jpg">this</a> 
              and <a href="images/screenshots/screwup2.jpg">this</a>? Sweet upgrade 
              huh? Anyways, they got that fixed. Moving right along.....</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">So the night starts, and people are slowly logging 
              in. Some are scouting out what mobs are alive while others are getting 
              some experience, normal patch day routine. Anyways, word comes from 
              Kael that King Tormax has showed up, and though we were a bit slim 
              in numbers, we went and laid the King to rest. </font></p>
            <p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="images/screenshots/target_tormax1.jpg" width="154" height="48"></font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Tormax has now been christened our RIP equalizer, 
              as the points his drops cost far outweigh the points a raid earns. 
              What drops you ask? Xorhitus finally gets T's head, Doljon got Gauntlets, 
              Quickdagger takes the crown, Ashramm gets the ST talisman and Utadin 
              spent points and got the Ring. Quick note about Doljon on his cloak 
              from yesterday....remember how I said Kael had crashed after our 
              SorZ kill and Doljon won the cloak? Take a guess what happened....yep, 
              his toon didn't save and the cloak was lost in cyberspace. Maybe 
              Verant can help the little halfer out, but we ain't holding our 
              breath.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Moving on, Dain was up and since he is always a 
              fun pull and kill, we moved to ThurgB. Mesos and Danon have been 
              watching Kirei too much, and it was yet another fun action filled 
              Dain kill.</font></p>

              Dral ninja's the Hammer and Fauchard gets the Crown.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">At this time, we have a few options 
              open to us. We had a pretty solid force, so.....off to NTOV. </font></p>

              gets the Amulet. We are getting pretty good at Aary, imo. Anyways, 
              there isn't much up so...we go nail Dagarn. Rhip takes the Wurm 
              Greaves, and Utadin and Jaysonn get some Shining Pants. Kriez dies 
              easily, and Yumin snags the Silver Disk. Koi gave up the Net to 
              Samwen, and Orb to Amagones. Jorrl gives up some Onyx Legs to Candy 
              to match her new BP, and Modox grabs the Facesmasher. Cekenar drops 
              a Meljeldin for Kremmel. We call it a night then, its late and well...I 
              was out of beer. </font></p></td>

                <td colspan=2> <p class="links">Well, things have been kind of 
                    slow the last while. I guess school and work finally caught 
                    up to a bunch of members. Others spent this time getting experience 
                    or aquiring the love known as 'Ssrafarmage'. I have taken 
                    over the web updates as Kirei needed a break. Anyways.... 
                  </p>
                  <p class="links">So we have a patch today, and things are looking 
                    pretty slow at first. Mob spawns are later then normal, and 
                    the raiding guilds all make their choices of zones to hit. 
                    Tamorfin really wanted a new BP, so the call goes out to head 
                    to Kael for a quick Vind kill while more people log in. Of 
                    course, chat channels are busted, kinda funny how useful these 
                    have become and when they are broke we almost panic. So, we 
                    kill Vind and <a href="images/screenshots/candysbp2.jpg">Candarye</a> 
                    wins the Breastplate, a new blouse as she says. At this time, 
                    Statue of Rallos Zek spawned, so...we put him to rest beside 
                    Vindi. Sorz gave up a nice cloak to Doljon, someone won the 
                    scroll but I was too busy to notice who, and Bettybettybetty 
                    ends up with the ST Talisman. </p>
                  <p class="links">So, we look around and notice Idol is up, and 
                    the other big guilds are busy elsewhere. The call was made 
                    to finally give this guy a shot and see what he is all about. 
                    Just when we start thinking what we need to do, the Idol wanders 
                    over and starts killing people. So, we camp or die and during 
                    this, Kael fooking crashes. Do we have luck or what? We finally 
                    have a legit force for Idol/AoW and the zone crashes grrrrr. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="links">So, zone comes back up a few minutes later 
                    and guess what......Vindi and Sorz are up again heh. This 
                    time Vinds BP goes to Agai, and Sorz drops a Swiftblade to 
                    Tamorfin. The winner of the ST Talisman is Marjolene woot. 
                    So, here we have the Idol again, and we are ready this time. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="links">Buffs are done, mages have been summoning rods 
                    for hours(or so it seems) and we got our rotations set. Things 
                    are pretty ghetto cause chats are still broke so the spam 
                    in zone is unreal, just like old times. So, the monks pull 
                    Idol...but ooops, one of our monks forgot to make sure the 
                    lead off MT had his defensive disc ready. 10 guesses which 
                    monk it was /glare leezard. So, after we rez and rebuff, we 
                    are ready again. </p>
                  <p class="links">Things can't go any better at the start. Trak 
                    is all over Idol like he is on sheep, and the next few tank 
                    switches go good. Then a few of our lady clerics flashed some 
                    leg, and the Idol went and whacked them. Things went to hell 
                    from there, with agro being fickle and more tanks/healers 
                    dying. We are now out of tanks, and we realize we are toast, 
                    Trev(complete in full planar gear rofl) tanks while people 
                    camp out. </p>

                    but its only a matter of time. Anyways, we thought we would 
                    go kill some dwarfs before the upcoming patch to fix the patch, 
                    but Yelinak decided to see what was going on in Skyshrine, 
                    so our bravest mage sucks it up and makes that damn run up 
                    top while people laze about. Anyways, CoH, Buff, wait for 
                    Guurn to turn in Tormax's head, kill. </p>

                    gets some factioning done. Grats Namin on the Mask and a new 
                    Robe. And the lucky dwarf cleric Karnos gets the Talisman
