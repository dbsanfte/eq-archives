  TSO is opening a recruitment push. Having defeated Rallos Zek and Solusek Ro, 
  the Elemental Planes are our playground. Looking back, we have not actually 
  had a recruitment drive for over a year. Due to retirements and some of our 
  folks hedging back play-times, we have a couple spots that need buffed out. 
  For us to prepare our final push into the Plane of Time, we are looking for 
  a few additional members to fill out and solidify our roster. Once this drive 
  is complete, we will not be accepting new members except in the case of a retirement. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <STRONG>Available Positions by Class</STRONG><BR>
  We are not looking to recruit part-time players currently. For all positions 
  below, 4 days-a-week is a bare minimum with 6 days being preferred. All positions 
  assume that you have a friendly attitude, can communicate reasonably well, and 
  take direction along with the occasional criticism. Areas with special, higher 
  demands of the player are noted.<BR>

  <STRONG>Closing</STRONG><BR>
  In closing, it's an exciting time to be in TSO. Over the last 6-8 months we've 
  gone from chasing a few guilds to being neck and neck with the top-runners on 
  Lanys. We will enter PoTime within the next few months and we want to pick up 
  a couple people to help with the ride. <BR>
  <BR>
  If you want to take a position available above, fill out an app and talk to 
  Thievin or Wikhed online. All applicants will eventually be filtered through our recruiting officer Sything. 
  But, do not spam her with tells or whippage shall ensue.</FONT></p>
