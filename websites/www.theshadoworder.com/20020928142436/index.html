                  <p class="links">Well, things have been kind of slow the last
                  while. I guess school and work finally caught up to a bunch of
                  members. Others spent this time getting experience or aquiring
                  the love known as 'Ssrafarmage'. I have taken over the web
                  updates as Kirei needed a break. Anyways....
</p>
                  <p class="links">So we have a patch today, and things are
                  looking pretty slow at first. Mob spawns are later then
                  normal, and the raiding guilds all make their choices of zones
                  to hit. Tamorfin really wanted a new BP, so the call goes out
                  to head to Kael for a quick Vind kill while more people log
                  in. Of course, chat channels are busted, kinda funny how
                  useful these have become and when they are broke we almost
                  panic. So, we kill Vind and <a href="images/screenshots/candysbp2.jpg">Candarye</a>
                  wins the Breastplate, a new blouse as she says. At this time,
                  Statue of Rallos Zek spawned, so...we put him to rest beside
                  Vindi. Sorz gave up a nice cloak to Doljon, someone won the
                  scroll but I was too busy to notice who, and Bettybettybetty
                  ends up with the ST Talisman.
</p>
                  <p class="links">So, we look around and notice Idol is up, and
                  the other big guilds are busy elsewhere. The call was made to
                  finally give this guy a shot and see what he is all about.
                  Just when we start thinking what we need to do, the Idol
                  wanders over and starts killing people. So, we camp or die and
                  during this, Kael fooking crashes. Do we have luck or what? We
                  finally have a legit force for Idol/AoW and the zone crashes
                  grrrrr.
</p>
                  <p class="links">So, zone comes back up a few minutes later
                  and guess what......Vindi and Sorz are up again heh. This time
                  Vinds BP goes to Agai, and Sorz drops a Swiftblade to Tamorfin.
                  The winner of the ST Talisman is Marjolene woot. So, here we
                  have the Idol again, and we are ready this time.
</p>
                  <p class="links">Buffs are done, mages have been summoning
                  rods for hours(or so it seems) and we got our rotations set.
                  Things are pretty ghetto cause chats are still broke so the
                  spam in zone is unreal, just like old times. So, the monks
                  pull Idol...but ooops, one of our monks forgot to make sure
                  the lead off MT had his defensive disc ready. 10 guesses which
                  monk it was /glare leezard. So, after we rez and rebuff, we
                  are ready again.
</p>
                  <p class="links">Things can't go any better at the start. Trak
                  is all over Idol like he is on sheep, and the next few tank
                  switches go good. Then a few of our lady clerics flashed some
                  leg, and the Idol went and whacked them. Things went to hell
                  from there, with agro being fickle and more tanks/healers
                  dying. We are now out of tanks, and we realize we are toast,
                  Trev(complete in full planar gear rofl) tanks while people
                  camp out.

                  <p class="links">No miracle 'First try, First Kill' this time,
                  but its only a matter of time. Anyways, we thought we would go
                  kill some dwarfs before the upcoming patch to fix the patch,
                  but Yelinak decided to see what was going on in Skyshrine, so
                  our bravest mage sucks it up and makes that damn run up top
                  while people laze about. Anyways, CoH, Buff, wait for Guurn to
                  turn in Tormax's head, kill.

                  <p class="links" align="left">Yumin finally spent some points
                  and takes home Yelinaks head to mount on the wall until he
                  gets some factioning done. Grats Namin on the Mask and a
                  new Robe. And the lucky dwarf cleric Karnos gets the Talisman
                  for the ST key, no he isn't keeping it for uber cleric haste.
