<hr>
            The last few days have seen us playing around in Time. I think there 
            was 2 things that popped into everyones mind when they zoned in, first 
            was 'woot hell yes', the second was 'wtf is up with the lag?'. Seriously, 
            its mind-boggling. Anyways, the new beginning...we have purposely 
            not done hard core research into things and how they work here, so 
            we went in blind. 
            <p>I'd say we did alright, considering we got started as people took 
              off for Thanksgiving weekend, and we managed to reach Tier2 last 
              night. Of course, so far we have gotten the variety of Tier1 goodies, 
              with lots of the Mask of Conceptual Energy, a couple Rings of Force, 
              a long Pulsing Emerald Hoop, a couple Smooth Onyx Torque and many 
              more of these:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/items/pop/time/wristguardofkeenvision.JPG" width="455" height="234"></p>
            <p>Tier 2 goodies came fast, but we weren't ready for what to actually 
              do and we failed. Oh well, for consolation Caahn and Druciferx got 
              :</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/items/pop/time/tinyjadering.JPG" width="453" height="215"></p>
            <p>Caahn then followed that up with this:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/items/pop/time/drapeoftheunending.JPG" width="452" height="214"></p>
            <p>We also put down Coirnav, Fennin and Rallos Zek again. Of note 
              from those, was Agai and Orme getting plate pants, our first Ifir-equipped 
              bard is Lycrist, and Felwin finally got a BoW. </p>
            <p>We got a bit of a rest from Time, but hope to be in Tier4 this 
              coming week. </p>
            <p>Time has brought its own challenges, mainly that being, a hard 
              72-person limit. I can see how guilds can get frustrated when they 
              recruit up for some of the PoP encounters, and then hit the brick 
              wall. What this means for us though, is recruiting is on hold for 
              an unknown amount of time. Feel free to send in an application, 
              but for now if we don't contact you, assume its not open yet. </p>
