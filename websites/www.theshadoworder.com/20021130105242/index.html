<hr>
            <p><font size="2">Sunday stuff....woke up and made my nfl picks again, 
              man i'm sucking at them for the last few weeks. Maybe my bears will 
              win a game.....anyways...EQ stuff. SoRZ was up, but we heard Kland/Zland 
              were up. Since 2 ST keys &gt; 1 ST key, off to DN we went. Grats 
              Orme and Lycrist(bard power!). </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Now, someone else had killed Sorz by this time, 
              so....Idol was up. Off to Kael! We were lighter in clerics this 
              time around, but better in overall DPS, so...since we are still 
              kinda new at this...unslowed Idol attempt. We did it with no troubles 
              other then MT going LD at enrage. Time for the big guy. I think 
              I can say, we got this guys number. The only deaths were from the 
              warped pull, AoW chewed through a few peeps right off....then Muros 
              took control. Healers did a great job again, and this time Muros 
              lived the entire fight. Drops, we got our first Blades of Carnage, 
              grats to Muros and Trakceles. Funnies won the Mask, and Sything 
              got herself a new Ring. Since I got roped into doing loot rolls, 
              I completely forgot to get a pic, oh well, maybe someone will mail 
              me one to put up.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">Off to Akheva we go. IV went down pretty 
              easy, Karnos and Hylas(dorf conspiracy!) won Insignias. Shei was 
              next, messy fight ugh, but we stuck it out and down it went. Quickdagger 
              won the spear, Loganil won Shadowed Torment, and Wonda got some 
              Shears. Since Mesos got a crappy pic, here is an old target shot!</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/target_shei.JPG" width="114" height="37"></p>
            <p><font size="2">Continuing along, time to hit The Deep. Other then 
              lag, Burrower was done without a hitch. Zaxer takes home a new Robe, 
              and Esto won the Ring of Depths. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2">So since it wasn't quite late enough, back to Ssra 
              we go and see if we can get this Cursed thing done right. Argh, 
              we know what to do, but just can't pull it off, little bit of bad 
              luck with LD's and resists /sigh. Soon though, soon!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Saturday PoG Rant: Things didn't go as well as normal 
              this time for us. We had good clearing time for a change, and half 
              decent turnout. But....guess the Dar curse kicked in, and while 
              we were killing the last 6 mobs in camp before engaging Tunare, 
              Lanys crashed hard. The only good thing that came about was a GM 
              waiting for us in PoG to summon/rez our raid while mobs ganged up 
              on us as we logged in.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">After PoG and recovering, we went to our most favorite 
              zone...Ssra. We tried the Cursed cycle earlier in the week, and 
              it was....messy heh. So we thought to try it again. Went better 
              this time around, but we came up just a bit short again. </font></p>

            first....stuff before Friday...lets see. THO was finally revisited 
            by us, and he dropped the Orb for Veneal, a Bauble for Merro, and 
            Gladius was won by the destroy button. Thursday night we did the 10th 
            Ring war for Hedge, though I was out of town, I heard it was a good 
            time. After the Ring war, the guild went and hit up Burrower Beast.....guess 
            he was hit the the crap loot stick, Ring of Depths to Seckzie, Shard 
            to Lasriias, and Spines to Wailen and Hydn.</font> <p><font size="2">Another 
              Friday night, and things are pretty slim for mobs. But, High Priest 
              was up in Ssra still, so why not at least engage him this time. 
              We overcame a minor detail forgotten very early on, thanks man! 
              Moving on, lets try this tank mez and other stuff. This time 'round, 
              we seem to have it figured out. Finally we engage the big lizard, 
              and though things didn't exactly go according to plan, we didn't 
              panic and we proved victorious!</font></p>

            <p><font size="2">Loots? Some mage won the Halo /hums, Shamira won 
              the Wraths Edge(woot 1 less ore!) and Sijur won the Shroud. Heck 
              of a fight, not many Luclin fights left for us to have killed at 
              least once.....expect another before December. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">After HP went down, we then headed to Thurgadin 
              and visited our old buddy Dain. He is still a grumpy dorf, so he 
              had to die. Recently un-retired monky Buvan won his Head and Hedge 
              took away the Cloak.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Stay tuned for another update tomorrow, few things 
              planned for today! </font></p>

              a bit for the weekend. Of course, what Saturday wouldn't be complete 
              without us being in PoG for some more Tunare farming? She was late 
              to show this time, but in the end....Sarlack won the Earring(no 
              earring for joo Dar!), Hydn won the Girdle(nice upgrade from ravenscale 
              rofl), Seckzie added the Flamberge to her sword collection, and 
              Enderlm won the Essence. We then rolled into Thurg to pop a suddently 
              contested Dain. Riain won Dains head, and Muros picked up a Hammer.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Sunday came, and after I did my weekly coin tosses 
              for my NFL picks and just when I got into an EXP group, Yelinak 
              popped.....oh joy. While everyone else screwed around or went afk 
              for 10 minutes, I made that loathsome run to his lair. Then everyone 
              thanks me by killing Yelinak so fast I had to /quit out to save 
              faction instead of camp. Anyways, grats to Candarye on Yelis head, 
              and my destroy button on the swords.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The rest of Sunday was spent in Ssra. Quote Kirei

            <p><font size="2">Night started out like a normal exp night, but then 
              we headed to Kael to drop Vind and Sorz and give the Idol a shot(see 
              archives for our last attempt). So, we buff up and give the Idol 
              a go unslowed to see how we do. We camped at 20% but we knew we 
              had it. So, here we go again, this time we do Idol and lay him to 
              rest. So....I guess we in the fire now! Med up and check haste, 
              and here is AoW inc. Anndar is tanking like a madman, clerics getting 
              dizzy watching his HP bar go up and down up and down. Finally, defensive 
              goes down and still Anndar just wouldn't die! Rumor has it he tanked 
              40% of AoW with no defensive, nice work healers jeez! Finally, he 
              was distracted by someone popping a beer, and he died...and Dral 
              was in. The big ogre took us home though, and AoW went down. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Agro control was top notch, other then the overnuking 
              wizard that every raid needs, along with the complimenty 'chanter 
              death to tashing. Kudos to everyone that came out for doing one 
              hell of a job. Killing AoW on our first try, /bow. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Oh, suppose loot should be listed...Enderlm won 
              the <strong>Ring of Destruction</strong>, Muros got the <strong>War 
              Bow of Rallos Zek</strong>, and Kirei won the<strong> Flayed Barbarian 
              Skin Leggings</strong>.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Oh yeah, we knew it was going to be an odd night, 
              cause Estopidiera finally won a<strong> Vind BP</strong>. To top 
              that off Kremmel and Tamorfin won <strong>Sorz BP's</strong>, and 
              Tamorfin was awarded the sleepers talisman!</font></p>
