            it was a legit patch this time. Do we move to Ntov? ST? Kael? No...........surprise 
            surprise...we move to Ssra! Same as last night, we started farming 
            ring pieces. Few more done, then we got big enough to raid. HP and 
            Rhag2 had been up a bit, but we went and smoked Rhag2 quicklike, grats 
            spell bank. </font> <p><font size="2">So, our fearless leader had 
              logged in by now, giving us enough 'chanters to ponder what to hit 
              next, AL or HP.../flips a coin...HP it is. So, we move up and the

            <p><font size="2">Guess we ticked off the loot gods, Zocan won the 
              Mantle and Merro won the Armlet. Of course, XTC decided to pop while 
              HP was at like 33%, and by the time we got done loot and killing 
              the adds, it was agroed. Amazingly, raid leaders talked and we decided 
              to hit AL. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">So, off we go on the Ssra tour with our guide Mesos. 
              Not much to say, we killed snakes /shrug. AL went down pretty smooth 
              this time, wonder how smoother it will be when /serverfilter is 
              actually working. </font></p>

              can now see!), Trevian won the Armguard, and our favorite furry 
              beastlord Pualani looted the Claw! That brought an end to my night. 
              As I write this, rumor has it servers are just coming back up, from 
              yet another patch. I guess thats pretty good, cause last night, 
              the top guilds on Lanys cleared out a ton of mobs all combined /rude,

              server crashing(again), things were pretty good. Quickdagger finally 
              got a Thorn, Anndar got the Girdle of Thorns, and Andylious got

              NToV. We did a quick ghetto kill of Vyemm, with some loot going 
              to someone or another, I didn't keep track. We then moved to where 
              we wanted to go, the Ring! We sorta went in with very little information 
              about this, and needless to say...we all died! Course, after that

              took control. Healers did a great job again, and this time Muros 
              lived the entire fight. Drops, we got our first Blades of Carnage, 
              grats to Muros and Trakceles. Funnies won the Mask, and Sything 
              got herself a new Ring. Since I got roped into doing loot rolls,

              won the spear, Loganil won Shadowed Torment, and Wonda got some

              we know what to do, but just can't pull it off, little bit of bad 
              luck with LD's and resists /sigh. Soon though, soon!</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Saturday PoG Rant: Things didn't go as well as normal 
              this time for us. We had good clearing time for a change, and half 
              decent turnout. But....guess the Dar curse kicked in, and while 
              we were killing the last 6 mobs in camp before engaging Tunare, 
              Lanys crashed hard. The only good thing that came about was a GM 
              waiting for us in PoG to summon/rez our raid while mobs ganged up 
              on us as we logged in.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">After PoG and recovering, we went to our most favorite 
              zone...Ssra. We tried the Cursed cycle earlier in the week, and 
              it was....messy heh. So we thought to try it again. Went better 
              this time around, but we came up just a bit short again. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2">After HP went down, we then headed to Thurgadin 
              and visited our old buddy Dain. He is still a grumpy dorf, so he 
              had to die. Recently un-retired monky Buvan won his Head and Hedge 
              took away the Cloak.</font></p>
