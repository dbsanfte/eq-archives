Zlexak died and passed on some slippers to Amagones. Cekenor fell and Sything picked up Blackstar. Since some of us had some energy left, Dain was killed with Kirei winning his head and Cicely a cloak.

                    was Thievin dying to Lord Vyemm like a litle bitch. But then 
                    again, no one expected anything less out of Thievin than a 
                    stunt like that. However, Vyemm did die shortly after, and 
                    to under 70 people, too! Who'd have thunk it possible? On 
                    a first try, no less.<br>
                    Grats Muros on Club, Joxur on Left Eye, and Riain on fang. 
                    And no, this doesn't make you look any less girly, Joxur.</span></p>
                  <p class="links">Aside from that TSO first, we managed to do 
                    the rest of North Wing as well, without using any sort of 
                    Reviviscence rotation at all. Impressive? Seems to be in this 
                    day and age. Grats assorted twinks on all sorts of useless 
                    ntov loot.</p>
                  <p class="links">Rest of the week has been pretty slow, but 
                    we still managed to totally own most of Velious.<br>
                    Lend: Grats Tamor on mask, Marjolene on Girdle, Kaithlar on 
                    Helm, and Zaxer on his key to the hell known as Sleepers.<br>
                    Ikatiar, Aary, Fleshrocket, Dagarn, Vyemm, and assorted other 
                    dragons have been slain as well, but I'm far too lazy / tired 
                    to list all the loot. Deal.</p>
                  <p class="links">Now, I'm sure you're all asking... 'Why has 
                    there been no update in a week?!?!?!' Well, here's your answer.<br>
                    Kirei is a bitch. He took a break, in his quest for man-sex. 
                    He has not yet found his hot man-sex, but rumour has it, he 
                    is looking at Thievin quite longingly. In his absence, I have 
                    usurped the site, and wrote an update. He may be back, depending 
                    on how good Thievin is in bed.</p>

                    we need to see soem dragon's dead! So we ported into Ntov 
                    finsh the COH and started off by killing Ikky the nobpformonk 
                    mob, he went down np Gratz Dolalin on his new Cloak and Andylious 
                    / Nishi on Mask of Venom. Then we started setting up for our 
                    good old friend Aary, I have to say I give prop to our Clerics 
                    and Debuffers. We took down Aary with 4 cleric with min problem. 
                    Very sweet kill for us so far. Aary droped Mask for Faviola, 
                    Hand for Modox and at last Ring for Mifisto. As we were preping 
                    next for DtD Lord Fesh suddenly poped so we said oh well one 
                    more dragon who won't drop our loot *cough SSoS*. To our surprised 
                    at the end of the Kill he drop put out a SSoS for our mage 
                    Utadin and BP to twink and Moncole to Mifisto. DtD droped 
                    crap again, tail went to twink and Robe Graz my destory key. 
                    Onwards to Kriezenn who again didn't drop Kriezenn Flame he 
                    put out bard weapon to rott and Arm to Lendo but we did have 
                    some fun with him. I went crazy as we were preping the for 
                    him and made the tank go in when clerics are all lom, after 
                    2 war went down we finaly got it stright and went on to a 
                    perfect kill. Lady M drop the Shawl for Krang, Mith Helm for 
                    Emmey and emm Mith Gloves to Manboob err I mean Joxur. Koi 
                    drop us his net which all our melee been dreaming about but 
                    Hydn the rogue manage to ninja it first so Gratz him Bracer 
                    went to Enderlm. Jorr to our surprise droped us a Sprinkler 
                    of Spirit Gratz Casu, Earring went to Hylas. At last we get 
                    to Lady Nev, I want to take a min to rant something about 
                    the messed up resist VI put it. I thought it was made resist 
                    to actully matters?? Well it doesn't Lady Nev is a horror 
                    now. I rather fight THO then her, I sware some ppl were close 
                    to pukeing from the AE. I resisted about 3 time doing the 
                    whole fight with 350 some MR and that is just crazy. Anyway 
                    she went down at the end no less and droped Eye for Lendo 
                    and Medal destoryed.</p>

                    how the heck did that happen doing some of our fights. So 
                    today we started off doing some ToV action. We ported in CoH 
                    to Lend drooped her for a fast Key for Bladeslasher Gratz. 
                    =) So we figure out Aary is up and the whole guild wanted 
                    some action since the last fight at the end didn't go so well. 
                    So we COhed there and couple hatchling repop so we decided 
                    to do aary asap after the hatchling pop. I pulled aary before 
                    the cleric set up a CH rotation lol but with our gold clerics 
                    they got the stuff sorted out fast and keep our tank up. Aary 
                    was weird a resistant mofo we couldn't get him slowed until 
                    50% but at the end as you can see he was still smacked down 
                    with couple lost. Gratz Marjolene on Circlet of Summer and 
                    Funnies on Reaper's Ring. After that we killed DtD but gee 
                    he had bad drops =( Gratz someone's destroy key on Bow and 
                    Robe and Agai on the tail. That all folks come back again!

                      it!.</p>
