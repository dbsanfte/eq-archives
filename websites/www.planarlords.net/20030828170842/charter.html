1. Membership shall be open to all who have attained at least their 35th season and to their alts who have attained their 20th season. No member may have membership in another guild.
</p>

<p>
Those seeking membership should submit an <a href="http://www.smdclan.com/PlanarLords/application.html">application</a> on this website and should seek out an officer in game.
</p>
<p>
2. Atmosphere - Planar Lords is a guild that seeks to create a home for those seeking to travel the worlds of Norrath and Luclin. As such, we strive to make our guild a place where friendships can be formed between members. Thus forming a community that is conducive to gameplay and allowing its members to show loyalty, friendship, and respect to each other. 
</p>
<p>
3. Conflicts - When conflicts arise in the guild, those with the conflict should seek out an officer of the guild to help settle the dispute. No conflicts shall be brought out in guild talk or raid talk. 
</p>
<p>
If conflicts arise during a guild raid, or at a guild event, all parties involved need to wait until the raid is concluded before resolving the coflict. That may seem too late or too long to wait, but coordinating these events/raids is time consuming. We will not hold up a raid/event or slow it down due to conflicts. 
</p>
<p>
4. Disciplinary Action - Any guild member who violates any of the guild rules/policies will receive a warning. Any guild member who recives three or more warnings will be up for review by the guild leadership for being disbanded. 
</p>
<p>
Officers/Leaders who do not follow the guild rules/policies will be demoted to a regular member after review by the guild council. 
</p>
<p>
5. All members who are online while a guild raid is going on are required to attend the raid (level permitting).
