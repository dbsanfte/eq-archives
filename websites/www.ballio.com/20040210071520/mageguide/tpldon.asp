<h4>Lost Dungeons of Norrath</h4>



<h3>Caveat</h3>



<p>

I wasn't in beta.&nbsp; I'm figuring this out as I go along, just like most of 
you.&nbsp; I could be wrong on some of this...but will continue to enhance this 
as I learn more.&nbsp; Here's what I believe to be true:</p>



<h3>

Augmentation and the Orb of Elements</h3>



<p>

As the patch message suggests, you should summon an Orb of Elements and hand it 
to the Erudite at the Toxx druid circle.&nbsp; She will give you an Ornate Orb 
of Elements....identical to the Orb of Elements except that it has no pet 
charges.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; So you can continue to summon and destroy the original 
version to make epic pets and yet maintain an augmented version for carrying.</p>



<h3>

Interactive Objects</h3>



<p>

LDoN is unique in the ways in which treasure can be obtained.&nbsp; In a dungeon 
adventure, targetable containers can be found.&nbsp; These containers must be 
approached with caution as the container is likely trapped. Handling a container 
incorrectly can result in your death, destruction of the object in the container 
and losing the adventure.&nbsp; Try to restrain your warrior buddy from simply 
smashing the chest open...</p>



<p>

Containers can be sealed by one of three mechanisms: mechanical, magic or curse.&nbsp; 
Your job is to find out which of these a given container is using, disarm any 
traps on it and open the container safely.</p>



<p>

Here is how, note this is tailored to mages:</p>



<p>

<u>Appraise the Situation</u></p>



<p>

1) If you have a rogue/bard in your group, that person should attempt to detect 
traps on the object until one of the following messages is encountered:</p>

<blockquote>



<p>

a) You sense that &lt;container&gt; is trapped.&nbsp; -- This is a mechanical trap, 
the rogue or bard should proceed with <b>Disarming the Container</b></p>



<p>

b) You are certain that &lt;container&gt; is not trapped. -- a rogue/bard should jump 
ahead to <b>Opening the Container</b></p>



<p>

c) You cannot tell if &lt;container&gt; is trapped. -- the rogue/bard should step 
aside.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>

2) If the rogue/bard could not tell if the container was trapped, a caster or 
priest should use their corresponding appraisal spell, for mages, it's a 
<a href="/mageguide/spells.asp?spellname=wuggan">Wuggan's Appraisal</a> (lesser, normal or greater) which results in one of the two 
following:</p>



<p>

a) a trap was sensed -- if you get a message similar to this, you should 
continue with <b>Disarming the Container</b></p>



<p>

b) a trap was not sensed --if you get a message similar to this, you should 
proceed to <b>Opening the Container</b></p>



<p>

c) this only works on magic -- if you get a message similar to this, you should 
step aside and let a priest class try their appraisal spell as this item is 
cursed -- you cannot open this container safely!</p>



<p>

<u>Disarming the Container</u></p>



<p>

1) You sensed a magic trap.&nbsp; To remove it, cast <a href="/mageguide/spells.asp?spellname=wuggan">Wuggan's Discombobulation</a>.&nbsp; 
This will consume a Scrying Stone of the same type as the spell (lesser, normal 
or greater).&nbsp; These tones are sold by the merchant in the Wayfarer's camp.&nbsp; 
Good luck!&nbsp; This isn't guaranteed, after all...perhaps you should have 
people stand back while you try this!</p>



<p>

<u>Opening the Container</u></p>



<p>

1) You did disarm it, right?&nbsp; Cast <a href="/mageguide/spells.asp?spellname=wuggan">Wuggan's Extrication</a> and claim your 
prize!</p>



<h3>

Spells</h3>



<p>

LDoN spells may be acquired only via spending spell points accumulated for 
completing LDoN adventures.&nbsp; Spells are purchased from an adventure 
merchant, one of which appears at each of the camps.&nbsp; The spells are NO 
DROP, so you cannot trade a spell to another player.&nbsp; Container spells are 
explained above.&nbsp; Here are the additional spells:</p>



<p>

<u>Bounce/Reflect</u></p>



<p>

A new spell type!&nbsp; This spell gives you a <u>chance</u> to send a hostile 
spell cast on you back at the caster!&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; Be aware mobs can 
cast this on themselves.&nbsp; Even cooler!&nbsp; This works on most detrimental 
spell types, although I'm uncertain as to whether it works on AEs.&nbsp; This is 
a short duration spell, so it's not something you can keep on yourself like a 
normal buff.&nbsp; <a href="/mageguide/spelldetail.asp?id=4099">Bounce</a> is level 44 and from the raw data 
has a 40% chance to reflect a spell.&nbsp; <a href="/mageguide/spelldetail.asp?id=4100">Reflect</a> is level 
58 and looks to have a 50% chance.</p>



<p>

<u>Calliav Line of Spells</u></p>



<p>

One of the toughest things about being a pet class on a raid is keeping your pet 
alive thru the AEs of boss mobs.&nbsp; This just got a whole lot easier!&nbsp; 
This line of spells is a pet buff that completely absorbs a fixed number of 
melee/spell attacks on your pet, similar to a Rune.&nbsp; Note that is is 
attack-based, not points-based like a Rune.&nbsp; The <a href="/mageguide/spells.asp?spellname=calliav">
Calliav line</a> has 3 spells of varying level, which respectively block 1, 2 and 3 attacks.</p>



<p>

<u>PBAoE Upgrade</u></p>



<p>

There is a PBAoE upgrade for us in LDoN.&nbsp; <a href="/mageguide/spelldetail.asp?id=4078">Wind of 
the Desert</a> (60).&nbsp; WotD is hugely mana 
inefficient!&nbsp; Apparently mage complaints about wanting a PBAoE upgrade weren't specific enough...</p>



<p>

<u>DD Upgrade</u></p>



<p>

If you're not level 65, <a href="/mageguide/spelldetail.asp?id=4110">Burning Sand</a> (62) might be worth 
getting.</p>



<p>

<u>Orb of Exploration</u></p>



<p>

An upgrade to the Coldstone that includes See Invis (second hand info here, I 
don't have this spell!).&nbsp; <a href="/mageguide/spells.asp?spellname=exploration">Lucy's data</a> has the 
item number.</p>
