<h4>Character Creation</h4>
<h3>Race Selection</h3>
<p>
Only the most intelligent of races can be magicians. Dark Elves, Erudites,
Gnomes, High Elves, and Humans may choose to be Magicians. Other races excel at
other things.</p>
<p>
Given these choices, you may find yourself wondering, &quot;What is the best
race for a magician?&quot; I'll tell you a secret. There isn't one. While
Erudites have the highest intelligence and Humans have the lowest, both can be
successful magicians. While other classes may prefer a Dark Elf's ability to see
in the dark to a Human's night blindness, magicians can grant themselves the
ability to see in the dark at fairly low levels. Some prefer to play a Human
since a human can trade with many vendors in the game, while Dark Elves are
limited. But again, magicians can summon food and drink to overcome much of the
need to visit vendors.</p>
<p>
Humans seem to be the least chosen race for magicians. I suspect that's simply
due to the fact that most people want to play a different race in the game than
we play in Real Life. I suggest you choose a race based upon your personal
preference, not on the stats. Your choice of race will ultimately have more
bearing on what other races think of you than it will your abilities. Choose a
race based on your personal preferences, not based on the differences in stats.</p>
<h3>
Bonus Point Distribution</h3>
<p>
With a race chosen, you may now distribute your bonus points. Allocating bonus
points to statistics will increase them. Subtracting points you allocated will
lower a statistic. You can never lower a statistic below the starting point. You
may only subtract points you added. Statistics in green are considered primary
for magicians. Statistics in white are secondary.</p>
<p><u>
Primary Stats</u><br>
Verant has chosen to highlight two stats as primary to the magician:
intelligence and stamina. Intelligence determines the size of your character's
mana pool and how quickly you will learn certain skills. Stamina determines the
number of hit points your character will have … and how quickly your character
will grow tired from physical exertion.</p>
<p>
I disagree with Verant in terms of stamina. Magicians get very little benefit
from stamina as a stat. Since I made my character before there were EQ sites
like this one, I put points into stamina because it was highlighted. With a base
stamina of 100, I see only a very small benefit in hit points. I have never been
happy with my allocation of points to stamina. My advice is to maximize the
intelligence of your character and then allocate the other points to secondary
stats.&nbsp; Ultimately, with end game items that add 20 and even 25 points to 
stats, choosing stamina will not &quot;hurt&quot; your play.</p>
<p><u>
Secondary Stats</u><br>
Charisma will affect the prices vendors will pay for your items and the price at
which they will sell their wares to you. It is not a bad statistic to raise,
should you wish.</p>
<p>
Strength will determine how much you can carry without being encumbered and how
much damage you can do with a weapon. Magicians aren't going to do much damage
with a weapon, and we can summon weightless bags to enable us to carry more
items. However, these bags have potential penalties. Increasing strength isn't a
bad decision -- especially if you're a race with low strength.</p>
<p>
Wisdom is believed to have all kinds of benefits from reducing failures at
certain tasks to preventing your character from shouting jokes on public
channels. I don't believe in any of them. Wisdom is of little, if any use to the
class.</p>
<p>
Agility is the primary stat for Armor Class.&nbsp; Higher agility means more AC
per level.&nbsp; However, as casters magicians are limited to cloth armor.&nbsp;
Magician AC will never be very high.&nbsp; AC does not absorb damage.&nbsp; It
mitigates damage.&nbsp; The difference is that as you level, your AC will be
increasingly below a blue-plus con mob's ability to hit you.&nbsp; In short:
your AC will always be poor.&nbsp; Even if you put points into agility.</p>
<p>
Dexterity determines the number of times your weapon will proc an affect (for
weapons that have effects).&nbsp; It also determines the rate of weapons skill
increases.&nbsp; Again, since magicians have poor attack ratings and weapons,
think carefully about putting points into dexterity.</p>
<h3>
Choosing a Deity</h3>
<p>
The deity choices you will have are determined by your class and race. Which to
choose is a tough call. Again, since I created Nenelar just after the launch of
the game, I chose a deity based on how I felt about each of the choices I had.
As a high elf, I had the choice of being agnostic or choosing a &quot;good&quot;
god. I chose Mithaniel Marr because I liked the idea of honor for my character.</p>
<p>
I quickly learned that I'd made a slight mistake. Factions (a measure of how
much an NPC likes or hates you) are in part determined by the deity you follow.
Agnostic is generally a neutral choice. NPCs may attack followers of one deity,
but not followers of another.</p>
<p>
Initially, there were no real benefits to choosing a deity. If you could be
agnostic, you probably should. Recently, Verant has introduced deity-based items
into the game. As of this writing, there are no items that benefit a magician
that follows Mithaniel Marr. Perhaps Verant is still working on them. I suggest
checking around on this or other EQ sites for the latest in deity-based
equipment before making your choice.</p>
<p>
Your choice of deity is permanent and you get only this opportunity to decide!
Choose carefully, however no choice will prevent you from playing your magician to his
or her fullest potential.</p>
<h3>
Choosing a Starting Location</h3>
<p>
The race you chose will determine your starting location options. Only humans
get a choice. Ak'Anon, Erudin and Neriak are &quot;library cities&quot; that
have a wider selection of spells than other cities. It is only of minor benefit
to start in one of these cities. Travel is much easier than it once was.</p>
<p>
<i>Historical Note:&nbsp; I made my first journey to Erudin from Felwithe at 
level 8.&nbsp; It was a harrowing journey in which I had to hope that my 
unreliable invisibility spell would not fail me many times.&nbsp; On foot, 
without Spirit of the Wolf, I saw: Felwithe, Greater Faydark, Butcherblock, 
Ocean of Tears, East Freeport, West Freeport, East Commons, West Commons, 
Kithicor Forest, High Pass Hold, Eastern Karana, Northern Karana, Western Karana, 
Qeynos Hills, Qeynos (both zones), Erud's Crossing and finally.....Erudin!&nbsp; 
At the time, I had only the cloth map that came with the original game.&nbsp; 
The journey took the better part of 3 hours.&nbsp; It was one of the best treks 
I have made in EQ. </i></p>
