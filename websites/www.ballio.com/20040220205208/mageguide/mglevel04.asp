<h4>Ding 4!</h4>
<p>
Congratulations…you've proven yourself to the guild and have been granted
permission to summon elementals! You're a full-fledged magician!&nbsp; But, before you rush off to summon Jobekn away from
his family, let me explain a little bit about pets. In this level, you become a
magician. There is more to learn at level 4 than any other level. Historical
data is noted below in italics, you can skip it unless you're nostalgic, like
me:</p>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5"><tr><td class="highlight" colspan="8" align="center">Pets</td></tr><tr><td class="highlight">Type</td><td class="highlight" align="center">Level</td><td class="highlight" align="center">HP</td><td class="highlight" align="center">Max Hit</td><td class="highlight" align="center">Spell Dmg</td><td class="highlight" align="center">Spell Effect</td><td class="highlight" align="center">Spell Resist</td><td class="highlight">Special</td></tr><tr><td>Air</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center">3 sec stun</td><td align="center">magic</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">95</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center">root</td><td align="center">magic</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">50</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center">fire</td><td>Self DS for 7</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">80</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center">cold</td><td></td></tr></table><br />
<p><u>
What is the Best Pet?<br>
</u>I often get tells from young magicians. Many of these wide-eyed mages have the
same question: &quot;What is the best pet?&quot; There is no universal best pet.
Magician pets are situational and have important differences:</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" width="80%">
    <tr>
      <td>
Earth</td>
      <td>Earth pets are made of dirt and rock. They are hearty pets with more health than
any other type of pet. However, earth pets take more of a beating since it isn't
very agile. Earth pets cast root on their targets once every 6 seconds. Root
holds the target in place, but also causes the Earth pet to take more damage in
a fight since a fleeing mob will turn and fight if it is rooted. At this level,
the root does not do damage. Earth pets are very resistant to disease.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
Water</td>
      <td>Water pets have roughly 85% of the hit points of Earth. Water is more agile and
does not root an opponent, so it takes less overall damage in a fight. Water
casts a direct damage spell on its target every 6 seconds. Overall, Water does
more damage to its target than does Earth. Water pets are very resistant to
poison.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Air</td>
      <td>
Air pets have roughly 80% of the hit points of Earth. Air is the most agile of
all pets and it has the best AC. Further, it casts a stun on its target every 12
seconds. Since this pet is agile and stuns its opponent, it takes the least
damage of any pet in combat. The stun cast by the Air pet can interrupt casting.
Air pet stuns do not do damage at this level. Air pets have the annoying habit
of turning themselves invisible.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fire</td>
      <td>
Fire pets have approximately 70% of the hit points of Earth. Fire is the least
hearty of the elementals. However, Fire pets cast a direct damage spell every 6
seconds and buff themselves with a fire shield. The self-buffed shield does
damage to an attacker on every hit. Since this damage is not resistible, Fire
will do more damage to a mob in a given period of time than any other pet. Fire
pets are immune to fire damage.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p><i>
History Lesson: Elementals used to be very different than they are today. For
example, only Fire and Water used to cast damage spells. Pets used to attack at
different speeds. Pets used to benefit greatly from weapons they were given.
Monsters used to attack a pet even if they would not have dared attack you. (A
benefit of the air pet used to be that it would turn itself invisible and
therefore most likely not cause of a fight. On PVP servers, an air pet's
invisibility may be of use still.) If you see information on the web that
contradicts what I've said above, it is likely out of date. It's also possible
that this document is out of date. This document was written in June of 2002.</i></p>
<p>
So what is the best pet? For mobs that hit hard and slow, Earth makes a good
choice. For mobs that hit fast, Fire is a good choice (mobs burn themselves to
death on the pet's fire shield). For mobs that cast spells, Air is a good choice
since it interrupts spell casts. Water is a good choice when you do not want the
pet to root. (Later, Water becomes more specialized than it is at this level).</p>
<h3>Pet Commands</h3>
<p>
Another question often asked is &quot;What are the pet commands?&quot;<br>
All pet commands start with &quot;/pet&quot; followed by a command. You can
create socials to make commanding your pet easier. I suggest you do! (They're
not hard to set up, but explaining that isn't part of this magician guide).</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" width="80%">
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet follow me</td>
      <td> Orders the pet to stay by your side when it isn't otherwise busy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet guard here</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to stay near the location you issue the command
except when it is fighting. The pet will return to its post when it has nothing
better to do.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet attack</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to attack your current target. If the target is not
legal (your pet can only attack things you can attack yourself) your pet will
apologize. If the target is legal and in range, your pet will immediately
attack. If the target is legal and out of range, your pet will wait until the
mob comes into range to attack. Note that your pet is not all that bright. If
you tell it to attack and you accidentally had a city guard targeted, you're
going to need medical attention at level 4. At higher levels, your pet could win
a fight like this quickly and cost you faction that you didn't intend to lose.
In short…always know what you're telling your pet to attack.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet back off</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to stop attacking. If your pet takes damage after
it is ordered away from combat, it will start fighting again.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet report health</td>
      <td> Your pet will tell you the percentage of health that it has
remaining.&nbsp; also: /pet report -and- /pet health</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet who leader</td>
      <td> Your pet will say, &quot;Nenelar is my leader&quot; - not overly useful, but if you have a cleric that will buff your 
		pet trying to pick it out of a crowd of pets, this works well. This command has been broken since sometime in 
		2002.&nbsp; Too bad...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet get lost</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to return to his family…the one you so
heartlessly ripped him away from during his Sunday dinner.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet sit down</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to sit at its current location. Note that if you
tell a pet to sit and then send it to attack, it will sit down wherever it
finishes the fight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet stand up</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to stand at its current location. Note that if you
tell a pet to sit and then send it to attack, it will stand wherever it finishes
the fight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet taunt ON/OFF</td>
      <td> Orders your pet to taunt…or not to taunt. Your pet will tell
you when it is taunting. Taunts are nasty things the pet will say to the mob to
make the mob angrier at the pet than anyone else. Sadly, you will not see the
creative taunts your pet can deliver. By default, taunting is always on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="120">
/pet stop humping</td>
      <td> If you pet ehibits the rather unpleasant tendency to hump your 
      groupmate's legs, this command will be helpful</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Historical Note: Sitting pets used to be the cause of fights
since mobs would see the pet sitting and attack. Now that mobs aren't KOS unless they are already fighting, you can use the sit command without fear of
being attacked for it. (Note: You're still a prime target in the mind of a mob
if you're sitting).</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
In my opinion, pet taunting was turned down too much when it was
&quot;fixed&quot; in 2001. You will find that many monsters will attack players
and completely ignore the pet. Earth and Air can temporarily immobilize a mob
and are therefore more effective at keeping the mob focused on themselves rather
than on you or your group members.&nbsp; This weak taunt is most noticeable at 
lower levels.</p>
<p><b>Important: </b> Your pet listens to everything you say when it is your target. Be
careful what you say in normal chat mode (pets don't listen to group chat, guild
chat, OOC, shout, etc) when your pet is targeted. Much like the Quest discussion
pointed out earlier, your pet will respond to anything that contains key words.
If you had your pet targeted and you say, &quot;How did Soandso get lost again?
He's a ranger for crying out loud,&quot; your pet will promptly vanish since you
said, &quot;get lost&quot; in the sentence. Smart pet, dumb mage! I've made this
very mistake myself…(it's even worse when you say the word attack and your pet
tries to parse exactly what you told it to attack).</p>

<h3>Pet Strategy</h3>

<p><u>
Buff your pet.</u> At this level, you do not have spells to enhance your pet.
However, others you group with likely will. Your pet will benefit from any
spells cast on it just like a player. If the pet will be tanking mobs, your
healer should check the pet's health periodically. Note: the results of /pet
report health are only seen by you, not the group.</p>

<p><u>Give your pet a weapon</u> as at low levels, most of the weapons you find
are better than your pet's barehanded attack.&nbsp; Your pet does not currently
dual wield, so you should give your pet the best 2H weapon you can afford (or
you can summon).&nbsp; For example, a level 4 pet that hits for 10 points max
will hit for 14 points with a 7 damage staff.&nbsp; That's a 40% improvement!</p>

<p><u>
Assist your pet</u>. You can use /pet report health or target the pet to see how it
is doing. If it is getting too low on health, you can step into the fight and
melee alongside your pet. Since the mob will switch to you when you do this,
your pet can continue doing damage until the fight is finished. A good strategy
is to pull a mob with a spell and then send your pet to attack. You can cast
another spell or two while your pet is fighting. Check the pet's health and
decide if your pet needs you to step in, cast another spell, or is doing just
fine on its own.</p>

<p><u>
Your pet is expendable.</u> If something goes horribly wrong and your pet is going
to die, it is very likely that you are next to be served. If it is hopeless, you
should gate (if you're solo…don't leave a group hanging) before your pet dies.
It's a nice touch to /salute your pet as you are channeling gate. Goodbye little
buddy…thanks for saving my bacon. *sniff* If it is not hopeless, you can start
channeling a new pet before your current one dies. You must be sure that your
existing pet is dead and gone before you summon a new one. Timing is important.
But then, you've got a command that will finish off your current pet instantly…don't
you?</p>

<p><u>
Pet kiting</u> is a tactic that many magicians stumble onto at this level. If you
nuke a mob heavily, it will be very angry at you. You can run away from the mob
and it will chase you. If you have a pet, your pet will chase the mob. The
result of this is that your pet is getting &quot;free&quot; hits on the mob,
which would rather chase you than turn and fight your pet. This requires an
outdoor environment in which there aren't many other mobs that will attack. In
general, other players see kiting as a cheap tactic. Kiting may also endanger
other players. I'm listing it here for the sake of completeness, but you won't
learn much about the game if you spend most of your time this way. Pet kiting it
is a good emergency tactic at this level. If you and your pet are low on health
and you are low on mana, pet kiting may enable you to win the fight. My advice
is to keep it in mind, but use it only as a last resort. Never endanger other
players to save yourself. And, if you do have a train of mobs behind you, it is
proper to give a shout to the zone that you're incoming to ____ with a train.</p>

<p><u>Magical beings</u> are tough to hit.&nbsp; In fact, they're immune to
normal weapons.&nbsp; At this level, you won't likely encounter them, but it's
good to know about them now.&nbsp; Your pet cannot hit a magic creature with its
hands until level 10.&nbsp; However, you can summon a dagger that is
magic.&nbsp; Hand the dagger to pet...your pet will know how to use it.&nbsp; At
this level, you need only hand a single dagger to your pet.</p>

<p><u>Equipping your pet</u> is a good idea.&nbsp; You should give it any armor you
encounter that you don't need and do not intend to sell.&nbsp; Although you
won't see the graphics, your pet will equip the items you give it.&nbsp; You can
give your pet a bit more AC by passing it any armor you'd otherwise
destroy.&nbsp; The benefit is small, so if you need money, you should sell the
armor to NPCs or other players rather than giving it to your pet.&nbsp; Your pet
will not return any items.&nbsp; When your pet dies, there will be no
corpse.&nbsp; Be sure you are handing your pet something you truly do not need.</p>

<p><u>Manage the pet's aggro list.</u>&nbsp; Your pet will attack things that
you tell it to attack (if it can).&nbsp; It will also attack things that attack
it or you.&nbsp; Pets have memories.&nbsp; If they are attacking Mob_01 and you
tell it to attack Mob_02, get attacked by Mob_02 or Mob_02 attacks the pet, your
pet will &quot;hate&quot; Mob_02 and may decide to attack it immediately or wait
until it has finished with Mob_01.&nbsp; If you do not want the pet to switch to
Mob_02, back off the pet (/pet back off) and send it at Mob_01 again.&nbsp;
You'll have to repeat this if Mob_02 attacks you or the pet again.&nbsp; You can
also use the hate list to get your pet to automatically attack Mob_02 when
Mob_01 dies.&nbsp; If you tell your pet to attack Mob_02 while it is fighting
Mob_01, it will attack Mob_02 once Mob_01 dies.&nbsp; Be careful.&nbsp; Your pet
will switch to Mob_02 before Mob_01 dies if Mob_02 makes your pet angry
enough.&nbsp; If that happens, Mob_01 may come for you, or your pet could be
tanking 2 mobs.</p>

<p><i>
Historical Note: Pets used to share in the experience from a mob. Groups and
mages were overly concerned about how much of a share in the experience a pet
took. In my opinion, pets never took more of the experience than they made up
for in power, but that's moot now. As long as you or a member of your group does
1 point of damage to the mob, you will get the full experience. If you let your
pet kill a mob outright -- with not even 1 point of help -- you will get much
less experience.&nbsp; Pets have never benefited from the experience they
&quot;take&quot; from a fight.&nbsp; They do not &quot;ding&quot; from
experience gained while fighting.</i></p>

<p>Historical Note:&nbsp; There used to be some randomness in the level of the pet 
a mage could summon. For example, level 4 pet
spells could summon a pet from level 3 to 6. Since that's a big range 
(especially at this level), mages used to burn a lot more malachite trying to 
get the best pet possible.&nbsp; That's no longer necessary since you always get 
the highest level pet!</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>
Summoning is a specialized spell that requires malachite to work. All pets,
regardless of level, require one piece of malachite to summon. Malachite is
relatively inexpensive and stocked in many cities. I carry anywhere from 20 - 80
malachite on me at a time. If you're tight on cash (as I was at level 4) you
might only carry 5 - 10, just remember than if you run out of malachite, you
can't make pets until you get more.</p>

<p><i>
Historical Note: At level 12 magician pets used to require a different component.
If you see lapis lazuli listed on a website, it's out of date. Lapis is much
more expensive (comparatively) than malachite, so be happy!&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>
If you have enough money to buy all of the pets, I suggest you do so.&nbsp;
There is no time
like the present to learn the differences in pets.</p>

<p>
*You will find that your guild vendors don't sell all spells. Some spells are
sold on the vendors of other guilds…like Gate…or in other zones, like Summon
Brass Choker (sold only on Luclin). If you can't get to the moon, don't worry.
The spell isn't all that important. But do search for Gate, which you will find
in your starting city somewhere - it is very
important.</p>

<h3>
Fire Flux</h3>

<p>This is your first Point Blank Area of Effect (PBAoE) spell.&nbsp; This spell
sends out a ring of fire from your position.&nbsp; It will never damage you, but
it will burn anything you can legally target for damage.&nbsp; There are not
many times when this type of spell is useful, however if you have a need to kill
several green mobs around you, Fire Flux is for you.&nbsp; Remember...if you
don't kill everything you hit, you're going to have some angry mobs to
placate.&nbsp; Note that this spell is not mana efficient unless you are casting
it on multiple targets.</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> Do not use any AoE spell like Fire Flux around NPCs you'd rather not
fight. As a level 4, I tested my new spells out a little too close to a guard.
Guard Highmoon says, &quot;Magicians like you really bring out the worst in me…&quot;</p>

<h3>
Sense Summoned</h3>

<p>
This spell will turn you toward the closest summoned being.&nbsp; It's useful
for finding mobs that are summoned.&nbsp; It can also be used to find mobs that
have pets.&nbsp; For example, if you wish to find an enchanter mob, this spell
might turn you to the enchanter's pet.&nbsp; Note that this spell turns you in
the direction of the mob, not necessarily the direction you'll have to run to
get to that mob.</p>

<p><i>Historical Note: Sense Summoned used to target your pet if it was the
closest summoned being to you.&nbsp; This is no longer the case.&nbsp; Sense
summoned will no longer target your pet.&nbsp; This change greatly increased the
usefulness of Sense Summoned -- although it means you cannot use the spell to
locate a lost pet.</i></p>

<h3>Summoned Items</h3>

<p>
Mages aren't a buffing class. We don't have spells to cast on others to make the
stronger, run faster or be smarter. (I've wished for that last one many times).
Instead, we summon items to give to people. These items are temporary. They
vanish if the player goes offline for more than 30 minutes. At this point, your
ability to summon is fairly limited to mundane items. That will change as you
gain levels. However, even at level 1, you'll save money since you don't have to
buy bandages.&nbsp; Summon Wisp is useful if you're a class that is
night-blind.&nbsp; This spell creates a small light source.</p>

<h3>Summoned Focus Items</h3>

<p>
Focus items are a special type of summoned gear that when worn affects the magic
of the wearer. At this point, you can only summon a Brass Choker. It's a
necklace that when worn, gives you a chance to save your malachite when you cast
a pet summon. The necklace actually works for other classes that have spells
that use components as well (within certain limits). These are high demand items
that were very recently added for magicians. Make use of them!</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>
You are now able to Mediate! Well, once you train it, that is. Meditate is a
skill that only increases if you train it initially. Just train one point. It
will increase on its own from there. You will automatically meditate when you
sit.</p>

<p><i>
Historical Note: To meditate, players used to have to sit, open the spell book
and click the meditate button. Since casting classes spend a lot of time
meditating, most of us spent a good percentage of time in EQ seeing a spell book
rather than the game graphics. Verant changed the game so that characters level
35+ would automatically meditate when they sat down in the first year of the
game. Today, all casters meditate automatically. So, that's why that useless
meditate button is there under your open spell book!</i></p>

<p>
I would recommend training Alteration and Conjuration at this point. These are
important skills that you may not have used much during your first three levels.
In lieu of training these skills, you can cast Gate to practice alteration. Cast
Summon Food or Drink to practice Conjuration. Don't summon pets to practice your
skill…they cost malachite! To practice, just stand there casting repeatedly.
When you run out of mana, sit and meditate. Repeat.</p>

<p>
You can practice your damage spells this way too. Target yourself and cast. Just
don't kill yourself. This is a safe way to practice Bind Wound. Make bandages,
nuke yourself and fix yourself up. (You can only bandage to 50% of your health).</p>

<p>
Begging is an actual skill in the game. It doesn't have any real use, but if you
wish, you can raise it by begging from your pet. You won't get anything from
your pet…but then, your pet won't decide you need a beating for begging
either. NPCs may not like beggars and may take it upon themselves to teach you a
lesson.&nbsp; I wish I could do that!</p>

<p>
Alcohol tolerance is another skill in the game that's there for fun. You've
worked hard to get to level 4. Stop by the local tavern and celebrate. Oh…and
you're buying.</p>

<p>
Trade skills are useful, although they are expensive pastimes. If you are
interested in taking on trades at this level, I encourage you to read one of the
many fine guides to trade skills. Note that trade skills are very important at
high levels in the game.</p>

<h3>
Melee</h3>

<p>
You should continue to assist your pet with melee.&nbsp; Doing this will not
only help ensure the outcome of the fight, but it will ensure that your offense
and defense skills stay maxed.&nbsp; Offense determines your attack rating (how
often you will hit).&nbsp; Defense is part of your AC calculation.&nbsp; Neither
of these can be trained.&nbsp; The only way to raise them is to melee.</p>
