<p>
You've made it another 4 levels. And, if you hadn't noticed already, you'll pick
up on the fact that many of your spells are more powerful versions of previous
spells. From this point on, I will just point out new things. At most levels,
you'll get more powerful versions of things you already have. There's no
need to review them again. You should be
starting to amass money and you should always check to see how much money you
would need to buy your next set of spells so you set aside enough to purchase
them. I'll no longer
suggest which spells you should buy either. You're gaining independence! Of course, I will not curb my need to
expound on history!</p>

<h3>Breaking a Habit</h3>

<p>
At low levels, you learned that if you ran from a mob, you might survive an
otherwise hopeless fight. After all, guards were nearby to deliver a severe
beating to any mob that chased you. But that taught you a lesson that you need
to forget. From this point on, when you are grouped you should never run from a
mob that is hitting you. Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
The mob is hitting you because you made it angrier at you than it is at anyone
else in the group. You need to slow down your spell casting. Don't chain cast
spells unless you have no other choice. It's easy to cast like crazy in a fight.
But, you're less able to take damage than is a warrior or other tank. Your
cleric will use more mana to heal you than to heal the warrior. Your group's
efficiency will suffer.</li>
    <li>
Look around. There are no guards that can kill a mob for you. Where will you
run? Most casters that run at this level run around in circles like a ninny. If
you do that, your tanks will not be able to hit the mob. Which means, they can't
make it mad at them again. You're not going to tire out the mob. It will keep
chasing you. Your cleric will use more mana to heal you….same story. Your
group's efficiency will again suffer.</li>
    <li>
So what should you do if you're tanking a mob and don't want to be? Be sure your
group knows the mob is hitting you so that a tank can anger it or an enchanter
can mesmerize or another group member can root. Back away from the mob slowly. It will switch targets or stop attacking
altogether. Backing away from it slowly
ensures that your tanks can get hit in on the mob. It will also ensure that you
don't get backstabbed.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>The Bolt</h3>

<p>
This is the first level you gain a bolt-type spell: Flame Bolt. This spell has a
much greater range than your normal DD spells, but it travels like a magic arrow.
You must have line of sight (LOS) for it to hit. It will follow a moving
opponent, but any landscape geometry, players or pets in the way will block it. A bolt will only damage targets you can attack but it will damage a mob that
gets in your way - even though that mob isn't your target! Be careful firing
bolts from an area that guards protect. You know what's going to happen if you
send a bolt at the back of a guard that jumps in front of you to protect you…(remember
that ducking….D by default…will instantly cancel a channeling spell)</p>

<p>
Bolts fly to the center of most mob models. For now, that's not all that
important to know. Most mobs you'll fight are physically small. But later, it
will be good to know. For example, you cannot easily hit a small beetle with a
bolt if players surround it. However, you can easily hit a giant even if it is
surrounded since the giant's center is above the heads of players.</p>

<p>
Bolts can be &quot;curved&quot; around geometry to a limited extent. If you find
your LOS partially blocked, you can face away from the mob to cast the bolt. The
bolt will start by moving away from you but will &quot;hook&quot; around and
orient on the mob. This has the effect of curving the bolt around something or
someone near you.</p>

<p>
You will find that bolts are generally a sure hit when you are at a higher
altitude that your target's center. Standing on a hill and firing bolts at
targets below you is a good strategy. You'll also find that bolts do not travel
uphill well. They have a tendency to collide with the ground short of the
target.</p>

<p>
<i>Historical Note -
Double Bolts: Bolts were bugged for the first 3 years of the game.&nbsp; Originally, if the player was above the mob, 
bolts had a good chance of landing twice per cast.&nbsp; Although Verant stated it was a display bug only, it was 
clearly hitting twice.&nbsp; In any event, it has been fixed.&nbsp; Regardless of rumor -- bolts no longer land twice.</i></p>

<h3>Healing the Pet</h3>
<p>
You can now cast your first pet heal: Renew Elements. This spell works just like
any other heal in the game, but will only work on your own pet. It heals 33 hit points per cast. It costs
25 mana points to cast. A quick calculation
will tell you that this spell is not very efficient. For 80 mana points you can
summon a new pet at full health. But, the spell has utility. Summoning a new pet is slower and requires malachite. While fighting,
check your pet's health. If it looks like an extra 33 hp is needed, toss your
pet a heal!&nbsp; This spell improves with each level.&nbsp; At level 9 it will
heal for 34, at level 10 for 35 etc.&nbsp; This spell stops improving at level
25 (50 point heal).</p>

<p>If you have been equipping and/or buffing your pet, healing it might be more
efficient than summoning -- since a new pet will need to be reequipped and
buffed.</p>

<p>Note: This spell also attempts to cure any diseases on the pet.&nbsp;
Depending on the type of disease, you may need more than one cast to remove it.</p>

<p><i>Historical Note: On 7/24/02, the healing penalty to non-clerics was
lifted.&nbsp; Heals will no longer suffer a 10% penalty in hit points healed and
will heal for the full amount.</i></p>

<h3>Damage Shields</h3>

<p>
You can now cast a damage shield, just like the one your fire pet casts on
itself. Magician damage shields are fire-based spells that immolate their target
in flame. Anything hitting the immolated person (or pet) takes a certain amount
of damage for each hit. This damage cannot be resisted and always lands for the
same amount. It adds up quickly. This is one of the most efficient spells you
get. Even at level 60, the damage shield is an important part of the mage
repertoire. Do not cast your spell on your fire pet. The fire pet's shield does
more damage than the one you can cast. This spell type has a short duration.</p>

<p>
The issue of efficiency deserves special attention. Many magicians don't use DS
because they believe they are wasting mana. Many tanks believe they'd be better
off with one more buff (the DS takes a &quot;buff slot&quot;) or are afraid it
adds aggro to them. Let's take the last of these issues first:</p>

<p>
Damage shields do not count as damage done by a player. Many magicians tell
tales about how they cast a damage shield, made a mob angry and died as a
result of it. Don't believe them yourself! The damage from a DS does not build aggro (they don't
make the mob hate you more). However, mobs notice any beneficial spell you cast
on someone they're fighting. And, they may take exception to it. You should cast
the DS prior to attacking. That way the mob won't know who cast the spell.</p>

<p>
We can prove that damage from DS does not &quot;count&quot; toward hate in three
ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) If a mob dies by burning itself to death on a
damage shield, the corpse will poof and you will not get experience. Why? Again,
damage from the shield does not count against you in terms of aggro. So the game
does not know that a player killed the mob (which proves you the damage did not
  count as damage you did), and&nbsp;</p>

  <p> 2) If you cast a DS on a player prior to the fight and that player dies,
  the mob will walk away.&nbsp; It will not come looking for you (which proves
  you were not added to the mob's hate list), and</p>

  <p>3) You will take faction hits
for kills by players on whom you cast a DS during a fight (which proves the mob saw your DS as a spell that benefited the
  player).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
As to efficiency, consider first how many times your pet or tank in your group
gets hit in an average fight. It's likely in the neighborhood of 20. But, to be
conservative let's call it 10. Now consider your most power spell: Flame Bolt. Both the DS and Bolt have the same mana cost:
40. Yet, your bolt will hit for a
maximum of 47, while in the average fight your DS will do 10 x 5 or 50 points of
damage. Further, the bolt can miss or be completely/partially resisted. Your DS
cannot miss and always lands for full damage. (It will increase to 6 points at
level 9).&nbsp; As you level, DS becomes increasingly efficient -- especially
since it will last more than one fight.</p>

<p>
Finally, magician damage shields have an important benefit -- they add to fire
resist.&nbsp; If you're fighting a mob that casts fire-based spells, you should
use a DS even if you don't expect to be tanking.&nbsp; It will increase your
chance to resist fire-based spells.</p>

<h3>The Bottomless Bag</h3>

<p>
You're weak and cannot carry much … but you like loot. What to do? Wouldn't it
be great if you had a magic bag that made things put into it weightless? Summon
one! Summon two they're small! But be warned: If you should leave the game for
any reason (deliberately or for reasons beyond your control) for more than 30
minutes, the bag and any items inside of it are gone. Forever. And that's a very
long time.</p>

<p><i>
Historical note: When I was a level 35 magician, bags vanished instantly if you
went off line. There was no 30 minute grace period. One day I was carrying
several summoned bags of weapons to sell to vendors and players. I zoned into
Greater Faydark and was awed to see Tunare! Well, everyone told their friends
and soon Greater Faydark had more players than it could hold. The zone crashed. Poof! 80pp worth of items
vanished. I never forgot that. Not long ago, I was
part of a raid that killed Tunare. The pain of losing my items is starting to
fade.</i></p>

<p><i>Historical note: In my newbie days, summoned items in the bank would not
vanish when a player logged out nor would summoned items vanish due to link
death.&nbsp; People abused these two things by putting stacks of food and arrows
in the bank before logging -- or by deliberately going link dead to save
items.&nbsp; To stop these exploits, Verant changed the game so that summoned
items immediately vanished, creating a new set of problems like the previous
note.</i></p>

<h3>Eye of Zomm</h3>

<p>
How Zomm got his name in the history books is a story for another day. It
certainly wasn't for this spell. This spell summons a moveable eyeball and
changes your camera perspective to it. You can control the movement of the eye
for a brief period. The idea is to use the eye to scout areas without taking
much risk. With the changes to pets, the eye is now completely ignored by mobs.</p>

<p>
Since the Eye of Zomm is ignored by mobs, you can no longer pull by sending the
eye into a room and making the creatures in the room angry.&nbsp; However, you
can still use the eye to obtain a target you might not otherwise be able to
target!&nbsp; For example, you can send the eye into a room and target a
specific mob through the eye.&nbsp; When you return to your own viewpoint
(either when the spell expires or you remove the icon) you will have that mob
targeted.&nbsp; Others in your group or nearby can even /assist you to pick up
that target.</p>

<p>
You can summon and control the Eye even if you have a pet (which wasn't always
the case). The eye is an NPC and isn't a pet, so players can attack it. You'll
find people delight in killing your eye.&nbsp; It has very few hit points and
will usually die in a single hit.</p>

<p><i>
Historical Note: Dueling in front of guards is not a good idea. When guards see
players fighting, they usually want to jump in and stop it. The most efficient
way of doing that is to kill you. A player can kill your Eye of Zomm in front of
a guard without offending the guard. But for some reason guards used to take
exception to a pet killing the eye. One time in North Freeport a magician killed
my eye with his pet and felt the wrath of the Paladin guild. This was fixed long
ago. Guards no longer care if pets kill the Eye of Zomm. It's too bad, really. It was a funny bug...if you weren't an Eye-killer, that is.</i></p>

<h3>Invisibility</h3>

<p>
This spell makes you invisible. Maybe. All undead creatures can still see you. Many mobs will still be able to see
you. Your pet will commit suicide (it can't
see you). And, the spell has a random duration. It could drop at any time
leaving you to say, &quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&quot;
But, the mobs probably will pay attention. Invisibility will drop instantly if
you begin casting a spell, start attacking or get attacked. You'll learn that
Invisibility is very unreliable. You'll die more than once while depending on
it.</p>

<h3>
Staff of Tracing</h3>

<p>
You can now summon a staff with rather poor stats that acts as a light source. The staff has 2 charges of
Flare. The staff is 2hb...since your pet doesn't yet benefit from 2
weapons, try giving it a Staff of Tracing!&nbsp; It will increase your pet's
damage output.</p>

<h3>New Focus Item</h3>

<p>
You can now summon a mantle that makes single target buff spells (like your fire
shield) last longer.</p>

<h3>New Pet Skill</h3>

<p>
Your pets will now bash their target for additional damage. The pet will do this
automatically while fighting.</p>
