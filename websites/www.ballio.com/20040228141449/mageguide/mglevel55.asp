<h3>New Pet</h3>
<p>Zomm was an odd mage.&nbsp; You'll recall the Eye of Zomm being named for
him.&nbsp; Now, you can scribe and cast another of his namesakes -- Rage of Zomm
-- a new pet!&nbsp; Many sites confuse the Eye of Zomm with this pet and
describe the Rage pet as a suicidal eye.&nbsp; Rage is actually a large earth
pet model, but the similarities stop there.</p>
<p>Prior to casting this pet, you should target the mob you want it to
attack.&nbsp; Once summoned, it will immediately attack that target.&nbsp; This
pet hits for more damage than any non-epic pet, but it has very few hp, seems to
hit much more slowly and from what I can tell it does not bash.&nbsp; If this
pet gets the attention of a high level mob, it is often killed in a single round
-- many times in a single blow!</p>
<p>This pet will suicide within a few seconds of the time its hate list is
cleared.&nbsp; So, if you back it off or if the last mob on its hate list dies,
it will suicide (the spell effects look like it is gating).&nbsp; You can stack
the hate list (tell it to attack Mob_02 while it is fighting Mob_01).&nbsp; If
you do this, the pet will not suicide until both mobs are dead.</p>
<p>This pet cannot be equipped since it will be fighting (or committing
suicide).&nbsp; It can be buffed while it is fighting.&nbsp; It does not cast
spells on itself or on its opponents.&nbsp; It does not require malachite to
summon.</p>
<p>You should use this pet only when you do not need a pet to tank -- at
all.&nbsp; But understand that this pet does not do much more damage than the
Greater Voceration series of pets you will get starting at level 57.&nbsp; If
you already have your epic pet, there's little reason to use this spell at all.</p>
<p>I'm convinced Zomm was a prodigy that died at an early age and never knew
what killed him.</p>
<p><i>Historical Note: In my opinion, one of the primary benefits of this pet
was in the fact that it would not wander off.&nbsp; After a fight, it simply
vanished.&nbsp; I used to use it frequently in fights where I didn't need a pet
to tank and was concerned about pathing.&nbsp; However, now that pets are not
aggro after a fight, that benefit is gone. </i></p>
<h3>Call of the Hero</h3>
<p>Congratulations on obtaining another of the class-defining spells.&nbsp; This
spell will summon a group member to your location provided that group member is
in the same zone as you.&nbsp; This spell consumes a pearl.&nbsp; It has an
additional benefit in that if you are outside a set range (the distance seems to
vary a bit, but it's around 150 - 200) from a mob that hates the player, that
mob will forget about the hate.&nbsp; In other words, you can use CoH to clear
aggro.&nbsp; If your puller gets a mess, have him/her kite it away and CoH them
to the group!</p>
<p><u>COH Tips:</u></p>
<ol>
  <li><u>Don't be the leader</u>.&nbsp; Only the leader can invite people to
    your group.&nbsp; You can only COH people in your group.&nbsp; So, you need
    someone else to be the ferry that goes and invites people for COH to your
    position.</li>
  <li><u>Adding people to a raid</u>: group with a leader that can gate to the
    zone.&nbsp; A wizard or druid is ideal for this task since they can also go
    pick up additional members from nearly any point in Norrath.</li>
  <li><u>Getting people out of a raid</u>: Suppose your group is somewhere like
    the Lower Kobold camp in Velks.&nbsp; You have no porter.&nbsp; How can you
    get the melees out?&nbsp; Well, they can drink a potion or you can plan
    ahead and bind yourself just outside the zone.&nbsp; When the group is done,
    gate out, zone back in and summon the melees to the zone line.</li>
  <li><u>The leader shuffle</u>: You may encounter a situation similar to:
    GroupA_Leader is standing near you.&nbsp; GroupA_Player1 is somewhere else
    in the zone.&nbsp; Ungrouped_Player2 is with GroupA_Player1 and needs to be
    brought to your location.&nbsp; GroupA_Leader cannot gate to the zone.&nbsp;
    What do you do?&nbsp; You shuffle the leaders!&nbsp; Do do this, join GroupA.&nbsp;
    (If GroupA needs to disband someone so you can join, be sure it is NOT
    Player1 that disbands).&nbsp; Once you're in group, Player1 should target
    you.&nbsp; Once you're targeted, disband.&nbsp; Have Player1 confirm you are
    still targeted!&nbsp; Ok?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Player1 should disband and
    invite you immediately.&nbsp; It's a good idea for Player1 to invite you
    using the /invite command rather than a click (which could inadvertently
    change the target).&nbsp; Now Player1 can invite Player2 and you can summon
    them both to your location!&nbsp; Woot!&nbsp; Shuffling in this manner can
    make you look like a genius!&nbsp; Just be sure Player1 fully understands
    what needs to be done before you and he/she disband.</li>
  <li><u>Warn players to stand still:</u>&nbsp; There's not much funnier than
    summoning a group into a spot like the cliff in The Hole while they're
    running.&nbsp; You have been summoned!&nbsp; LOADING PLEASE WAIT...&nbsp;
    Cliffs aren't the only hazard.&nbsp; A player running around most places can
    cause unwanted aggro.&nbsp; I set up a social that just does a /g %T is
    being summoned ... Please stand still, /cast #.&nbsp; You might find that
    useful.</li>
  <li><u>Be alert</u>: I've saved many pullers using COH when they never even
    thought of it.&nbsp; Make a social like: /g Emergency COH of %T ... Say if
    you want cancelled!, /cast 7.&nbsp; Be prepared to duck to cancel the spell
    if the puller doesn't want to be COH'd.&nbsp; It's a good idea to work out
    when you will COH in advance so you don't surprise anyone.&nbsp; On a
    warrior, you might not &quot;auto cast&quot; this spell until they are down
    to 40%.&nbsp; On lighter tanks, 50% might be better.&nbsp; Of course, the
    speed with which you see hp dropping should factor into your decision as
    well.&nbsp; COH takes a long time to channel.&nbsp; You won't always be able
    to save a puller that gets in a bad spot, but think of COH as the only 100%
    experience resurrection in the game.&nbsp; There are other alternatives if
    you fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Historical Note: COH used to clear aggro regardless of range.&nbsp; It was
abused.&nbsp; Magicians were clearing aggro on high level encounters while
standing next to the mob.&nbsp; The change to implement a minimum range wasn't a
nerf in my opinion -- it makes sense that the mob not forget if the player is
moved only a short distance away.&nbsp; Where'd he go?&nbsp; THERE HE IS!</i></p>
<h3>Sirocco</h3>
<p>Sirocco is a very good upgrade to the rain line of spells.&nbsp; For a mana
cost of 399, Sirocco attempts 3 waves of 630 damage each.&nbsp; This spell has
an amazing 4.74 damage to mana multiplier if all 3 waves hit -- and is better
than Char or Shock of Swords if just 2 of the 3 waves land for full
damage.&nbsp; Remember to keep yourself out of the area of this spell!&nbsp; You
should wait until your target has built up some hate against its current target
before casting.&nbsp; That will ensure it stays in the area of effect for all
waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against multiple targets, Sirocco makes 4 attempts of 630 damage each.&nbsp;
Should all 4 waves land, you will do 2520 total damage for only 399 mana!</p>
<h3>Burnout IV</h3>
<p>Yet another upgraded spell merits a quick note.&nbsp; As of July 2002, pets
have a haste cap of 60%.&nbsp; Burnout IV has a haste effect of 60%.&nbsp; If
you cast Burnout IV on your pet, no other speed buffs are needed.&nbsp;
Enchanters and shaman can save their mana! (And you can stop giving your pet
those Runebranded Girdles you've been farming).</p>
