	<h4>Level 1 - Getting Started</h4>
	<h3>Finding the Magician Guild</h3>
	<p>Poof! You appear in Norrath in your starting city. What to do? You want to be a magician…find more magicians! 
	You'll have a note in your inventory that you should read. (Right click it while in windowed interface mode). If you 
	deliver the note, you'll not only know where your guild is located, but you'll be rewarded with experience and a 
	minor item! You can also right click the guild master to train your skills. Many skills go up automatically, without 
	you ever putting a point into them. Scroll down the list to see all of the skills you have. Notice that at the 
	moment, you're not very skilled!&nbsp; In fact, you're downright awful!</p>
	<h3>Training</h3>
	<p>If you wish to train a skill, click the skill box and then click train. Each time you click train, you will spend 
	one training point. You start the game with 5 points and will earn an additional 5 each level. Don't spend all your 
	points just yet. Low-level characters get bonuses for skills to overcome the ineptitude of newbiedom. I recall 
	training piercing…but it isn't necessary. Your skill will improve even if you don't train it. Spell skills will 
	automatically increase as you cast them. More important skills you get later won't work that way. So I suggest 
	saving your training points. You can always come back and train later if you disagree with me. But once you spend 
	the points, they're gone.</p>
	<p>Important starting spell skills include:</p>
	<div align="center">
		<center>
		<table border="1" width="80%">
			<tr>
				<td>Abjuration&nbsp;</td>
				<td>Shielding spells</td>
			</tr>

				<td>Adeptness at casting spells of all types</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Important starting combat skills include:</p>
	<div align="center">
		<center>
		<table border="1" width="80%">
			<tr>
				<td>Piercing</td>
				<td>Your ability to use piercing weapons like a dagger</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1H Blunt</td>
				<td>Your ability to use a small blunt weapon like a short staff</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2H Blunt</td>
				<td>Your ability to use a larger blunt weapon like a long staff</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Throwing</td>
				<td>Your ability to throw small objects like daggers at opponents</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Bandaging</td>
				<td>Your ability to patch yourself and others up after a fight</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Other important starting skills include:</p>
	<div align="center">
		<center>
		<table border="1" width="80%">
			<tr>
				<td>Sense Heading&nbsp;</td>
				<td>Your sense of direction - a skill you will use throughout your career</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Swimming</td>
				<td>Your ability to swim - many zones have water - and, in some zones swimming skill is critical</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>All skills go up as you use them or train them. Of all skills, Sense Heading goes up the slowest. Spam &quot;Sense 
	Heading&quot; repeatedly even if you know exactly where you are. You want to be good at it before you get lost. A neat 
	trick is to add a line to a social to sense heading. For example, when you set up your pet commands at level 4, add 
	a line to each social that senses heading. You'll practice the skill every time you issue a pet command!</p>
	<h3>Spells</h3>
	<p>In EQ, you will need to buy, find, make or quest for your spells.&nbsp; You've already got all the spells you're 
	going to get for free.</p>
	<p>While you're in the magician guild check the various vendors to find which ones sell your spells. Note that you 
	can't afford any spells yet, but hey…there are two of your first spell series in your inventory already! Life is 
	good. To put the spells into your spell book, click on the book icon or type /book. Place a spell onto the cursor by 
	clicking. Drop a spell onto an empty square in the spell book to begin scribing it. This is a good time to get some 
	housework done. Scribing takes a while!</p>
	<p>Once a spell is scribed, you will know it forever. The spell book cannot be dropped, traded, lost or stolen. It 
	will always be right there for you. You cannot erase a spell from the book, but you can move a spell to a new page 
	or square in the book. Just right click the spell you want to move and a new square to which you wish to move it. If 
	the destination square has a spell in it already, the spells will be swapped.</p>
	<p>Before you can cast the spell, you must memorize the spell. As a level 1 you can memorize up to 8 spells. (As a 
	level 60, I can memorize up to 8 spells…the limit remains the same). To memorize a spell, click the scribed spell 
	you wish to memorize and drop it onto one of the 8 empty spell gems. Memorizing takes time as well…but not as much 
	time as scribing. To forget a memorized spell, right click the spell gem. To see what each spell gem contains, hold 
	the ALT key. To cast a spell, click the gem or press ALT-# where the # is 1 - 8.</p>

	<h3>Burst of Flame</h3>
	<p>This spell is a direct damage (DD) spell.&nbsp; That means it will hit a targeted mob, NPC or player (if you're 
	in pvp) as long as you are within the limits of the spell's range.&nbsp; No other (non-targeted) beings will take 
	damage from the spell -- although they might take offense at seeing you cast it on their friend.&nbsp; Scribe and 
	then memorize this spell.&nbsp; You'll always want to have a DD spell or two memorized.</p>
	<h3>Minor Shielding</h3>
	<p>This spell is a self-only increase in your HP and AC.&nbsp; You should always have the effects from a spell from 
	this line on you.&nbsp; If it starts to flash (meaning the effects are about to wear off), recast it immediately.&nbsp; 
	As a caster, you need all the HP and AC you can get!&nbsp; You do not need to target this spell.&nbsp; Cast it and 
	it will affect you, regardless of your target.</p>
	<h3>The Red Book</h3>
	<p>Among your other inventory items, you'll also notice a red book. You can read the book (right click it), but in 
	general you should simply destroy it. Warning: Turning this book into the Priest of Discord will make your character 
	PVP (player vs. player). This has only negative implications on most servers (if you're on a PVP server, you're 
	already PVP). Since you have room, you may elect to keep the book for now. You can always throw it away later.</p>
	<h3>Quests</h3>
	<p>NPCs can give quests to players. In fact, chances are that your guild leader has one for you! To find out what an 
	NPC might have you do, say hello! Target the NPC by clicking on it and then press H. &quot;Hail, Nenelar!&quot; If there is a 
	quest that Nenelar has to give, he will offer a hint to that affect in his response. &quot;Hail, Soandso, have you come 
	to [assist] me?&quot; Note the word(s) in brackets. Repeating these words back to the NPC will continue the conversation. 
	Many times you can be blunt and just state the words or you can fancy it up a little, &quot;Yes, my good mage. My credit 
	card has been approved and now I am here to assist you!&quot; You completed a quest when you turned the note into the 
	guild leader. Additional quests will gain you fame, fortune and more experience.</p>
	<p>As you gain levels, NPCs will be more vague. It's up to you to figure out the proper trigger. For example an NPC 
	may tell you to go away because he or she is very distraught. It's up to you to figure out how to handle this 
	delicate situation. And be warned…some NPCs may not wish to be bothered by you or not like what you say.</p>
	<h3>Leveling the Bloody Way</h3>
	<p>No doubt you're anxious to get to the killing (and killing is far more rewarding than turning in notes to your 
	guild master). Until you get to level 4, you're on your own. You cannot summon a pet until then. Enjoy these first 3 
	levels. You'll never be this efficient with a weapon again!</p>
	<p>Make sure you have placed your dagger in your primary hand (there are no left handed characters in Norrath…but to 
	compensate, the box that corresponds to your right hand is on the left). Make sure you're wearing that nice robe you 
	got from your guild master as well. Once you're ready, take a deep breath and find your way out of the city.</p>
	<p>At the city gates, you'll find at least one guard. The guard is there to protect you at this stage in the game. 
	The guard is also there to punish you should you do something foolish like try to attack the city watch. If it looks 
	like you will lose a fight, try to run back to the guards and they will assist you. Monsters slain by guards do not 
	award you experience, nor will they leave a corpse to be checked for loot. So, use the guards only in an emergency. 
	You'll want to fight far enough from the guards that they don't run out to kill your enemy unless you want them to 
	help, but close enough to make it to them before you die.</p>
	<p>Survey the landscape. No doubt there are evil creatures lurking just outside your fair city. Target one of the 
	creatures you see and press C (you can also right click the creature). It is very important to understand the 
	following before you attack:</p>
	<p>The color of the &quot;con&quot; (consider) suggests the outcome of the fight:</p>
	<div align="center">
		<center>
		<table border="1" width="80%">
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#008000">Green</font></td>
				<td>You'll almost certainly win…but you will not get experience…this fight is too easy</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#00FFFF">Cyan</font></td>
				<td>You'll very likely win…but not get much experience…this fight is easy</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#0000FF">Blue</font>&nbsp;</td>
				<td>You'll likely win…and get good experience…this fight is average, you have a slight advantage</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>White</td>
				<td>An even match (the color will be black in window mode)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#FFFF00">Yellow</font></td>
				<td>You may win, but the creature has the advantage</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><font color="#FF0000">Red</font></td>
				<td>Did you make out a will? This fight is too tough for you.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The message also suggests what the creature thinks of you:</p>
	<div align="center">
		<center>
		<table border="1" width="80%">
			<tr>
				<td>Scowl&nbsp;</td>
				<td>This creature really hates you. It will attack you without a second thought.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Threaten</td>
				<td>This creature hates you too. It will attack you after giving it some thought.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Dubious</td>
				<td>This creature does not like you. It will not attack, but it will not be happy to talk to you.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Apprehensive</td>
				<td>This creature isn't sure what to make of you. It will not attack.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Indifferent&nbsp;</td>
				<td>This creature couldn't care less if you lived or died. It will not attack.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Kindly</td>
				<td>This creature is pleased to see you. It will not attack.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Warmly&nbsp;</td>
				<td>This creature is very happy to see you. It will not attack.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ally</td>
				<td>This creature couldn't be more pleased with you. When he gets off work, he'll buy you an ale.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Lustily</td>
				<td>This creature will try to talk you into going back to his place after sharing the ale.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;<br>
	Note: All creatures, regardless of con, will attack if provoked. And many creatures will help their friends.&nbsp; 
	Lustily cons are very rare.&nbsp; They're usually to be avoided.&nbsp; GMs do not con dubious.&nbsp; They just seem 
	that way sometimes.&nbsp; Probably because of something you did.</p>
	<p>At level 1, you will only find cons that are even and higher.&nbsp; You can likely kill a yellow con. You should 
	try an even con for your first fight, just to get the feel for it. You should be able to defeat an even con fairly 
	easily.&nbsp; As you gain levels you'll find that mobs are increasingly stronger for their con. This is to balance 
	the fact that players begin grouping to gang up on mobs. At level 60, you will have no chance at killing an even or 
	yellow con on your own. In fact, at 60 you'll find it rather difficult to kill anything above 50 on your own. 
	There's no magic level for this.&nbsp; Magicians can solo all the way to 60. It's just that by your late teens, 
	you'll likely only be soloing blues. Enjoy level 1!</p>
	<p>Enough talk. Your dagger is ready? Do you have Burst of Flame and Minor Shielding memorized? Great! Cast your 
	shield spell. If you fizzle, cast it again. Sit down until your blue mana bar returns to full. Let's go!</p>
	<p>You're a caster, so you want to get in some damage from a distance before you have to resort to your dagger. 
	Target a mob that's a ways away from you and con it. Even? Good! Cast your Burst of Flame spell. Boom! The mob takes 
	a tremendous amount of damage (probably 3 points or so!). While the mob is on its way to you, cast again. Boom! This 
	fight is looking good for you already.</p>
	<p>But now, the mob is on top of you, taking chunks out of your flesh. Return the favor. Start swinging that dagger 
	(the default for this is the A key). Since your dagger doesn't have much ranger, you'll need to stand close to the 
	mob to use it. You can cast spells while taking damage, but chances are the mob will interrupt your cast. If you 
	want to try, cast the spell immediately after taking a hit. With luck, your spell will go off before the mob swings 
	again.</p>
	<p>When the mob gets low on health, it may run. Chase it and use your dagger or cast a spell at it to finish it off. 
	It's your choice. But, if you chase it, know that you're headed further away from the guards into hostile territory. 
	The mob may well flee in a direction it has friends. Kill it quickly.</p>
	<p>Whew, you won your first fight! Right click the corpse and grab any loot you find. It's not worth a lot, but you 
	need to save up money for spells!</p>
	<h3>Ack, I Died!</h3>
	<p>It happens. Again and again, it happens. And if it hasn't yet -- it will.&nbsp; Over and over again.&nbsp; The 
	first time you die can be a bit confusing. When you die, you'll be transported back to a point near your city gate. 
	(You can change this point once you've gained some experience). You'll notice that your death had a negative effect 
	on your memory. All of your memorized spells have been forgotten.&nbsp; You'll need to memorize your spells again. 
	It also cleared any of the beneficial spells you had on you. Death at a low level has no real penalty. You will not 
	lose experience or your possessions until level 10. If you return to the spot on which you died, you'll see your own 
	corpse. Only you can loot your corpse, but you can let others move it by typing /consent &lt;name&gt;. Typing that again 
	will revoke that permission.</p>
	<h3>Getting to Level 4</h3>
	<p>Kill and die, kill and die (hopefully kill more than you die) your way to level 4! As you collect items from the 
	mobs you kill, you should sell them to merchants. Since you only have a small number of slots in which to store your 
	loot, one of the first investments you should make is a backpack. Save as much money as you can for spells. I would 
	suggest you not buy any more level 1 spells until later. You don't need them yet and you want to be sure you can 
	afford certain level 4 spells and malachite (more on that below). You do not need to buy food or water since all 
	characters start with a generous supply of each.</p>
	<h3>Optimism</h3>
	<p>As you get close to the next spell level, buy and carry your spells with you if you can afford it.&nbsp; That 
	way, if you're in a good group when you ding, you do not have to leave to go get your spells.&nbsp; If you're in a 
	bad group, you can always say you have to go get spells -- even if you're already carrying them!</div>
