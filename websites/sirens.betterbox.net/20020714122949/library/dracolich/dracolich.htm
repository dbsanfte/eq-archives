entered the dark cave.  Silver dagger held firmly in hand, he
walked calmly toward its dark recesses.  His features were calm and
serene as if he where sitting at his desk, petting one of his great
hounds.</P>

<P>He was dressed in long flowing blood red robes, which caressed the
calves of his knee high black boots.  The robes where split to mid-thigh, 
showing dark gray leggings as he walked.  A dark gray belt
synched his muscular waist, and matched exactly to the coloring of his
eyes.  His shoulder length blond hair was pulled back into a thick
ponytail at the base of his neck, showing off his alabaster skin.  In
his hand he carried a simple steel dagger.</P>

<P>In the depths of the cave it waited..... its sleek body in its vast
horde, its claws razor sharp, hot acid breath, it waited.......</P>

<P>Countless years it waited......</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And watched for Volo to come.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And Volo came.  His stride leisure, he stepped forth into the home of
the dragon.  His dark gray eyes slowly surveyed the dragon.</P>

<P>Its immense body filled the large cavern.  Huge claws, each larger then
a man's head, lay resting beneath a huge reptilian face.  The dragon's
eyes swirled like twin pools of bloody death.  Its scales of Onyx as
hard as stone.</P>

<P>Its voice rumbled across the cave, "Why do you disturb me little one?"</P>

<P>Volo smiled slightly, showing pointed white fangs.  "My god has called
for you."</P>

<P>The dragon snarled, curling back his lips to show rows of sharp white
teeth.  Its eyes narrowed into cold thin slits, its tail twitching in
agitation.  "You dare to challenge me?"  It roared making the cave
tremble with force.  "I defy you.  I defy your god... I AM A GOD!"</P>

<P>Volo bowed slightly to the dragon in mockery.  "Then it shall be a
pleasure to kill a god."</P>

<P>Volo raised his dagger in the air, drawing ancient symbols, almost a
dance of his left wrist.  Then sharply he brought it down, slashing
deeply into his open right palm.</P>

<P>The Dragon screamed in pain, an open gash drew blood in a jagged line
upon its right paw.  Its eyes turned to face the necromancer.  But the
necromancer was no longer there.</P>

<P>A deep echoing laugh rang through the cave.</P>

<P>The dragon's eyes searched wildly about, his forked tongue testing the
air for Volo's scent.  And then Volo appeared before him slashing the
dagger along his own arm, a deep gash ran from shoulder to wrist.</P>

<P>The dragon roared again.  Its left shoulder now gaped open showing dark
red meat, and glistening white bone.</P>

<P>Again Volo was gone.</P>

<P>The dragon's mind whirled in agony, its thoughts confused.</P>

<P>A third time Volo appeared,  This time his dagger cutting deeply into
his own chest, across  ribs and into his stomach.  Then he watched, his
eyes intent on the dragon, oblivious to his own wounds.</P>

<P>The dragon howled in pain its belly splashing hot blood onto its horde. 
Its eyes swirled in pain, its body twisting in its death throws.  Then
it was still, its eyes sightless.</P>

<P>Mockingly, Volo bowed to the dragon,  "And so ends the life of a god."</P>

<P>Quietly the necromancer sheathed his dagger, then as if in afterthought
he ran his fingers across his open wounds, sealing them.</P>

<P>Volo let out a small sigh, the only sign of emotion.  Then carefully he
began the ancient incantation.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Over and over Volo recited the spell, his voice growing stronger with
each repetition.</P>

<P>Slowly the dragon arose, its body moving in stilted jerking motions. 
Its once blood red eyes now two solid rubies, the size of a man's
clenched fist.  The eyes now centered on Volo.</P>

<P>Volo grew silent, his gray eyes met the dragon's.  He chuckled at his
victim, "You so boastful in life, are now living death.  Always you
serve me, and through me you serve MY god, Durak."</P>

<P>With that Volo casually strolled from the cave, the dragon's anguished
cries echoing in his ears.</P>
