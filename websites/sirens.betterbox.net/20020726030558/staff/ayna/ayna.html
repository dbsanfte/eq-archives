Ayna slowly looked out at the devastation around her.  The entire forest was in ruins.  Everything was dead.</P>
<P>Pulling a lock of dark red hair away from her cheek, she let out a long sigh.  "What the gods had created," she whispered "all but destroyed in a matter of moments."<P>
<P>A slight smile lit The Siren's mouth, as her gaze fell to a small flower, its leaves curled in death. Kneeling down Ayna ran her fingers slowly over its tender young leaves.  From her eyes fell gentle tears as she whispered a simple incantation and watched as the flower bloomed.
