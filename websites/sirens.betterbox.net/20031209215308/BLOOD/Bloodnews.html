fun time frolicing with Blatha An Oir. We spent our nights listening to the drummers drum, and to
watch the lovely belly dancers.  We were also there to watch the highlight of the Bane Camp "The 
Kissing Auction".  No lovely ladys or handsome gentlemen were bidded upon.  (we were a broke camp
this event.)</font></TD>

our camp in our festivities.  Many thanks to Rebecca and Brenne our camp companions.   We had fine 
chats, and found these ladys to have a wonderful sense of humor, and ready wit.  </font></TD>
