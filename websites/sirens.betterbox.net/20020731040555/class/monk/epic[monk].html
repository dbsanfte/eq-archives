There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.  Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second huge rock has another tunnel, (at loc -11354, -1365) which is at the opposite side to where you entered.

You cannot trade with the presence (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) while it is in the windmill. It is best to give the scale to a presence, causing Gwan to spawn, then pull Gwan into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. WALKING backwards with him. Running off nearly always causes him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill.</font></TD>

Heading to a slope at loc 1810, 668 is the closest to the Projection. He does not need to be fought, is approx 52nd level, but if fought hits for 175 damage, and says nothing on death.

So it is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without despawning him. How this affects the next person, I am unsure, so it may be wise to say the text, meaning the next person has a 'fresh' projection to turn the head into.</font></TD>

<TD align="center"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="BLACK">What to do</TD>
<TD align="left" width="80%"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="OLIVE">When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns immediatly, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS, and will both attack you.  Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated me? Now, witness the true power of Rallos Zek!  Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies.  Once Xenevorash is killed he will drop Demon Fangs.</font></TD>

<TD align="left" width="80%"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="OLIVE">He is identical in appearance to the other Projection. He is KOS to all, but does not attack and will accept the eye.  Again, due to the fact that there where some problems with this part of the quest, one way to minimize the chances of Vorash and Deep not spawning together is to have your groups on the edges of the platform, and hand the 'eye' in at the maximum distance allowed for trading, or obviously fight on the beach. You can never be too careful.</font></TD>

<TD align="left" width="80%"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="OLIVE">Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and hits for 250 ish.  Tactics: The final battle was originally done with 4 groups, which where all 52 to 58th level, one group was on Deep, all with high CR, and 3 groups where all on Vorash, with high MR. Due to the large amount of people involved,
the fight had no casualties.  The fight is normally done by pulling Deep and Vorash to the 'beach', or the fight can be done on the platform. However, fighting on the beach does allow a brief time to rebuff for the Xenevorash fight.  Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform, he will run into the water, which is another reason to fight on the beach.  The Astral Projection respawns 3 hours after Xenevorash has been killed.</font></TD>

Once the Book of Celestial Fists has been returned to you, it is now ready to be handed to either Kaiaren along with the Demon Fangs.  Handing either form of Kaiaren (Mad or True) the Book of the Celestial Fists and the Demon Fangs, results in the Monk Epic, the Gloves called the Celestial Fists being handed over</font></TD>

<TD align="left" width="80%"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="OLIVE">If you have followed the quest in order, you will end up with the Book of Celestial Fists and the Demon fangs, and may find that the 'True' Kairen is no longer about. If you have done it the 'proper' way, you can hand the 'Book of the Celestial Fists' and the 'Demon fangs' to the 'mad' version and still get the Fists.  Most people however, now that the quest has been completed, will fight the four fists to get the fang, THEN hand over the Robe to Lheao. This way, the first time you see the True Kaiaren, you can hand in the 'Celestial Fists' book, then when it is returned (and changed), hand him the 'Book of Celestial Fists'</B> to him along with the 'Demon fangs' to obtain the Fists.</font></TD>
