<ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="O"><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Mortana's pale blue eyes ran across the adventurer's board, skimming over the various posts.  Nothing, she thought glumly as she plucked a white strand of hair away from her face.  Nothing that would even make a dent into the amount of money she owed.  Slowly she rotated her shoulders, hoping to release the tension from her hardened muscles.  With a sigh, she turned her attention from the board, and watched as a young Shiva Guard hurried into the room.</p>

<P>He walked quickly and with purpose toward a well-armored man who sat behind a large Oak Desk.  The man was Oktal, captain of the guards.  He was a man of undetermined years.  His hair, a coal black, was peppered with gray.  His strong elven features showed a pale white skin, and almond gray eyes.  He carried an air of knowledge, to go with the several battle scares that decorated his face and hands.</p>

<P>Slowly Oktal stood up to face the young elven guard, his gray eyes showing nothing of his emotions.  The young guard spoke quickly and in hushed tones, so that Mortana had to strain to make out what was being said.  Snatches of "Dragon...... Princess Eayase..... Prince....killed... save.. reward." were all she could hear, but it was enough.</p>

<P>With a lazy ease Mortana sauntered up to Oktal's desk, her eyes watching as Oktal began to write the information for the adventurer's quest board.  Her blue eyes glazed slightly as she saw the words 50,000 gillion written at the bottom.</p>

<P>Standing at the corner of Oktal's desk, she reached forward and plucked
the still drying paper from the paper holder.  Smiling slightly she
looked steady into Oktal's questioning eyes.  "If I do not return in
three weeks", her smile widened in self-confidence, "then you may write
up a new one."</P>

week later found Mortana in the court of Verdin Castle.  She stood
now before King Leayor.  "I have come to save your princess," she
boasted confidently. "I believe your daughter's life is worth 50,000
gillion?"</P>

<P>King Leayor slowly looked over the elven warrior, taking in the dragon
armor, as well as the Ragnarok she carried at her side.  "Yes," he said,
his voice dripping with aristocratic disdain.  "That is the price, IF
she survives."</P>

<P>Mortana gazed steadily into the King's eyes.  "I see, 50,000 is a small
sum for a dragon's death, and the life of your daughter.  But...." She
paused and looked down at her Ragnarok, her fingers unconsciously
caressing its hilt.  "I have always had a soft spot in my heart for
family."  Her eyes again traveled up to meet the king's gaze.  "I would
consider doing your quest for.... oh..... shall we say 100,000 gillion."</P>

<P>An audible gasp could be heard throughout the court.  King Leayors eyes
glittered dangerously at the warrior.  "I will pay your sum.  IF...." He
paused for a  moment, eyes narrowing, "If you survive, and IF you bring
me the claws of the dragon.  I want him dead.  Dead for what he has done
to me.  Dead for killing Prince Vortu.  Death for daring to take my
beloved Eayase."</P>

days later Mortana slowly crept into the cave, her Ragnarok clutched
firmly in both hands.  A trickle of sweat ran from her bassinet, down
her cheek.  Despite the icy cold fog of the cave, her body felt hot, as
if trapped in an oven.  Her mind raced with the thoughts of the battle
to come.  "Kill dragon..... grab princess.... get claws.... find prince
Vortu's body..."</P>

<P>Carefully she picked her way past the dead bodies of the dragon's
previous victims.  Several brave and valiant warriors lay dead on the
cave floor.  Each one's face gripped in silent agony.  A few of them
where even frozen and stuck to the icy floor.  Among the bodies, she saw
a young man dressed in platinum armor, his head crushed on one side. 
The blue seal of Prince Vortu hung from his broken neck.  Mortana
reached down and plucked the seal from the dead prince.</P>

<P>"Durak be with you in death," she prayed, "as Nuada was with you in
life."  Carefully she placed the seal in a side pocket of her girdle,
and then slowly closed the prince's still unseeing eyes.</P>

<P>Gasping back a harsh breath, she clutched her Ragnarok tighter and
boldly went to face the Ice Dragon.  The cold mist swirled in the air,
thickening with each step, until the warrior could hardly see, but still
she walked on.  Her ears turned to pick up noise, any noise, and her
eyes strained to see in the thick icy fog.</P>

<P>Suddenly she heard it, a low woofing sound, like the grunt of a wild
bear.  She crept forward, gaining sight of a large and bulky form. 
Running forward, she cried "Belgar, I summon you. Heed my cry for
battle."  Mortana lunged forward to face the gigantic beast.  What
ensued was a battle to be told in legend.  In the end the warrior was
victorious.</P>

<P>Wiping the blood from her face, the warrior leaned forward and severed
three of the claws from the dragon's left front paw.  Wrapping them in a
twine of rope, she attached them to her girdle.  Her eyes glazed in
pain, as her body now told tale of her wounds.</P>

<P>A long jagged claw-mark ran blood from her temple to the bottom of her
right jaw.  Deep gashes slashed open the metal of her leggings and
pierced muscled flesh.  Her right wrist lay broken and clutched
protectively to her chest.  Her breathing was shallow from broken ribs
and bruised insides.</P>

<P>Using her inner will, Mortana gathered her strength and began to explore
the cave.  In the far corner the Princess Eayase lie in pale beauty upon
a bed of gillion.  Her eyes closed, her breath weak.</P>

<P>Wearily Mortana made her way to the entrance of the cave, where a medium
sized war horse stood.  Gently she laid her cheek on the horse's neck. 
There she lay in rest for several minutes, praying to the gods for
strength.</P>

days later Mortana collapsed onto the castle's stone courtyard. 
Three days later she awoke from her exhausted slumber.  She lay still
for several minutes surveying her surroundings.</P>

<P>A maid rushed to her, her eyes alight with worry.  "Miss... Miss... You
are all right?"  She said in a rushed voice.  "We were all so worried." 
Checking her cheek for signs of fever, the nurse then hurriedly left the
room.  Moments later Eayase entered..</P>

<P>The princess slowly walked into the room, her eyes haggard and tired
looking.  "So you're awake," she said, her voice quiet.  "Are you well?"</P>

<P>She looked slowly at the warrior woman."</P>

<P>Mortana let her gaze slip over the princess' features trying to read her
emotions, but finding none.  "I am ok, I believe."  She slowly ran her
left hand over her body, noticing bandages on most of it.</P>

<P>"Good," Eayase said.  Then reaching up, she slapped Mortana hard with an
open palm.  "You killed my love."</P>

<P>Mortana stared at the Princess in open amazement.  "Your love, but the
Prince had already died, the foul dragon killed him."</P>

<P>The Princess laughed almost hysterically, then choked it off.  "The
Prince, THE PRINCE..... You think I am talking about petty vile Prince
Vortu.  That man?  I would rather die then marry the Prince."  Her eyes
flashed in pain and anger. "I am glad the Prince is dead.  No I speak of
my love, Toran.  The one you call the foul dragon."</P>

<P>She stopped her voice going almost quiet.  "He was my love, so tender
and loving, and you have killed him."  She stopped and looked unseeingly
at Mortana.  "I should...I should have you killed....I should...but what
is it worth....nay, it will not bring Toran back...."</P>

<P>Large tears started to fall down Eayase's face.  "So go, and relish your
money, and know... know you sentenced me to a fait worse then death." 
With that Eayase hurried from the room.</P>

Zartan's Inn.  Around her neck she carried the Vortu's seal, in her
right hand she held the ice dragon's claws.</P>
