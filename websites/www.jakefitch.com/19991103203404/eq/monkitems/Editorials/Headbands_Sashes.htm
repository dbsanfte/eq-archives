    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#4E5D6A" colspan="4" valign="top"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman">Many monks in
      the game believe that the current Headbands and Sashes that are available
      from our guildmasters are not worth the amount of effort that is required
      to get them.&nbsp; That is not even mentioning the fact that we can only
      currently get half of them through the quests, the only way to get the
      other ones is to kill a fellow monk, or for the best ones the guildmaster
      himself.&nbsp; So I would like to propose a change to the current
      headbands, that would make them a valuable resource to a monk for his/her
      entire life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p>First, lets look at some of the background to the monk class in
      EverQuest and the headbands and sashes themselves.&nbsp; When one creates
      a monk they are told that the key statistics for them are strength,
      stamina, agility, and dexterity.&nbsp; Of these, monks have pretty much
      always agreed that stamina is the least important statistic to them.&nbsp;
      With strength, agility and dexterity being heatedly debated as to which
      one is the most important.</p>
      <p>That being said lets look at the headbands and sashes as they are
      currently in the game:<br>
      White headband/sash: +1 STA, +1 CHA<br>
      Yellow headband/sash: +1 STA, +1 CHA, +1 AGI, +1 HP<br>
      Orange headband/sash: +2 STA, +1 CHA, +1 AGI, +2 HP<br>
      Red headband/sash: +1 DEX, +2 STA, +2 CHA, +2 AGI, +2 HP<br>
      Purple headband/sash: 1 AC, +1 DEX, +2 STA, +2 CHA, +2 AGI, +3 HP<br>
      Blue headband/sash: 1 AC, +1 STR, +2 DEX, +3 STA, +3 CHA, +2 AGI, +3 HP<br>
      Black headband/sash: 2AC, +2 STR, +3 DEX, +4 STA, +4 CHA, +1 INT, +3 AGI,
      +4 HP</p>
      <p>Now as you can see the headbands and sashes as they are currently
      implemented don't really help us that much in our most important
      statistics.&nbsp; As a monk-only items I feel that they should improve
      those statistics that Verant has stated are the important ones for monks.</p>
      <p>I would also like to point out that currently the highest headband that
      you can receive via the guild quests is the Purple headband, and the best
      sash is the Red Sash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As for those quests lets look at one of them, and the rewards that we receive
      from it.&nbsp; To go from the Red to the Purple Headband you have to give
      one of the monks at the guildhouse: the dagger of Marnek, the skull of
      Jhen'Tra, and Zaharn's Coronet.&nbsp; Just yesterday I saw Zaharn's
      Coronet being auctioned at the bazaar on the Rathe server for over 250
      plat.&nbsp; Now for turning in these items we receive an additional 1 AC
      and 1 HP.</p>
      <p>Yes, most of the other quests are easier to complete, but many of them
      require a monk to camp in one area for more than 12 hours to receive the
      items that they must turn in.&nbsp; However, it is not the quests that I
      am complaining about, it is the rewards for those quests.&nbsp; What I
      would like to see happen is that Verant would change the headbands and
      sashes into an item that any monk would be proud to wear into battle, not
      just because of the work involved in receiving them, but also because they
      would actually help us in those fights.&nbsp; Or as many higher levels
      monks do, not wear them at all because there are so many other items that
      are better that a high level monk can get that will help them much more in
      battle.</p>
      <p>So here are the changes that I would like to see happen.&nbsp; First I
      believe that the sashes and headbands should be made No Drop.&nbsp; The
      monk already is the most un-twinkable class, or at least melee class in
      EQ.&nbsp; I do not want to see these changes affect that at all.&nbsp;
      Also, I would like there to be a minimum level that a monk could receive a
      headband/sash.&nbsp; These levels would be below the level that a monk can
      currently get the headband or sash IF he/she were to collect the items necessary
      to complete the quest themselves.&nbsp; As a bonus it would be nice if the
      items that a monk most collect for the quest were light enough for them to
      carry themselves, but this really is not necessary.&nbsp; And finally I
      would like to see the headbands and sashes to give abilities that a monk
      would find useful and to affect statistics that Verant has stated, and all
      monks agree, are important for monks.&nbsp; Here are some ideas for the
      headbands and sashes that I had, where level is the level required to
      finish the quest (turn the items in).<!--mstheme--></font></td>
