I know it's been a while since I've done an update, but that's because I'm a slacker at heart... and, we've been taking it pretty easy lately.  Sometimes even the best need a little siesta.  =)<br><br>Tonight, however, a call was made and we rallied our troops.  Vision teamed up with our good friends over at <a href="http://xa.webhop.info">Exiled Alliance</a> and we headed to ToV to smite some dragons. WHEEEEEEEE!<br><br>Telkorenar was the first to feel the might of our swords.  He departed Norrath quickly, and left us with a few goodies.<br><br>Grats to Lyeth on her new <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5974">Necklace of Nightstalking!</a>  Grats to XA on the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4951">Black Rock Maul of Crushing</a> and the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5897">Pauldrons of Blight!</a><br><br>While we were looting Telk's smoking corpse, we could hear Gozzrem taunting us with threats of retaliation and saying mean things about our mothers.  I think it was the mother thing that sent us over the edge.  Gozzrem had to die.  <br><br><a href="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/gozzrem.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/gozzrem.jpg" border="0" width="236" height="175"></a><br><br>And die he did!  He was also kind enough to donate a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6283">Cloak of Silver Eyes</a> for Dammur and a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6397">Rekeklo's War Sword</a> for XA.  Grats!<br><br>While basking in the glow of our victory, someone suggested we try Sontalak.  What a great idea!  He's there... and he's one hell of a fugly dragon.  Time to die, Sontalak!  <br><br>We never had any luck defeating the new Sontalak in the past.  The first attempt tonight was met with a small train that included a couple of cragwyrms and Ionat.  Needless to say, we didn't quite win the first shot.  Our second attempt was much better.  It was train-free, but we had some agro control issues.  Needless to say, we didn't win the second shot.  The third attempt went a <b>lot</b> better, agro was controlled, no trains... just us and Sont.  Needless to say, we kicked his ass.<br><br><a href="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/sont_corpse1.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/sont_corpse1.jpg" border="0" width="256" height="192"></a><br><br>Grats to XA on the Sleeper's key and grats to Vision on a bunch of spells and dragonhide armor for the bank.  But more importantly, grats to both XA and Vision on guild firsts... Sont died like the putz he is and it's a victory we can all be proud of!<br><br>After Sont was relieved of his loot, some of us decided to hit Kael for some faction work.  And to nobody's surprise, our good buddy Vindi was up.  We hooked up with a group of Vallis Scortor folks, and 40 or so Vision/XA went to the arena to lay waste to the angry Derakor.<br><br>Vindi was easy, of course.<br><br><a href="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/vindi_corpse2.jpg" target="_new"><img src="http://www.guildvision.org/images/kaelynai/0714/vindi_corpse2.jpg" border="0" width="256" height="192"></a><br><br>Grats to Vallis Scortor on the Boots of the Vindicator and Iilluas got the head.<br><br>A great night it was indeed.  Vision is definitely looking forward to spreading more love and destruction with our friends in XA and VS.</font></td></tr></table><p>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">We're looking for a few good toons...</font></b><br> Posted Sunday, July 14, 2002 by <a href="mailto:kaelynai@guildvision.org">Kaelynai</a><p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><font size="1" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="999999">Vision is currently accepting applications for membership.  Here's a little something from our guildleader, Palimax.  If you read this and think you'd be a good fit for Vision, we'd love to hear from you!  You can find our message boards <a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/bsolusekseye">here</a>.<br><br><br>This is, without a doubt, one of the biggest lulls Everquest has ever seen. Server-wide retirement is at an all-time high. To counter this, like several other guilds, Vision is openly recruiting again.<br><br><b>Here's some things we're looking for:</b><br><br>(1) Able to raid most days of the week from 6pm PST to midnight PST.<br>(2) A fun and adventure before treasure attitude that still doesn't mind getting treasure.<br>(3) Of "adult" age, or certainly of adult mind.<br>(4) Raid experience at the Velious/Luclin level.<br>(5) Epic completed to at least the end of the solo or small-group steps.<br>(6) Comforable with the role of your class on a raid.<br><br>Your attitude and personality will certainly factor greater into the formula for getting a try-out over any of the criteria listed above. Vision has a class leader for each class. Simply contact a Vision member and ask to speak to the class leader for YOUR class to see if we're recruiting; and PLEASE don't be upset if we either fill these spots before you ask or if we pick someone else.<br><br><b>Here's some stuff you probably want to know:</b><br><br>Vision, as a guild, killed a lot of giants. Although not exclusively, the vast majority of our members are <b>allied to Claws of Veeshan.</b> While not being allied to Claws of Veeshan won't instantly exclude you from consideration as a member, it is a serious hurdle to overcome, as you won't be able to participate in a number of events that happen in Velious.<br><br><b>Vision is not an uberguild.</b> We don't logon at server-up on patch day and kill every boss in Luclin and then go makes snacks of whatever is left in Velious. We aren't farming Sleeper's Tomb for Primals. We certainly kill our share of large targets, but if you want to kill the Arch Lich so-and-so every time he spawns, I suggest you apply to Eternal Wrath. They are an honorable guild and a raiding juggernaut. <br><br>Although we have members worldwide, <b>Vision mostly raids during PST hours.</b> If you want to join Vision to go on raids, you need to bring both the desire and motivation to form raids during non-PST hours, or be prepared to raid during PST hours.<br><br>Vision supports members primarily in the "near 60" range. <b>The raw average level of a member of Vision is over 58.</b> If you see a level 51 Vision member, it's because he's an alt, a friend, or someone who's been with the guild since we were all level 20.<br><br>Vision is mean to its recruits. <b>We don't let you loot anything but scraps while you're in your trial period.</b> Your trial period as a Vision recruit lasts three weeks, in which time we encourage you to show us what sort of player and what sort of person you are. At the end of those three weeks, the entire guild gets to vote on you, and you maintain a nice ratio, we keep you.<br><br>Not scared yet? Drop us a line. <br><br>-Palimax Sceleris, Guildleader of Vision<br></font></td></tr></table><p>
