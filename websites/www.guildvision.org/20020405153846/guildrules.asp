<ol><FONT face=Verdana size=1>
<li> Planning and organizing raids for specific class items.<br><br>This includes regular items and quest mobs; and may, at the Class Leader's discretion, be mandatory for a particular class.  Class raids that benefit the guild as a whole may also be made mandatory with Council approval.<p></p></li>
<li> The fair distribution of class loot.<br><br>Members of each class will work together with their class leader to determin loot arrangements.  Class leaders may implement any fair or mutually agreeable system that they feel works best for their class.  Officer Council members will assist in a situation where a class is unable to reach a decision.<p></p></li>

<li> Adhering to the code of conduct for Vision Members.<p></p></li>
<li> Participation in at least one guild event per week (when scheduled) when you are the appropriate level for the event.<br><br>Real life concerns outweigh in-game concerns.  It is acceptable to miss a guild raid because of any signficant real-world event.  It is unacceptable to skip a guild raid because you don't feel as though your class benefits from the raid or because you felt the risk-reward ratio wasn't favorable (e.g. Plane of Sky).<p></p></li>
<li> Vision members are expected to own and keep keys necessary for events.<br><br>These include the keys necessary to meet membership status (Sebilis by level 52, Howling Stones by 55) as well as other locations (Velious) as the need arises.  Vision leadership will provide events to gather keys when it is more advisable to do so as a group.<p></p></li>
<li> Vision Members are expected to own and keep items necessary for events.<br><br> These include (but aren't limited to) resist gear and other encounter-specific items.  Vision leadership will provide events to gather these items when it is more advisable to do so as a group.<p></p></li>
