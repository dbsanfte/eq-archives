			There's nothing more entertaining than seeing the text message come up saying &quot;Your magical skin absorbs the
			blow&quot; *g*. In fact in most groups I play with regularely I end up tanking more than the tank and I kick butt
			*bg*. I guess you could say I'm a combat enchantress, but I wasn't before I got Rune I. I spent my time cowaring
			in the back of the group debuffing MOBs and color fluxing. I still do that but now I'm up front kicking butt and
			casting spells and I even solo better. I also found it's a good way to keep players in your group alive that are
			about to die, just cast it on them and watch them for signs that it has worn off so you can recast as needed. I
			wa!<BR>
			s told once by a group member &quot;Who needs a Cleric if no one gets hurt *lol*?&quot;. I could sing the praises
			of rune I all day but I don't want to bore you. I would like to point out I make alot of money jewlery making and

			our DoTs and our buff/debuffs. You will find in later levels that an enchanters role is to buff with speed the
			tanks, clarity to casters and then debuff the MoB, then when things go bad if you are up to snuff as an enchanter
			you can either turn things back around with crowd control spells or give the druid/wiz time to evac the group to
			safety. I have been hailed a hero a few times for just this but in truth it is the enchanters lot in life.</FONT></P>

			HREF="#Table"><FONT SIZE="4"><BR>
			</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4">Found this article on another site and thought it was so important that it had to be
			placed in an issue or three.</FONT></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="6">How to Group with an Enchanter</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="4">I have not been able to find anything out there that is a good guide for people to follow when
			grouped with an Enchanter. So I have decided to write one up myself in hopes to enlighten people as to what an
			enchanter really is. This pertains to mainly grouping in dungeons. <BR>
			<BR>
			Many of the people who spend the majority of their time in dungeons know most of this stuff and take it for granted.
			But there are many people that never set foot into a dungeon until they are level 30 or later and have no clue
			about dungeon group tactics. Let alone dungeon group tactics with an Enchanter. This is for them so they can know
			what to expect and how to act when grouping in a dungeon. <BR>
			<BR>
			Contrary to the belief that way too many people have, an Enchanter's main role in a group is not to keep the group
			with Clarity and speed buffs and blast like a wizard. The main role of the Enchanter in a group is crowd control.
			The buffs are just a nice benefit. A well disciplined group with a good Enchanter can handle many more MOB's than
			normally possible. If the group is poorly disciplined, an Enchanter, no matter how good he is will be near worthless
			to the group. <BR>
			<BR>
			When grouping with an Enchanter, fighting tactics for the entire party totally change as opposed to fighting without
			one. Normally the tanks job is to try to taunt all of the MOB's onto him/herself. With an Enchanter in the group
			it is the Enchanters job to keep everything mesmerized while the group concentrates on a single MOB. The Enchanter
			Mesmerize line of spells will hold a MOB in place for the duration of the spell and it will not attack as long
			as no one else attacks it. The mesmerize spells will not work if a DOT is cast on them. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- First off everyone must agree who the main puller/tank will be and make sure everyone will be assisting that
			single person. To do this make up a hot key that says /assist puller' s name. You can lose precious time by trying
			to target the puller and typing /assist every time you want to assist someone. When assisting it is important to
			wait till the puller/tank is actually engaged with the MOB before assisting or you may get the wrong MOB targeted.
			It is also very important for the puller/tank to instantly engage the MOB they wish to attack and when it dies
			to instantly switch to a new one so people can target right away. Don't stand there looking at everything trying
			to decide which one to attack. When in a tense situation time is of the essence. Also if you're not engaging something
			when someone tries to assist you they may target something half way across the zone. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- For people trying to assist.... if assist does not work when you try it, i.e. nothing targets, move and try
			again. For some reason Assist is picky and if you do not have a clear line of sight to your target it may not allow
			you to target it. And at other times it will target something across the zone if the person you are assisting is
			not currently engaged with a MOB. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Very important... do NOT switch MOBS. Do not switch to pull something off of one of your casters. Trust the
			Enchanter to get it mesmerized. A good Enchanter will be standing back watching the entire battle to see what needs
			to be done where. Do not switch if a caster joins in. Trust the Enchanter to mesmerize it and then it should be
			high on the puller/tanks list of mobs to attack after finishing the one that he is currently on. Now of course
			there are always exceptions to this. If there is something on a caster and the Enchanter is having a tough time
			with resists, only the MAIN tank should switch to taunt the MOB off of the caster and then as soon as it is taunted
			off switch right back to the MOB he was previously attacking. That should give the enchanter plenty of time to
			get it Mez'd and back out of the action. If you keep on attacking the MOB you pulled off the caster and not let
			the Enchanter mez it you have cut your groups effectiveness in half. If there is a MOB or 2 on an Enchanter they
			should have no problem getting it off themselves if they use Color Shift/Color Flux (which is an AE stun spell
			affecting everything within a couple steps around the Enchanter) and then casting a Mez spell. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- When pulling in small, cramped rooms try to pull the mobs to one corner of the room so the Enchanter can stand
			as far away as possible to cast his AE mez spell. It's very frustrating when you realize you were too close and
			catch yourself in your own mez spell. The AE mez spell is a very nice spell though because unlike all the other
			Enchanters mez spells it can be cast over top of itself and refreshed. That means if the Enchanter casts the AE
			mez again after about 10 seconds or so of casting the first one he can effectively keep everything standing still
			for quite a long time. It is much more effective than picking each MOB out singly and trying to mez it. If you
			do that you have to wait until the mez effect drops before you can mez it again. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Casters and Clerics... if you have a MOB that you pulled onto yourself that is not the one that the others are
			attacking DO NOT run around with it. It is much safer to stay where you are and let the AE mez spell catch it.
			The Enchanter should be back observing the battle and if he is not in the process of casting his AE mez he should
			Enthrall it if possible. If you go running around you leave the range of the AE mez effect and you have to make
			the Enchanter chase after you trying to target the thing that is on you. Single targeting like that will make the
			MOB aggro on the Enchanter when the mez drops. With the AE mez as long as the Enchanter is assisting the puller
			he will be casting his AE mez onto the MOB the puller/tank is attacking and will not aggro anything else onto himself.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The single most important thing is for everyone to stay focused on one MOB at a time. If you can do that and avoid
			that compulsion to switch to something else you can overcome unbelievable odds. If you give in to that compulsion
			you can spell disaster for your entire group. It is a good habit to use these tactics when only fighting 2 or 3
			mobs as well so that you get it ingrained into you and don't stumble later. I hear so many people say &quot;But
			it went ok so it don't matter&quot; after just haphazardly attacking the 2 or 3 that are there. Get into good habits
			now and they can save you in the future. <BR>

			(Fennin Ro. 60th Phantasmist)<BR>
			Tactics !<BR>
			<BR>
			This player instead of taking the average enchanter route took Conjuration as his specialization. He stated that
			when mezzing, he would prefer to have less cast time and mana cost than hits dots and buffs, which can always be
			brought up. &quot; In a desperate situatation your not going to want to cast clarity2, you will want to cast Dazzle
			faster..&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			His spell lineup during an average exping group was:<BR>
			Tash / Dispell / buff<BR>
			Bedlam (cheaper version of rune, regentless, increases stats semi)<BR>
			Dazzle<BR>
			Rapture<BR>
			level 4 Color Flux<BR>
			Theft of Thought<BR>
			Dictate (unresistable charm)<BR>
			Largarn's Lamentation<BR>
			<BR>
			His average tactic (he likes to pull) was to pull with Dispell on most mobs, its a low taunt spell and removes
			a few good buffs on casters. Tactics usually would be to mez (duh) the mob and if you got more than 3 mezzed, while
			still in a good fight, wait for a break and charm one to help out.<BR>
			<BR>
			Of course there are tactics for raids. Buff wise, he likes to keep the following, this is only self buffs, keeping
			mana and amount of buffs to minimum:<BR>
			Speed of Shissar<BR>
			Enlightment<BR>
			Clarity2<BR>
			Shield of Magi<BR>
			Group Magic Resist<BR>
			<BR>
			These 5 are his lineup and does not buff others unless necessary. Also only takes Symbol and Heroism OR Aegolism
			from clerics. (Donal's Gauntlets also for AC if needed, only if gaunts though).<BR>
			<BR>
			When soloing, which he has done in Sebilis. He will load Rune5, have alot of regents and charm a front mob. Using
			Boltran's Agacerie, this lets him have a good effect longer than 48seconds and also keep recasting. During fight
			he will do NOTHING except root the opponent and hope charm does not break. He will always try and charm the strong
			of the two (the weakest sebilis are Jins). This will leave him with a mob that is low hit points when the opponent
			is killed, and he can break charm.<BR>
			<BR>
			Stun then, and mez, Tash it, hit with Dementia. Stun, Dementia, continue till its dead. Remember to keep a good
			nuke or something handy. Some DO run! And worst part is having your day ruined by a running mob back with two friends.<BR>
			<BR>
			Also, feel free to ask for buffs or heals from nearby players, never hurts!</FONT></P>
