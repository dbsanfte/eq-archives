			<P><BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">Role of an Enchanter:</FONT><BR>
			Enchanters are very a flexible class with their own niche in the life of Norrath, First and foremost we are crowd
			control personal this means we get spells as time goes on that allow us to Charm creatures, stop them dead in their
			tracks for a few moments or even make them forget who they are attacking. As well we have the ability to cast Illusions
			changing our race and cast spells upon our enemies so that we may walk safe in their cities and even do quests
			normally beyond our races reach. Finally we are the enchanters of metal allowing us to create magic jewelry and
			even magic armor and weapons(armor and weapon enchantment is currently removed but is promised eventually). <BR>
			<BR>
			In this guide I will attempt to deal with each step in the character creation process for an Enchanter and try
			to encompass all of the different styles of play that the flexible Enchanter class can give sway to.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">First lets look at stats:</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Strength</FONT>:<BR>
			This stat has little to do with the Enchanter class other than the amount of items you can carry. In most all cases
			this stat is left at the beginning racial amount.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Stamina</FONT>:<BR>
			This stat is a hard one to tell what it directly affects other than starting hit points but in all cases I know
			of it is left at the racial base amount.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Agility</FONT>:<BR>
			This stat appears to be your ability to aviod damage so if you are planning on being a combat Enchanter this stat
			could use boosting a bit but its not greatly important to our class.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Dexterity</FONT>:<BR>
			This stat is directly related to the percentage of times a weapons special effect will go off. In most cases this
			is also left at racial base.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Intelligence</FONT>:<BR>
			This is one of the primary stats for true casters, this stat is directly related to the amount of mana you have
			the higher this stat the more mana you will have. One thing to note is that after this stat reaches 201 the amount
			of mana you gain per point on Int is lowered.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Wisdom</FONT>:<BR>
			This is a PRIMARY stat if you are going to be interested in working on any of the tradeskills(Jewelry, Blacksmithing,
			and others) it reduces the amount of fails on items.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Charisma</FONT>:<BR>
			This stat is the secondary for the Enchanter class this spell affects the resistance of creatures when dealing
			with our Charm, Mez, and some of the Debuff lines of spells.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">Now lets look at Races Pros and Cons:</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">High Elf Enchanter<BR>
			</FONT>Starting city: Felwithe<BR>
			Strength: 55<BR>
			Stamina: 65<BR>
			Agility: 85<BR>
			Dexterity: 70<BR>
			Wisdom: 95<BR>
			Intelligence: 102<BR>
			Charisma: 90<BR>
			Bonus points: +30<BR>
			Starting abilities: Infravision(night vision)<BR>
			<BR>
			The high elf is one of the favorites of many players having a high starting Int and Charisma as well as a high
			wisdom allows them to cover the needed basics of an Enchanters life. However sharing a newbie section with the
			wood elves does cause alot of tension in a new players life as ell as lag at prime playing times.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Dark Elf Enchanter <BR>
			</FONT>Starting city: Neriak<BR>
			Strength: 60<BR>
			Stamina: 65<BR>
			Agility: 90<BR>
			Dexterity: 75<BR>
			Wisdom: 83<BR>
			Intelligence: 109<BR>
			Charisma: 70<BR>
			Bonus points: +30<BR>
			Starting abilities: Ultravision(night vision)<BR>
			<BR>
			Another favorite of the Enchanter class due to the high Int but suffers from a lower charisma than their high elf
			cousins their wisdom is also somewhat lower, but this race still makes a large amount of the playing enchanters.
			The dark elves have a large newbie area that is all their own but this is a popular class for most all classes
			making this area crowded at times as well their city can be very confusing in the beginning as it is spread out
			over three zones. Their city also sits near a variety of zones covering many lvls including a mid teens dungeon,
			a mid 20 to low 30s dungeon and a high 35th to 50th lvl dungeon. Also having access to some good outdoor zones
			it makes a nice location to base a character from. The final bonus is the only place that the enchant metals spells,
			for making magic jewelry, can be found is in the very back of the dark elf city.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Human Enchanter<BR>
			</FONT>Starting city: Freeport(note: humans may start in Qeynos also)<BR>
			Strength: 75<BR>
			Stamina: 75<BR>
			Agility: 75<BR>
			Dexterity: 75<BR>
			Wisdom: 75<BR>
			Intelligence: 85<BR>
			Charisma: 85<BR>
			Bonus points: +30<BR>
			Starting abilities: none<BR>
			<BR>
			Some say that the human is a well balanced starting character but I would discourage new Enchanters from playing
			a human as their stats are not very high in the primary areas. Past that I have little information about them as
			Enchanters as I have never considered them a good caster race. They have a lack of night sight and a lack of high
			primary stats making them the lowest used caster race.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Gnome Enchanter<BR>
			</FONT>Starting city: Ak'Anon<BR>
			Strength: 60<BR>
			Stamina: 70<BR>
			Agility: 85<BR>
			Dexterity: 85<BR>
			Wisdom: 67<BR>
			Intelligence: 108<BR>
			Charisma: 70<BR>
			Bonus points: + 30<BR>
			Starting abilities: Ultravision(night sight)<BR>
			<BR>
			One of my favorite races to spend hours partied with as it seems inherent in most players using this race to be
			silly and jokingly good natured. The race itself offers nothing special for the Enchanter class though they do
			start with a good Int and a good charisma they lack in the wisdom area making them less effective in the tradeskills
			however they do have a fine newbie area and surrounding zones offer alot of days of exploration and experience.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Erudite Enchanter<BR>
			</FONT>Starting city: Erudin<BR>
			Strength: 60<BR>
			Stamina: 70<BR>
			Agility: 70<BR>
			Dexterity: 70<BR>
			Wisdom: 83<BR>
			Intelligence: 117<BR>
			Charisma: 80<BR>
			Bonus points: +30<BR>
			Starting abilities: None<BR>
			<BR>
			My personal favorite class having a high Int and good Chr they have the basics for our class but with their high
			wisdom they also have the basis to be good tradesmiths. Their starting city has a large newbie section as well
			as a low teens dungeon, unfortunately if you wish more you will have to venture to the mainland and begin exploring.<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">Bonus points application:</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			Ok you have your race and now you need to distribute those bonus points, well I won't tell you exactly where to
			put each point I can give you an idea of what I have seen in the real world and hopefully you will aviod the mistakes
			i made in this area.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Enchanted Tradesman:<BR>
			</FONT>I would suggest boosting Int and Wis this will increase your mana and your successes at tradeskills don't
			worry to much about your Chr (unless you choose a race with really ow starting) as there are alot of high Chr boost
			magic items out there that are not hard to get.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Support Enchanter:<BR>
			</FONT>Boost the Chr and Int this will decrease the amount of resists that happen when using your Mez, Charm and
			Debuff spell lines as well as increase your mana. The down side to this is that Wis boost items for Enchanters
			is hard to come by leaving you weak at the tradeskills.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Combat Enchanter:<BR>
			</FONT>This one is a hard call for sure boost your Int as you will be needing the mana but you may want to consider
			some in Agil and Dex. Just a note most players regret this direction after reaching 25th+ level as you will find
			your role in groups turns to Crowd control and speed-clarity(29th) buffing.<BR>
			<BR>
			in conclusion I personally would suggest the Enchanted Tradesman because once you have some Chr boost items you
			will find you have all the areas of an enchanters life well covered.<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">Choosing Deity:</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			I have one word AGNOSTIC, unless you have a role-playing reason to have a deity DON'T. In my personal experience
			I have found that you will have access to more areas without having to use illusions if you are agnostic. Also
			a HUGE NOTE, your Illusions will change your race and give some faction bonuses allowing you to enter enemy cities
			BUT it will not cover you deity so if you worship an evil god your illusion will not stop that Paladin NPC from
			coming after you.<BR>
			Just so you know also there is no bonus for choosing a deity it seems to be only a faction boost to get you killed
			by other deity worshipers and purely a role-players tool.<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="blue">Conclusion:</FONT><BR>
			<BR>
			Well you should be well versed now in what you are looking for in an Enchanter now all that is left is to enter
			the game (after you have printed your city map possibly) and enjoy your new life. Also for any more information
			on what to do as you grow check out the <A HREF="encnotes.html">Enchanted Notes Newsletter</A> and its <A HREF="archives.html">archived
			volumes</A> they may help. Good hunting and may you profit from every venture.<BR>
