			We being Enchanters, we have the most control and selection of &quot;What do we<BR>
			want to do next.&quot; :)<BR>
			<BR>
			An adventure I had back in my 12-13th year, if you play your cards right,<BR>
			you can accomplish almost anything.<BR>
			<BR>
			Here is a story of how I defeated 3 Lv 14-15 Orcs by myself.<BR>
			<BR>
			One day while venturing through the vast area of Butcher Block Mountians, I<BR>
			found myself straying off the path to a beautiful pinnicle off in the distance.<BR>
			Upon my arrival, it appeared that the beauty was infact a Lure to what can be<BR>
			certian death. I saw Orcs standing guard. Turns out that this place is one of their shrines.<BR>
			<BR>
			Hmm... I thought for a moment and after considering the odds, I decided to<BR>
			gear up for battle. Eventhough I love my pet, I knew that my faithful friend might not<BR>
			be a good Idea at this time, for there were 3 powerful Orcs and one of them was a<BR>
			caster.<BR>
			<BR>
			I dispelled my pet by making it think I left him(casted INV on myself)<BR>
			*sigh* I could not bear to tell him he was usless for this battle. If you think of the<BR>
			odds, 3 Orcs vs you and your pet, you better be good. I looked at it as 2 Orcs vs me<BR>
			and my soon to be friend. Thus making the odds 2 vs 2 instead of 3 on 2.<BR>
			<BR>
			Cracking my fingers and beaming a smile at their Orcish Oracle, I started<BR>
			to cast. Dancing and Smiling, saying Elvin words of Rejoyce, I was able to &quot;Charm&quot;<BR>
			their Oracle. Quickly as my new friend started to make his way to join me, the<BR>
			other 2 Orcs attacked him. My heart started to race as I watched them fight, I wasn't<BR>
			sure how long my friends moral was going to stay(the Charm), so I started Dancing<BR>
			again, recasting the same Elvin words of Rejoyce just to make sure his moral would<BR>
			hold. Alas he was losing, so I decided to give him a hand.<BR>
			<BR>
			Clapping my hands and with a few thoughs, I Envoked the power to smolder<BR>
			the enemy's mind.(Chaotic Feedback) The Orc went insane as it started to walk away<BR>
			with its brains smoldering, just to find my friend on it's back. I cheered on my Friend as<BR>
			he slew the one and started fighting the other.<BR>
			<BR>
			My friend was about to die, so quickly I told the Enemy to Dance! (casting<BR>
			Whirl till you Hurl) and the Orc started to spin :) It is funny to see such large<BR>
			clumsy Creatures trying to dance. I backed off and watched. It was a close fight, but alas<BR>
			my friend died, and this severly weakened Orc started making way to me! I tried to<BR>
			Envoke powers to aid me, but alas I fizzled and became drained. (OOM) I closed my Eyes<BR>
			and took a swing with my Staff... Thawk! I hit um right up side the head! He turned<BR>
			and started to run. I gave chase and started beating him over the back of his head. I<BR>
			was able to slay him.<BR>
			<BR>
			After cheering victoriously, I started to make my way home after I<BR>
			collected my winnings.<BR>
			<BR>
			Farewell and Gods Speed!<BR>

			Subject: Are you guys playing tricks on us??? Oh Test CENTER QUESTION.......<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			I have noticed some really odd things, either someone is missing some code,<BR>
			or just playing tricks....<BR>
			<BR>
			I talked to a fellow Female Enchantress, and he/she claimed not to be having<BR>
			problems with resist.<BR>
			Could this actually be????<BR>
			BTW, its been over a month now, and my second Enchanter is useless against<BR>
			anything but Blue MOB's, <BR>
			most groups hunt RED MOB's to get any exp, starting to feel really left out!<BR>
			Do I have to wait till I am level 35 before I can hunt a level 34 hill<BR>
			Giant, in a group????<BR>
			<BR>
			The Dungeons have gotten, really useless, except for acquiring items. I will<BR>
			give ya a few examples.<BR>
			PAW: I was hunting in paw, with a pretty good group, Enchanter 12, Paladin<BR>
			12, draconal 11, Bard 10, Cleric 12.<BR>
			We start hunting the Commanders in the secret area, and the named Gnoll.<BR>
			Well after getting the named Gnoll down to 1/4 health, he bolts off, with<BR>
			amazing speed. In his wake, returns several guards, all of wich are Green to<BR>
			me.<BR>
			Well the beat the hell out of us, as it was way to many, we died 3 times in<BR>
			the night, and lost all the exp that we had gained.(many of the guards<BR>
			resisted my enchanter)<BR>
			I thought Green Mobs didnt attack anymore, unless they were able to give<BR>
			exp??<BR>
			Oh, in a whole night of hunting, never got the Totem Staff or any Snake Skin<BR>
			armour at all.<BR>
			The only guys seeming to survive were 2 level 20 Druids.<BR>
			<BR>
			Is there a set limit of specific items the game will generate??? Are all the<BR>
			Snake Skin armour, and Totem staffs, already accounted for?<BR>
			<BR>
			Befallen: Hunting on level 2, we attack a single creature, and all these<BR>
			monsters come out of the ajoining rooms, to give us quite a spanking, and<BR>
			the level 10 Necro Acrolyte's hit for 29dmg Bare Handed??? <BR>
			Can I be one of those??<BR>
			Guys were bringing up Trains from level 3 of 7-10 monsters, talk about mass<BR>
			slaughter, our group was killed 4 times, I died 6.<BR>
			<BR>
			It seems to me that the only people that can hunt the Dungeons are the ones<BR>
			to high to get any EXP, you surely cant level in them past 10, its way to<BR>
			Chaotic, and the Monsters start doing UnGodly damage at 10 and above.<BR>
			Is it really supposed to be this way????<BR>
			The only place I have a remote chance of leveling is outdoors (if I am not<BR>
			resisted by a Blue MOB).<BR>
			<BR>
			Enchant Jewelry: umm the only stuff I could make with the level 8 Enchant<BR>
			Silver spell, was pretty much useless, and unsellable, at least no one would<BR>
			buy it from me, even got Cursed out for trying to sell a +5mana Ring.<BR>
			If I remember right, the guy said something about, that isint enough for<BR>
			even a level 1 spell.<BR>
			<BR>
			Wierd stuff, I think I am gonna play on the TEST CENTER, atleast there will<BR>
			be less people to steal my Kills, ofcourse there will be less to help me<BR>
			find my body, when a blue MOB resists me, then beats the Smack out of me.<BR>
			Hmm maybe I should stick to something more Mainstream, like a Druid or Wiz,<BR>
			it would be alot less frustrating.<BR>
			<BR>
			BTW, why do all the Mage shops, remind me of a Dirty Kids ROOM???<BR>
			Everything is such a mess, is that supposed to be fun, or challenging???<BR>
			<BR>
			ONE BIG QUESTION, WILL they be DOING Char wipes on the TEST CENTER?????<BR>
			I really need to know, I can't invest months building a Char, etc, and have<BR>
			it wiped out in a day.<BR>
			Could someone please get back to me on this?<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Thanks for your Consideration<BR>

			COLOR="#CC0000"><BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFBF0"><BR>
			</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFBF0">My idea for fixing the resist problems with enchanters.<BR>
			Enchanters can be very powerful chars, some say perhaps the most powerful,<BR>
			but the main limit is that they cannot effect RED creatures at all.<BR>
			This becomes a major problem for a few reasons.<BR>
			1. Most groups hunt RED's for decent exp.<BR>
			2. The role of the enchanter is to make a diffucult to impossible kill,<BR>
			possible.<BR>
			3. As a dedicated casting class, it should be a stronger caster than say a<BR>
			druid, or Shaman.<BR>
			<BR>
			My solution to this is simple.<BR>
			Make it so that the Enchanters &quot;de-buff&quot; spells effect the same range of<BR>
			creatures as the Wizard's attack spells.<BR>
			As it is the Enchanter is only useful to a group for Buffing, and that<BR>
			usefullness is marginal, as a Druid, or Shaman would do better, as they<BR>
			could fight better, and also heal.<BR>
			<BR>
			Bottom line, the Enchanter would not be another Combat spell master, instead<BR>
			he would lay in the backround controlling things like a master pupeteer. As<BR>
			it is now, this can only marginally be done with White or Blues, oddly<BR>
			Greens resist at a very high rate.<BR>
			<BR>
			Jewelry:<BR>
			Needs major vamping, as it is now, its a loose loose, situation, that only<BR>
			pays when you can use gold, and pump as many points as you can into the<BR>
			skill. Other than that it is way to exspensive, and to useless, let me<BR>
			explain.<BR>
			I did a test with a level 34 that dedicated over 200plat to figuring out<BR>
			this skill.<BR>
			Our first tests were with the cheapest gems and silver, well after using<BR>
			about 50 plat, and not getting any magical items, I asked around and found<BR>
			that you had to use the Pearl and up.<BR>
			Basically limiting me to make +5 mana rings.<BR>
			Oddly I was not able to sell even one ring to a &quot;PC&quot; it just didnt have the<BR>
			value, also the SV disease, and poison were equally useless, as there are<BR>
			magical items that serve other purposes, that do the same.<BR>
			Solution:<BR>
			It should be scale based.<BR>
			That is, a Hematite Magic Silver ring should produce a +2 stat in increase,<BR>
			this would be about as valuable as a Cuttthroat ring, while not profitable,<BR>
			you could atleast break even.<BR>
			Electrum +5<BR>
			Gold +10<BR>
			Plat +15<BR>
			The scale of diffulculty should also be harder.<BR>
			Thus at higher levels, you would really be a usefull and profitable on the<BR>
			open market, and you could afford the climb.<BR>
			<BR>
			Also the Enchant Ore I have never seen, nor seen any reference, to it, that<BR>
			would be very desirable, atleast if the Enchanter is useless in group combat<BR>
			atleast they would have a skill value.<BR>
			<BR>
			More to come<BR>

			The sun danced on the horizon making the water sparkle as if imbued with magic, Toorac could make out the docks
			of Qeynos if he squinted his eyes almost hard enough to hurt. He did not look much different than the other passengers
			upon the Seaking other than his bright yellow robes that marked him as an Enchanter and his slightly larger forehead.
			As the mighty vessel drifted in to make contact with the dock many of the sailors where shouting in what Toorac
			knew to be common tongue, but what they said was so filled with slang that he knew not a single word.<BR>
			&quot;ALL ASHORE WHATS GOING ASHORE&quot; shouted a large burly sailor. <BR>
			With that the passengers moved toward the ramp which lead to the dock, some more quickly than others and some holding
			their stomachs displaying a unique shade of green. Toorac moved without urgency toward the ramp keeping an impassive
			face to hide his disgust of being in proximity to so many low humans. Normally he would not refrain from his haughty
			Erudite attitude but his current mission called for him to blend into the crowd, even if the crowd was filled with
			low humans.<BR>
			Toorac allowed the crowd to guide him through the busy streets of Qeynos, past all the vendors shouting their wares
			and the common people haggling for their next meal. The cobbled streets were small, unclean and the drab buildings
			were crowded together, he noticed, amused that it was as if the streets and buildings where a parity of their creators
			within the crowd.<BR>
			Keeping careful watch on the street names Toorac slowly shifted his path, almost imperceivably manipulating his
			position within the crowd. Anyone watching him would have seen a lost erudite caught up in a sea of drably dressed
			humans. But one set of eyes followed his every move as they drifted through the oblivious crowd not far from their
			target. The stranger seemed to read Toorac's mind shifting with him as he navigated the crowds. Finding the street
			he wanted Toorac slipped out of the crowd with the grace of a cat and found himself alone on the side street. For
			the first time since the Seaking docked Toorac noticed that the sun had crested and the torches lining the streets
			where causing the shadows to dance merrily upon the building walls. Toorac felt a shiver pass his spine and instantly
			scanned the deserted street, Nothing. After gathering his composure Toorac continued down the dimly lit street
			and listening to the timed scrape of his shoes on the cobbles quickly lost himself in thought, never noticing the
			quiet shadow moving and dancing within the others upon the wall.<BR>
			Before long Toorac found himself standing before a large home, bright blue banners hung from the third level portraying
			a family crest of a unicorn overlapped by a jewel encrusted sword. Toorac smiled, this was the emblem he was looking
			for. Casually shifting his position into the shadows he noticed the two guards standing watch within the recessed
			foyer. <BR>
			&quot;Now for the wait&quot; whispered Toorac moving deeper into the solid shadows and adjusting his stance so
			as to lean against one of the cold brick walls of the sleeping buildings. Again Toorac missed the slight motion
			of his predator shifting himself into a more comfortable position as the night closed over both of them.<BR>
			<BR>
			It had felt to Toorac as if he had been waiting for hours and that the sun would surely rise any moment ,but in
			truth it had been no more than an hour and a half he had been waiting. He was almost to his breaking point when
			he heard someone walking in his direction whistling an extremely annoying tune. <BR>
			&quot;Finally&quot; Toorac moved his lips and the sound barely escaped.<BR>
			The figure moved at a gingerly pace down the dim street, but even at this distance it was easy for Toorac to recognize
			the figure in the dark red robes as a wizard. Toorac studied him committing every detail of the old man to memory,
			he would need this for the next step in his plan.<BR>
			&quot;Greetings Ashlak, blast any hill giants lately old man.&quot; the first guard said breaking into a grin and
			nudging the second guard in the ribs.<BR>
			&quot;Why yes I did Guard Rilek, and I believe he said he was your cousin just before he died&quot; the wizard
			beamed back with a great smile. The first guard's faced dropped in surprise though the second guard was now leaning
			upon his spear hilt in attempt not to fall over laughing.<BR>
			The first guard regained some of his wits, &quot;Quickly now old man, the master of the house will not wait forever&quot;
			he retorted casting a sideways glare at the second guard who even at that moment was losing his battle with gravity
			and sliding down the wall laughing.<BR>
			<BR>
			Toorac took no pleasure in the laughter but did use the noise to mask his movement as he slipped further into the
			dark side street. The enchanter found a Pitch black nook within an unknown shops wall, he carefully slid into the
			protective darkness and settled in for his next task.<BR>
			Toorac began to mutter Strange words just barley above his breath, yet if anyone where present they would swear
			the words echoed with a unearthly tone causing them to scream into their mind. He waved his graceful hands and
			a dim light followed their path creating glowing runes that seemed to float in the air before him. The dim light
			set his features into a sinister glow as he opened his eyes to survey the runes. Then with one quick motion he
			pushed the palm of his hands outwards smashing rune into glowing rune, the very fabric of reality seemed touched
			by his spell as the area he stood seemed to ripple as a pond would if a child through a pebble into it. Nodding
			in satisfaction Toorac began concentrating, remembering as his hands began to weave another rune within the ripples
			and once again he smashed the new rune with the palm of his hands. The ripples began to gain momentum growing to
			waves crashing upon realities shore itself, each wave held a slight change to Toorac's form. Wave after wave the
			second form seemed to overlay the first and each ripple held a different face, first that of an enchanter from
			a far off land the next an old human with a jovial look. Finally the waves calmed but where once stood a young
			Erudite in a flowing yellow robe now stood an old man in a dark red one.<BR>
			<BR>
			Toorac, satisfied with his new visage moved back toward his previous hiding spot closer to the street. As he arrived
			he found the two usual guards still at their posts, the first guard seemed sullen and was not looking at the second
			who still chuckled to himself ever once in a while. Toorac was raising his hands to begin his next spell when he
			got the shiver again, a moment of panic gripped him, had someone seen his casting? Able to calm himself Toorac
			thought &quot;No, no one is here but myself and the two guards&quot; and with his fragile confidence rebuilt he
			returned to his duties. Once again he scribed runes but these runes were very much darker casting almost no light
			at all and were very much quicker to scribe. Once the runes were done Toorac's ancient brow creased as he searched
			first for the minds of the guards then finding them he sought a single memory in a sea of thoughts, satisfied he
			had found the memory he sought Toorac waved his wrinkled hand and scaterred the runes before him.<BR>
			Both guards stood stunned for a second, eyes blank as if they were staring into a viod that noone else could see.
			Toorac knew that his que as an actor in this play was at hand, gathering his robes into one hand he scurried across
			the street toward the stunned guards. Slowing his pace and casting a sideways glance he positioned himself a few
			meters infront of the guards.<BR>
			<BR>
			The guards seemd to snap back to reality with no recollection of the moment of time they were frozen.<BR>
			&quot;Greetings Ashlak, blast any hill giants lately old man.&quot; the first guard said breaking into a grin and
			nudging the second guard in the ribs.<BR>
			Toorac took this as a good sign his memory blur had taken now if it would only hold. This close to the guards he
			found his source had not lied each guard had a monicule of sight over one eye, his invisability spell would have
			been useless against them. Toorac instatly filed the rest of the information given to him the magical traps and
			alarms that would make entry and possibly rapid exit much harder.<BR>
			&quot;Why yes I did Guard Rilek, and I belive he said he was your cousin just before he died&quot; Toorac knew
			to make the spell hold perminant he must overlay this moment exactly upon the other. The first guard's faced dropped
			once again in surprise and the second guard began his struggle not to break out laughing.<BR>
			The first guard once again recoverd, &quot;Quickly now old man, the master of the house will not wait forever&quot;
			he retorted casting a sideways glare at the second gaurd who was again sliding down the wall laughing. But Toorac
			noticed a strange look pass on the first guards face, he recognized the sideeffect of the spell, &quot;De'ja vu&quot;,
			the thought that one had been here or done this before. Toorac grinned allowing the guards to think it was because
			he had won the discussion when in fact he was pleased the spells held so solid.<BR>
