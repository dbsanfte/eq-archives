			Tactic Description: </FONT>Basically all i do is get someone to sow me, even at the cost of a few plat its worth

			attack something then go on to find a target, if it kills the creature fine, it comes back i tell it to attack
			another target, when u decide to stay near u stay far enough away that you can recharm, if that fails run and charm
			when far enough away. This gets exp fast. only problem is getting sow and in the case of karana highland lions
			run faster than sow... so stay away from them. GL</P>

			Well I am now up to level 24 and am so frustrated with this game I am about to quit. I am finding myself unable
			to take on anything that cons even or higher. Maybe I am doing something wrong, maybe my strategy needs some work,
			but I have tried many tactics and all end in my death or running for the zone. My necro friends of levels 22 and
			23 can take rooks and harriers no problem while I can take a rook also it takes a lot of mana and health, and a
			harrier is undreamed of. This is very frustrating and discouraging, especially because they are a level or two
			lower. I know that we are not supposed to be much for soloing but still sometimes I only have an hour or so and
			just want to make some progress. After getting slammed by a rook and losing my level 24 I went back to lake rathe
			to hunt avriak guards. I chose single spawn because I just wanted a sure way of getting my level back. These things
			conned green and low blue to me. But still I was taking some damage !<BR>
			and they were resisting my spells. This is ridiculous, green creatures resisting 2 and 3 spells in a row. So much
			in fact that one of them took out my pet and was kicking the crap out of me. If some druid hadn't stopped by to
			see if the spawn was available I would have died. I have tried all sorts of different strategies. root, DoT, slow,
			weaken, tashani, etc.. When they aren't resisted they are great but a green resisting my spells and kicking my
			but. Come on. I have boosted different stats in a hope to make my spells more effective, but still nothing seems
			to really work. One avriak guard still give me too much trouble for me being 24. Oh and that charm idea, well I
			tried that also but when the charm wears off you are hating life and there is no where to run and no one to call
			for help. The duration's of the charm lasts usually one fight. Way to short for a greenie again. <BR>
			<BR>
			So now I am 24 and my necro friends are are gaining 2 levels to my one. I ask the older enchanters what am I doing
			wrong. Did I choose the wrong the class, groups are fun but I don't want to have to rely on others all the time.
			ANy tips and tactics would be appreciated as I am about to retire at 24... </FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue"><BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#A0A0A4">{This is very common with this level area of enchanters for two reasons<BR>
			1. We don't yet have an OBVIOUS group help spell like clarity and many groups have no idea the power of a good
			enchanter.<BR>
			2. We lack the power to solo effectively things i have noted our fear or fear like spells simple do not stack up
			my Chase the Moon spell lasts a sorter time than my 4th lvl fear and neither are good enough to reverse kite at
			higher lvls.<BR>
			As a temporary answer for you my friend go to High Keep and get into the Guard room until you make 29th lvl then
			with clarity grouping is much easier or try your hand at a HIGH CHR and do the charm pet tactic it helps. And hold
			in there things do get better.}</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue"><BR>

			</FONT><FONT SIZE="6" COLOR="blue">A letter based on the &quot;Play Nice Rules&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue"><BR>
			<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4">About the new &quot;Play nice&quot; rules, I have yet to read them but I will as soon as
			I write this. I dont believe my feelings on this matter will change at all though. I have played Ever Quest for
			about 10 months, I have several characters none of which are high level. (13, 18, and 22) But I play very often
			and for long periods of time. I have bowed out many many times from spawns because people say they were there first,
			or they &quot;just died&quot; and came back and would like theyre spawn, or would like to join in and share spawns.
			I am sooo annoyed with this stationary spawning created by the designers and the difficulty in abtaining quest/magic/lore
			items that I am about to go &quot;every person for themselves&quot; on every creature on my menu. I DO NOT go outta
			my way to KS others, I mostly try to help all those I can in anyway I can. But when it come to things I need for
			my characters, I am going to do everything in my power to get. They TSK TSK TSK at us players for an environment
			they created. Whatever social problems that arrize in the game is COMPLETELY THEYRE RESPONSIBILTY. They promoted
			Role Playing rules and now theyve turned it into a disfunctional society. Theyve mixed our human player rules in
			with the fantasy universe. Let the strong survive from now on. Heck we all have different gods and beliefs in the
			game, so let the conflicts coincide. I as a wizard stick with other wizards and should act as such towards races
			under me. They should preach the role playing rules and ban socializing. Take the human players personalities out
			and the game will become a true universe of conflict and change. When someone cries to me now for taking theyre
			named spawn I go into complete role playing mode and snub theyre character not them. They dont cry nearely as much
			for they dont (in my opinion) feel as much of a threat from a fictional character as from a typing maniac casting
			spells of nasty words and insults.<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Whooaaa! I feel better now.</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue"><BR>

			HREF="#Table"><FONT SIZE="4"><BR>
			</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4">Found this article on another site and thought it was so important that it had to be
			placed in an issue.</FONT></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="6">How to Group with an Enchanter</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="4">I have not been able to find anything out there that is a good guide for people to follow when
			grouped with an Enchanter. So I have decided to write one up myself in hopes to enlighten people as to what an
			enchanter really is. This pertains to mainly grouping in dungeons. <BR>
			<BR>
			Many of the people who spend the majority of their time in dungeons know most of this stuff and take it for granted.
			But there are many people that never set foot into a dungeon until they are level 30 or later and have no clue
			about dungeon group tactics. Let alone dungeon group tactics with an Enchanter. This is for them so they can know
			what to expect and how to act when grouping in a dungeon. <BR>
			<BR>
			Contrary to the belief that way too many people have, an Enchanter's main role in a group is not to keep the group
			with Clarity and speed buffs and blast like a wizard. The main role of the Enchanter in a group is crowd control.
			The buffs are just a nice benefit. A well disciplined group with a good Enchanter can handle many more MOB's than
			normally possible. If the group is poorly disciplined, an Enchanter, no matter how good he is will be near worthless
			to the group. <BR>
			<BR>
			When grouping with an Enchanter, fighting tactics for the entire party totally change as opposed to fighting without
			one. Normally the tanks job is to try to taunt all of the MOB's onto him/herself. With an Enchanter in the group
			it is the Enchanters job to keep everything mesmerized while the group concentrates on a single MOB. The Enchanter
			Mesmerize line of spells will hold a MOB in place for the duration of the spell and it will not attack as long
			as no one else attacks it. The mesmerize spells will not work if a DOT is cast on them. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- First off everyone must agree who the main puller/tank will be and make sure everyone will be assisting that
			single person. To do this make up a hot key that says /assist puller' s name. You can lose precious time by trying
			to target the puller and typing /assist every time you want to assist someone. When assisting it is important to
			wait till the puller/tank is actually engaged with the MOB before assisting or you may get the wrong MOB targeted.
			It is also very important for the puller/tank to instantly engage the MOB they wish to attack and when it dies
			to instantly switch to a new one so people can target right away. Don't stand there looking at everything trying
			to decide which one to attack. When in a tense situation time is of the essence. Also if you're not engaging something
			when someone tries to assist you they may target something half way across the zone. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- For people trying to assist.... if assist does not work when you try it, i.e. nothing targets, move and try
			again. For some reason Assist is picky and if you do not have a clear line of sight to your target it may not allow
			you to target it. And at other times it will target something across the zone if the person you are assisting is
			not currently engaged with a MOB. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Very important... do NOT switch MOBS. Do not switch to pull something off of one of your casters. Trust the
			Enchanter to get it mesmerized. A good Enchanter will be standing back watching the entire battle to see what needs
			to be done where. Do not switch if a caster joins in. Trust the Enchanter to mesmerize it and then it should be
			high on the puller/tanks list of mobs to attack after finishing the one that he is currently on. Now of course
			there are always exceptions to this. If there is something on a caster and the Enchanter is having a tough time
			with resists, only the MAIN tank should switch to taunt the MOB off of the caster and then as soon as it is taunted
			off switch right back to the MOB he was previously attacking. That should give the enchanter plenty of time to
			get it Mez'd and back out of the action. If you keep on attacking the MOB you pulled off the caster and not let
			the Enchanter mez it you have cut your groups effectiveness in half. If there is a MOB or 2 on an Enchanter they
			should have no problem getting it off themselves if they use Color Shift/Color Flux (which is an AE stun spell
			affecting everything within a couple steps around the Enchanter) and then casting a Mez spell. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- When pulling in small, cramped rooms try to pull the mobs to one corner of the room so the Enchanter can stand
			as far away as possible to cast his AE mez spell. It's very frustrating when you realize you were too close and
			catch yourself in your own mez spell. The AE mez spell is a very nice spell though because unlike all the other
			Enchanters mez spells it can be cast over top of itself and refreshed. That means if the Enchanter casts the AE
			mez again after about 10 seconds or so of casting the first one he can effectively keep everything standing still
			for quite a long time. It is much more effective than picking each MOB out singly and trying to mez it. If you
			do that you have to wait until the mez effect drops before you can mez it again. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Casters and Clerics... if you have a MOB that you pulled onto yourself that is not the one that the others are
			attacking DO NOT run around with it. It is much safer to stay where you are and let the AE mez spell catch it.
			The Enchanter should be back observing the battle and if he is not in the process of casting his AE mez he should
			Enthrall it if possible. If you go running around you leave the range of the AE mez effect and you have to make
			the Enchanter chase after you trying to target the thing that is on you. Single targeting like that will make the
			MOB aggro on the Enchanter when the mez drops. With the AE mez as long as the Enchanter is assisting the puller
			he will be casting his AE mez onto the MOB the puller/tank is attacking and will not aggro anything else onto himself.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The single most important thing is for everyone to stay focused on one MOB at a time. If you can do that and avoid
			that compulsion to switch to something else you can overcome unbelievable odds. If you give in to that compulsion
			you can spell disaster for your entire group. It is a good habit to use these tactics when only fighting 2 or 3
			mobs as well so that you get it ingrained into you and don't stumble later. I hear so many people say &quot;But
			it went ok so it don't matter&quot; after just haphazardly attacking the 2 or 3 that are there. Get into good habits
			now and they can save you in the future. <BR>

			Read the journals of a young enchanter as he begins his climb in the of the circle of enchantments. This article
			will be a weekly update hopefully so please check back often.<BR>
			<BR>
			The birth of this boy marked a great day in the history of Norrath. Son of Galdarid and Kinu, he was to become
			a savior in the worlds future. The gods themselves had blessed this child with gifts of the enchanter and Tunare
			had added her blessings to him as well.<BR>
			<BR>
			His parents had named their first born child, this boy, Excedor, meaning child of life and of death. As he grew
			he proved his worth to all of his teachers and surpassed his peers.<BR>
			<BR>
			Chap. 1 -Awakening<BR>
			<BR>
			Today was a great day in Excedor’s life, the day when he reached his 20th year of age. Today he would be sent into
			the world to prove his worth to his fellow eleven brethren. As a high elf enchanter he stood tall and wore a green
			apprentice robe. By his side was a dagger and in his backpack was his most valued asset, the spellbook. In it were
			already two spells he knew, the first was Shallow Breath, which would prove to do some minor damage. The second
			was Minor Shielding, giving him some extra defense to absorb the attacks of the enemies.<BR>
			<BR>
			So he stood, tall and proud at his guildhall in Felwithe as his guild master handed him his graduating medal and
			sent him forth into the world. His classmates were there to congratulate him and his parents with a proud look
			on their faces. His masters for those past nineteen years shook his hand and wished him luck. Excedor bowed to
			all of them as he took a step out of the hall and walked through Felwithe. He waved hello to the fishermen and
			the merchants as he quickened his pace. Soon arriving at the bridge which lead to Greater Faydark he started casting
			the words of his shielding spell and moved his hands into a proper formation. Green colors floated from his hands
			and dispersed as he ended the casting and he felt stronger.<BR>
			<BR>
			He hastened to a jog as he stepped into the great forest of Faydark. He swiftly asked the guards to where he could
			find some bats to kill. They pointed to a road that led out but said nothing. He walked down the road as fellow
			elves and even some humans were fighting the beasts of the land.<BR>
			<BR>
			Excedor quickly spotted a bat alone and started chanting the words of his spell Shallow Breathing. The bat was
			struck by a sudden force and swiftly flew to engage him in combat. He whipped out his dagger and started to jab
			into it. As the bat attacked him he quickly started casting once again but before he could finish the spell, the
			bat had attacked him and interrupted his casting. He worked through the bat with his dagger as he saw it was almost
			defeated Excedor started casting once again, he managed to get it off but the bat was still alive, and his hit
			points were also dropping from the bats continuous attacks. He tried to cast once again but the spell fizzled away,
			that was common he remembered his master saying. “Concentrate,” he pounded into his head and managed to get it
			off. The bat fell as the spell hit it.<BR>
			<BR>
			Excedor checked the bat and found two bat wings he could sell later on that night.</FONT></P>
