			Greetings all,<BR>
			Well so much for making it out in time I am writing this on the first and still many of the articles are not in
			or need some rework, Though I do apologize I hope our readers understand that there is some quality control we
			do to make this a better site.<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">NEWS</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> for the month<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">The Patch </FONT><FONT SIZE="4">- Well the major patch like it or not there
			has been major changes, but since we deal with the Enchanter class in truth there is not much that directly affects
			us. We will wait and see how improved the Reoccurring amnesia spell is, though I am sure they have done us right
			in this one.<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">Manastones</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> - Having never possessed nor even seen one
			myself I have no idea on how players are feeling on this one, I would like to hear your feelings on the message
			board.<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">The Unwanted message</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> - Well it had to happen I finally
			got a message that was filled with improper information and rude comments(including a return email address of profanity),
			though it will never be placed here I do not want to steal that persons ability to be in the limelight and so this
			brief message is all I offer. &quot;Your question will not be answered until I feel it is not being wasted on someone
			who is not listening.&quot;<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">Server Overcrowding</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> - Well here is a huge one, the
			servers are seeing up to an average of 2000 player at peak time and it seems most mobs and item drop zones are
			turning into parking lots. Now I am not here to rant or rave on the crowding but instead on the ranters. It is
			time that we sit back a bit and allow them to do their jobs, in other words quit hatemailing and try some constructive
			input. As for those who are helping find the problems and giving well thought input &quot;I wish you all the named
			spawns you can handle&quot;. There is one thing that most ranters make me think of, a scene from a play<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#3366FF">-Ranter &quot;But they are crowded and have no power item spawns or easy
			spawns for experience&quot;<BR>
			-Draconal &quot;What is there no Najena, no Permafrost, no Planes?&quot;<BR>
			-Ranter &quot;Yes of course those zones are still there.&quot;<BR>
			-Draconal &quot;Ah good you had me worried sir, but then why do they not go there?&quot;<BR>
			-Ranter &quot;But most would rather quit than hunt those places.&quot;<BR>
			-Draconal &quot;Then let them quit and decrease the server population.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><BR>
			BTW its a take off of a scene from Scrooge(Charles Dickens) if you don't recognize it. Please don't bother flaming
			me in emails it takes less time to delete then it does to write it, but I would be happy to see any thoughtful
			comments on the messageboard or in the form of a well thought out IMHO article.<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#990000">We have moved</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> - Well we have a new home and lots of
			new addons to our assembly page it is a very exciting time for us and from now on this news will be posted daily

			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="red">Answer</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> --you need a jewelry bag, bars of silver to begin
			and gems, you see you can only train the first 20 points at your guild the rest must be learned in the act of crafting

			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue">Question</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> -When is specialization truly figured out? Is
			it true the first skill over 50 no matter what it is or when it happens is the one you can specialize in or is
			that determined back at the guild when you do you practice points, or at level 20 do you get to &quot;pick&quot;
			and have some control over the choice?<BR>
			</FONT><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="red">Answer</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> --Yes it is true the first Specialization skill
			(note: not your actual casting skill) over 50 (that means 51) is the only one that can climb past 50. The best
			way to decide what spec you want is to choose a low level spell that uses that casting type and just keep casting
			it on a corpse or yourself. BTW a little note as an enchanter DO Specialization ALTERATION it is a majority of
			our DoTs and our buff/debuffs. You will find in later levels that an enchanters role is to buff with speed the
			tanks, clarity to casters and then debuff the MoB, then when things go bad if you are up to snuff as an enchanter
			you can either turn things back around with crowd control spells or give the druid/wiz time to evac the group to
			safety. I have been hailed a hero a few times for just this but in truth it is the enchanters lot in life.</FONT></P>

			<BR>
			Tactic Description: </FONT>This is my standard Group combat spell line up the first 5 spells will lower the MOBs
			magic res, Strength(a large amount), Agility and Attack Speed with the added side line of doing 200 damage in a
			DOT. The last three spells are my crowd control. The Enthrall or AEMes are there for multiple MOB situations, it
			saves amazing amounts of healing if one or more of the MOBs sits there not casting or attacking and keeps those
			pesky healers from assisting. The color line I use to keep the MOBs (if situation is under control) stunned for
			nearly the whole fight, I chain the two color spells one after the other to aviod the recharge problem with using
			just one. I use the Color line spots to rotate out buffs like clarity and augmentation during down time. If I get
			a group that wants Alacrity instead of Augmentation then I usually drop Feckless Might for it due to Alacrity's
			short duration.</P>

			<P><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="blue">Baelish IMHO (Taken from EQcasters web page, see links page)</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"><BR>
			Note: I have also added a few editors notes of my personal opinion.<BR>
			<BR>
			I think I should point on behalf of the &quot;Quiet Enchanters&quot;. Now this may have a &quot;Grass is Greener&quot;
			feel to it, but that is intentional. Verant are forcing Enchanters to stick to their primary role - crowd control.
			More and more of the damage role has been taken away from them since release and they are being left only with
			a grouping role and I think we should evaluate that a little.<BR>
			<BR>
			Pets have been weakened. They are the weakest of all pets in the game, but unlike the Necromancers or Magicians
			they are meant to be ancilliary damage, even a &quot;sacrifice' to allow enchanters time to control overpulls.
			They have no hp, they cannot be controlled, and they are the only class without a true pet heal. That said if this
			is the case animations should be made to have 100% taunt factor, always pulling any and all mobs off an Enchanter
			instantly for as long as they live.<BR>
			</FONT><FONT COLOR="#A0A0A4">{Editors note: This I myself am not sure on, I like many of my fellow enchanters abandoned
			my pets long ago in favor of working on better solo tactics. Now I agree it has been hard without a pet to help
			but since I have always loved playing the challanging class or the underdog I am fine with it. Though I agree that
			enchanters should have the choice to use a pet or not so if Baelish says that it is a problem I would tend to agree
			due to his dedication and experiance.}</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"><BR>
			<BR>
			Note that this doesn't solve the primary issue that because a pet can't be controlled it is useless if you get
			overpulls since what you mez gets auto attacked once it has hit you once. There is no way to prevent this, and
			the only solution is to let the pet die and then waste enormous mana resummoning, equipping and rebuffing before
			the next fight. Let me tell you right now, between doing the crowd control and this as well - you just don't have
			the mana.<BR>
			<BR>
			So, why not charm? Simple. You cannot charm 95% of mobs in any of the planes as Allure is capped, and it is totally
			random in duration. If Enchanters are going to be told to rely on charm then Allure has to be upgraded to be castable
			on all NPC's (bar Dragons and Gods) and set durations have to be implemented.<BR>
			<BR>
			{</FONT><FONT COLOR="#A0A0A4">Editors note: Ok this is where I must disagree myself I use the charm series on a
			regular basis to replace my pet. I feel they are much more usefull than our pets for many reasons.<BR>
			1. They require no regeant, thats right no more tiny daggers.<BR>
			2. They obey commands (CHEER, my favorite part).<BR>
			3. It reduces the number of incoming MOBs by one for crowd control.<BR>
			4. get the caster, be it blaster or healer have its mana working for you and not against you.<BR>
			As for the amount of creatures that are uncharmable I guess I haven't reached that point yet but if it is so maybe
			a boost to our high level spells would be in order after all this is one of our primary class roles.<BR>
			But a few downfalls I have noticed also<BR>
			1. your charmed pet will have a tendency, in Lower Guk especially, to warp if not in battle then return to you
			uncharmed with a large deadly train.<BR>
			2. because many are not used to us charming things they tend to waste alot of mana on a MOB not bothering to notice
			it is doing no damage, this verant could fix with a simple warning line that you have targeted a charmed creature
			or as the spell goes off a line saying the Gods protect your target in the yellow warning color.}</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"><BR>
			<BR>
			Ok forgetting pets, are Enchanters still the most powerful class in buffs and debuffs? Wrong again. With the increasing
			number of haste items in game the need for Swift, and even Celerity is highly diminished. <BR>
			<BR>
			The only thing Enchanters have better than any other class is: <BR>
			<BR>
			Haste buffs (which I have just mentioned the problem with) <BR>
			Group Resist Magic. <BR>
			Hate List Wipes. <BR>
			Clarity. <BR>
			AE Stuns. <BR>
			Mesmerize Spells. <BR>
			High Level Charm. <BR>
			If Enchanters are going to be reduced to Charm, Clarity, Mez and Stuns then they need some upgrades: <BR>
			<BR>
			The cap on Allure upped, and random times removed. <BR>
			Better clarity for grouping. <BR>
			Unresistable/near unresistable mez spells. <BR>
			Longer duration, less resisted AE stuns. <BR>
			If it is not Verant's intent to reduce Enchanters to this role then they need to be givien some kind of combat
			upgrade. Possibilities include: <BR>
			<BR>
			Stronger pets with commands. <BR>
			More efficient and group friendly DD and DoT spells. <BR>
			Enhancements to their slow and stat debuff spells to make them the leaders in this area. <BR>
			I am not saying Enchanters are useless, but they are being forced into a role which they are becoming very quickly
			ill-equipped to handle in High Level zones.<BR>
			<BR>
			On top of this are the little things for Enchanters: <BR>
			Berserker Spirit being nerfed silently last patch losing 20% of its protective skin. <BR>
			Still no full implementation of Item Enchantment after being told it would be included in March of 1999. <BR>
			Mana Sieve &amp; Curse of the Mind are for all intents useless on NPC's. <BR>
			</FONT><FONT COLOR="#A0A0A4">{Editors note: I was thinking on this one last night what if Mana Sieve where to give
			us a small ratio of the mana taken from the mob? Say 1:10 or so since we are not really great blasters and our
			mainstay is to debuff and charm this would have little chance of having an abusive application. I understand this
			may not fit so well into our perceived class type being a leach like spell but I never saw the original spell as
			much of an Illusionists trick either, unless you think of it like we are using the MoBs own thoughts against him.}</FONT><FONT
			COLOR="white"> <BR>
			The Lull Series has a resist level so high it is a suicide spell on anything white or above. <BR>
			Illusions now being for all intents purely for fun with the removal of the Enchanter scouting abilities. The bonuses
			on the illusions aren't really of any major benefit. <BR>
			WTYH and DDD. These spells offer nothing a cheaper mana AE stun can't provide. And the AE stuns are resisted much

			which is need of retuning. Rogues, SK's, Paladins, Necromancers are all below what they should be at this moment

			placed in an issue.</FONT></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="6">How to Group with an Enchanter</FONT></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="4">I have not been able to find anything out there that is a good guide for people to follow when
			grouped with an Enchanter. So I have decided to write one up myself in hopes to enlighten people as to what an
			enchanter really is. This pertains to mainly grouping in dungeons. <BR>
			<BR>
			Many of the people who spend the majority of their time in dungeons know most of this stuff and take it for granted.
			But there are many people that never set foot into a dungeon until they are level 30 or later and have no clue
			about dungeon group tactics. Let alone dungeon group tactics with an Enchanter. This is for them so they can know
			what to expect and how to act when grouping in a dungeon. <BR>
			<BR>
			Contrary to the belief that way too many people have, an Enchanter's main role in a group is not to keep the group
			with Clarity and speed buffs and blast like a wizard. The main role of the Enchanter in a group is crowd control.
			The buffs are just a nice benefit. A well disciplined group with a good Enchanter can handle many more MOB's than
			normally possible. If the group is poorly disciplined, an Enchanter, no matter how good he is will be near worthless
			to the group. <BR>
			<BR>
			When grouping with an Enchanter, fighting tactics for the entire party totally change as opposed to fighting without
			one. Normally the tanks job is to try to taunt all of the MOB's onto him/herself. With an Enchanter in the group
			it is the Enchanters job to keep everything mesmerized while the group concentrates on a single MOB. The Enchanter
			Mesmerize line of spells will hold a MOB in place for the duration of the spell and it will not attack as long
			as no one else attacks it. The mesmerize spells will not work if a DOT is cast on them. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- First off everyone must agree who the main puller/tank will be and make sure everyone will be assisting that
			single person. To do this make up a hot key that says /assist puller' s name. You can lose precious time by trying
			to target the puller and typing /assist every time you want to assist someone. When assisting it is important to
			wait till the puller/tank is actually engaged with the MOB before assisting or you may get the wrong MOB targeted.
			It is also very important for the puller/tank to instantly engage the MOB they wish to attack and when it dies
			to instantly switch to a new one so people can target right away. Don't stand there looking at everything trying
			to decide which one to attack. When in a tense situation time is of the essence. Also if you're not engaging something
			when someone tries to assist you they may target something half way across the zone. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- For people trying to assist.... if assist does not work when you try it, i.e. nothing targets, move and try
			again. For some reason Assist is picky and if you do not have a clear line of sight to your target it may not allow
			you to target it. And at other times it will target something across the zone if the person you are assisting is
			not currently engaged with a MOB. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Very important... do NOT switch MOBS. Do not switch to pull something off of one of your casters. Trust the
			Enchanter to get it mesmerized. A good Enchanter will be standing back watching the entire battle to see what needs
			to be done where. Do not switch if a caster joins in. Trust the Enchanter to mesmerize it and then it should be
			high on the puller/tanks list of mobs to attack after finishing the one that he is currently on. Now of course
			there are always exceptions to this. If there is something on a caster and the Enchanter is having a tough time
			with resists, only the MAIN tank should switch to taunt the MOB off of the caster and then as soon as it is taunted
			off switch right back to the MOB he was previously attacking. That should give the enchanter plenty of time to
			get it Mez'd and back out of the action. If you keep on attacking the MOB you pulled off the caster and not let
			the Enchanter mez it you have cut your groups effectiveness in half. If there is a MOB or 2 on an Enchanter they
			should have no problem getting it off themselves if they use Color Shift/Color Flux (which is an AE stun spell
			affecting everything within a couple steps around the Enchanter) and then casting a Mez spell. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- When pulling in small, cramped rooms try to pull the mobs to one corner of the room so the Enchanter can stand
			as far away as possible to cast his AE mez spell. It's very frustrating when you realize you were too close and
			catch yourself in your own mez spell. The AE mez spell is a very nice spell though because unlike all the other
			Enchanters mez spells it can be cast over top of itself and refreshed. That means if the Enchanter casts the AE
			mez again after about 10 seconds or so of casting the first one he can effectively keep everything standing still
			for quite a long time. It is much more effective than picking each MOB out singly and trying to mez it. If you
			do that you have to wait until the mez effect drops before you can mez it again. <BR>
			<BR>
			-- Casters and Clerics... if you have a MOB that you pulled onto yourself that is not the one that the others are
			attacking DO NOT run around with it. It is much safer to stay where you are and let the AE mez spell catch it.
			The Enchanter should be back observing the battle and if he is not in the process of casting his AE mez he should
			Enthrall it if possible. If you go running around you leave the range of the AE mez effect and you have to make
			the Enchanter chase after you trying to target the thing that is on you. Single targeting like that will make the
			MOB aggro on the Enchanter when the mez drops. With the AE mez as long as the Enchanter is assisting the puller
			he will be casting his AE mez onto the MOB the puller/tank is attacking and will not aggro anything else onto himself.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The single most important thing is for everyone to stay focused on one MOB at a time. If you can do that and avoid
			that compulsion to switch to something else you can overcome unbelievable odds. If you give in to that compulsion
			you can spell disaster for your entire group. It is a good habit to use these tactics when only fighting 2 or 3
			mobs as well so that you get it ingrained into you and don't stumble later. I hear so many people say &quot;But
			it went ok so it don't matter&quot; after just haphazardly attacking the 2 or 3 that are there. Get into good habits
			now and they can save you in the future. <BR>
