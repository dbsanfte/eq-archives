			Name: Azerfal en’ Vec<BR>
			Server: Tallon Zek<BR>
			<BR>
			I had just spent 2 days and more than 500 platinum on the enchanter's gift of Jewelcrafting. Things were going
			great as my skill improved to 90. I was a bubble from hitting level 34 and achieving Enchant: Platinum, so I decided
			on getting better at the skill before I leveled. I filled up 2 backpacks with jewelry and headed to a zone where
			I knew someone would buy something, Lake Rathe. Filled with level 16-25 people who are killing Aviaks and getting
			money. Upon entering the zone I instantly auctioned off my Fire Emerald Bracer (Gold; Stats: strength+5 dexterity+3).
			Knowing the tanks in the zone would love this item; it came first on my list of selling objects. I instantly got
			a /tell from a guy who I would remember later as ENEMY #1. He wanted to but it, like any real merchant and customer;
			we haggled over the price. (I was here on business; none of my spells were combat based, unless you consider Clarity
			a combat spell.) We agreed on 200pp, a great deal in my mind. We would meet at the Aviak Darters. He soon arrived
			and I was waiting there overjoyed at the money I was about to get. It turned out that the person I had agreed to
			a deal was a Dark Elf, now I am not saying all Dark Elves are bad (though they should be if they role-play) but
			this guy seemed good to me. He put his money into the “trade” box and I put my Bracer into my box. We traded and
			he thanked me I thanked him, the usual business finishers. I was about to go happily and bank my money when I was
			blasted by a spell. Taking away much of my HP, now remember, I was not geared up for battle and thus was a weakling.
			It turned out that the Dark Elf whom I had made the trade was blasting me like his life depended on it. I soon
			died and the Dark Elf got his money back. I was angry and frustrated at the server and how its PvP could be devastating
			to business. I finally devised a plan of business, now who ever I do business with thinks that I am a part of their
			race. As in, if I do business with a Troll, (which almost never happens) I go into Illusion: Dark Elf. This lets
			him know I am an enchanter, (cause my spells and stuff give me away) but unless I am attacked, he can not be sure
			that I am in Illusion. Also, now I always have 2 spells memorized and hot keyed: Gate and a form of Mesmerize.
			This way, I can stop them for as long as Mesmerize holds and then gate out to wherever I am bound. I learned a
			very important lesson about business and PvP servers. So to all people who read this, learn from my mistake. Always
			be ready for combat.</FONT><BR>
			{Editors note: I have never played on the PvP servers but I thought about this and Enchanters have the greatest
			tools to avoid the above problem: Illusions. Let me explain, before a trade no matter what the race you illusion
			and call the person to near their guards, hence they cannot attack you unless they want a guard to kill them. Of
			course this would only work in zones with guards but of course there are drawbacks to any plan :)}</P>

			<BR>
			Character name: Poggin<BR>
			Server: Povar<BR>
			Level tactic good for: 4-12<BR>
			Spells used: an Animation, Mesmerize, Tashan, DD spell, Fear<BR>
			<BR>
			Tactic Description: I have had some success with this tactic and have used it to successfully kill things which
			conned yellow to me.<BR>
			<BR>
			I came up with it because I found lions, grizzlies and the like seemed to be killing my pets with considerable
			ease. The purpose of this strategy is to enable the pet to damage a monster without getting wiped out after 20
			seconds.:<BR>
			<BR>
			1) Create a pet<BR>
			2) Select your victim<BR>
			3) Mesmerize<BR>
			4) Tashan<BR>
			5) Optional non damaging spells, like Enfeeblement<BR>
			6) A DD spell (Suffocating Sphere/Chaotic Feedback)<BR>
			<BR>
			When the monster comes and hits you, and your pet joins in, back off and cast Fear.<BR>
			<BR>
			While the monster is fleeing, the pet will be able to hit it repeatedly, without taking any damage itself.<BR>
			<BR>
			You can still do this if the mesmerize fails, it is just more stressful and dangerous :)<BR>
			</FONT>{Editors note: Though I never tried this tactic it sounds like a staple to me. personally at this level
			I had enough mana and int. items that I could root and shoot without a pet, unfortunately I died if I saw fizzled
			or resisted more than once a fight :) wish I had thought of this tactic myself earlier.}</P>

			<P><I><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFBF0">Toorac watched as the moon hovered above the water and its gently swaying
			reflection. He had been standing on the main deck of the Seaking for hours now attempting to sort his emotions.
			He was elated at the fact of returning home to Erudin and his chest swelled at the thought of completing his mission
			perfectly but a dark shadow hung over all the other emotions, the image of that innocent child would drown his
			elation and deflate his pride. As his thoughts raced back he would find himself questioning ,why? <BR>
			Lost in thought Toorac did not notice the last passenger head to below decks yawning and for a few moments longer
			the seaking and what seemed to be its only passenger sat in silence.<BR>
			&quot;You look troubled Initiate Toorac, &quot; a detached voice barley a whisper came to Toorac &quot;you performed
			well you should be proud.&quot;<BR>
			Toorac glanced over his shoulder to see a tall slim figure hidden beneath a hooded cloak so dark it seemed to steal
			the light from near it. With instant recognition Toorac spun and bowed his head in respect &quot;Master, the council
			does me honor by sending you to greet me.&quot; Toorac raised his head and was caught surprised, the shadow still
			remained head bowed in a sign of respect not given to Initiates.<BR>
			&quot;No Initiate Toorac you do us honor, from the moment you stepped forward to take this mission.&quot;<BR>
			Toorac was caught speechless, he had never expected to see one of the council here let alone hear him praise an
			initiate so highly. The world seemed frozen for Toorac as confusion gripped his mind &quot;why would a council
			member come to him&quot;<BR>
			The shadow raised his head and Toorac noticed that the light would never seem to reach past the dark hood leaving
			his face in a permanent darkness. &quot;The Mission you performed so well has given us time to contemplate our
			next move,&quot; The shadow shifted hesitantly and cast a quick glance around making sure they were still alone
			&quot;the wizards guild will be in chaos for a short time as Ashlak was up for their open guildmaster position.
			Now a internal power struggle will leave them concerned with internal affairs for the time being&quot;<BR>
			Toorac's face grew dark &quot;So the death of that girl was to assure this one man will not rise to power?&quot;<BR>
			&quot;Calm yourself Member Toorac there are folds below what you think you know. That girl's soul has walked this
			world many times in many forms and holds a key to a power that would best not found until we are ready for it&quot;<BR>
			&quot;It is good Master I feel the weight of this deed ...&quot; Toorac stopped his face twisted in confusion &quot;Member?
			Master I have not yet passed the tests.&quot;<BR>
			&quot;Your performance today has more than proven your prowess and skill the title is yours&quot; Toorac stood
			stunned a moment longer as it set in he was at last a member, he had strove for so long for this day.<BR>
			The shadow shifted once more his arms moved under his cloak but Toorac was to distracted to notice or care. &quot;Now
			Member you understand how important your mission was? But it is not complete.&quot; Toorac seemed to awake from
			his thoughts at that.<BR>
			&quot;What is left Master&quot;<BR>
			&quot;The connection to the council must never be found even with your work there are still possibilities of discovery.&quot;
			Toorac had not even begun to contemplate the Master's word when a jet black dagger flashed between the master and
			Toorac. &quot;It will be short you will feel nothing it is the way for all honored members.&quot; sadness filled
			the masters voice.<BR>
			Toorac looked down at the dagger plunged into his chest, he was amazed all he felt was a slight cold between his
			ribs and his heart skipped a single beat as the tip of the dagger pierced it. slowly he felt a warmth cover his
			heart and spread as the poison discharged from the dagger's tiny hollowed tip. A taste of honey came to his tongue
			and he felt his eyes begin to close, though his mind stayed strangely aware of all of what was happening to him.
			&quot;I am a member and will forever be one with the council, and the council is one with Norrath and forever exist.&quot;
			Toorac calmly thought as his mind slowed and he succumbed to sleep.<BR>
			The shadow held Toorac until his last breath came easily, his still face still harbored a slight smile. Without
			delay the shadow reached once more into his cloak and withdrew a crystal. Laying the crystal over the dead man's
			chest the shadow began to chant in an ancient harsh tongue which sounded as if rocks being ground, of howling winds,
			the crackle of fire as it danced, and the sound of waves crashing against a shore. A dull light appeared within
			the crystal and began to pulse growing in intensity until it became hard to look at. Then with a final phrase a
			bright flame licked out of the crystal engulfing the body. Then an oval of blue engulfed the flames and the body,
			pulsing as the crystal did but growing dimmer and smaller with each pulse until it had faded. In the end all that
			remained on the deck was a silent kneeling shadow with a dimly glowing crystal cradled within his hands. &quot;It
			is done another has been joined&quot; joy seemed to echo in the shadows words.<BR>
			<BR>
			Even as the shadow spoke his last words many old scribes deep within each of the cities of Norrath raised their
			withered hands reaching for their quills and with the other hand opened the great book resting before them. In
			unison quill to paper they each wrote upon a blank page &quot;Member Toorac Teloran - Caster of the Council - Joined
			with the crystal - Commendation - suggest resurrection when needed&quot; and they closed the books resting their
			quills each returned to their meditation.<BR>

			greater for her memory. Today I learned another friend and allie has passed on and so I have opened this dedication
			to Zhavier also, his legacy shall live on in his friends. - &quot;All journeys end, but it is what you see, do
