			These two comments are final proof that verant does listen to us.<BR>
			News has come in that on the test server we are seeing a remarkable change in the jewelry skill, items are becoming
			worth their weight in plat.<BR>
			I have seen the new items with my own eyes and made them myself life has returned to a blissful state. This is

			Server: Tunare<BR>
			<BR>
			Notes on Enchanter problems and the new modifications:<BR>
			Some call us an Enchanter while now we are little more than an<BR>
			Illusionist. Our spells center around controling the minds of others<BR>
			not in Enchanting. We have a limited ability to Enchant items needed to<BR>
			make magical jewelry but thie jewelry is not only non cost efective it<BR>
			is also seems to have been mastered by non enchanters who have coned our<BR>
			brotheren into linning their pockets with our blood and sweat. Our Most<BR>
			usefull spells also seem to be the hardest to come by. Our Enchantment<BR>
			after level 4 are hidden deep within High Hold Keep, A very dangerouse<BR>
			area for thouse under 15 unless grouped. Our Enchant metal spells are<BR>
			deep in the Dark Elf city and out illusion of Dark Elf spell has to be<BR>
			recast every time you zone. Our Illusions also do not discise our<BR>
			religion so some trying to sneak into cities will need to use<BR>
			invisibility as well to get past the guards.<BR>
			Reading the discription of the Enchanter in the EQ manual you will<BR>
			note that we should be able to enchant weapons. This is no longer so.<BR>
			While it seems that wizards can summon the weapons their fiends need we<BR>
			can not make existing weapons magical even for a brief period of time.<BR>
			Our spells get resised much more than any other class even with our<BR>
			Tashan spell(which must always be used and tends to lower the number of<BR>
			spells we can cast before the taget comes after us as well as increasing<BR>
			mana cost) The resistance also adds to the number of castings needed to<BR>
			be succesful and even resists count to the target as damage and even<BR>
			high level warriors doing masive damage and using taunt are no match for<BR>
			3 resisited spells. Our one saving grace was Memmory blur, a seemingly<BR>
			unresistable spell. this spell is now just as resistable as the others<BR>
			and no longer seems to make the monster forget as even a succesful<BR>
			casting does not return a docile creature to a docile state(Camiens will<BR>
			still attack me even when the spell works and no one is engaged with<BR>
			them)<BR>
			After level 16 you should rely on buffing spells like quickness and<BR>
			RUNE. these spells seem to work great and I have not seen any other<BR>
			class that can use them. Quickness also does not last long so you will<BR>
			feel like you are doing something when your spells do not seem to be<BR>
			effective. Also PC's never resist(don't tell Verdent or that may change<BR>
			too)</FONT></I></P>

			Once inside the house Toorac drew on a map that he had committed to memory before leaving erudin, and remembered
			he found it almost child's play to memorize next to the complicated spells stored in that same mind. Toorac stood
			in the greeting hall, once again the family crest resounded through out the room on banners, shields and even carved
			into the marble walls itself. The ceiling vaulted at least 40 feet into citiadellike arches, and the floor was
			covered in a fine woven carpet depicting larger than life the master of the house engaged in a battle with a griffin.
			Before him was a great oaken fireplace and upon its majestic mantle sat a shiny brass shield with the family crest
			emblazed upon it. Hanging on the wall just above the shield was a jewel encrusted bastard sword like the one in
			the woven picture. To his right two sets of stairs lead to a small balcony overlooking the hall, this Toorac knew
			was where the lady of the house would sit and watch over the master of the house as he greeted his guests and discussed
			his business, a tradition that had gained favor among the low humans over the last few years. Below that balcony
			sat twin oaken doors braced by rune covered iron strips. Remembering the map he knew this would lead to the house
			proper, the living quarters of the master and lady of the house. But they where not why he was here, to the left
			of the fireplace sat a undecorated wooden door. Toorac smiled, the entrance to the house major where all others
			residing within these walls lived.<BR>
			Toorac moved at a swift but nonchalant pace toward the wooden door, this was the most dangerous part of his mission
			if he passed someone who had seen the old wizard pass moments before they may cast enough doubt to see through
			his illusion spell. His sources did tell him that after a evening visiting his guild the hired house wizard would
			normally head straight to his laboratory to work on spells he had learnt that night. He passed through the door
			and entered a long narrow hallway decorated with the usual family portraits, each depicted a member alone or with
			others. Toorac stopped at one such portrait, upon it in vivid colors, obviously painted by a master, was a fair-haired
			girl in a flowing gown and at her feet a young boy dressed in fine black silk.<BR>
			&quot;Innocence must die for the good of all&quot; Toorac mumbled almost as if in a trance<BR>
			&quot;EH, Aslak that you... what did you say... you know I cant hear so well&quot; Toorac jumped at the voice,
			cursing himself for letting someone get this close without him noticing.<BR>
			&quot;AH.... Yes... Irudam it is me, I was lost in thought. How are you tonight you old goat.&quot; Toorac held
			his breath and prayed his source had given him the proper name for this wizen old man.<BR>
			&quot;HA. You call me old you decrepit old gnoll, you beat me in years by many.&quot; The old man gave a toothless
			smile, and Toorac wondered if without the illusion spell the half blind old man could have told Toorac from Aslak,
			or even a Orc centurion for that fact.<BR>
			&quot;You have me there Irudam, but alas I keep fit in the hills clearing them of the vile creatures that stir
			there. And you old man sit and watch the fire burn down.&quot; Toorac smiled despite himself he felt he like the
			old goat.<BR>
			&quot;Hrump... More like keeping fit running from those creatures.&quot; Irudam retorted with a sour face. &quot;But
			what brings you into this end of the house at such a late hour&quot;<BR>
			Toorac thought quickly his next words could jeopardize his mission &quot;I have business with a chicken in the
			pantry if you must know.&quot; Toorac made a serious face in an attempt to add humor to his comment.<BR>
			&quot;EH.. Oh.. ha, just as I thought an assassin,&quot; The words made Toorac's blood freeze &quot;best not let
			Cook Elsa catch you or you will find yourself on a hook with a skinned bear as your neighbor.&quot;<BR>
			Toorac relaxed as best he could and even managed to push a chuckle out, &quot;Well Irudam, Good eve to you I should
			not keep my victim waiting&quot;<BR>
