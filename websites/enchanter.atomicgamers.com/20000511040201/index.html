<p><strong><font color="#ffcc66">The Breeze LOC debate solved</font> </strong><small>Posted Friday, May 5, 2000 by <a href="mailto:draconal@telusplanet.net">draconal</a></small><br>It appears that there may be some confusion regarding the Breeze spell. It is available in 2 places. One is the elven outpost in "Fironia Vie", where the boat from Butcherblock docks, and it costs around 11pp. The other  place you can purchase it is in "Overthere". This is where the boat from Oasis docks, and the spell costs around 22pp there. Fironia Vie is for the good races, and Overthere is for the evil races. I have no idea about the coordinates, but both posts may be right. The first one does not mention what zone they were in, but the price of 22pp sounds like they were in Overthere, hence the different coordinates.<br> <br>Hope this helps.<br> <br>Shai<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ffcc66">What is your opinion on them nerfing the tp room</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, May 1, 2000 by <a href="mailto:draconal@telusplanet.net">draconal</a></small><br>We recived this Email from a very upset Player.<br><br><br>the teleporting room was nerfed , first by a large 55 level monster that roves the area, and is there randomly, killed me twice, then the next day they made it illegal to bind in the entire timorous deep, they suggested this was due to balance, how ever i disagree, making binding not available to casters in the entire zone makes the zone unbalanced in favor of warriors as that binding is a balancing factor that magic users have to balance out vs. warriors strength and Armour. To me the teleporting room made it easy to get places and eliminated a great deal of drudgery in the game, example, Freeport to Halas! Whew! And since I would rather play the game hunting vs. running for 45 min across the world, this really stinks. I for one have the opinion that I would have more fun if I could get to where I was going a little faster. Wasn&#8217;t the instant death monster enough! (i mean OMG! one hit dead!) , If i had known they were going to nerf it I never would have bound in a different place , i would have stayed bound there for the life of my char , monster or no monster. One of the problems i have with this game is the HUGE time it takes away from my real life. Easier transportation would take away much of the drudgery and have allowed me to get on with more of the meat of the game. (Grouping, meeting people and hunting, less travel time) I was very distressed by losing access to the teleporting room , actually i still have access to it, I am still going to use it! It just takes more senseless time now. Here is what I have to do to use it now...I am bound on the docks in Friona vie. So in order to use the teleport room, I have to wait a for the boat(boring) then once in timorous zone I have to repeatedly click the /loc hot key i made, then when i am close i have to jump ship, levitate, invisible, enduring breath, run, click on the loc key repeatedly , taking about 30 min till I find the spires coming out of the water, dive down, cross my fingers, hope the monsters not in there, then duck into a pot. This does not add to my enjoyment of the game, just the drudgery of it! Boring! Grunt work, no exp, just frustration, but what am i to do its faster for me this way than running to Halas, Erudin or where ever, so Now i am permanently bound in Friona vie, every time I die its a 30 min run to the pot, teleport, then when i arrive in the town I have to go to where my corpse is. This is drudgery. Pure drudgery! If they say that it gives a imbalance to the casters if they can bind in this zone , why not balance it out making the warriors able to bind here as well. That would be balance! as it is we casters (in the timorous deep)zone, have the disadvantage of our low strength and low armor with none of the advantages of being able to bind here. Where is the balance there? And about the teleporters taking something away from the druids and the wizzies, how FUN is it for wizzies and druids to get begs from others to teleport them somewhere. It must be grand! I mean they have to stop what they are doing and go help someone instead of playing the game. Any way teleporters in the timorous deep only teleport one person, not multiple people like wizzies and druids can do. The teleporters won&#8217;t work for an emergency evac, unless you were able to gate out. No way are the telporters going to replace group evacs and group transfer. Wizards and druids only gain and advantage being able to use the room as that the world is still larger and more accessible to them than it will ever be to ohers , tp room or no tp room. The teleporting room just enhances their access to the room.<br><br>I would like them to do away with the drudgery of me having to hop the boat and try to find this place every time I need to go somewhere. I mean where else can I go and get to where I am going as speedily? The boat ride, and the running across the water just sucks! Less time for the meat of the game and less time I can spend doing real life things, and most importantly LESS FUN! (The purpose of the game is FUN in the first place it&#8217;s not a documentary) All this running doesn't add to game play or enjoyment it takes away from it. Let us bind in the timorous deep so I can still play the game and yet have a little more time for my husband and my dear baby Ben..<br><br>This is my plea, let us have more time for the meat of the game, and spend less time doing drudge work! Please make the timorous deep balanced once again.<br><br>And before anyone tells me about how the room makes the game unbalanced, or what ever, Look at the bottom line, I Play this game for one reason FUN, the teleporting room made the game more fun for me, that&#8217;s all I want to know about, The fun factor. And not having the teleporting room available to me makes it less fun more drudge; about this there is no argument. :P<br><br>You can let Verant know what you think of this by writing to them at: jsmedley@verant.com<br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

Last night, I ran for<br>nearly 14 straight hours, having found, with a<br>Ranger's help, only 4 of the Ton Warriors.. each one<br>had the "pieces" of a totem which are not sufficient. <br>Also, I had a small group <thank you Galdon and<br>Namuhtae> that tried to find the Nok Shaman.. and<br>found that engaging froggies tends to bring about a<br>billion..whether they're green or not.  <br><br>I am currently in my 23rd realm, and am finding this<br>quest to be very very difficult.  It may be my<br>tactics, or just poor luck, but I do know for certain<br>that soloing this thing, in the low 20's is not a good<br>idea. Bring friends.  You will want to have at the<br>least a tracker, who can double as a tank if he's your<br>level. The neat thing about the zone is that only the<br>froggies and skellies actually aggro on you.  <br><br>It's a tough quest, and the difficulty is really not<br>offset by the gain in all practical purposes. <br>However, it is now a matter of honor, and I intend to<br>strive until I succeed.  Good hunting and safe<br>journeys to you..<br><br>Nolija Ghrim,<br>Enchantress of the 23rd Realm,<br>Rodcet Nife, Norrath<br><br><br>{Sorry it took so long to post Nolija I just got my Kunark CD and am currently running the new lands :) - Draconal}<br><br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

I have indeed verified the existence and<br>Location of Breeze.  It's in the Elven outpost, in the<br>"spell shop."  Forgive me if I can't recall the exact<br>/loc at the moment, as I'm at work and do not have my<br>notes.  Also..the Iksar illusion is a quest item.  I<br>am going back tonight or tomorrow to try the quest,<br>and will have a 29th necro, 24 Shaman with me as back<br>up.  I'd like to find out if the quest is actually<br>do-able by a 22 enchantress, or if the beasties are<br>much to strong for me.  I also found a couple other<br>NPC's who are asking for you to hunt down spell<br>components for them, promising "new spells" in return.<br> I intend to bring some of the Breeze spells, and the<br>Iksar ones if it isn't TOO tough back to the main<br>continent for our fellow Enchanters.  While this only<br>affects Rodcet Nife.. I was a little merpfhed when I<br>saw the spell being sold off for 60 + plat. <smile><br>..it costs 11.5 or so.

<p><strong><font color="#ffcc66">Spell: Breeze and updates to come</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, April 25, 2000 by <a href="mailto:draconal@telusplanet.net">draconal</a></small><br>The 16th level clarity spell is available but only on the Island of Kunark. I personally would have verified this if I had recived my upgrade. <br>As for updates we are working on many of the sections offline and hope to have a massive upload by the weeks end. But until then the Assembly team just like you are enjoying the breathing room and getting some much needed Exp.<br>Small side note apparently after achiving 51st lvl and Enchanter finds hims class renamed to Illusionist, and that there may be another name change at 55 and 60 but this part is speculation at this time.<br>Enjoy our expanded world.<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ffcc66">Enchanter Nerf or Enhancement??</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, April 19, 2000 by <a href="mailto:draconal@telusplanet.net">draconal</a></small><br>So WHY after many many months of this stacking it is suddenly removed? I mean there is going to be a spell that gives both later in enchanter new expansion spells life, so why NERF us now.??? granted why do i need both, well its my mana and I like both buffs, since I am an intellegence based casters I recieve no cheating buff or anything, so WHY . Please explain this??????<br><br><b>It's our opinion that each spell granting the same primary stat that it used to, plus a lesser value of the secondary stat is an enhancement. It actually gives enchanters a way to buff INT prior to them being able to before. <br><br>It's not about game balance, so I suppose if enough people want it to go back the other way we'll seriously consider it.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br>{Editors note: I am not sure but personally I think the multi stats buff is better one less spell to cast and also lower level Enchanters benifit by getting the Int buff sooner.}<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p><strong><font color="#ffcc66">Patch Effects</font> </strong><small>Posted Tuesday, April 18, 2000 by <a href="mailto:draconal@telusplanet.net">draconal</a></small><br>Today's patch consisted of preparations for the launch of Kunark, as well as some new art. The following spell changes were also included:<br><br>-Corrected a bug with a new bard song that allowed them to charm anything, such as deities and dragons. <br>-Added a lesser included wisdom effect with "Brilliance" as well as a lesser included intelligence effect with "Insight". These spells will no longer stack.<br><br><br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
