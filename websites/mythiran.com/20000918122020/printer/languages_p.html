      &amp; Magic By Geoffrey, Arch Magi of Norrath</b></font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">This is a translation of
      the book you get in-game called &quot;On Languages.&quot; It should clear
      up a lot of the questions I've been receiving about what languages are
      needed to read a certain in-game research book (however, I've no clue why
      you need to read a research book anymore, as they have all been translated
      and put up on this site). This comes to you courtesy of </font><font face="Arial">Beosil
      Livelyearth the Mage.</font></p>

      <hr>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Much of the recent research done by young
      Magi has dealt with the piecing together of old spells.&nbsp; Since many
      of the spell fragments found are not written in common, I have been asked
      to write a brief treatment on languages, research and magic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The history of magic on Norrath can be
      divided in to four eras.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most recent historical period saw
      conflict between dark elven necromancy and the magic of the fathers to
      those who now live on Erudin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Books from this period are alternately
      written in Elder Tier-Dal and Old Erudin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Proceeding this conflict was the era of the
      Combine Empire, whose glory stretched across the length of Antonica. This
      civilization flourished for a handful of centuries before their magical
      powers became so great that the dragons of the world awoke and grew
      jealous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All that remains now of the Combine Empire
      is steel and ash.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Scrolls from this period were written in
      Combine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before the ascent of the Combine Empire was
      the Age of the Dragons.&nbsp; These powerful beasts ruled all of Norrath
      under an iron claw and a spell-quick voice.&nbsp; Their wizardry was dark
      and strong. Magic from this period was recorded in the Runes of Dragon
      Tongue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the beginning, during the Age of Scale,
      were those only known to me as the Elder Dragons.&nbsp; Their language is
      as harsh as it is difficult, twisted as it is beguiling. The rewards of
      learning Elder Dragon are, however, plentiful, as to speak their tongue is
      to know the language of magic itself.</font></p>
