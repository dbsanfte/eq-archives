              <font face="Arial" size="3">This walkthrough will cover how to
              create spells for all four researching classes. Please see the
              appropriate section for you class.</font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Many younger researchers have asked
              &quot;When should I&nbsp;start researching?&quot; My answer is
              always the same: Wait until you see a spell you think you are
              going to use. I recommend any Wizard who does not use area of
              effect spells to delay researching the level 16 spells, for
              example, because you probably will not use them. Of the three
              spells you could research at level 16 as a wiz, only two cannot be
              bought on vendors - Identify is available on merchants. The
              remaining two are both AOE spells. If you don't think you want to
              use these spells, chances are you can wait until level 20 or maybe
              24, etc. The benefit for doing this is twofold. First, when you
              finally put that initial practice point into research, you get a
              skill the is equal to your current level - If you put a point in
              at 16, you get a skill of 16 in research; if you put a point in at
              20, you get a skill of 20 in research. Second, the spells you
              passed over will be easier to research, as they are now lower
              level spells.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Keep in mind that your maximum
              skill in research is (Level - 15) * 5. If you do put a point into
              research at 16, you will not be able to advance your skill at all
              until level 20. (When you put a point in at 16, you get a skill of
              16 in research. However, if you calculate the skill using the
              formula, you'll see that at level 16 you're only supposed to have
              a skill of 5)</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Keep in mind that practice research
              is there to help you advance your skill. If you have only one
              component for a spell you need, and really don't want to fail on
              it, max research for your level using practice research. Then when
              you do go to attempt the spell, you will have better odds. Also,
              it is not recommended to use practice points on research until you
              are fairly high in level. You will come across many low level
              components, they are commonplace. Use these, and practice
              research, to up your skill. You'll want to save some practice
              points for when research gets tough. Dump all your points in then,
              and max your skill. Plus, who knows, you may want some for the
              expansion pack ; )</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">First you will need the
                      appropriate container for your class in which to combine
                      the components. For enchanters this is the Tome of Endless
                      Enchantments. You can get this container on a merchant at
                      your guild. Enchanters use pages for their research.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One series of spells calls
                      for the left and right half of the same page. You will be
                      able to visially see which is the appropriate half by
                      which side has the straight edge and which side is torn.
                      An example would be the level 16 spell Levitate:</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Tasarin's Grimoire Pg. 23
                      Left<br>
                      Tasarin's Grimoire Pg. 23 Right<br>
                      You simply place these two components in your Tome, and
                      click combine.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Another line of spells
                      calls for two successive pages, like the level 24 spell
                      Tepid Deeds:</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Velishoul's Tome Pg. 8<br>
                      Velishoul's Tome Pg. 9<br>
                      You simply place these two components in your Tome, and
                      click combine.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">And the final line of
                      spells is a bit more difficult, these require Faded pages
                      which you must first restore by putting them in your Tome
                      all by themselves in an attempt to restore them. An
                      expample would be the level 34 spell Mana Sieve:</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Step 1:<br>
                      A Faded Salil's Writ Page<br>
                      Place this into your Tome alone, and click combine. If
                      successful, you will get a Salil's Writ Pg. 90 Right.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Step 2:<br>
                      Salil's Writ Pg. 90 Left<br>
                      Salil's Writ Pg. 90 Right<br>
                      To finish the process, you place these two components in
                      your Tome, and click combine.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are several Faded
                      Pages, three examples follow:<br>
                      A Faded Velishoul's Tome Page - Velishoul's Tome Pg. 16<br>
                      A Faded Velishoul's Tome Page - Velishoul's Tome Pg. 108<br>
                      A Faded Salil's Writ Page - Salil's Writ Pg. 90 Right</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">As you can see, there is no
                      way to determine which of the Faded Velishoul's Tome pages
                      you have, other than to convert them. If you have both
                      Faded Pages, you can try seeing how much the vendor offers
                      you for each page, if he offers you more for one, it will
                      be Pg. 108.</font></p>
