<P>An eerie howl echoed across the great eastern wastes, accompanied by a driving blast of wind.  Snow swirled up from the endless and relentless drifts, obsuring the night sky.  Thin trailers of cloud scudded across the moon periodically, throwing the snowscape into stark whiteness one moment, then dropping it into occluded darkness the next.
</P>
<P>The old shaman paused for a moment to wonder again why she had come to this unforgiving land.  In the short time since her arrival she had  already seen more snow and ice than she had in the many long years of her life before.  She huddled over the small fire she  had built under the sheltering, sweeping limbs of a giant fir tree.  All of the signs and portents had shown her this place though, and she sensed through means she could not fathom that the time drew close for the Transfer.  She stiffened momentarily as the ground vibrated gently under her feet, but a quick scrying showed the giant that caused it was miles away, and no threat.  She inspected the kettle of boiling water which hung from a tripod over the fire and waited.
</P>
<P>A wolf howled shockingly close, but she did not look up.  In another moment, a tall figure swathed in furs and liberally dusted with snow seemed to materialize from the gloom, followed a second later by a grinning white wolf.  The stranger crouched on her heels on the other side of the small  blaze, and said nothing.  The wolf curled up in a neat ball near the stranger, daintily tucking his nose under his tail, and watched the two humans with bright eyes.
</P>
<P>The moon peeked out once more, brightening the snowdrifts.  A few timeless minutes crept by, and the old shaman spoke..."Are you certain of your calling?"  The stranger nodded silently and offered the shaman a pouch of herbs.   The old shaman brought out her apothecary pouch and mixed some contents of the two together.  She poured the concoction into the waiting kettle, stirred, and filled two Coldain smithed tin mugs with the resulting brew.  She passed one to the stranger and motioned her to sit.  They both took a handful of snow, dashed it into the mugs, and drained them in one gulp. A wave of dizziness spread over both and they reached out to steady each other.  The snow wolf raised his head and looked at his mistress inquiringly, but she nodded to him and he returned to his nap.  "A moment more and they will come" the old shaman murmurred to the stranger, and indeed, a moment later vision blurred and they both watched images flicker into being and as quickly ghost away as the potent herbs turned both their blood to fire.
</P>
<P>A huge and graceful dragon, a thunderous boasting giant and a stout and fearless pale dwarf were locked in a stalemated struggle, each with a mortal hold on  his two opponents but unable to summon the strength to finish them without himself being crushed.  Onto this image were overlaid the flashing of a myriad of faces and scenes: a paladin with a firebladed sword cut a swath through a horde of leering orcs as a grim faced druid called down starfire on those who tried to jump on the paladin's back.  A scowling troll shadowknight called on dark magics to engulf a charging giant, allowing his companion, a lithe mage, to form a formidable elemental pet!  A monk with a strange light glowing from his fists surveyed a field of sarnaks stopped in their tracks by the powerful spells of a nearby enchanter, picking a likely target from among them!
</P>
<P>The old shaman shook with the power of the drugs she had imbibed, but did not loosen her hold on her companion, as the visions took on a painful clarity.
</P>
<P>A grinning bard sent a hord of gnolls running in fear with his racuous burst of drums, allowing a harried looking cleric to call upon her god for the power to heal the suddenly opponentless warrior who stood before them.  A rogue, triumphantly waving secret plans pickpocketed from a dark elf captain grinned impudently at his pursuit as he was safely teleported away from them by a wizard.   A necromancer flanked by a formidable spectre pet follwed a ranger as they attempted to track a rare creature.  As each new face appeared, the struggle between the dragon, giant, and dwarf seemed to tip to one side for just an instant.  The battling triumvirate and the many faces swirled together once more in an overwhelming and abrupt attack on the senses of both watchers.  The old shaman gazed into the bright spinning maelstrom of images.  She murmurred one last directive to the stranger, "Remember what you have seen, for it is Prophecy."
</P>
<P>The stanger slowly returned to her senses, becoming aware of a whimpering sound.  As soon as she opened her eyes, the whimpering stopped. She found herself standing next to the old woman's campfire, quite alone.  Planted firmly in the ground where the old woman  had been stood a tall spear.  Leatherbound griffon feathers fluttered in the night wind and an unearthly light shimmered from it.  Suddenly full of confidence, she plucked the spear from the ground, whistled to her companion, and strode into the darkness, with the knowledge of ages of medicine women who had come before her safely tucked away in her mind, along with the memory of the old shaman who had passed it on.
