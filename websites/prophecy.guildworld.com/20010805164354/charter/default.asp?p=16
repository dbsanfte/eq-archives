<ol>
<li>If a person leaves the guild on bad terms, they will not be extended a second invitation. If they left for personal or other reasons and later want to rejoin, a 8/11 yes no vote of the officers in their favor will allow them to return. This vote should take place via the officer list or in a IRC or EQ chat room at some point soon after the player requests to be re-added.
</ol>
<br>
Acceptable Behavior:
<ol>
<li>No kill stealing. Since a lot of us are fairly high to high level, it would often be easy to take a spawn from someone else. Don't. However, if you were at a spot already and someone else wants to take it from you, you are under no obligation to give way. Sharing is up to the parties involved individual tastes. However it is probably good practice to use the yield rule, especially if it becomes official. (Yield rule - if you get no XP camping a mob and a person or group who does get XP wants to camp it, you should give way. Verant is considering making this an official petitionable offense.) 
<li>Distribute loot gained while in guild parties to a) party first b) guild second c) Twinkies/sell last. The party may decide to give an item gained to another non-present person if that is the wish of all present in the party. Loot distributed while in multi-party guild events will be /randomed to interested parties who will use the item themselves. Likewise, an item gained in a multiple group situation can be presented to one person if that is the wish of all present. You don't *have* to participate in a random if you do not want the item, even if you could use it. If non guild members are included in some multi-party outings, those people have the right to participate in the /random. Loot gained on your own time is yours to do with as you want. Sharing with the guild is encouraged but not required. If you have an item gained on your own that you intend to sell, please do your guildmates the courtesy of NOT talking about that item or its stats on the guildsay channel. When you encounter a situation not covered by these guidelines, use your own best judgment and attempt to arrive at a fair solution. There is no perfect method of distributing loot! 
<li>Don't talk badly about your guildmates. With as many varied and diverse players as we have in the guild, there are bound to be conflicts of one sort or another. It's just something that is going to happen when you, as we have tried to do, recruit players who have minds of their own! Please try to work these issues out between yourselves as they arise, and in the worst cases, agree to disagree and let the issue rest. Don't talk badly of other guilds in public forums, even if you have reason to malign them. This includes the guildsay channel. I realize that many of us have issues with players in other guilds. By the same token, many of us have friends in other guilds. Please try to make the differentiation between the individual player and the guild. There will be no cussing at officers out of the blue. If you have a problem with an officer that is fine, take it up with them or another officer via tells; taking a personal issue to guildsay is bad form and bad taste. I absolutely don't mind if you cuss when you die, someone steals your kill, things like that, cause I do it too - sometimes in chat and sometimes not :-) Leeway should be given in case of extenuating circumstances. Likewise for officers, always treat guild members with courtesy and respect!
<li>Reread Number 3.
<li>There may be times, especially when visiting the Planes, that we request all party members go /roleplay or /anon. Other than those times, whether you go /roleplay, /anon, or stay viewable is entirely up to you. Do me a favor and feedback for a /who all guild kind of command that will show you all members of your guild who are presently logged in regardless of their /rp, /anon status. 
<li>Feel free to be nice to other players :-) I'd like to dispel the snooty thing!
<li>Have fun! (Well, this is actually the #1 rule!) Remember, this is a game, a chance for us to get AWAY from the petty problems of real life!
