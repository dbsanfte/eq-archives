Above all else Prophecy is a group of friends.  For the most part Prophecy works and plays very well together.  
People share ideas and knowledge, we compliment one another's abilities, and we enjoy each other's company.<br>
<br>
The officers of Prophecy, in order to maintain our friendly atmosphere more completely, are putting forth this 
"Code of Conduct".<br>
<br>
The officers of Prophecy intend to lead by example.  We will live this code of conduct as fully as we are able.  
Additionally, we will work to the greatest of our abilities to deliver the most enjoyable guild in Everquest.  
We will be as fair as humanly possible in resolving disagreements, we will listen to suggestions, and we will 
always strive to please those people who can be pleased.<br>
<br>
In return, we expect the members of Prophecy to live by this code of conduct.  No new member will be admitted 
to the guild that lacks these characteristics.  Any existing member who demonstrates a pattern of failing to 
exhibit these qualities will be, with due process, removed.  The officer corps will carry out judgment in these 
cases.<br>
<br>
This is not to say the officers are going to be heavy handed.  To the contrary, we are members of the guild, 
too.  Our enjoyment stems, in part, from a general feeling of goodwill within the guild.  It is our intent to 
remove bad apples, allow no new ones, and cultivate an atmosphere of brotherhood.  Our goal is an overwhelming 
percentage of satisfied members.<br>
<br>
For the benefit of each individual and the guild as a whole it is each member's responsibility to evaluate 
whether they fit within the bounds of Prophecy or not.  If you don't fit you won't have fun, nor will other 
members of the guild.<br>
<br>
<b>CODE OF CONDUCT</b><br>
<br>
<i>Show integrity</i><br>
    Each member must demonstrate a higher level of integrity than is generally present in the server population.  
We strive to be the best.  Mediocrity will not suffice.  Don't train on others; don't group with those that do, 
and so forth.  We are known by whom we associate with.  If you do something that is reprehensible it affects us 
all.  Others will remember your guild tag longer than they will remember your name.<br>
<br>
<i>Have fun and don't impact others' fun</i><br>
    This is a game and it is played for fun.  The more you enjoy it, the more you will be enjoyed.  It is an 
escape for many.  If you are having a bad day, have died too many times, or the boss (or instructor) is climbing 
down your back, please don't lash out at your friends in the game.  It is not right for one to degrade the 
enjoyment of another.  Besides, the person you take it out on might have been the one to pull you back out of 
the doldrums.<br>
<br>
<i>Be polite</i><br>
    In an effort to not impair someone else's enjoyment of the game all members of Prophecy will make a 
concerted effort to be polite to others.  Don't hide behind the anonymity of the web.  Imagine that you are 
standing in front of the person you are speaking too.  If you have an issue or a problem it will be addressed 
and every effort will be made to work it out. Don't present it from a position of anger and your concern will 
be heard and addressed.  This includes in game and out, in guild and out.<br>
<br>
<i>Show respect</i><br>
    Each of us has talents, view, and capabilities worthy of the respect of the others.  Your disagreement with 
another does not mean that the other is less talented or knowledgeable.  Swearing in anger at someone and 
inflammatory comments will not be tolerated.  Perhaps the other is wrong in this case, but he is still worthy 
of your respect. <br>
<br>
<i>Share</i><br>
    Part of the fun is sharing ideas, items, stories, and knowledge.  The more you share with others, the more 
likely it is they will share with you.  We have a tradition of passing items around to other guild mates 
before we sell them.  It is not mandatory, but how you deal with items demonstrates your priorities.  It's 
fun to gain new things and it's fun to give them, too.<br>
<br>
<i>Loyalty</i><br>
    Each one of us needs help and support from time to time.  The more you provide to your guild mates, the 
more likely you are to receive help when you need it.  It may be assistance camping an item, help dealing 
with a kill stealer, or help with a corpse recovery.  Help out; you'll enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<i>Do your best</i><br>
    We all continue to learn.  You are not expected to play flawlessly.  Nor should you expect others to be 
without fault.  If you die because you didn't get healed in time or if someone evacs at the wrong time or if 
someone over pulls please give them a break.  It may be you next time.<br>
