To many of you, the characters that have been a part of this site are all too familiar. The faces of players that have long since moved on have been a part of the plot, the humor, and the familiarity. But as with all things, change occurs. Life acts as a cycle, and all things one day come to pass.
<br><br>

Today is no different from any other day. With the new infusion of members into Wraith, we have grown in numbers and in strength. New faces have stepped up to lead, and new challenges present themselves. There's a feeling of excitement and uncertainty that rages in the pit of your stomach, and the brave members of this alliance live for that feeling, for that rush.
<br><br>

In light of all these things, a few final changes must be made. Some of the older members of this alliance have been forced to move on, no longer able to continue forth as the leaders of this great alliance. Today, I am one of those leaders.
<br><br>

If there's anything I regret from my stay in Wraith, it's that I could not contribute more. I always gave my position every ounce of effort I could muster, but it never felt like I was giving enough in return... perhaps I could have done more. Being a part of this alliance has been a great honor for me. Having the chance to see great victories and great losses changes a person. And I will forever be changed by my time here.
<br><br>

But as life continues onward, so too will this alliance. The new officers are embarking on their new positions, and with an excited membership to follow, W/R will continue to do great things far beyond my small time here. I wish them the best of luck on their continuing adventure.
