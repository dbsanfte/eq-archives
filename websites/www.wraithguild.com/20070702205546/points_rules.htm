<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What is Points system?</font></b></p>

<p>'Points System' is a system shamelessly cloned from

BotS. These points are awarded to each individual as they attend a guild raid.

The current Points of each member reflects his or her priority for loot.

Essentially, the eligibility of a guild member for an item based on raid

attendance is now quantified by your Points standing. Officers can make 

discretionary decisions where following the Points system does not make sense, 

including awarding loot to twinks, or 1 member bidding for someone not present 

there. In most cases the person with the highest points wins the item and loses 

a Points amount that reflects the value of the item.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What is the benefit of Points?</font></b></p>

<p>Points allows for an unbiased comparison between guild

members when decisions about loot are to be made based on attendance and recent

items that have been awarded. Eligibility is determined by the highest current Points

among those interested in the item.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What negative effect will the Points system have?</font></b></p>

<p>The implementation of Points will never properly reflect past contributions over the years course of the existence of a guild. It is purely a tool to help award loot, but ultimately the decision lies with Wraith/Reviv officers<br>

<br>

Because each item costs Points points, members cannot equip

their secondary characters at the expense of the guild

without it affecting their Points standing. If an item drops that a member is not

willing to pay for, it will rot. The ramifications are three-fold: items that

would have helped a member will rot, members will hoard Points points for items

they want, and members will think more carefully about showing interest in

items.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How are raid values determined?</font></b></p>

<p>The incoming Points points and the outgoing Points points

must be equal to control inflation. However, the effort involved in an encounter

is not always reflected in the loot. Dain will always drop a head, but his other

loots are random, and so is the number of attendees. One Dain encounter could

easily be worth quite a bit more than the next if a straight value of (total

item Points / # attendees) was used to determine that raid value.<br>

</p>

<p>Instead, an average value is used, and values are

adjusted accordingly for the difficulty of an encounter and the available

needed drops. Encounters such as Klandicar and Sontalak are assured to drop no 

loot, so they cannot be worth Points. However, Points is still awarded for such 

encounters, and failed raids, because it reflects the effort of members. </p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How are item values determined?</font></b></p>

An item value is set to properly reflect the amount of

active raiding required to earn that item. There are a few guidelines used to

determine this value:

<ul>

  <li>Whether or not the item can be traded.

  <li>The classes that can use the item.

  <li>Usefulness of an item, including its stats and

    versatility.

  <li>Rarity of an item.</li>

</ul>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How do I earn points?</font></b></p> 
<p>Points are earned through attendance. Attendance is taken hourly and by named mob. Attendance is posted along with the loot purchased and it is periodically consumed by our database system.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How do buy items?</font></b></p> 
<p>Officers will announce loot and cost in the raid channel. Members interested will send a tell to the officer in the following format; <b><i>bidding ITEM, points spent</i></b> since last update. It is your responsibility to track what you have spent since the last update and communicate it to an officer when bidding. Bids that don’t include amount spent will be ignored. Bidding on multiple items in a single drop is discouraged. Since we do simultaneous bidding, if you choose to bid twice remember to note the cost of the first item as points spent. We will not allow you to go negative in order to buy an item.
</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Who do I contact in case of any issues with the Points?</font></b></p>

<p>Any Issues with Points should be reported in the appropriate thread. Changes in attendance should be posted in the appropriate thread in the correct format and loot issues need to go in the sticky thread.
</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What if I arrive late ?&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p>Everyone present at the time the mob is engaged will get full

points. In some cases (PoF clearing, Chardok clearing to royals, Clearing

defenders before dragons in NToV, etc) pre-clearings will have separate points.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What if I play 2 PCs or someone else's character out of

necessity?</font></b></p>

<p>Points will be awarded to the

person NOT the character. So it doesn't matter which char you are playing (for

instance someone else's character due to necessity) or playing 2 PCs etc.</p>



<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What about spell drops and drops to 

complete quests for keyed dungeons?</font></b></p>



<p>All Spells and Keys will be distributed based on an officer discussion. With the advent of lots of different methods of rune dropping and key pieces the method can change depending on the item. Best example is OOW runes, these were initially awarded to individuals of high participation in order to get key buffs, now they are just randomed.
</p>



<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Are there any special bonuses to points?</b></font></p>



<p>First time kills of non-epic mobs results in a one-time double point bonus.  There is also a graduated monthly bonus based on percentage of participation.</p>



<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about failed Raids?</b></font></p>



<p>Failed raids will get half the value of the mob.</p>



<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about recruits?</b></font></p>



<p>As of now recruits do not get any points for attending raids. This might 

change in future</p>



<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about costs for items not in the database?</b></font></p>



<p>New items dropping, which aren't in database, will be given points on the 

fly, and this value might be later retroactively changed (though if it's 

increased, it wont be increased by much) on further evaluation.</p>


<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How are raids announced?</font></b></p>



<p>Raids are announced in our joint raid channel</p>
