         </FONT><font face="Verdana"><span class="style13">W</span></FONT><font face="Verdana" size="-1">raith started a long long time ago, and quite possibly in a galaxy far far away. Many of our current members were not active during the incarnation of the original Wraith. The original Wraith (hereby dubbed Wraith3.1) was disbanded. From the ashes of Wriath3.1, came a much stronger and bolder guild. We called it, Wraith95.<br>
          <br>
          It was here, within these digital walls, that Wraith carved its name in the Quellious legacy. Aided by their new found allies of Reviviscence, the two clans formed a great alliance, which would survive far past its fathers. It was through this alliance that Quellious was brought to new heights, and new lows.<br>
          <br>
          During the quest for territory and spoils, the alliance found many adversaries who attempted to halt their progression. These adversaries would use dark magic such as Spawn Whoring, Ogre Walls, and Massive Trains the size of something big to impede the alliance’s path. All of these attempts failed, and on 6th moon of February, in the year of our lord 2003, Wraith’s name would be forever scarred into the game’s legacy. For on this day, forces from Wraith, Reviviscence and Vis Maior would band together to zerg Rallos Zek with over three hundred troops. Each one of these troops was granted a flag from the Planar Projection, causing much unrest in the world of Sony. Hours later, the event was taken down on all servers, and retrofitted with new flag limits. Wraith was scorned for their actions by their rivals, but their story lived on.<br>
          <br>
          Today Wraith has witnessed the utter destruction of every other Quellious raiding guild. Wraith and Reviviscence stand alone as the only living raidforce that knew Quellious’ beginnings. We have gladly accepted this torch, and we will continue on forward until the day the sun ceases to rise. <br>

                -We are a raiding guild that uses a slightly-modified DKP system. This system is publicly viewable.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Wraith is allied with Reviviscence, and members from both guilds are treated exactly the same. The two guilds exist to preserve familiarity and history, but we function as one organism. 
                <br>
                <br>
                -We raid 7 days a week. Normal hours are 7PM EST to 1AM EST.
                <br>
                <br>
                -We do not require attendance minimums, but we do offer bonus points for different levels of attendance. The more you raid, the more you get in terms of points.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Our number 1 focus is progression.
                <br>
                <br>
                -We do not allow any use of 3rd party software. Keep it clean.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Our demographic varies from late high school students, to PhD graduates, to grandparents.
                <br>
                <br>
        -We do not discriminate due to color, religion, creed, national identity, or otherwise. We only expect that you are able to communicate in English well enough to raid.</FONT></p>
