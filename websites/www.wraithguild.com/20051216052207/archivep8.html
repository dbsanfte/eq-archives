<BR><BR> 		

Four long days passed after the fall of the Feran. The epic adventure was just beginning, and the Jedi knew it. Blood stained their footsteps. The air crept with a humid filth that you could taste. Morale was high, but endurance was low. How much longer could they endure? How long could they walk the inhospitable path of Discord?

<BR><BR>


In the embrace of the dusk sun, a herald was spotted moving towards camp. He was met with discrepancy, glares, and distrust. He spoke of his masters, a French guild called Wiz Cheezor, and gave their message to the T-Bone leadership. The lords of Wiz Cheezor were erroneously accusing T-Bone of stealing their secret cheese recipe. Action had to be taken. Biff-yo-fro called forth T-Bone’s Public Relations Manager, and sent him to investigate these allegations.

<BR><BR>


Upon arriving at Wiz Cheezor’s headquarters, the following dialogue ensued:
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

Dwarvenale is an exceptional negotiator. <img border="0" src="shots/DWcomic2F.jpg" width="390" height="352">

<BR><BR>

The Emperor quickly got word of T-Bone’s insulting actions against Wiz Cheezor as T-Bone was nearing the summit of Mount Doom. Mordor was falling at their feet. It wouldn’t be long before they would overtake the Land of Shadow, before they obtained The Ring. The Emperor instructed Lord Vader to send his most ferocious warriors to the land of Middle Earth and intercept the intrusion, stopping them in their tracks.

<BR><BR>

Sensing a dark cloud in the force, the Jedi prepared for the coming warlords. Garethe (a crappy cleric with WAY too many HPs) suggested a radical new strategy, “kite em to 97%!1 hten were sure to win!” And so, the Jedi took his advice, and prevailed!

Hate down!
<BR><BR>
Rejoining our forces in the alpha quadrant, we held a great celebration at DS-9. Benjamin Cisco danced with Major Kira, Odo turned into a bottle of beer, and then Dwarvenale drank him (apparently drinking a changeling has hallucinogenic effects!). It was at this time that Yoda (remember, code name Biffins) revealed his true origin. According to his long and overly-explained story, Biffins isn’t really a Whills, but rather a Hobbit! He was sent to Norrath in order to carry The Ring to the depts of some volcano (I don’t remember the name, I was drunk on sinthahol at the time, die pls). At first we didn’t believe him, but then he took off his shoes and showed us all that man hairs he had down there. We believe him.
<BR><BR>
After the celebration, after Biffins came clean about his racial orientation, and after we all sobered up…. plans were made to travel to the lands of Mordor, in search of The Ring (which… was lost previously). Unfortunately, we lost our transport two days before in a bet gone south (thanks Bruz3). We needed a ship, and more importantly, we needed a Navigator. Durrnik found some kid named David Freeman, and with his robotic friend named Max, we made our way to the lands of Mordor.
<BR><BR>

 
<img border="0" src="shots/DavidFreeman.jpg" width="375" height="255">

 
<BR><BR>
Mordor is a pretty big place. We had to split into two teams in hopes to confuse the forces of Lord Farquaad. Team Alpha moved south along the foreign shores of Ndrnen. Unfortunately, their part wasn’t in the movies, so let’s just say… they all died. Team Bravo (“T-Bone”) headed north by northwest. Steep battles and bloody fights carpeted their path. The g-dawgs of T-bone were ruthless, and it paid off.
<BR><BR>
Under the command of Biffins/Yoda/Frodo (“Biff-yo-fro”), T-bone uncovered a nest of Faran. Biff-yo-fro laid down the strategy, and sent the men into the unknown. Biff-yo-fo was well aware that many would not make it out alive, but a key lay in the hands of these primal beasts, and he had to possess it. The key would get him closer to The Ring, and it was beckoning him.
<BR><BR>
Biff-yo-fro turned to the knights, and instructed them to keep heed at the door. They were told under the guise of whispers that if anything was to happen to the raid, they should continue to stay outside… continue to be the worthless classes they really were. They rejoiced and got AFK points.
<BR><BR>
After a chaotic volley of strikes, the Faran nest fell under T-bone’s might. <BR><BR>

 
<img border="0" src="shots/CorpseHateTrial.jpg" width="744" height="606">

 
<BR><BR>
Though many died that fateful day, the important thing was the victory the men tasted. We will always remember those that were lost, and always keep in mind the old saying…………

Endurance down!
<BR><BR>
During a ferocious battle two day ago, The Ring was stolen by The Empire. Depression filled the ranks of the Rebel Alliance. Our secret weapon was forever lost to the power of The Dark Side. An emergency meeting was held on the second moon of Hoth. Yoda (code named Biffins) decided the loss of The Ring was too substantial to let go. He called forth forty-seven of the alliance’s greatest Jedi, and ordered them to the war-torn lands of the Muramite.
It was a bloody battle every step of the way, but finally the elite group stood at the doorway to the Trial of Endurance. Yoda explained to these brave men what they needed to do in order to survive. (Leet strat inc! Don’t tell anyone k?!)….
<BR><BR>

<img border="0" src="shots/Text.jpg" width="569" height="66">

Carnage ensued. Yoda led his men with determination, courage, and anti-clockwise-ism. And just as it seemed their fate was sealed, a miracle happened…
<BR><BR>
<img border="0" src="shots/Text2.jpg" width="569" height="33">
<BR><BR>
And with that, the Rebel Alliance used their Proton Transphasic Anti-M.O.B. Torpedoes (with a +1000 Dragorn damage mod) on the keepers of the Endurance Trial, and prevailed!

Wraith Kills Tunat’Muram Cuu Vauax!
<BR><BR>
Tunat may hit for a billion and summon hundreds of CareBears to aid him, but we killed him today! We tried hundreds of times to kill him with our uber Kunark gear (the 1337ets around!), but failed to get him past 99%. It all began earlier this week….

Six days ago, Mitchepoo was wondering through the dark lands of Discord. He came upon a guide, an officer of The Magistrate, named Rushil. Mitcheypoo quickly /d’ed Rushil. The battle was intense, and the two fought for an epic TEN SECONDS! Realizing that Rushil’s power was great, Mitcheypoo quickly used the force to unplug the GM’s network cable. Rushil proved to be no match for the
Noobside.<BR><BR><img border="0" src="shots/Gmdead.jpg" width="510" height="283">
<BR><BR>
After slaying the pesky green-con, Mitcheypoo looted a very interesting ring…
<BR><BR>
<img border="0" src="shots/Ring%20copy.jpg" width="396" height="183">
<BR><BR>
Word quickly spread among our ranks about a new weapon. We had an alliance meeting, and the elders sat around a large circle at the top of a tall futuristic tower in the center of Coruscant’s main city. After much debate, Droz (leader of Wraith, and back from his training on Tatooine) called forth The Ring Bearer. The debate continued.

It was later decided that The Ring be used against Tunat, overlord of Utapau. Mitcheypoo said he didn’t want to carry it anymore, so the council leaders put our (now useless) tanks to work.
<BR><BR>

<img border="0" src="shots/Ringpull.jpg" width="510" height="283">
<br><BR>
After dragging The Ring deep into the lands of Tacvi (codename for Utapau), the stage was quickly set for Tunat’s undoing.
<br><br>

<img border="0" src="shots/Ringdangle.jpg" width="510" height="283">
<BR><BR>
The Force guided our Jedi hands. We use our spiffy “Jedi mind trick” to lull Tunat. He was totally unaware of what fate lay before him.
<BR><BR>


<img border="0" src="shots/Tunatdead.jpg" width="510" height="283">
<BR><BR>
Tunat is dead!
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, as you can see from the completely unaltered and 100% real screenshot, we didn’t get any loot. We tried to right click on Tunat’s Reeboks, but that proved little use. After 30 minutes of frantic clicking, we were unable to loot his corpse. Everything rotted. Ittee cried, and Zarnaha faked a link dead. Things were looking down. But then….
<BR><BR>



<img border="0" src="shots/Juicebox.jpg" width="215" height="281">
<BR><BR>


Quesci used his uber leet hacker skills to summon us all Pepsi Juice boxes! We all rejoiced! Even Yoda and Obiwan came back from the dead and got down with their green translucent selves!
<BR><BR>
-Mitcheypoo
<BR><BR>
Note: This post is 100% real. Nothing in this post was fabricated. We really killed Tunat using a GM ring, and Quesci really does have a Pepsi Juice Box hack. Or… It’s a six day late April Fools joke. You pick.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">No mob should have to put up with only being
killed once!&nbsp; So off we went to kill Zun'Muram Tkarish again.&nbsp; We reached our little huddle, and our officers told us we had a new
plan.&nbsp; The short version involves Tkarish dieing first try of the
night.&nbsp; I cant tell you the entire plan, but the ending involves pounding Tkarish's head into the
wall over and over until it goes through Marvel Comic style.&nbsp; Don't tell
anyone I told you our Tkarish strat though. Thanks.  <br><BR>
Gratz to the alliance on
a second tacvi key.</font>

AND GUESS WHAT HE DIED!!!!

<br><br>
So now us tanks are getting cocky and decide its time to go OLD SCHOOL EPIC ON THE NEXT MOB!!!<br><img border="0" src="shots/epics.JPG" width="530" height="370">
<br>THIS IS HIM!!!!<br>
<img border="0" src="shots/zundelt.JPG" width="433" height="509"><br>
I will not let us warriors using our old school epics be the excuse, and will instead blame our loss on the fact DWARVENALE did not use his Old School epic.   The lack of flashies in the mobs eyes allowed him to concentrate and kill us :(
