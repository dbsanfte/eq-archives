						<p>Emperor attempt 4. Everything started wrong. We tried 
                        a new strategy which back-fired. Emperor jumped in camp 
                        and a bunch of clerics, shamans, mages and other classes 
                        bit it before the fight even started. From there how we 
                        managed to make even this progress is a testament to the 
                        skills of the wonderful folks I choose to play with. We 
                        never managed to fully recover from the initial mess and 
                        I hope to bring better news next time we go at him 
                        .......... which frustratingly won't happen for a week.</p>

						<p>In other more cheerful news, we've managed to lay 
                        into RoV well and good. Sometimes one wonders whether 
                        the RvR is worth the 4 hour raid until you pick up one 
                        of these gems.</p>

						<p>Congrats Lunara on your new robe; don't see many 
                        (any?) clerics with these. Also picked up Master of 
                        Death spell for Nirhtam, Feral Avatar for Lotanz and 
                        other goodies from here and many other farming mobs. 
                        Another week to wait....... oh well.</p>

						<p>Emperor attempt 3. The bad news is too much stuff 
                        went wrong with the fight. The clincher being that a add 
                        woke up as one of the four enchanters we had for the 
                        fight lagged out. No excuses. It is a unforgiving fight 
                        in some respects. We'll get some backup enchanters for 
                        next time. </p>
						<p>The good news is we know how to fix it. Ah, if only 
                        we could try him everyday. Till next time, ciao. </p>

						<p>Since there's not much new to report I thought I 
                        might as well comment on another successful Vulak 
                        beating last night. The significant thing was that it 
                        was by far our smoothest outing. This encounter still is 
                        a wild-ride. Sometimes a bit too intense for 3 and half 
                        hours of non stop action. Still our only source of 
                        Ancient spells and we'll take it. Loot consisted of

						<p>Nothing new to report from never-never-land. Summer's 
                        ended, and had a slight hit in attendance. Didn't affect 
                        much except force us to abort our attempt on Emperor. 2 
                        attempts so far only and we were well-schooled in both 
                        of them. And since you dont see his face plastered here 
                        in a 'horizontal' position, he's not dead yet.</p>
						<p>And the thought of camping more stuff for the next 
                        challenge (Seru weapons, Acrylia keys, VT components) is 
                        enough to make one sick. PoP can't come fast enough. </p>
						<p>We've been doing more than our fair share of farming 
                        though, as one would expect. Same old ssra bosses minus 
                        Emp, AoW, Burrower, RoV, Shei etc. I would have even had 
                        a chance to put a &quot;Flawless Victory&quot; headline for our 
                        recent AoW kill had the puller not inexplicably died on 
                        pull, but we still managed to 1-tank him for the first 
                        time for us. People used to say switching MTs was the 
                        hardest part for AoW. Well, he's a total bore now. Ciao 
                        and laters.</p>

						<p>For the most part Quellious can be qualified as one 
                        of the most civil servers at the top end. All the top 
                        guilds are in contact with each, discussions are held in 
                        advance to pre-empt spawn disputes and hardly anyone 
                        races another. In this 'Pleasantville' equivalent of EQ 
                        servers we now have a spoiled brat. A new guild, Expoofit, has arrived to 
                        the scene. It's a up-and-coming guild, with a propensity 
                        for Velious kings, and Luclin minors. They also like to 
                        poof AoW and Shei every chance they get, hence the name. 
                        Unfortunately they haven't been blessed with the 
                        maturity to handle spawn disputes. </p>
						<p>Case in point, one late night Wraith/Reviv arrive in 
                        Kael to kill King Tormax. Rel in Por starts moving in as 
                        well and I talked to their guild leader. Apparently they 
                        had been camping him all day and had moved out of Kael 
                        15 or so minutes before he popped. We decided to be 
                        courteous even though we were at the spawn first and let 
                        them go ahead. So as RiP is gearing up, we headed to 
                        Arena to kill Vindicator and to wait to see if RiP would 
                        take down Tormax. Lo and behold, Expoofit decides to 
                        give up on Seru keys for the night (thank god he can't 
                        be poofed) and comes to Kael even though there are TWO 
                        guilds already in the zone for the spawn. At this point, 
                        brought together by a common enemy, Wraith/Reviv and RiP 
                        teamed up to pull Tormax through all of the Expoofit 
                        trains and kill him TWICE as a treacherous bard who will 
                        hereby go unnamed (aka Linaren of Expoofit) casted bard 
                        gate song on King Tormax when he was 10% hp. It was a 
                        lot of fun actually and one can only hope that the 
                        up-and-coming guild Expoofit also picks up some manners 
                        along with better skills in their evovling process.</p>
						<p>On the less dramatic side, we took down RoV again and 
                        picked up some loot along with Mage and Druid nukes for 
                        Kindir and Aguilera. 
                        Also farmed all other mobs you'll expect us to farm, all Ssra except Emp, AoW etc etc. But we also gave some 
                        shots to some new encounters. Here's the key to RoV 
                        fights, mages in unbearably bright lime green robes.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/RoV-mages.jpg" width="400" height="356"></p>
						<p>Finally we tried Emperor Ssraeshza. You don't see a 
                        ss of the dead corpse, hence it didnt go so well. With 
                        the current rotation we have in place with the guild 
                        currently farming him, we only get 1 shot per week on 
                        the spawn pretty much, excluding patches, and we hope to 
                        bring him down within the next few tries. I'll keep you 
                        guys posted if we do any significant damage to him.</p>
						<p>Also, in one of the most fun encounters we have ever 
                        participated, we also tried the Ring of Thule, the 
                        source of the best droppable loot in the game... almost; 
                        since all items in the new CT are droppable. We had an 
                        unbelievable time through RoT. Here's an action shot.</p>
						<p align="center">

						<p>We actually progrssed pretty far in the fight and 
                        managed to kill Dread and Fright and almost killed 
                        Terror. I hope to soon bring you guys screenshots of 
                        another encounter completed. Here's the loot we picked 
                        up from Dread and Fright respectively, new to the server ofcourse. 
                        The loot is as expected, sub par for the difficulty of 
                        the encounter, but the fun factor of the fight made up 
                        for it.</p>

						<p>
                        Also took down the new THO given the new resist rates 
                        and dot stacking. I must say that this is a most 
                        annoying fight now. One of the worst RvR out there and 
                        not worth the time anymore. Take your usual 3-4 grps for 
                        the fight and you'll have some fun. Although we were 
                        lucky to get unusually good loot (2 wiz nukes, orb and 
                        dagger), the loot table most certainly is not changed. </p>

                        Fire and completely dominated it. We are now extremely

                        cycled through all of the named as they kept popping 
                        including the Underking's first slaying on Quellious. He was kind enough

						<p>Eventually after 2-3 hours of farming we stopped the 
                        Ring but since it's always up I'm sure we'll be back 
                        when there's not much up elsewhere and we want some nice loots.

						<p>Don't have anything significant to report. Quellious 
                        has had more outages and we've been incredibly busy 
                        mopping everything up. Cleaned out all mobs in Ssra 
                        except Blood / Emp in the last patch and were busy this 
                        patch too. Been getting good drops of late including our

                        within a fortnight. </p>
						<p>Killed some named in the Ring of Fire (Warlord, 
                        Warmaster etc) but the Underking eluded us. Will revenge 
                        him soon. Must get Ice Comet proccing skull !!!! =)</p>
						<p>Gave the Ring of Vulak a whirl. Got trampled on by

						<p>Classic perfect first encounter. Figured out where he 
                        was in the zone. Got to him. Got hit by traps two doors 
                        before (now we know), cleared to his room, saw the 
                        guards in the room, killed them, timed repop, checked 
                        debuffs on them, checked mezzes on them, checked mob 
                        melee, checked mob debuffs, mapped strategy for the

                        days added up (4 attempts, 4 dead mobs, 3 of which we 
                        had never attempted before and had little to no

						<p>Cheers Wraith / Reviviscence for three awesome days, 
                        with the third new kill for us. Started with some more farming in Ssra and then word came that Shei Vinitras was up in 
                        Akheva Ruins. We've never had the pleasure of attempting 
                        this fellow before.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/shei-070202.gif" width="450" height="367"></p>
						<p>First try and dead. If you know this encounter you'll 
                        know that if you lose a bunch of folks to him during the 
                        fight, you get lev 60 adds to deal with. Hence any 
                        winning encounter has to be relatively clean, but I must 
                        admit for a first attempt we surpassed our own 
                        expectations. The fight was clean, under control and 
                        remarkably easy, from start to finish. All the hype about this encounter's 
                        difficulty are exaggerations at best, and pure lies to 
                        keep others away at worst.</p>
						<p>Now the reason we went for this encounter was simple, 
                        we hadn't killed him before. But the reward we got was 
                        astonishing and made it all the more worth it. </p>

						<p>Hehhee. If we are going to be treated to more of 
                        these goodies you can bet we'll be back for more. Take 
                        care and make sure you don't miss the fireworks. Later.</p>

						<p>Arrived back in Ssra the day after killing Arch Lich 
                        to find that the basement was up but we were already 
                        beaten to it. Oh well. We have yet to trigger (let alone 
                        attempt) the Glyphed cycle due to availability. I guess 
                        we'll be forced to wait another week for that chance. 
                        But we did find that the Creator had spawned.</p>

						<p>After the Arch Lich this fight was a complete joke, 
                        even though we got the dual weilding version. With 
                        little prior info the mob went down on first try. 
                        Everyone involved had more good time. People are pumped 
                        for more Ssra action, and we are taking action  to 
                        satiate them. Stay tuned for more Ssra adventures and ciao. </p>

                        encounter we didn't even know the way to him. 
                        Everyone truly had a blast through this exhilarating 
                        fight. Just another step forward and the first one we took to

                        in a row...... after 3 months of waiting. It felt as if 
                        this was enough to get us charged. It's a sign and it's

						<p>Been busy with some stuff here and there. Killed 
                        almost everything outside of Ssra multiple times. Went 
                        into the depths a few times..............</p>

                        <img border="0" src="shots/Burrower.jpg" width="300" height="164"></p>
						<p>But came up empty handed. The stupid thing warped 
                        TWICE in 2 tries to the zone. Although we got GM rezzes 
                        it still doesn't insatiate the desire for revenge. </p>
						<p>Also hit Tunare again like we have been when she's up 
                        (Hey, we need our share of phat loots). Enough shots of 
                        corpses, here's one of the fight. As Siran the Lunatic 
                        once said, &quot;Be one with the wall.....................&quot;</p>

						<p>Gave the Ring of Fire version 7.32 a whirl and I must 
                        say it's a ton of fun. We were rather overwhelmed with 
                        our minimal damage output. The waves just popped too 
                        fast, so we'll need to come up with some alternative 
                        strats maybe or bring some more ppl than 30. Near the 
                        end we had 20+ mobs mezzed thanks to the presence of 2 
                        members (Alzedo and Einu) of our team of 
                        mega-enchanters.</p>

                        each time and other goodies. I have heard a lot about 
                        how unlike other encounters this one retains its 
                        difficulty even when beaten once..... yeah right. Lost 
                        only 2 folks one time and second time we made mistakes 
                        and still won with less than 10 deaths. Need to get a

						<p>Just got done with the most excruciating run in N ToV. 
                        4 days !!!! How you ask? Each day we killed all the 
                        dragons that WERE up in just about the shortest time 
                        possible. Apparently the guild before us took this long 
                        to crawl through the place. When questioned, they claim 
                        the guild before them are to blame. This rotation is 
                        becoming cumbersome if this is to be repeated. I'm sure 
                        steps will be taken to ensure this doesnt happen again.</p>
						<p>On a more positive note the fights themselves were an 
                        absolute joke, most of them flawless with no deaths. So 
                        the rooted dragons don't warp now, didn't change much. 
                        Vyemm was probably the most fun as our last strat 
                        moderately relied on warping but he didn't prove to be 
                        too much trouble as his pets popped during the fight but 
                        died along with him. Dropped the sweet Graudalek sword.</p>
						<p>Yeah yeah you've seen this ss a billion times on tons 
                        of other guild sites but we were particulary frustrated 
                        on day 4 on waiting for this stuff to pop and executed 
                        our revenge in full force.</p>

						<p>In other news we've just been farming keys in Ssra 
                        and farming mobs in general. Approaching 30 second floor 
                        commanders. No key yet. Creator aka loot heaven lies 
                        beyond our reach still. Ah well atleast we're getting 
                        plenty of rings for Emp keys.</p>

						<p>Earth Mother dead. No long commentary on this one. We knew we could kill 
                        her, we did it. I wasnt there but I&nbsp; heard it went 
                        very smooth. Cheers for Wraith / Reviv !!</p>
						<p>In other news, had a shot at AoW, got him to 70% or 
                        so on first MT and the switch never happened. Great. Oh 
                        well. Live and learn. Cleared Dain, CT, Tormax, Yelinak, 
                        Klan, Zlan, IV, N ToV and etc etc like a gazillion 
                        times. </p>
						<p>A couple of special things happened in NToV, for the 
                        curious minded. 1. We cleared Aary + 2 pets together 
                        along with all the hatchlings in a sweet long fight. Was 
                        fun. 2. We killed the rooted, spellfilter bugged, 
                        irresistible knockback Lord Vyemm in a nearly perfect 
                        fight (4-5 fights deaths at end enrage to... &quot;lag&quot; hehe). 
                        3. We cleared 11 or 12 dragons in a awesome 6 hr burst. </p>
						<p>And yeah, Tanven did irritate me into doing an update 
                        ! =)</p>

						<p>Wraith is killin' stuff, <font color="red"><b>big</b></font> stuff. They be getting loots, <font color="red"><b>nice</b></font> loots. Other than that I got no idea what the hell they are doin' but I figured I could irritate Desi into making a real update.</p>
