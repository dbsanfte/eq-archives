2003 - Rallos Zek Falls to Revived Old Alliance - </b></font>
<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>Frustrated by limited attempts at the Rallos Zek encounter and artificial 
hindrances to our EQ progression, Vis Maior and Wraith / Reviviscence revived a 
three year old alliance to bring down Rallos Zek the Warlord tonight together 
for the first time on our first try. Last time Wraith and Vis Maior raided 
together was during the server first and early few kills of Trakannon in 2000 
during the Ruins of Kunark. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/rallos-zek-dead.jpg" width="600" height="439"></p>
<p>And tonight, united against a common enemy by a common cause, Rallos Zek was 
brought down to his back by a monumentally zerg force by any standards.......... 
and all of us had a blast doing it. Cheers to everyone present. See you in the 
elemental planes.</p>

2003 - Solusek Ro Tower - </b></font>
<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>Spent the last few weeks getting everyone who was missing flags upto speed 
and then worked on the Solusek Ro trials.</p>
<p>Anyone who has done them would realize that to say they were easy would be an 
understatement. It's surprising that one of the most beautiful zones in the game 
(up there with Vex Thal and Veeshan's Peak) is again locked away from the 
majority of the people, and AGAIN the mobs required to kill are harder than the 
mobs in the locked away zone. Trakannon was harder than all VP mobs except 
Hoshkar and Phara Dar. Emperor Ssraeshza was harder than all Vex Thal mobs. And 
now they bring the absurdity to another level. None of the Solusek Ro trials are 
harder than ................ Grummus. Probably Xanamech difficulty. Really the 
trials are ideal encounters for small guilds, small raids..... requiring about 
3-4 grps and guaranteeing a decent item reward after an hour or two of fighting. 
Oh well. Some random pics.</p>
<p>First trial we did. After an hour or two of clearing we met a boss mob which 
ended up being a slowable version of Vindicator !!</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-frontright.jpg" width="400" height="265"></p>
<p>This trial ended up with this beautiful flaming bird swooping down to attack.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-arlyxir.jpg" width="300" height="304"></p>
<p>Oh yeah, he's a gimp.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-arlyxir-dead.jpg" width="600" height="177"></p>
<p>All trials were done upon availability and now we're at a stand still.</p>
<p>Rallos Zek the Warlord.</p>
<p>After being unable to access him for a couple of weeks since the guild first 
to kill him on the server was keeping him down because of his incredibly amazing 
and absolutely unsurpassed loot items, we finally managed to strike a deal 
allowing us access to the event........................ and now he's perma-killed! 
After trying the event a few times and getting our ass kicked by this version of 
Tallon Zek we have been unable to try him again since GMs are perma-killing him. 
More to come from La La land as we all sit and wait to try this sucker finally 
so we can move forward. Even worse, the PoP mob RvRs and itemizations are so 
sucky you don't even feel like killing them for the loot if you don't need a 
flag. Oh well, something has to give one way or another. Later.</p>

2003 - Bertoxxulous, Mithaniel Marr, Saryn - </b></font>
<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>Being on a competitive server limits your opportunities to progress somewhat 
and Quellious is one the more competitive servers around. Still we all strive to 
find our niche and we managed to find some opportunities and downed these 
respective mobs to continue the PoP storyline progression and opened a new zone 
for us.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Temple of Marr: Tier 3 
                            (Sub-zone)</font></p>
<p>Went again at Mithaniel Marr and this time he went down with ease.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/mithmarr-dead-011503.jpg" width="500" height="181"></p>
<p>Infact the fight proved to be too easy for some so in all our wisdom we 
somehow managed to train a lot of mobs on us after the fight (repops and beyond) 
and managed to wipe after hardly losing anyone to him. Ah the joys! Loot did get 
distributed and everyone got flagged so mission was successful.</p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Crypt of Decay: Tier 2 (aka 
                          Ruins of Lxanvom)</font></p>
						<p>Ran the Bertoxxulous script and managed to take him 
                        down the second time we popped him. Fight was easier 
                        than expected or perhaps we got lucky. Flags were 
                        collected and one more challenge was put to rest.</p>

                          <p>Also visited Saryn's Tower and cleared all the way 
                          to and including Saryn herself. Saryn is a 
                          surprisingly easy encounter, not much different from 
                          Terris Thule. With the Mithaniel Marr, Saryn and 
                          Bertoxxulous kills we managed to complete the 
                          necessary progression and Maelin now allowed us to 
                          enter the Temple of Solusek Ro.</p>

                          <p>Haven't explored this zone too much yet. More news 
                          to come when we do explore it further. Right now 
                          Rallos Zek stands between us and access to Elemental 
                          Planes and we will be proceeding to try his event soon 
                          as we repeat some flags for people who missed them. 
                          Hope you had a good long weekend. Ciao.</p>

						<p>Not much's been happening. Lots of people took breaks 
                        during the last 2 weeks so the guild resorted to boring 
                        stuff like Vex Thal farming and etc. Although a little 
                        progress was still made along the storylines.</p>
                        <p><font color="#FFFF00">Temple of Marr: Tier 3 
                            (Sub-zone)</font></p>
<p>Made a few unsuccessful attempts at Mithaniel Marr. The zone possibly has the 
most frustrating graveyard compared to any other zone in the game, landing you 
next to the zone in portal where attempting to loot your corpse can port you to 
kos mobs in the Halls of Honor and ofcourse you cant drag your corpse out of the 
graveyard either. Mithaniel Marr himself was a fun fight and I'll report more 
progress along that front when we revisit him. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Bastion of Thunder: Tier 3</font></p>
<p>Visited the Bastion of Thunder to attempt to free Karana from the stormlord's 
cruel reign. Agnarr was a very entertaining bout, especially figuring out the 
events for the first time. The visit was successful and Agnarr went down.</p>

<p><font color="#00FF00">Plane of Tactics: Tier 2</font></p>
<p>Visited Tactics to meet the other demi-god we had not yet met. Tallon Zek was 
a harder than the pitifully easy Vallon Zek, and probably more fun too. 
Especially if you play with the graphics on and you see the flames burning 
around him as he reaches back on his arrow to land a 3k ish nuke on someone 
(complete with different effects / colors for different resists) and then see 
that person burning............. it's a colorful fight indeed. Much fun for all. </p>

						<p>We came late to the party but it won't stop us from 
                        having fun. PoP as you all know has limited zones which 
                        have events which give further access. I will report 
                        progress along multiple storylines, skipping from one 
                        arc to another and hope you can follow along the mind 
                        boggling and complex plot. 4 Planes initially available,

                        Plane of Storms and Plane of Valor. About a dozen or so 
                        keys for 7th Hammer, but since he was buffed we don't 
                        feel he's worth the effort to key more people, 
                        especially since he doesn't progress the storyline.</p>

                          people but almost seemed to be zerging it down. A good 
                          pull team and decent strategy and this can be done 
                          with 4 grps or less for sure. Quite a change from 
                          Behemoth.</p>

                          <p>More news to come from this zone as we proceed to Tallon 
                          Zek before at some point attempting Rallos Zek, whose 
                          Tier 3, Plane of War, zone was removed from the game 
                          at the last minute, and it's contents included in this 
                          zone. Hence I dubbed the zone Tier 2/3 since the 
                          content past Tallon and Vallon is certainly Tier 3.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for staying along for the ride. Sorry the 
                        progress report was less pictorial than I intended but I 
                        will remind myself to take more screenshots from now. 
                        Expect more updated news reports about the progress 
                        along all the different storylines and arcs as we continued 
                        to march towards the Lands of Phat Loots (aka Elemental 
                        Planes). So much to kill, so little time.</p>

						<p>Lots of kills since last update, of note are: Emp x2, Cursed(grats Revenger on bloodfrenzy), HP(grats Citto on BB), Terris Thule x2, Grummus x2, HoH trials even tho Rydda'Dar seams to avoid us, Doomshade(wtf??), Aerin'Dar x2. Finally completed the buggy Save the Gnome quest in PoI and tried Behemoth(note thats Behemoth the big ass ugly mofo in Poi, not to be confused with Behemoth the big ass ugly mofo in Wraith). Also have been doing alot of key farming for Bastion of Thunder, and getting some exp. Cleared VT again, our fastest and cleanest yet, grats me on a whopping negetive 57 or so points /sigh. Grats Biffins on Wristband of Judgement, Vortok on uber neck and Nemekis on V10 arms.</p>

                        down he went giving us access to Halls of Honor. Aerin'Dar was a fun fight, more Kunark (VP in

                        change. Still haven't found Grummus, Terris or Behemoth up ...... damn that

                        and picked up our first Aten Ha Ra robe for Nanelen. Ciao.</p>

						<p>I'd hate to be overdramatic but the win was so sweet 
                        which such a emphatic conclusion to months of keys and 
                        shard farmings that it's hard not feel so satisfied. All 
                        those days/night of emp key camps, the long waits for 
                        Emperor attempts, the shards camps etc all came together 
                        in a rousing crescendo. In a exciting 6 hour romp we ran 
                        from Thall Va Kelun to Aten Ha Ra exploring and learning 
                        all the content in between for the first time.</p>
						<p>None of the named or clearing mobs etc posed any 
                        issues with our  40-45ish member raid force, which only 
                        enhanced the feeling that VT was a reward zone for all 
                        the months of effort. Nothing in VT is close to the 
                        difficulty of the many more tougher mobs outside it, just tedious. The 
                        place doesn't need to have half as many mobs to clear as 
                        it does, but it wasn't an issue at all. We went from 
                        zone-in to TVK in 1 day and from TVK to AHR in another 
                        day, and two days seemed fair to me for the rewards. I 
                        know other guilds manage to romp through the zone in 
                        single 7-10 hour sessions and hopefully we'll manage to 
                        achieve that level of proficiency as well on repeat 
                        clearings. The zone is beautiful, the clearings were fun 
                        and we all thoroughly enjoyed learning and clearing it.</p>
						<p>Thall Va Kelun and Diabo Xi Va Temarial were next to 
                        go down after the Diabos on first floor. Both look like 
                        the same old 4-armers, and they look the same dead. 
                        First run on Thall Va Kelun posed some problems as it 
                        was late night and our 6 grp raid couldn't handle the 
                        repops on the longish fight. Second try we had better 
                        time management to cap off the first day with the kill. 
                        The second day of clearing took us to DXVT through the 
                        much discussed &quot;Hall of Doom&quot; although I didn't 
                        understand the big deal. DXVT also went down easily and the clearings became a lot less tedious 
                        after that as 
                        named lined up one after the other, ready to die.</p>

						<p>VXAHR was first new model we saw for a while, which 
                        itself was cause to cheer. Got trained by mistakes but 
                        still died easily as we learnt the mob during the fight. 
                        Next up were two versions of these identical goos.</p>

						<p>The buggy Gravty-fluxes managed to warp the entire 
                        wing below us onto us, but in probably the most 
                        challenging and exciting fight of the whole trip we 
                        again managed to avoid a CR and cleared all of them. And 
                        then nothing remained but Aten Ha Ra herself, and she 
                        followed the course of her comrades to eternal 
                        rest...... well, till repop.</p>

						<p>Yeah we picked up some nice trinkets and ancient 
                        spells along the way but I doubt anyone who comes to 
                        read this update cares for the list. Needless to say 
                        they were nice enough to warrant repeat trips. </p>

						<p>Frequent server outages have forced frustrating 
                        restarts on our Vex Thal clearing. I wanted to post pics 
                        of trains and disasters and corpses littered all over 
                        the screen due to wipeouts and I will, soon as we have 
                        one. Pull team's been a gem and the zone is very 
                        enjoyable so far. Granted the more annoying features 
                        like AE blind have been removed, making the zone easier 
                        and more enjoyable for recent entrants like us, and I'm 
                        glad. </p>

						<p>They all have identical rooms, same model and died in 
                        the same spot, in the same position and with equal ease, 
                        so why take up more bandwidth than one pic. So far all 
                        mobs seem to be rewards for all the months of key/bane 
                        farmings for emperor and shard camps for VT keys. None 
                        of the mobs so far are harder than Vindi/Rumblecrush 
                        difficulty level, all mobs encountered so far died 
                        easily on first go with no prior info. Picked up some 
                        nice trinkets from them, but don't worry, I won't 
                        barrage you with a list of loots and names.</p>
						<p>Emperor also died again, for the first time since PoP 
                        and WOW! With the new hp buffs, lev 65 tanks, and above 
                        all the 40% disease slow available, the mob is a 
                        complete joke to its previous difficulty level. Atleast 
                        he's more accessible by smaller guilds now too, which 
                        means less farming for them and makes you wonder why you 
                        bothered. Right now Emperor is most definitely doable 
                        with 35-40 ish.</p>

						<p>Planes of Power is here, and we have nothing to do 
                        with it. Need to finish up some old stuff before we 
                        tackle this new beast.</p>
						<p>Killed Emperor twice more, this time without mod 
                        rods. This is after the patch in which the gimped 
                        version was fixed. The fight lengths were exactly 26 min 
                        and 27 min for the 2 fights and seems his hitpoints have 
                        been restored to what they originally were. Wasn't much 
                        of a problem and we managed to find several ways around 
                        the god rods. Dropped a
                        <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/the_sword_ssraeshza.jpg">

						<p>Finally managed to enough people with shards (40 or 
                        so) to decide it's enough to try out Vex Thal. I have to 
                        say the zone is fun and active. We've yet to have any 
                        trains (well, none we couldn't handle) and I'm thankful 
                        that the coffin crs we were warned about on first trips 
                        have eluded us. We've been cautious though, as we were 
                        trying to learn the mobs, their 
                        classes/levels/abilities/repop timers and etc. </p>
						<p>First mob up was Thall Va Xakra after a little 
                        clearing. Rumblecrush difficulty level. No I'm not 
                        joking. Also took out Thall Va Xakra #2. Loots were very 
                        good for the difficulty. 2

                        black. Another trivial fight. So far it seems everything 
                        is easily manageable with 6 groups or even less. 
                        Ofcourse most of the zone to go still and more 
                        challenging mobs around the corner. This guy dropped an amulet 
                        and earring. </p>

						<p>In other news, the dreaded death of God Rod is in and 
                        we've only done a handful of uber mobs since. The Cursed 
                        cycle we took down happened to be the gimped version. 
                        High Priest's AC/hitpoints were majorly nerfed, very 
                        disappointing and unnecessary as all clerics were above 
                        80 mana when he died. Same with Arch Lich, closer to 50% 
                        this time, but another unnecessary nerf on AC/hps. We 
                        never used rods on Itraer Vius and Shei anyway so those 
                        fights were unchanged. The upcoming Emperor fight will 
                        be a lot more interesting as it's supposed to provide 
                        more challenging mana management issues.</p>
						<p>Plane of Power patch goes in on Monday. Given my 
                        experience with the release of the Kunark, Velious, 
                        Luclin expansions, I'd advise everyone to gear up for 
                        daily patches for the next week or two. See you in the 
                        Plane of Knowledge as we all sit around and curse Verant 
                        when we realize 70% of the content is locked, each plane 
                        requires a laborious key process and you can't put 
                        points in Planar AA abilites without your class title.

						<p>Need I say more ? No........ but I will anyway. 
                        Emperor Ssraeshza is dead. And not just dead, he was 
                        comprehensively beaten in a manner we didn't dare hope 
                        for. MT died only once (coincidentally at about 
                        the 50% mark) and the next one didn't die in a totally 
                        clean fight. 27 minutes of 
                        pure adrenaline rush. The kind of emphatic win that 
                        makes you wonder why it didn't happen earlier. Grats 
                        Hayzel on shawl, Ittee on slippers, Lunara on torque and 
                        Desaran on Garrison nuke.</p>
						<p>Fiercely proud of our accomplishments, and having 
                        beaten arguably the two hardest encounters in the game (RoV 
                        and Emp), it's time to remove the artificial restrictions 
                        we had to cope with, regarding access to the mobs 
                        because we came to the scene late. Emperor should have 
                        been dead months ago but our 6 attempts were spread 2 
                        months apart. Time to change all that in PoP. It's all 
                        even now.</p>
						<p>Cheers Wraith and Reviviscence! Cheers indeed!!</p>

						<p>Emperor attempt 4. Everything started wrong. We tried 
                        a new strategy which back-fired. Emperor jumped in camp 
                        and a bunch of clerics, shamans, mages and other classes 
                        bit it before the fight even started. From there how we 
                        managed to make even this progress is a testament to the 
                        skills of the wonderful folks I choose to play with. We 
                        never managed to fully recover from the initial mess and 
                        I hope to bring better news next time we go at him 
                        .......... which frustratingly won't happen for a week.</p>

						<p>In other more cheerful news, we've managed to lay 
                        into RoV well and good. Sometimes one wonders whether 
                        the RvR is worth the 4 hour raid until you pick up one 
                        of these gems.</p>

                        (any?) clerics with these on Quellious. Also picked up Master of 
                        Death spell for Nirhtam, Feral Avatar for Lotanz and 
                        other goodies from here and many other farming mobs.

						<p>Emperor attempt 3. The bad news is too much stuff 
                        went wrong with the fight. The clincher being that a add 
                        woke up as one of the four enchanters we had for the 
                        fight lagged out. No excuses. It is a unforgiving fight 
                        in some respects. We'll get some backup enchanters for 
                        next time. </p>

						<p>Since there's not much new to report I thought I 
                        might as well comment on another successful Vulak 
                        beating last night. The significant thing was that it 
                        was by far our smoothest outing. This encounter still is 
                        a wild-ride. Sometimes a bit too intense for 3 and half 
                        hours of non stop action. Still our only source of 
                        Ancient spells and we'll take it. Loot consisted of

						<p>Nothing new to report from never-never-land. Summer's 
                        ended, and had a slight hit in attendance. Didn't affect 
                        much except force us to abort our attempt on Emperor. 2 
                        attempts so far only and we were well-schooled in both 
                        of them. And since you dont see his face plastered here 
                        in a 'horizontal' position, he's not dead yet.</p>
						<p>And the thought of camping more stuff for the next 
                        challenge (Seru weapons, Acrylia keys, VT components) is 
                        enough to make one sick. PoP can't come fast enough. </p>
						<p>We've been doing more than our fair share of farming 
                        though, as one would expect. Same old ssra bosses minus 
                        Emp, AoW, Burrower, RoV, Shei etc. I would have even had 
                        a chance to put a &quot;Flawless Victory&quot; headline for our 
                        recent AoW kill had the puller not inexplicably died on 
                        pull, but we still managed to 1-tank him for the first 
                        time for us. People used to say switching MTs was the 
                        hardest part for AoW. Well, he's a total bore now. Ciao

						<p>For the most part Quellious can be qualified as one 
                        of the most civil servers at the top end. All the top 
                        guilds are in contact with each, discussions are held in 
                        advance to pre-empt spawn disputes and hardly anyone 
                        races another. In this 'Pleasantville' equivalent of EQ 
                        servers we now have a spoiled brat. A new guild, Expoofit, has arrived to 
                        the scene. It's a up-and-coming guild, with a propensity 
                        for Velious kings, and Luclin minors. They also like to 
                        poof AoW and Shei every chance they get, hence the name. 
                        Unfortunately they haven't been blessed with the 
                        maturity to handle spawn disputes. </p>
						<p>Case in point, one late night Wraith/Reviv arrive in 
                        Kael to kill King Tormax. Rel in Por starts moving in as 
                        well and I talked to their guild leader. Apparently they 
                        had been camping him all day and had moved out of Kael 
                        15 or so minutes before he popped. We decided to be 
                        courteous even though we were at the spawn first and let 
                        them go ahead. So as RiP is gearing up, we headed to 
                        Arena to kill Vindicator and to wait to see if RiP would 
                        take down Tormax. Lo and behold, Expoofit decides to 
                        give up on Seru keys for the night (thank god he can't 
                        be poofed) and comes to Kael even though there are TWO 
                        guilds already in the zone for the spawn. At this point, 
                        brought together by a common enemy, Wraith/Reviv and RiP 
                        teamed up to pull Tormax through all of the Expoofit 
                        trains and kill him TWICE as a treacherous bard who will 
                        hereby go unnamed (aka Linaren of Expoofit) casted bard 
                        gate song on King Tormax when he was 10% hp. It was a 
                        lot of fun actually and one can only hope that the 
                        up-and-coming guild Expoofit also picks up some manners 
                        along with better skills in their evovling process.</p>
						<p>On the less dramatic side, we took down RoV again and 
                        picked up some loot along with Mage and Druid nukes for 
                        Kindir and Aguilera. 
                        Also farmed all other mobs you'll expect us to farm, all Ssra except Emp, AoW etc etc. But we also gave some 
                        shots to some new encounters. Here's the key to RoV 
                        fights, mages in unbearably bright lime green robes.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/RoV-mages.jpg" width="400" height="356"></p>
						<p>Finally we tried Emperor Ssraeshza. You don't see a 
                        ss of the dead corpse, hence it didnt go so well. With 
                        the current rotation we have in place with the guild 
                        currently farming him, we only get 1 shot per week on 
                        the spawn pretty much, excluding patches, and we hope to 
                        bring him down within the next few tries. I'll keep you 
                        guys posted if we do any significant damage to him.</p>
						<p>Also, in one of the most fun encounters we have ever 
                        participated, we also tried the Ring of Thule, the 
                        source of the best droppable loot in the game... almost; 
                        since all items in the new CT are droppable. We had an 
                        unbelievable time through RoT. Here's an action shot.</p>

						<p>We actually progrssed pretty far in the fight and 
                        managed to kill Dread and Fright and almost killed 
                        Terror. I hope to soon bring you guys screenshots of 
                        another encounter completed. Here's the loot we picked 
                        up from Dread and Fright respectively, new to the server ofcourse. 
                        The loot is as expected, sub par for the difficulty of 
                        the encounter, but the fun factor of the fight made up 
                        for it.</p>

						<p>
                        Also took down the new THO given the new resist rates 
                        and dot stacking. I must say that this is a most 
                        annoying fight now. One of the worst RvR out there and 
                        not worth the time anymore. Take your usual 3-4 grps for 
                        the fight and you'll have some fun. Although we were 
                        lucky to get unusually good loot (2 wiz nukes, orb and 
                        dagger), the loot table most certainly is not changed. </p>

						<p>Among new encounters we've been learning to take care 
                        of the guards in Emp room on non-loot Blood. Still not 
                        ready for a Emp attempt but our first go should happen 
                        within a fortnight. </p>
						<p>Killed some named in the Ring of Fire (Warlord, 
                        Warmaster etc) but the Underking eluded us. Will revenge 
                        him soon. Must get Ice Comet proccing skull !!!! =)</p>
						<p>Gave the Ring of Vulak a whirl. Got trampled on by 
                        the wave of splitter drakes. Been too busy finishing 
                        keys for Emperor to focus on these other encounters much 
                        but soon enough. Ciao.</p>

						<p>Classic perfect first encounter. Figured out where he 
                        was in the zone. Got to him. Got hit by traps two doors 
                        before (now we know), cleared to his room, saw the 
                        guards in the room, killed them, timed repop, checked 
                        debuffs on them, checked mezzes on them, checked mob 
                        melee, checked mob debuffs, mapped strategy for the

						<p>Cheers Wraith / Reviviscence for three awesome days, 
                        with the third new kill for us. Started with some more farming in Ssra and then word came that Shei Vinitras was up in 
                        Akheva Ruins. We've never had the pleasure of attempting 
                        this fellow before.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/shei-070202.gif" width="450" height="367"></p>
						<p>First try and dead. If you know this encounter you'll 
                        know that if you lose a bunch of folks to him during the 
                        fight, you get lev 60 adds to deal with. Hence any 
                        winning encounter has to be relatively clean, but I must 
                        admit for a first attempt we surpassed our own 
                        expectations. The fight was clean, under control and 
                        remarkably easy, from start to finish. All the hype about this encounter's 
                        difficulty are exaggerations at best, and pure lies to 
                        keep others away at worst.</p>
						<p>Now the reason we went for this encounter was simple, 
                        we hadn't killed him before. But the reward we got was 
                        astonishing and made it all the more worth it. </p>

						<p>Hehhee. If we are going to be treated to more of 
                        these goodies you can bet we'll be back for more. Take 
                        care and make sure you don't miss the fireworks. Later.</p>

						<p>Arrived back in Ssra the day after killing Arch Lich 
                        to find that the basement was up but we were already 
                        beaten to it. Oh well. We have yet to trigger (let alone 
                        attempt) the Glyphed cycle due to availability. I guess 
                        we'll be forced to wait another week for that chance. 
                        But we did find that the Creator had spawned.</p>

						<p>After the Arch Lich this fight was a complete joke, 
                        even though we got the dual weilding version. With 
                        little prior info the mob went down on first try. 
                        Everyone involved had more good time. People are pumped 
                        for more Ssra action, and we are taking action  to 
                        satiate them. Stay tuned for more Ssra adventures and ciao. </p>

                        encounter we didn't even know the way to him. 
                        Everyone truly had a blast through this exhilarating

                        this was enough to get us charged. It's a sign and it's

						<p>Been busy with some stuff here and there. Killed 
                        almost everything outside of Ssra multiple times. Went

                        <img border="0" src="shots/Burrower.jpg" width="300" height="164"></p>
						<p>But came up empty handed. The stupid thing warped 
                        TWICE in 2 tries to the zone. Although we got GM rezzes 
                        it still doesn't insatiate the desire for revenge. </p>
						<p>Also hit Tunare again like we have been when she's up 
                        (Hey, we need our share of phat loots). Enough shots of 
                        corpses, here's one of the fight. As Siran the Lunatic

						<p>Gave the Ring of Fire version 7.32 a whirl and I must 
                        say it's a ton of fun. We were rather overwhelmed with 
                        our minimal damage output. The waves just popped too 
                        fast, so we'll need to come up with some alternative 
                        strats maybe or bring some more ppl than 30. Near the 
                        end we had 20+ mobs mezzed thanks to the presence of 2 
                        members (Alzedo and Einu) of our team of

                        each time and other goodies. I have heard a lot about 
                        how unlike other encounters this one retains its 
                        difficulty even when beaten once..... yeah right. Lost 
                        only 2 folks one time and second time we made mistakes 
                        and still won with less than 10 deaths. Need to get a 
                        lot more lewts so we'll down him a bunch more times. </p>

						<p>Hit Tunare again. Now I don't know exactly if all her 
                        loot items drop equally often but, being in need of 
                        better weapons, we felt very content with our bounty of 
                        the excellent Girdle of Thorns, the

						<p>Finally got another shot at AoW and as you can see we 
                        have our work cut out for us.</p>

						<p>Just got done with the most excruciating run in N ToV. 
                        4 days !!!! How you ask? Each day we killed all the 
                        dragons that WERE up in just about the shortest time 
                        possible. Apparently the guild before us took this long 
                        to crawl through the place. When questioned, they claim 
                        the guild before them are to blame. This rotation is 
                        becoming cumbersome if this is to be repeated. I'm sure 
                        steps will be taken to ensure this doesnt happen again.</p>
						<p>On a more positive note the fights themselves were an 
                        absolute joke, most of them flawless with no deaths. So 
                        the rooted dragons don't warp now, didn't change much. 
                        Vyemm was probably the most fun as our last strat 
                        moderately relied on warping but he didn't prove to be 
                        too much trouble as his pets popped during the fight but 
                        died along with him. Dropped the sweet Graudalek sword.</p>
						<p>Yeah yeah you've seen this ss a billion times on tons 
                        of other guild sites but we were particulary frustrated 
                        on day 4 on waiting for this stuff to pop and executed 
                        our revenge in full force.</p>

						<p>In other news we've just been farming keys in Ssra 
                        and farming mobs in general. Approaching 30 second floor 
                        commanders. No key yet. Creator aka loot heaven lies 
                        beyond our reach still. Ah well atleast we're getting 
                        plenty of rings for Emp keys.</p>

						<p>Earth Mother dead. No long commentary on this one. We knew we could kill 
                        her, we did it. I wasnt there but I&nbsp; heard it went 
                        very smooth. Cheers for Wraith / Reviv !!</p>
						<p>In other news, had a shot at AoW, got him to 70% or 
                        so on first MT and the switch never happened. Great. Oh 
                        well. Live and learn. Cleared Dain, CT, Tormax, Yelinak, 
                        Klan, Zlan, IV, N ToV and etc etc like a gazillion 
                        times. </p>
						<p>A couple of special things happened in NToV, for the 
                        curious minded. 1. We cleared Aary + 2 pets together 
                        along with all the hatchlings in a sweet long fight. Was 
                        fun. 2. We killed the rooted, spellfilter bugged, 
                        irresistible knockback Lord Vyemm in a nearly perfect 
                        fight (4-5 fights deaths at end enrage to... &quot;lag&quot; hehe). 
                        3. We cleared 11 or 12 dragons in a awesome 6 hr burst. </p>
						<p>And yeah, Tanven did irritate me into doing an update 
                        ! =)</p>

						<p>Wraith is killin' stuff, <font color="red"><b>big</b></font> stuff. They be getting loots, <font color="red"><b>nice</b></font> loots. Other than that I got no idea what the hell they are doin' but I figured I could irritate Desi into making a real update.</p>
