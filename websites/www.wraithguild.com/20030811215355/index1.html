      <FONT FACE='Verdana' size="2">
                     <p>I know Desaran did a update on the Rathe event beat down 
                     a few hours ago but I just wanted to add a few thoughts 
                     of my own. The above verses are part of the lovely
                     <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~andavall/Rubaiyat.html">
                     Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</a>, the famous 11th century 
                     Persian mathematician and philosopher, and are a personal 
                     favourite of mine. The verses have multi-context 
                     significance but I bring them up now as their relevance 
                     occurred to me after another long day in Earth B unraveled 
                     at the hands of the most minor of infringements.</p>
                     <p>It's SoE that's playing a game with us, one which is 
                     most asinine in nature. Day after day we come out to 
                     participate and with the ever increasing requirements for 
                     raid strengths, dependence on certain classes, multi-tiered 
                     flagging, it's enough to give one a feeling of despair at 
                     times.......... all of which culminates in a encounter like 
                     the Rathe event.</p>
                     <p>The Rathe Event. Where do I start. Although by any 
                     account we came out of this relatively unscathed making 
                     remarkable progress by killing it in 4 days total since 
                     first trying, each day left some of us so mentally and 
                     physically exhausted it was hard to cheer at the progress 
                     made. Certain aspects of it seemed to be included just to 
                     annoy and irritate like the shadowstep ability. The event 
                     is like building a house of cards and becomes increasingly 
                     precarious as one nears the zenith and as if it wasn't 
                     enough we have to do it outside and be subjected to random 
                     gusts of wind which is what the shadowstep ability is.</p>
                     <p>When the Avatar of Earth finally popped it was a 
                     overwhelming feeling of relief rather than joy that swept 
                     me, even though we did it with more than 3 minutes to 
                     spare. SoE really needs to retune the ridiculousness of 
                     some of these events. Although at 3 and half hours total 
                     that it took us to win was scattered with various delays 
                     and recoveries caused by LDs etc it's still pretty crazy to 
                     design encounters which require non stop concentration for 
                     so long and then put such ridiculous raid strength 
                     requirement on it.</p>
                     <p>So without futher ado, here's something to colour up 
                     this update.</p>
                     <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/AoE-dead.jpg" width="500" height="300"></p>
                     <p>Cheers Wraith and Reviviscence on a truly awesome 
                     accomplishment, the reward of 4 days of grit and 
                     determination, proving yet again the old adage 
                     &quot;Perseverance commands success&quot;. </p>
                       <p>Now it's &quot;Time&quot; for Coirnav. Incidentally I believe 
                       this is a first across all servers, killing Rathe before 
                       Coirnav, which is only a testament to how flawed the 
                       repop timer on the big fish is, moreso on a crowded 
                       server......... but that's a speech for another update, 
                       another day. Ciao.</p>

                           hall, we decided we were not done yet, we proceeded 
                           to Captain Mc'nasty himself, Coirnav, the Avatar of 
                           Water. Impressive encounter to say the least. Very 
                           well tuned and made out, and sure as hell not the

                           well, popping Coirnav on our first attempt with 
                           minimal casualties, not knowing much at all about the 
                           encounter. </p>
                           <p>A few minutes after Coirnav graced us with his 
                           ugly ass presence, we found ourselves in The Plane of

                           fucked the day for myself and the rest of the group. 
                           Seconds later, I see people start zoning in on top of

                           <blockquote>
                           <p>Almost 4 weeks since the last update when we 
                           managed to take down Xegony. Well since then we 
                           decided it was about time to farm Elem planes harder 
                           to gear up a bit. As an example on our kills of 
                           Fennin and Xegony the MT (who didn't die) didn't have 
                           a single item from the elemental planes. Didn't 
                           really stop us much but time to make things a bit 
                           easier on ourselves.</p>
                           <p>Since then we've farmed a lot. Still have yet to 
                           find Coirnav up or get a shot at that bugger, so a 
                           long learning process awaits us (if word of mouth is 
                           to go by). We DID however manage to play with the 
                           bugged rings in Earth a lot. That stupid dusty warder 
                           ring and resetting and bugged Triumvirates (9 at a 
                           time!!) was frustrating but we managed to wade 
                           through the mess and pop the Arbitor. Although I 
                           didn't mind the Peregin and Mudman rings much both 
                           the buggy nature of the dusty warder ring and the 
                           absolute boredem of the vegerog ring kind of gets to 
                           you when we spend 6 hours at a time in the zone. 
                           Arbitor himself happened to give us more trouble than 
                           he was worth, mostly due to our own fault. After 
                           managing to let him depop once and then wipe after 
                           winning (and hence no flags) we finally gave this 
                           lump the beating it deserved and got the majority 
                           flagged for Earth B. Look for more news from the home 
                           of the Rathe as we snag another Arbitor kill.</p>
                           <p align="center">
                           <img border="0" src="shots/arbitor-062803.jpg" width="450" height="401"></p>
                           <p>In the meantime we also managed to learn and take 
                           down the new Innoruuk as well which is only fitting 
                           as Wraith was there to take down Inny 1.0 and Inny 
                           2.0 as server firsts as well. I actually enjoyed this 
                           new fight a lot, especially the first time we went at 
                           it with no prior info. A synopsis of the first 
                           attempt would sound like &quot;Adds&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;and adds&quot;, 
                           &quot;and more adds&quot;, &quot;and more adds..........&quot; ad nauseum. 
                           But we managed to revise the strat for what is pretty 
                           decent RvR especially considering the lack of Plate 
                           BPs to go around and also the relative lack of FT 
                           items in PoP. </p>
                           <p align="center">
                           <img border="0" src="shots/inny-062803.jpg" width="500" height="335"></p>
                           <p>We also managed to spend a fair bit of time in 
                           Plane of Water as well (what good elem farming can be 
                           complete without it) and have been pretty frustrated 
                           by it. Although we managed to score kills on Groihin 
                           the Wise, Hydrotha and Krizik the Mighty, the 
                           absolutely laggy and buggy nature of the zone is 
                           frustrating. It's absolutely ridiculous that soon as 
                           mobs touch a wall they manage to port whoever they 
                           melee to the zone. This has led to a lot of 
                           frustration and we're still unsure on what areas 
                           exactly are bug free. Also attemped this beast twice.</p>
                           <p align="center">
                           <img border="0" src="shots/ofossaa-062803.jpg" width="400" height="231"></p>
                           <p>Ofossaa the Enlightened gave us a pretty thorough 
                           beating in our 2 runs though we got him to like 30% 
                           or so. Pretty ridiculous RvR for this idiot which 
                           explains why he is always up. His time will come and 
                           RvR notwithstanding, he must die once atleast. </p>
                           <p>Our luck (or lack of it) with rogue daggers 
                           continues from the Luclin days (we got 1 khal in 10 
                           Cursed kills and 2 BB in 10+ HP kills). I think our 
                           rogues are ready to throttle some folks as we have 
                           yet to get a Ifir or Gold Runed Mithril Knife in 5 
                           Fennin and 7 Sol Ro kills. Maybe Warlord Gintoklan 
                           will be more kind to us.</p>
                           <p>Also somehow we managed to find Lord Inquisitor 
                           Seru up late night and we also managed to produce a 
                           key. So we proceeded to smack down this guy for a 
                           guild first. The fight was about as anti-climatic as 
                           expected but the RvR was better than expected, again 
                           mostly to the reasons I stated for Inny, as Seru 
                           coughed up a BP, the FT5 ring and his torque. No 
                           wonder he's almost never up. </p>
                           <p>Sprinkle in off hours Ssra / Kael clearings, one 
                           VT run, more backflagging and more comfortable repeat 
                           kills on all elem plane mobs we've killed before 
                           (including another kill of Xegony) and you pretty 
                           much sum up what we've been up to last few weeks. 
                           Hopefully I will have more info on our Coirnav / 
                           Rathe progression as soon as we get to work on them, 
                           which should be happening soon.&nbsp; </p>

                     <blockquote>
                           <p>So after working on the event about a week or so 
                           we finally managed to bring down Xegony. I say 
                           finally because IMO this is a pretty anal encounter. 
                           It's all about executing with an acute attention 
                           span. The fight lasted about an hour for us. Fact is 
                           there's almost no way you can guarantee complete 
                           heals between every round from Xegony for an hour and 
                           2 consecutive bad rounds can kill any tank in the 
                           game. So you have to hope that the healing is on 
                           target and nothing too freakish happens. I guess 
                           that's where gear etc comes in (to increase the 
                           chances of successfully surviving bad rounds and 
                           sustain faster healing indefinitely). All in all it's 
                           definitely a team effort and an encounter we enjoyed 
                           breaking down and conquering. And there was the 
                           familiar rush from another challenged offed.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/Xegony-053103.jpg" width="500" height="209"> </p>
<p>Managed to pick up 2 robes (vests rather) from her and were also lucky to 
pick up some plate legs. I'm sure this encounter will becomes lots simpler as we 
continue to gear up. </p>
<p>In other news we managed to find a lot of mobs up in Fire that we had yet to 
take out and so down they must go. The new versions of Pyonis, birds, generals 
weren't much different. Reparm had been over-rated in some of the boards I read 
and he was definitely a push over. Babnoxis proved to be more interesting but 
still went down without much ado once we adapted our strat a little.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/babnoxis-052003.jpg" width="400" height="210"></p>
<p>The best challenges came from Blazaxx the Omnifiend and Arch Mage Yozanni. 
Arguably both these mobs are harder than Fennin Ro now, atleast that's what I 
thought. Some pretty whacked RvR for sure. Here's a 
<a href="shots/blazaxx-052403-large.jpg">very large pic</a> of Blazaxx in all 
his glory as he taught us a lesson in the earlier run before we managed to best 
him, but barely. Since then we killed him again and more smoothly, though the 
RvR is still pretty whacked compared to almost any other mob in the elem planes, 
except Arch Mage Yozanni.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/blazaxx-052403.jpg" width="400" height="188"></p>
<p>The new Arch Mage Yozanni was a ton of fun to figure out. We tried some 
pretty whacky off-the-road stuff with some hilarious results before we managed 
to put together various elements from all the runs to put him down. The guy is 
absolutely a beast but a very fun fight to learn, adapt and execute. Though he 
went down, his RvR is also pretty out of whack. Definitely a fight that gets 
much easier once you have the right strategy for it. </p>
<p>Also managed to revenge the new Groihin the Wise in Plane of Water, another 
mob with stupid RvR. No wonder he's always left up. Dropped just one item for 
us, the so-so bard lute. Ummmm yeah. What's up with that? Not even 2 loots on 
this stupid mob with 2k quad + ramps + AE of&nbsp; 2kdmg/5sec stun that's pretty 
much unresistable, not to mention the leet ability of all named in Plane of 
Water to port ppl to the zone in or bind spot if they touch a wall at certain 
angles. Fun fun. It's not that he was much hard but the RvR on him is so stupid. 
We'll probably be looking to venture more in Water / Earth in the coming weeks 
(duh) so stay tuned for more updates in that regard. </p>
<p>Also managed to go up to hate late night and took out the new Maestro. He's 
like a Tier 1 PoP mob strength now, maybe slightly weaker, but definitely in the 
same vein (scripted event, low hps, etc etc). Dropped some loot in line with the 
fight, comparable to other Tier 1 PoP drops. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/maestro-052603.jpg" width="400" height="139"></p>
<p>Also took a shot at the new Inny but having no prior info we were taken by 
surprise by what was held in store for us. Blowable events suck. Now that we 
know what to expect from him we'll go back sometime when free to take him down 
atleast once. Hope he drops something decent. </p>
<p>Cheers Wraith/Reviviscene on Xegony! Ciao.</p>
