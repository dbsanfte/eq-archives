It's the dirty little secret big guilds don't want you to know: Vanguard, Saga of Heroes. It's made by the original creators of EverQuest, and it's going to pull in a ton of our players. But don't think about it! Or, let's just see what happens! It can't be THAT bad! Right guys?
<br><br>
Towards the middle of Gates of Discord, and the beginning of Omens of War, lots of guilds suffered due to the EQ2/WoW exodus. Many, mine own included, looked the other way and waited for the impact. Few guilds survived as the very balance of our server shifted. 
<br><br>
Two years later, EverQuest is being faced with the same challenge again, only this time the impact may be even larger. The fact of the matter is, Vanguard is a lot like EverQuest in its early days. And for a lot of people, that means a definite sale. But a lot of us are not done with EverQuest. We've built social ties and lives for ourselves here, on Quellious. To just give that up for a shinier car would be ridiculous.
<br><br>
So why post about this stuff? What does it mean to you?
<br><br>
The fact is, upper tier guilds require a nominal amount of recruits. There will always be turnaround. When an upper tier guild loses a huge chunk of its raiders to a new game, the demand for recruits exceeds the supply. The end result is a bunch of crippled guilds who cannot really function, trying to soak up new hires and gear them quickly... but since they're already crippled, they can't meet the demands of their recruits. It's a horrible cycle and guilds will fall to this, of that there is no doubt.
<br><br>
We are the oldest raiding alliance on this server and we are the ONLY remaining Quellious-birthed endgame raid force. We have a long and rich history here, and we have no intension of letting go of any of that. We plan to proactively recruit and gear up brand new excited players before any catastrophic event has a chance to hurt us. We will do this by making ourselves more attractive to recruits, in order to topple the competition. Here's the quick facts:
<br><br>

<b>Wraith Offers</b><br>
Non-mandatory raiding. - In the hospital? We're not going to kick you.<br>
Bonuses for high attendance. - You'd be amazed how many 90%+ attendees we have.<br>
Publicly viewable points system. - Can't cheat in a house of glass.<br>
Tank rebates! - Tanks receive a rebate on the gear they buy based on their attendance. Goodbye paper!<br>
Super fun atmosphere. - Have you seen our site? C'mon.<br>
Very respectable leadership. - Ever hear of xxx officer going off on yyy member? Not here.<br>
Fraternity. - We do guild Vegas trips... what more can I say?<br>
<br><br>

<b>New Tags</b><br>
New tags receive a 200 point signing bonus.<br>
New tags normally see a 2.0 orb their very first Anguish raid.<br>
New tags normally see Anguish (Demiplane and sometimes DK) gear their first tagged raids.<br>
New tags can take advantage of our DoN/GoD point-free farms, and /random for easy upgrades.<br>
New tags will all receive guild help getting keyed.<br>
<br><br>
In ADDITION to all of that, we're going to make extra efforts to gear/key any new recruit that gets accepted in the near future. Remember, a normal recruitment period is 1-2 weeks. We don't make you wait months like the other guys. The more you raid, the faster you get tagged.
<br><br>
So, if you feel like shifting your EverQuest experience to the next level, see zones and monsters you've never seen before, and join a family that stands to help you achieve your goals in the game, we'd love to have you aboard.
