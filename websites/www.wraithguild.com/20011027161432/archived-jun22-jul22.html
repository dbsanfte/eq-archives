Look for Lord Gimpinak to fall very very soon.&nbsp;</p>							<p>The reason we had to delay our Yelinak attempt was that Dain decided to visit Quellious, and had to be promptly taken down.

Absolutely bull-dozed through VP. Kick ass fun.&nbsp;</p>							<p>The few people in PoM have been busy and the +50 DR buff, +50 PR buff, +50 CR buff flowers have been completed. Also the first decent piece to be completed would be this nice bracer by our very haaarny monkey, Sizare.

Or supposedly. We personally had more problems with Hoshkar. Phara died, despite Complete Healing herself, with only 1 or 2 casualties. And if there is any dragon that drops good loot consistenly in Veeshan's Peak, it's Phara Dar. We were lucky to get the rare <a href="shots/PharaDar-Robe-AzureSky.jpg" target="_top">Robe of the Azure Sky</a>, the second on the server, and I cant thank the guild enough for choosing me to be worthy of it. In other drops Boldair was awarded the sweet <a href="shots/PharaDar-Shroud-Veeshan.jpg" target="_top">shroud</a>, Dachunker the <a href="shots/PharaDar-Claw.jpg" target="_top">claw</a>, and Jagg the <a href="shots/PharaDar-Katana-FlowingWater.jpg" target="_top">katana</a>.&nbsp;</p>							<p>Thus concluded the successful raid put together by Thuulsa and Jagg, though the intent at zoning in was to just try Silverwing, with few expectations. After VP was cleared, Thuulsa appropriately responded.</p>						</div>						<center>							<p><img border="0" src="shots/Thuulsa-raid-comment.jpg" width="444" height="18"></p>						</center>						<div align="left">							<p>It was a wonderful weekend and Veeshan's Peak's dragons will die again, and again, till we have all the items we need from them. Good day folks.</p>							<h3><font color="red" size="4">Veeshan's Peak - Day 1 - Desi, June 24th, 2001</font></h3>							<p>In a surprise move 3 days ago, Thuulsa and Jagg started brewing a plan to take the 24 of us who did have VP keys to VP to make an attempt on Silverwing. Lo and behold, in a chain reaction, a lot of keys magically started getting completed and 33 of us and 3-4 invites zoned into VP, mostly for the first time today. Some of us had been waiting for this for a while, and excitement was at an all time high, with few knowing what to expect.&nbsp;</p>							<p><i>Rest in peace - Silverwing</i></p>						</div>						<center>							<p>&nbsp;<a href="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="158"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Silverwing-062401-loot.jpg" width="119" height="135"></p>						</center>						<div align="left">							<p>Our first meeting was with the dragon we originally had planned to slay. To our delight the enounter was easier than expected, and only added to the excitement of the first slaying in VP for us.

Another <a href="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead2.jpg" target="_top">shot</a> of the dead enchanter. Having dealt with Silverwing earlier than expected we decided to try the dreaded Hoshgate, I mean Hoshkar.</p>							<p><i>Rest in Peace - Hoshkar</i></p>						</div>						<center>							<p><a href="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="249"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Hoshkar-062401-loot.jpg" width="119" height="231"></p>						</center>						<div align="left">							<p>Not an easy encounter and it took us a few attempts at him, but perseverance paid off in the end. Hoshkar fell to our excited cheers and the beneficiaries included Thelon for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-burning-robe.jpg" target="_top">robe</a>, Kiliam for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-shissar-apothic-staff.jpg" target="_top">staff</a>, Talen for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-blade-fallingstars.jpg" target="_top">blade</a>, and Jagg for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-Veldrak-shortblade.jpg" target="_top">shortblade</a>.

March on, ofcourse. A majority of the rest of the time was spent figuring out the pulls for the other dragons and Druushk did survive an attempt on him. With fervor still running high in the gang, I'm optimistic I'll bring more good news tomorrow. Wraith will exit VP legitimately on their first trip, I promise.
