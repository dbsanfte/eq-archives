                        <p>&nbsp;Sorry for no updates friends. I've been extremely 
                        busy and I'm afraid this update will be brief for now. I 
                        might spruce it up later. </p>
						</div>
						<div align="left">
                        <p>So what have we been upto. Well actually we're 
                        waiting for our friends in Reviv to finish up their ToV 
                        farming so that they can switch faction to Giant as well 
                        so we can kill some dragons. Soon enough =)</p>
						</div>
						<div align="left">
                        <p>But in the meantime, we managed to wax Rhag 1 and 
                        Rhag 2 for a bunch of much needed lev 60 SoL spells as 
                        well as gave the Ring of Fire a go. We were doing great 
                        with almost no deaths, killed 4th boss, halfway to make 
                        5th pop and somehow the quest inexplicably stops even 
                        though we had people in the ring. Oh well. We'll get him 
                        next time. </p>
						</div>
						<div align="left">
                        <p>A bunch of ToV farming besides this, and that pretty 
                        much wraps it up for now. Ciao </p>

                        <p>&nbsp;So we decided to go to Kael knowing that the 
                        Statue had already been killed. After all Vindicator was 
                        as much a learning experience as any other mob. We all 
                        get to Kael, pull Mr. Derakor and after some 4-5 min of 
                        some admittedly pretty messy stuff Vindicator was dead. 
                        Hopefully now that we have waxed him once we will do it 
                        more smoothly next time =) </p>

                        fun for everyone involved (atleast I hope it was) and an 
                        eye-openner as well. Sontalak &gt; Wraith =) .... for now.</p>

                        Va'dyn's been miserly with us giving shit loot and no

                        <p>Got together fast for Velk when he heard the Gimp was

                        (about 40) and least deaths too 5-10. We're getting 
                        there =) The great news is Velk dropped possibly one of 
                        the best loots ever including a wiz robe for Sandy, enc 
                        rod for Alzedo, Velk book for Nandaben and Shield for

                        Considering we had only 1 wiz and almost noone had 
                        fought Gore before I was a bit worried. But still we 
                        triumphed, though it was a long fight as we just meleed

                        <p>Yeah Yeah! We killed the gimp again, the drops (as 
                        expected) werent too good but it was good practice for 
                        some of the new members. We got ANOTHER necro bracer 
                        (2/2 now) and the recipient was Tada. Also got the

                        lifetap proc. The fight with Va'Dyn turned out to be a 
                        lot more exciting than&nbsp; anticipated as he brought 
                        all his friends with him, around 7-8 unmezzable mobs

                        we were falling asleep. Routine stuff. Was a pretty 
                        successful trip with almost everyone getting something,

                        too =) Actually we didnt do all that bad but it's good 
                        to laugh about it =) Was a good experience for everyone

                        tagged members and i believe an equally grand showing of
                        20 Reviv members and laid the smackdown on Velketor the
                        Gimp. I believe the experience was particularly
                        satisfying since this was the first raid of it's calibre
                        for the vast majority of the people present there. The
                        loot went to Niruhtam (the excellent necro bracer), Tada
                        (necro ring) and Doleiron (caster bracer), along with a
