      <p>Uqua was a delight to play in a learn, a very fun and zone to raid in, 
      with just the right amount of emphasis on all sorts of skills for any 
      raiding guild to be tested in, be it debuffing, crowd control, raid speed, 
      split-encounters, and ofcourse the all important tanking, healing and agro 
      management.</p>


      <p>If Uqua is an example of the challenges that lie ahead in Gates of 
      Discord and more in Omens of War, with more twists and turns and and 
      unique events, we have a bunch of very fun months coming up! Stay tuned 
      for Qvic and Inktuta updates. Ciao.</p>

      <p>We've started raiding in Uqua and contrary to all expectations we've 
      found the zone a ton of fun. </p>


      <p>To all the guilds who beta-tested it last few months and then got 
      frustrated or even quit, Thank You! We're enjoying the fruits of your 
      labors and are having a fantastic time in the place.</p>


      <p>We haven't been in Uqua for too long but have managed to get atleast

      <p>We've re-opened recruiting recently after a 2 month hiatus. We 
      feel we've trimmed down sufficiently from the PoP raid sizes to the ones 
      needed in GoD now to recruit a few active players who want to see high-end 
      EQ and want to raid in GoD.</p>


      <p>Ofcourse, we do like to be guilded with like-minded people. So if you 
      do not like to raid, do not know your class well, do not like to play with 
      skilled players,

      <p>Yes that's the name of the Robin Hood spoof movie but it also happens 
      to be the name of the Wraith / Reviviscence super-group in City of Heroes. 
      I want to give a shout out to all old-timers, inactive and ex-W/R players 
      who I know still check up on this site now and then to hook up with some
      <a href="http://www.menintights.org/">old pals</a> if they are playing or 
      planning to play City of Heroes. I haven't played it, nor am planning to, 
      but apparently these guys have been having some fun. </p>


      <p>Was kind of funny to hear the first thing in /raid chat after Enraged

      <p>The new and improved Keeper of the Altar fell. Ikkinz Raid 4 is a 
      pretty fun and balanced raid now and we enjoyed the event though are still 
      perplexed by the long lockout timers (they're afraid we'll farm too much 
      loot?)</p>

      <p>These 3 below on the otherhand were much more straightforward fights,

      the door to access these primals) so it resets when someone who has 
      triggered and answered a few questions (wrong) and leaves haflway - so we 
      don't get nasty surprises like we did. The spawned golems on incorrect 
      answer had zonewide agro! Ahem! My apologies to Explicit who were merely 
      clearing to Uqua on the otherside of the zone and wiped to those 
      ass-kicking golems.</p>

      <p>Due to the national shortage of juice boxes, I will keep this update short and sweet (more short than sweet). <BR> Quarm dies.. Yay!</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/QuarmDead3.jpg" width="516" height="467"> </p>
      <p>The picture below was taken very shortly after the 4 headed pound puppy died.</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/QuarmDead1.jpg" width="458" height="199"></p>
      <p>If you look closely, you will see Rurark stripping his clothes off.  Being an astute observer, it was obvious he was suffering from a case of "Dawgeth Corpus" or which is better known as "puppy love".  There was only one thing to do, and we had to act quickly.  We took the very last juice box from the Wraith/Rev reserve and we proceeded to hose Rurark down.  The "holy juice box", as it has been dubbed, saved Wraith/Reviv this most horrific event, that was about to take place. </p>
	<BR>
	<p> Anyway, we are all coping with this current state of juice affairs.  The tree suicide rate has jumped dramatically. This is due to Druids being less prone to tree-hugging, due to the ill-mood this juice box drought has brought to Druids. Also suffering, from
    ill-mooded casters, are wizard's familiars.  Quesci’s Familiar was quoted as saying “I hope this juice box shortage end’s soon.  I am not sure how much more of her
    *****ing I can take”. </p>
<BR><p>This national juice box shortage has taken its toll, but there is a glimmer of hope.  We have inside information that in the depths of
      Kodtaz, there is the mother of all juice reserves.  That’s right, there has been visual confirmation that there are multiple kegs of
      Cherry-lime-ade being guarded deep with-in Kodtaz.  As you would expect
      Wraith/Revivience has gone full tilt on getting flagged for, as we come to call it, "the promise land". Hopefully, we will soon have the force to liberate the oppressed juice.  Stay Tuned.

      <p><img border="0" src="shots/CTsm.jpg" width="488" height="559"></p>
      <p> Then all Hell broke loose.. Arariana asked for a rod in chat.. Rurark and Branoic, who most likely had 1 too many juice boxes,  both wanted to give her a rod.. Mages are known for their fiery temper, so it was no surprise that this situtation soon came to fist-a-cuffs. Because of this, the raid ended and both mages lost their juice box privileges..  But the next night, Bertox fell relatively easily and then Rallos Zek was in our sights </p>

      <p> I am officially renaming "Rallos Zek the Warlord" to "Rallos Zek the Snow Angel". Anyway, we gave Inny a try but we ran out of time..  We left time with only Inny and the 4 head dog still breathing... Till next time!</P> <BR>Viva Wraith/Reviv !!!
