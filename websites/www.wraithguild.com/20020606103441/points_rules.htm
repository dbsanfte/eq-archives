<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What is Points system?</font></b></p>
<p>'Points System' is a system shamelessly cloned from
BotS. These points are awarded to each individual as they attend a guild raid.
The current Points of each member reflects his or her priority for loot.
Essentially, the eligibility of a guild member for an item based on raid
attendance is now quantified by your Points standing. Officers can make 
discretionary decisions where following the Points system does not make sense, 
including awarding loot to twinks, or 1 member bidding for someone not present 
there. In most cases the person with the highest points wins the item and loses 
a Points amount that reflects the value of the item.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What is the benefit of Points?</font></b></p>
<p>Points allows for an unbiased comparison between guild
members when decisions about loot are to be made based on attendance and recent
items that have been awarded. Eligibility is determined by the highest current Points
among those interested in the item.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What negative effect will the Points system have?</font></b></p>
<p>The implementation of Points will never properly reflect
past contributions over the 2 years of the existence of the guild. As such, it
is a tool to help award loot, but ultimately the decision lies with Wraith/Reviv 
officers. As time
progresses, Points will be more reliable, and become the dominant method of loot
distribution.<br>
<br>
Because each item costs Points points, members cannot equip
their secondary characters at the expense of the guild
without it affecting their Points standing. If an item drops that a member is not
willing to pay for, it will rot. The ramifications are three-fold: items that
would have helped a member will rot, members will hoard Points points for items
they want, and members will think more carefully about showing interest in
items.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How are raid values determined?</font></b></p>
<p>The incoming Points points and the outgoing Points points
must be equal to control inflation. However, the effort involved in an encounter
is not always reflected in the loot. Dain will always drop a head, but his other
loots are random, and so is the number of attendees. One Dain encounter could
easily be worth quite a bit more than the next if a straight value of (total
item Points / # attendees) was used to determine that raid value.<br>
</p>
<p>Instead, an average value is used, and values are
adjusted accordingly for the difficulty of an encounter and the available
needed drops. Encounters such as Klandicar and Sontalak are assured to drop no 
loot, so they cannot be worth Points. However, Points is still awarded for such 
encounters, and failed raids, because it reflects the effort of members. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How are item values determined?</font></b></p>
An item value is set to properly reflect the amount of
active raiding required to earn that item. There are a few guidelines used to
determine this value:
<ul>
  <li>Whether or not the item can be traded.
  <li>The classes that can use the item.
  <li>Usefulness of an item, including its stats and
    versatility.
  <li>Rarity of an item.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Who do I contact in case of any issues with the Points?</font></b></p>
<p>Any Issues with Points should
be Directed to Desi (Biffins) in game or mailed to him at <a href="mailto:murghkhor@yahoo.com">murghkhor@yahoo.com</a>.
Alternatively you can also contact Alzedo. Only Alzedo and Desi
will manage the official record. Also you only have 5 Days from the
posting of a Point Sheet to report errors. After 5 days it is considered correct
and will not be fixed (no exceptions).</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What if I arrive late ?&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p>Everyone present at the time of the kill will get full
points. In some cases (PoF clearing, Chardok clearing to royals, Clearing
defenders before dragons in NToV, etc) pre-clearings will have separate points.
If someone is repeatedly showing up just before a mob is killed, action might be
taken against that person.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What if I play 2 PCs or someone else's character out of
necessity?</font></b></p>
<p>Points will be awarded to the
person NOT the character. So it doesn't matter which char you are playing (for
instance someone else's character due to necessity) or playing 2 PCs etc.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">What about spell drops and drops to 
complete quests for keyed dungeons?</font></b></p>

<p>All Spells and Keys will be distributed 
based on officer award method. No points will be spent for these items.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Are there any special bonuses to points?</b></font></p>

<p>First time kills of non-epic mobs results in a one-time double point bonus.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about failed Raids?</b></font></p>

<p>Failed raids will get half the value of the mob.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about recruits?</b></font></p>

<p>As of now recruits do not get any points for attending raids. This might 
change in future</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>What about costs for items not in the database?</b></font></p>

<p>New items dropping, which aren't in database, will be given points on the 
fly, and this value might be later retroactively changed (though if it's 
increased, it wont be increased by much) on further evaluation.</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">How will points be handled for
Reviviscence people ?</font></b></p>

<p>All Reviviscence members will get the same points
for attending raids as Wraith people and can bid on the same items. Reviviscence
members also need to track attendance on any raid (such as spur of the moment
epic raids, with small numbers) and inform Alzedo or Desi about
it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Who informs the other guild about raids ?</font></b></p>

<p>Everyone must remain on the raid channel all the time. It is moderated and 
will not increase spam. It's only used during raids or to announce any future 
raids.</p>
