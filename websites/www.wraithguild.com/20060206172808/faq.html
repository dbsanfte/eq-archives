Q: What’s up?
<BR>
A: The sky and other tall things.

<BR><BR>

Q: So what’s the deal?
<BR>
A: Yeah, we don’t know either.

<BR><BR>

Q: No, seriously. What the hell is the deal with your news section?
<BR>
A: Oh, that. Hmm, how can I put this…

<BR><BR>

Q: Uh… hello?

<BR>
A: What was that? Sorry… I got distracted.

<BR><BR>

Q: You don’t seem very bright.
<BR>
A: 

<BR><BR>

Q: Did you hear me?

<BR>
A: Yes.

<BR><BR>

Q: Then why didn’t you respond? I insulted you!
<BR>
A: Was your insult a question?


<BR><BR>

Q: No.
<BR>
A: Well there you go.

<BR><BR>

Q: I want to recruit with Wraith. Where do I start?
<BR>
A: You could start by not insulting me. That really hurt my feelings. =*( !!!1!11


<BR><BR>

Q: Are you serious?
<BR>
A: Huh? Sorry… got distracted again.

<BR><BR>

Q: Are all of you guys like this IRL?
<BR>
A: Like what?

<BR><BR>

Q: Think you’re all Jedi and crap?
<BR>
A: No. We’re those losers that stand in line for Star Wars movies all decked out in Jedi gear.

<BR><BR>

Q: Seriously?
<BR>
A: Not really. We’re actually those kids in middle school that used to dunk you in the toilet. After years of counseling and therapy, we were able to accept ourselves and our mistakes as being part of the overall life cycle. Since then, we’ve emotionally restructured and found a new calling in life: EverQuest.

<BR><BR>

Q: Are you seriously leading Quellious?
<BR>

A: Yes.

<BR><BR>

Q: But I looked on EQRankings.com and other guilds have members that are better geared than yours. What gives?
<BR>
A: If all we owned were a Short sword* and 2 rations, we’d still consider ourselves number one.

<BR><BR>

Q: Why?

<BR>
A: Ego.

<BR><BR>

Q: Ego?
<BR>
A: The one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.

<BR><BR>

Q: One of your members trained me, stole my group’s named, and then said in OOC that I was “a girlyman with a nice ass.” What do I do?
<BR>
A: Oh, it’s really important not to blow it at this stage of the relationship. Just take it easy, and don’t come on too strong, be delicate but retain your masculinity. And always remember to be yourself!

<BR><BR>

Q: Who is Reviviscence?
<BR>
A: Reviviscence is a guild. They’re a good guild. A kind guild. A fair guild. Maybe, even a sexy guild.


<BR><BR>

Q: Why are you guys always hanging out?
<BR>
A: Oh that. We’re not serious, just seeing each other off and on. It’s an open relationship.

<BR><BR>

Q: Why do you guys raid together all the time?

<BR>
A: Why do you want to know? What’s with the 20 questions?

<BR><BR>

Q: I'm just curious.
<BR>
A: YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR DISTANCE BUDDY, IF YOU KNOW WHAT’S GOOD FOR YOU!

<BR><BR>

Q: Who hosts / pays for this site?
<BR>
A: No idea.

<BR><BR>

Q: Do you guys hate the other uber guilds on the server?
<BR>
A: Not really. It’s fun to tease them. A little healthy competition never hurt anybody.


<BR><BR>

Q: Will you guys buff me for free, even when I'm in a different zone, and you’re busy doing something more important?
<BR>
A: Absolutely. It’s the only reason we play this game. 

<BR><BR>

Q: Who did you guys vote for in the last presidential election?
<BR>

A: Nader.

<BR><BR>

Q: If you were a food, what food would you be?
<BR>
A: Hmm. That’s pretty hard. OH! Those Peep things! You know those little marshmallow things they have around Easter? Those are awesome.

<BR><BR>

Q: What are the recruitment requirements for my class?
<BR>
A: Check out the Forums, under the Recruitment Desk.

<BR><BR>

Q: Is Raalf in Wraith?
<BR>
A: Yes.

<BR><BR>

Q: Why does he have corpses everywhere?
<BR>
A: We’re all very superstitious. Every time Raalf gets a tingle behind his right <strike>testicle</strike> ear, he swallows his tongue. It’s all standard stuff really.

<BR><BR>

Q: What’s on all those corpses?
<BR>
A: Candy.

<BR><BR>
 

Q: Are you getting tired of my questions yet?
<BR>
A: Absolutely not. Want some buffs?



<BR><BR>

Q: Alright dude, I’ve gotta go do some RL stuff now.
<BR>
A: Sure sure.

<BR><BR>

Q: Later man.

<BR>
A: Love, peace and chicken grease G’dawg.
