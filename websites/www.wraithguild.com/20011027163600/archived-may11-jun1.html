The agro control was good and the clerics did well, but our main tank got out of heal range due to AE so the fight was tougher than it needed to be. Cazic was too miserly to drop his halo or brain but he did drop his <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/eyeofcazicthule.html" target="_top">Eye</a> with the flowing thought effect.

Considering how boring camping can be, we all had a pretty good time, helped by the fact that it was our best day there with hardly a wipeout and a LOT of drops. Now if we could only get enough gems to keep up with this drop rate.</font></p>						</div>						<div align="left">							<p><font size="3">Did Chardok yesterday as quickly as we could, 3 more Kings, 2 more Queens. I think we all hate this zone so much, because waiting for the next King / Queen can be soooooooo boring. And the loot from royals (besides the epic pieces) has one of the worst reward/effort ratio, probably matched only by Velketor the Gimp (no references to Disruptor) himself.
