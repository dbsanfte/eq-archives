						<p>Tried him a few times and mapped some strats out. 
                        Finally repopped today and Arch Lich is dead on the 4th 
                        day of our first try when we were so ignorant of the 
                        encounter we didn't even know the way to him. 
                        Everyone truly had a blast through this exhilarating 
                        fight. Just another step forward and the first one we took to 
                        announce our arrival in the famed Temple of Ssraeshza. 
                        Cheers Wraith / Reviviscence !! </p>

						<p>Commander Zheroz No. 40+ puts it out finally. And to 
                        make sure the moment sustains a sense of irony, we got 2 
                        in a row...... after 3 months of waiting. It felt as if 
                        this was enough to get us charged. It's a sign and it's 
                        time. Expect a LOT more Ssra news coming up. </p>

						<p>Been busy with some stuff here and there. Killed 
                        almost everything outside of Ssra multiple times. Went 
                        into the depths a few times..............</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/Burrower.jpg" width="300" height="164"></p>
						<p>But came up empty handed. The stupid thing warped 
                        TWICE in 2 tries to the zone. Although we got GM rezzes 
                        it still doesn't insatiate the desire for revenge. </p>
						<p>Also hit Tunare again like we have been when she's up 
                        (Hey, we need our share of phat loots). Enough shots of 
                        corpses, here's one of the fight. As Siran the Lunatic 
                        once said, &quot;Be one with the wall.....................&quot;</p>

                        <img border="0" src="shots/tunare.jpg" width="400" height="190"></p>
						<p>Gave the Ring of Fire version 7.32 a whirl and I must 
                        say it's a ton of fun. We were rather overwhelmed with 
                        our minimal damage output. The waves just popped too 
                        fast, so we'll need to come up with some alternative 
                        strats maybe or bring some more ppl than 30. Near the 
                        end we had 20+ mobs mezzed thanks to the presence of 2 
                        members (Alzedo and Einu) of our team of 
                        mega-enchanters.</p>

                        <img border="0" src="shots/RoF1.jpg" width="500" height="247"></p>
						<p>Killed the AoW two more times. Got a Blade of Carnage 
                        each time and other goodies. I have heard a lot about 
                        how unlike other encounters this one retains its 
                        difficulty even when beaten once..... yeah right. Lost 
                        only 2 folks one time and second time we made mistakes 
                        and still won with less than 10 deaths. Need to get a 
                        lot more lewts so we'll down him a bunch more times. </p>
						<p>Now I present to you the Battle of the Wannabe 
                        Gnomes. In the green corner, the wannabe gnome.... 
                        Alzedo</p>

                        Gimlik</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/gimlik.jpg" width="400" height="285"></p>
						<p>Alzedo won this round though, and got phat lewts in 
                        the process as the wannabe-saved gnome gave up some nice 
                        rewards............. perhaps the only earring of its 
                        kind on the server. Woot Rumuk.</p>

						<p>Got him to 30 on our last 2 tries and suddenly, the 
                        skies parted, the sun shone and the path was clear. 
                        Everyone knew their role and when the idol went down 
                        unslowed with no deaths we knew the time had come. 
                        Pulled AoW, clean switches,&nbsp; 5-10 deaths total, and 
                        down he went as Wraith / Reviviscence took another step 
                        forward.&nbsp; I swear there is a gossip channel with 
                        someone from every guild on the server in it getting 
                        constant hp updates because as soon as he died it seemed 
                        the whole server knew as congratulations started pouring 
                        in literally seconds after. Or not, since we weren't 
                        supposed to be ready to kill him yet. Just need to wrap 
                        up 2 outstanding issues, Shei and Burrower, before we 
                        greet our counterparts in the temple in the grey. We 
                        seem to continue to surprise everyone but ourselves. 
                        It's a sweet feeling. Ciao.</p>

                        Nothing new - Desi</b></font></p>
						<p>Just got done with the most excruciating run in N ToV. 
                        4 days !!!! How you ask? Each day we killed all the 
                        dragons that WERE up in just about the shortest time 
                        possible. Apparently the guild before us took this long 
                        to crawl through the place. When questioned, they claim 
                        the guild before them are to blame. This rotation is 
                        becoming cumbersome if this is to be repeated. I'm sure 
                        steps will be taken to ensure this doesnt happen again.</p>
						<p>On a more positive note the fights themselves were an 
                        absolute joke, most of them flawless with no deaths. So 
                        the rooted dragons don't warp now, didn't change much. 
                        Vyemm was probably the most fun as our last strat 
                        moderately relied on warping but he didn't prove to be 
                        too much trouble as his pets popped during the fight but 
                        died along with him. Dropped the sweet Graudalek sword.</p>
						<p>Yeah yeah you've seen this ss a billion times on tons 
                        of other guild sites but we were particulary frustrated 
                        on day 4 on waiting for this stuff to pop and executed 
                        our revenge in full force.</p>

                        fun. 2. We killed the rooted, spellfilter bugged, 
                        irresistible knockback Lord Vyemm in a nearly perfect 
                        fight (4-5 fights deaths at end enrage to... &quot;lag&quot; hehe). 
                        3. We cleared 11 or 12 dragons in a awesome 6 hr burst. </p>

						<p>Well, an update wasn't justified. We haven't done much. Same old, same old. Multiples kills of N TOV, Cazic, Yelinak, Tormax, Dain, IV, THO, VP, etc. When we do manage to do something new or take the next step .......... like Tunare or Burrower or AoW or Shei I'll post the update.

						<p>So we finished our trek in N ToV, well almost. We were unable to best Vyemm. Thanks to /serverfilter not working anymore and his warping tactics. But we did come awfully close.</p>

He has since been buffed, but that turned out to be a non-issue. I believe the last of Wraith's resurrection effects have worn off.&nbsp; There are only 2 mobs that I can think of that we attempted back then and since returning haven't returned the favor, only due to availability. I'll mention those tidbits in due time as well. A dose of history now and then!

Saying 'zero deaths' on him is probably a given for any half decent effort. Anyway, atleast for today his loot was gimp even for his difficulty. 1 wiz only staff and 4 spells. lol !

						<p>It was midnight, but Sontalak was up !! And the most screwy risk-reward ratio mob in existence couldnt dispell the slow on him !!!! Thanks disease counters !!

						<p>So it was past midnight but there were 2 more dragons up nearby, so why not. CoH'ed to Telk, quick easy kill. Didnt drop anything too interesting that I recall. We then decided to whack Gozz too and were CoH'ing to the West ToV drop off point to clear to Gozz when I used my leet Gimp-ShowEQ (aka Halfling looking through wall bug) and saw a action packed shot with so many interesting observations that I decided to post it here.

						<p>So patch day came about. Huge patch. And you know what that means. Yes. We all knew there will soon be a patch to fix the patch. Unfortunately noone expected that patch to come 2 hours after servers were up. Pathetic. Why not just announce a 14 hour patch in the first place instead of making ppl wait with no ETA.</p>
						<p>So we logged on and guess what. The most absolute bizarre and unexpected of things happened. It was a complete shock. STATUE WAS UP !! and NOONE IN KAEL !! Whoa !! so we ran over to finally get a shot at him. Had yet to kill him this time around. Was glad that people got in the groove relatively fast (relative to well.... someone slower, hehehe). Vindi dropped BP for Lotanz and Statue dropped BP for Revenger, Hammer for Shihhan and Scroll for Nysa.</p>
						<p>So we also wanted to try the much talked about pull spot. First conceived by some smart tacticians in a guild called <a href="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml">Blood of the Spider</a> in Rathe almost a year ago for their Statue and later AoW kills. Later posted by <a href="http://www.fohguild.org">Fires of Heavens</a> in a ss on their website in their 44 man kill. Scroll down and you'll see it. Sorry I didn't take any screenshots (you can also see the pull spot in <a href="http://www.lotuscult.com">LC</a> and <a href="http://www.vismaior.net">VM's</a> websites for their AoW kills). Needless to say, the pull spot makes the Statue encounter beyond trivial. It was the fastest we've killed him since we first did him on the server 9 months ago. Any decent 4 grp effort can kill Statue in that spot. We had a bad pull, he warped to camp, killed 6-7 ppl, MT got hold of him, never died and no deaths after that.</p>
						<p>Headed to Ssraa after that, killed Rhag2. Got the nice Smoldeshank weapon, the crap and inexplicable Druid root proc sword (which rotted) and some spells.</p>
						<p>Quick trip to Umbral Plains after that late night netted some so-so loot from Zaelthiniwhatever and Rumblecrush.</p>

					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Apparently Trakannon was ganked a few times for obvious reason (No it's not the BPs). Also these guys got together for Klandicar again tonight as he popped, in apparently one super easy victory, without my 2-boxing clerics too ! Excellent news !! If mobs like Klandicar are becoming routine (resulting in the title) it's time to keep upping the potential and see what lies ahead. After all, we do want to raise the skill further and I believe Klandicar becomes trivial at 225 =)</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Also Gorenaire was dropped as well in one the shortest fight possible without mana burn using this super strategy: Someone trigger the AE, rush in kill to the point where she starts CHing without even the first AE goes off, finish her before the CH ends casting. 15-20 sec fight. Apparently Trakannon also died without an AE going off, fun fun.</p>

					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Now to the good stuff. So we returned to Sleeper's Tomb after the patch day played havoc with us. 2 more rogues made a world of difference quite. Pulled Master of the Guard and he died in less than 10 min instead of 25. 2HB primal for Droz. Cleared the way to the Progenitor and maintained the streak of a new mob for us every few days =) Kind of. Well Progenitor was a fun kill. He is by far the biggest non-dragon mob I've seen dwarfing the likes of Statue / PoG Trees etc and simply the tallest mob I have seen so far, period. Alzedo's direcharmed pet hit for 291 (hasted ofcourse) and ate all rampages, hehehe which made things easier than expected. And he had the goods too. Primal Spear for Nemekis. Congrats.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>In other news Trakannon and and Talendor and Ragefire were killed today. So technically the new Ragefire was another new mob for us. Hehehehe ok I'm stratching this first-timer thing.

					<div align="left">
						<p>When I sat down to write this update I wanted to somehow sum up how long some of us have waited for this moment and how much it meant to us. Besides the thrill of the exciting fight itself, there was closure finally for something that a lot have referred to as unfinished business. In our first real try at Sontalak this time around we finally took care of it in our 2nd attempt. Our army of non-epicced melee mowed down this meanie in a relatively clean fight. After we gave him one go, and came close, we refined our strategy and nailed this idiot through and through. 30 Wraith, 20 Reviv and 1 dead dragon. Anyone who has fought this mob would be nothing but impressed given our numbers, our armor and most importantly our weapons. People are learning fast and I am extremely proud to say we are finally coming into our own. All Hail Wraith - Reviviscence !</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Before we dropped Sontalak we got together for another Klandicar kill. In retrospect, Klandicar might even be a slightly more difficult encounter than Sontalak in light of our excellent strat on Sontalak. But like I said before Sontalak will hold a special place for Wraith-Reviv's brief history this time around. We've surpassed our expectations, achieving first timers for us on almost a daily basis. We're not taking a detour for armor farming in ToV or epic completions. We're just mowing them down with our limited numbers, even more limited equipment and seemingly limitless enthusiasm and sensibilities =) Best example would be that tonight after we lost 10 melee and 2 clerics after the loss in the first attempt to Sontalak I proposed calling it a night, but I pretty much got vetoed by everyone there who urged me to try the new refined strategy and ultimately resulted in our victory. We're beginning to believe............ and it's a great feeling =)<br>

					<div align="left">
						<p>So we decided that we had just about enough waiting (well some of us have been waiting 8 months, hehe) and decided to get on with times and see what Sleeper had waiting for us. 7 folks from Wraith / Reviv zoned in, some 2-boxed, and proceeded to participate in one of the most lengthy fights of my career, 25 minutes in which Gurunt used his defensive 3 times. End result: Master of the Guard dead. My first Statue kill, incidentally first on server, was a lengthy 18 minutes, first Vulak kill (with VM) incidentally also first on server, was an equally lengthy 21 minutes. Tonight's fight with Motg was certainly of a different nature but hardly less thrilling. Only fight longer (and definitely the most boring of this set) was the mindless 80 min killing of Bristlebane in PoM, lol also the first on server. So what did Motg put out? Actually we were extremely lucky, since we got only the most rare drop in ST now besides the stupid scale. Yes folks, I refer to none other than the elusive Primal Bow. So what happens to bows with no rangers present? Rogues get to make out. Grats Jagg.</p>

						<p>What a ride ! So Klandicar popped. You can read our exploits of our besting of this beast below in the last update when we, despite Puvil's evil strategies, won in a relatively messy fight. We went again and after some craziness executed pretty much as good an attempt as a raid with limited experience and a hoard of non-60 melees holding weapons like Defiance and stuff and mostly pre-ToV armor could =) Most definitely it was our most supreme effort on a mob of this caliber and all present there shared in my excitement with our improvement. I think there were no deaths till Klandicar was 30% or so and ~15 deaths of the ~55 man effort after that, all of them to the unresistable AE since the fight kept going on and on and on like the Energizer Bunny ~ 4 min !!! and 15+ AEs. Dmg output still too low. Oh well, the tides are turning =)&nbsp; Congrats Lotanz on the ST Key</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>One indication of this was the constant Myga PH clearing finally bearing fruit and Sandyilie is now the proud holder of another Dragonsbane. DB-able Dragons, beware.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Also cleared the Rhags for some spells and minor loot at some point. Finished some epics and waxed Servitor / Va'dyn as they popped with whoever was present. Pretty humble accomplishments. Then again, so was Klandicar =) Everything is relative. Just put in context, that starting the guild from scratch our first raids of Velketor and Gorenaire were only 5-6 weeks ago, the easy besting of Klandicar gives tons of inspiration for lots of good stuff to come.</p>

					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>10th War - Part Deux. So after our last mess with the 10th War we had learnt our lessons..... or so we hoped. We went again today with infact fewer people. ~30 Wraith , ~15 Reviv and after a out of control start with more Dwarves killing us than Giants we took a hold of things and never looked back. Only 1 hero died and the end result was Gurunt getting his ring (congrats man), Clavendale the Lance of Uber Taunt, Shamson the Helm of Uber Envy, Elof the earring (Fear the DA shaman), and Heio the Eye. Everyone had a blast. I'm sure there are more of these in the horizon.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Klandicar - Part Deux. So Klandicar had humiliated us pretty badly in our last go at him. We rearranged the strategy a little and voila, death to the ugliest dragon in existence. Although there were those (Puvil) who tried to foil the uber strategy by pushing the dragon up the wall !!</p>
					</div>

						<p>But it seems despite our best efforts to try and muck it up we won ! Probably our hardest encounter yet and a really sweet victory because of it. Dropped a Matchless BP for Nemekis and ST Key for Lunara. BTW Puvil wasnt at raid, but I bet that's what he would have said was he there =)</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Also decided to try Gozzrem in West Wing. Had ~35-40 ppl and had a total blast. We still need better weapons though. Given it's got 100k more hp now ~250 total, the fight still went on far too long, probably 8 min. Actually with the dragon being perma-rooted it's actually fun to go to it's lair to gank it. Desaran (62k dmg from banes) observing his spoils here. Loots include Eye of Rigatorn for Dupri, and Cloaks of something for Leetah and Genix.</p>

						<p>Also killed Zlandicar again as it popped. Rather uneventful (besides my train, so we wont dwell on this kill tonight). Cowl to Droz, Frak Tali to Faippo, ST Key to Alzedo, Zlan Heart to Doleiron etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">

						<p>My apologies again for the long delay since the last update. I've been rather swamped with work again and updating points (which btw are now updated) is taking precedence and is more time-consuming that I had imagined.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>We gave Lendinara the Keeper a shot yesterday. Well, we need better connections for one. 150 ppl in zone and lag sucked. We also need better damage output, forget primals, ppl need to finish epics, lol. So this was our first go on a AE / positioning type mob and I was pleasantly surprised how fast people picked up. First try sucked. we had about 55 ppl, 5-10 went LD, most of the rest were lagging, dragon was in the casters, positioning sucked and we only got her to 40. Second try we had 35 ppl better lag, perfect positioning, Main tank held agro and stayed alive for 6-7 min (including disc) before clerics started going oom ( more rods plz ) and she was only at 50% hp !!! Yes after 6-7 min atleast. Hmmm.......... we need ppl to level up some and get better weapons !! In progress now ! =) All in all it was a great run, everyone had a blast, especially the last attempt and people picked up on the strat incredibly fast. Soon with some more levels and better gear she'll go down.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>We also got around to heading up the Plane of Air for some serious blade farming. And when I say serious I mean serious. ~8 hours, 51 Spiroc Lords, 13 blades. I think that pretty much puts to rest any contention on how often the blade drops. The sample size is large enough. It's 25%. The 13 un-epicced warriors were (in no particular order) Heio, Puvil, Puresmoke, Rumuk, Revenger, Tunset, Vortok, Torros, Ragnarz, Timok, Cabat, Inges (Pinga), Naje. And yes it sucked doing this boring crap. We were just way too exhausted to continue to I7 for crown farming but that too is looming in the horizon at some point. Also picked up 2 necro epics cloaks (grats Niruhtam and Vilenn) and finished Anyelle's Paladin FA. On Isle 4 all evil PCs got wiped due to Inadequate Research aka Anyelle =) Here's a pic of the marathon Spiroc Lord action.</p>

						<p>Also downed the old hag Zlandicar sometime last week. I wasnt around to witness the fun but I heard it was an easy kill. Stay tuned for more Zlan farming in the weeks to come.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>We finally got around to triggering the 10th Ring War for Gurunt and I must admit, it is as much a blast as everyone who has participated in it before has raved about. Truly an event everyone should participate in atleast once. Not to be missed. It was our first time with little prior info. Our start messed up, our forces divided. Yet we managed to get to the last sub-wave of the third wave before Narandi spawns. Next time we will no doubt fare better, and I will hopefully be the harbinger of good news. I think this pic aptly depicts how confused the situation was most of the times.</p>

					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>I have been really busy during the past week at work and also in EQ due to setting up the Wraiths points system so my apologies for no updates earlier and the small one now.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Did a bunch of stuff in the past week including epics mobs, a bunch of Va'dyns, ToV farming, and stuff. Va'dyn's been miserly with us giving shit loot and no spells so nothing to post about him.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Got together fast for Velk when he heard the Gimp was up and brought him down with our lowest numers so far (about 40) and least deaths too 5-10. We're getting there =) The great news is Velk dropped possibly one of the best loots ever including a wiz robe for Sandy, enc rod for Alzedo, Velk book for Nandaben and Shield for Genix. And guess what ? He didnt fall in the wall this time !!!</p>

					<div align="left">
						<p>After grabbing Ragefire for Satinsister (woot) we headed to DL to meet the dragon Gorenaire. Considering we had only 1 wiz and almost noone had fought Gore before I was a bit worried. But still we triumphed, though it was a long fight as we just meleed her down through the CHs !!</p>

					<div align="left">
						<p>Loot consisted of a bunch of spells and 2 Paladin books, awarded to Anyelle and Skoria and a stupid bard horn.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Sorry no more quotes for now till I get the points system rolling properly. Still sucking too much of my time =) Later.</p>

					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Yeah Yeah! We killed the gimp again, the drops (as expected) werent too good but it was good practice for some of the new members. We got ANOTHER necro bracer (2/2 now) and the recipient was Tada. Also got the excellent <a href="shots/Velk-book.jpg">Velk Book</a> for Phypher and some sword for Heio.</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>After Velketor we went to go kill Va'Dyn in Akheva to get some SoL 60 spells. Along with the spell we also got a pretty sweet 16/28 monk / bst weapon with a 75 pt lifetap proc. The fight with Va'Dyn turned out to be a lot more exciting than&nbsp; anticipated as he brought all his friends with him, around 7-8 unmezzable mobs plus 4-5 mezzable mobs.&nbsp;</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>On Saturday we spend the day farming ToV. Nothing too exciting. Broke in. Sat in octagon room and farmed till we were falling asleep. Routine stuff. Was a pretty successful trip with almost everyone getting something, especially plenty of plate for once =)</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>Earlier we made an attempt on Vindicator and got our first thrashing of 2002, YEAY !! I think that's an event too =) Actually we didnt do all that bad but it's good to laugh about it =) Was a good experience for everyone there for sure.&nbsp;</p>
