          Yelinak - Desi. July 22nd, 2001</font></H3>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>What a rush ! Wraith faced Lord Yelinak today for the
          first time and unfortuantely due to time constraints we only managed
          to give this sucker one try, but we did manage to get him to about 30.
          Look for Lord Gimpinak to fall very very soon.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The reason we had to delay our Yelinak attempt was that
          Dain decided to visit Quellious, and had to be promptly taken down.
          Grats Jagg and Yasungaa on this excellent <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/frostreaversveliumcrown.jpg">crowns</a>,
          Guelah on the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/aegisofice.jpg">shield</a>,
          and Havusin on the head for this mediocre <a href="shots/beltofdwarfslaying.jpg">belt</a>.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Earlier we slapped Gorenaire at some point when I was
          MIA and then cleared VP again for more phat lewts. The highlights, all
          of these new loots for us, included this awesome right-click DMF <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/Advers_stats.jpg">robe</a>
          for Maylay, sweet <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/rilecrown.jpg">crown</a>
          for Nineveh, <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/greysuedeboots.jpg">boots</a>
          for Droz, and many other items. Absolutely bull-dozed through VP. Kick
          ass fun.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The few people in PoM have been busy and the +50 DR
          buff, +50 PR buff, +50 CR buff flowers have been completed. Also the
          first decent piece to be completed would be this nice bracer by our
          very haaarny monkey, Sizare. Most others are still working hard on the
          extremely tedious and random class specific armor items.&nbsp;</p>

          Kriezn and Vulak'Aerr and blazed through. Ok we didn't kill any of
          them....... yet, but Wraith did manage to score the first entry into
          the Plane of Mischief. Yeay!! And the first entrant from Quellious

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The zone is actually far more fun than we had
          anticipated, bringing the small game feeling back to EQ which used to

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>For the first time we confronted the dual wielding
          Statue of Rallos Zek; and after a long battle and many casualties, our
          perseverance brought us triumph. Imagine the absolute delight to find
          this on the corpse.&nbsp;</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Woot !! Grats Gurunt and Mandrax on the BPs and
          Dachunker and Ghenghis on the blades.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Ofcourse we had to drop the Gimpicator before the
          getting the phat loot from the Statue fight. Congrats to Redlance on
          the <a href="shots/Vindicator-Chestplate.jpg">BP</a>. Head was looted
          for multi-questing later.</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Earlier we had finished 2 fantastic days of farming in
          ToV. Gathering 1 Plate BP (Clawgrip), 4 Chain BPs (Talen, Batuda, Jagg,
          Galaad), 2 Leather BPs (Growls, Kendall) and 2 Robes (Draja, Burl) as
          well as, proportionally, a gazillion other drops.</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>It was meant to be an exp week. We were supposed to sit
          back and relax. For one reason or another, there was always some mob
          up for us to go kill next =)</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Gimpicator died again. Statue followed soon after.
          Gimpicator dropped his <a href="shots/Vindicator-Chestplate.jpg">BP</a>
          while Statue dropped his second <a href="shots/Statue-BP-Eradication-new.jpg">BP</a>
          for us, the wonderful <a href="shots/Statue-Iron-Scroll-War-new.jpg">scroll</a>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Thursday we heard Kael was brought down and we promptly
          headed over to get more Statue loot, unfortunately, after we killed
          Gimpicator we found no signs of the Statue and were informed that the
          GMs had poofed him, sigh.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Yesterday we decided to get more VP gear. VP was cleared
          of all dragons except Phara Dar yesterday and Phara was promptly
          killed today while the rest off the day was taken off. As usual,
          plenty of notable drops from VP including <a href="shots/Nexona-Nightfall.jpg">nightfall</a>,
          <a href="shots/Xygox-wiz-robe.jpg">wiz robe</a>, <a href="shots/PharaDar-Shroud-Veeshan.jpg">shrouds</a>
          etc etc. Sorry no details in this small update. I'll get more next

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Seems like it's been ages since the last update. My
          apologies. I have been incredibly busy.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>After that super patch day, we were are all rudely
          brought back from our euphoria by a thrashing from the new re-buffed
          Cazic Thule. We've re-worked our strategy now, and he'll fall in our
          next meeting, promise.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Servers were brought down again Friday morning, so we
          headed out to get some more of the upgraded phat loot from the Statue.
          Ofcourse, this fool must fall before we get to the statue.&nbsp;</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Again a relatively easy, and exhilarating fight. Statue
          fights are fun, indeed. No BP but still this <a href="shots/Statue-Hammer.jpg">hammer</a>

          respective slots. Lets hope Laffy doesn't click away the Expendable
          scroll this time.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>After the Kael Drakkel adventures, we headed over to VP since
          these guys still need to hand over a lot of loot yet. Dropped
          Silverwing and Hoshkar before we camped for the night.&nbsp; Hoshkar
          went down easily this time, despite fewer people. Goes to show when
          you kill a mob once, it becomes easier.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Silverwing-062901-small.jpg" width="200" height="145">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Silverwing dropped 2 of these excellent <a href="shots/Silverwing-scimitar-lifestealing.jpg"> scimitars</a> for
          Clawgrip and Dachunker along with this <a href="shots/Silverwing-blueflower-katana.jpg">katana</a>. Hoshkar still was too
          measely to drop his shoes but guess what he did drop. Complete
          surprise for us.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Hoshkar-Green-scale.jpg" width="213" height="73"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The absolute last place you could have imagined for the
          new source of green dragon scales. Yeay. No more Sev camping, Thank
          God ! He also dropped the mage <a href="shots/Hoshkar-burning-robe.jpg">robe</a>,
          a <a href="shots/Hoshkar-Shissar-Elementalist.jpg">wiz staff</a> and
          this <a href="shots/Hoshkar-Fatestealer.jpg">orb</a>.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Next day we pulled up the rest of the dragons. We got
          them down pretty fast, but can be even faster. First 2 to go were
          Xygoz and Druushk.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Xygox-062901-small.jpg" width="200" height="134">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img border="0" src="shots/Druushk-062901-small.jpg" width="200" height="121"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Xygoz's loot included a <a href="shots/Xygox-spear-constriction.jpg">spear</a>,
          a short <a href="shots/Xygox-Razor-Sharp-Sword.jpg">sword</a> and a <a href="shots/Xygox-Frozen-Zweihandler.jpg">2-hander</a>.
          While Druushk finally dropped something other than necro staffs, which
          incuded this <a href="shots/Druushk-Shissar-Focus.jpg">enc staff</a>,
          this <a href="shots/Druushk-Katana-Endurance.jpg">katana</a>, short <a href="shots/Druushk-Veridix-Shortsword.jpg">sword</a>
          and <a href="shots/Druushk-Maelstorm.jpg">Maelstrom</a>. Dont rememebr
          who got what in VP, so shoot me. Too many drops.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Nexona-062901-small.jpg" width="200" height="123">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img border="0" src="shots/PharaDar-062901-small.jpg" width="200" height="95"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Nexona, and Phara Dar were the last to go. Nexona went
          down easier with better resist info this time. And lo and behold, he
          dropped the superb <a href="shots/Nexona-Bo-Staff-Trorsmang.jpg">Bo
          Staff of Trosmang</a>, and not one, but 2 !! to make 2 monks very
          happy. Grats Droz and Sizare. Nexona also dropped the excellent <a href="shots/Nexona-Nightfall.jpg">Nightfall</a>
          and this <a href="shots/Nexona-Howling-Cutlass.jpg">cutlass</a>. While
          Phara dropped another <a href="shots/PharaDar-Shroud-Veeshan.jpg">shroud</a>,
          <a href="shots/PharaDar-Claw.jpg">claw</a> and <a href="shots/PharaDar-Katana-FlowingWater.jpg">katana</a>.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>After all that raiding, we should technically have gone
          to sleep. But hearing that Dain is up, how could we sleep peacefully.
          We gathered late and gave the ugly one-eyed dwarf the smacking he
          deserved. Posted enough pics of him already. He dropped his head for
          the great <a href="shots/beltofdwarfslaying%20copy.jpg">belt</a> for
          Annalyse, this <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/ringofwinter.jpg">ring</a>,
          the awesome <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/frostreaversveliumcrown.jpg">crown</a>
          and this <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/frostreaver.jpg">axe</a>.
          Bah, forgot who got what. Does it matter? =)</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Sunday, we had a go at Sontalak, the mean dragon who
          guards the entrance to the Temple of Veeshan. Still undefeated on the
          server he overwhelmed us by the tremendous damage potential he
          possessed, although he did go to his lowest HP on the server to like
          25ish. I promise his next run-in with Wraith will end in his demise.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Warmest welcome to Kalsto, Choppa and Zenfe to the
          guild. No patch in sight so we're planning on taking it easy the next
          few days.</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>PATCH DAY !!</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Yes, yes, that means all mobs are up, and must be taken
          down in turn. The day started with some sweet surprises. All our
          Ikatiar loots had been upgraded, as were our Vindicator and Statue
          loots. Ketel's <a href="shots/Statue-BP-Eradication.jpg" target="_top">BP
          of Eradication</a> from the Statue yesterday has been upgraded to a
          monstrous 55AC, 20Sta, 100hp, 10cha, 15dex, 15agi, 15str, +8 all
          resists. Woot !! The loot of the day from yesterday made even more
          Uber. Similarly Galaad's <a href="shots/poison-tunic-ikatiar.jpg" target="_top">old
          BP</a> from Ikatiar has been given a massive boost to 48 AC + tons of
          stats, not a resist gear anymore.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>What a whirlwind tour of a day. We used massive Zerg
          tactics and bannable exploits to kill Dain, Velketor, Vindicator, and
          the Statue in a 6 hr period <img border="0" src="imgs/smiley.gif" width="14" height="14">
          Yeah, right. As Clawgrip puts it &quot;It's just our mad skillzzzz&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>First up today was Dain.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/dain-062701-dead.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/dain-062701-dead-small.jpg" width="300" height="224"></a></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The one-eyed dwarf is always a fun one to kill. Either
          he's been nerfed or we're suddenly all swinging harder, but he died in
          half the time he usually does *shrug* Grats to Batuda on the head for
          the uber <a href="shots/beltofdwarfslaying%20copy.jpg" target="_top">belt</a>.
          Laverius and Lyiriel on the <a target="_top" href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/ringofwinter.jpg">rings</a>,
          Tunset on the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/frostreaver.jpg" target="_top">Axe</a>,
          and Talen on <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/tripplatedgoldenhacklehammer.jpg" target="_top">hammer</a>.
          We moved to Velketor after this, having never killed him before.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Velk-062701-dead.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Velk-062701-dead-small.jpg" width="300" height="280"></a></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Ok, sue me for not getting a better shot, but he feel
          into the wall with only his boot sticking out. You can also click to
          see a larger pic, but I doubt you'll see anything more. I figured
          since it's our first kill, I should post some screenshot. Very fun
          fight. Dropped a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/crystalcrownofconfusion.gif" target="_top">crown</a>
          for Alzedo, his <a href="shots/Velk-book.jpg" target="_top">book</a>
          for Cascow, a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/boneringofcondemnation.jpg">ring</a>
          for Disruptor, and <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/silverswordofyalrek.jpg">sword</a>
          for Tunset. After this we decided to move back to Kael again.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Vindicator-062701-dead1.jpg"><img border="0" src="shots/Vindicator-062701-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="206"></a></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Our cleanest and fastest attempt on this fool. Dropped
          his <a href="shots/Vindicator-Chestplate.jpg" target="_top">BP</a> for
          Tunset and head for Kendall's <a href="everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/gloves_earthcrafting.jpg" target="_top">gloves</a>.
          It was getting late for the Euros, so we rushed and pulled the Statue

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>1100 Melee and 500k hp notwithstanding, we owned this
          bad boy with no deaths. Dont ask me how the rogues and rangers
          survived when he enraged. New and upgraded loot today. The stats speak for themselves. Laffy
          must be kicking himself since his hand-held only, +10 int <a href="shots/Statue-Iron-Scroll-War.jpg" target="_top">crap
          item</a> from yesterday (which poofed) is now a 35 AC, +10 int, +50
          mana RANGE item. hehehe We'll get you a new one friend, dont worry.
          Grats burl on <a href="shots/Statue-Iron-Scroll-War-new.jpg" target="_top">scroll</a>,
          now dont use those charges. Droz won a great <a href="shots/Statue-Hammer.jpg" target="_top">hammer</a>,
          galaad a sweet <a href="shots/Statue-Cloak-FallingStars-new.jpg" target="_top">cloak</a>,
          and hurtun got a new <a href="shots/Statue-Reaver.jpg" target="_top">toy</a>
          to play with.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Lord Dojo was quickly wrecked late into the night and
          the idiot still didnt drop his turbin. More crap loot, boots and
          stone. Sorry no links. Beleive me it's crap.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>See you all more fun under Norrath's sun tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>For the first time on Quellious, the mighty Avatar of
          War (still undefeated across all servers) was spawned. He popped after
          Wraith dropped this bad boy, The Statue of Rallos Zek, his first
          demise on Quellious</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Statue-062601.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Statue-062601-small.jpg" width="300" height="192"></a></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Despite meleeing for 1100 and carrying 500k + HP, 33
          Wraith + 4 invites were able to drop this sucker in a absolutely exhilarating
          and thrilling 18 min fight. The loot was fantastic. Drop of the day
          was this sweet cloak.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Statue-Cloak-FallingStars.jpg" width="332" height="126">&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Grats Anercar. Other sweet loot included this <a href="shots/Statue-Swiftblade-Zek.jpg" target="_top">sword</a>,
          awarded to Gurunt, and a <a href="shots/Statue-BP-Eradication.jpg" target="_top">BP</a>
          awarded to Ketel. BTW the <a href="shots/Statue-BP-Eradication.jpg" target="_top">BP</a>'s
          AC has been upgraded this patch to 55 !! which makes it the second
          highest AC item in the game, second only to the Warrior Kael BP. Woot
          Ketel. He also dropped a crap item, <a href="shots/Statue-Iron-Scroll-War.jpg" target="_top">scroll</a>,
          which Laughter picked up. The stupid expendable tag also meant the
          item poofed as soon as he used the 2 charges. It was a crap item
          anyway. You can sense of anticipation in the guild these days. We've
          just been on a roll lately with minimal forces. Ofcourse, before you
          get to the Statue, you have to drop this fool.</p>

          <p ALIGN=LEFT>After we learnt to pull him most efficiently last visit,
          we just steam rolled past him. He dropped his head for Aguilera to
          complete these Uber <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/gloves_earthcrafting.jpg" target="_top">gloves</a>,
          as well as his much desired <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ss/bootsofthevindicator.jpg" target="_top">boots</a>
          for Havusin.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Earlier we managed to gather for a quick (30 sec approx)
          kill of Trakannon, about 70-80 min from zone in to port out. I'm not
          posting a screenshot of this idiot anymore. There are enough of them
          on this page and elsewhere. He dropped a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/elder_bp.jpg" target="_top">ES

          Desi. June 25th, 2001</font></H3>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>What a wonderful, wonderful day it turned out to be. A
          great day for Wraith and for Quellious. Today, Wraith became the
          second guild in Quellious to clear Veeshan's Peak, clearing the other
          4 dragons, Xygoz, Druushk, Nexona, and Phara Dar. 4 attempts, 4 dead
          dragons. The day started with a great sense of
          anticipation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in peace - Xygoz</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Xygox-062501-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Xygox-062501-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="161"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Xygox-062501-loot.jpg" width="117" height="133"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>The first pull today was of the golden dragon, with the
          much talked about AoE Silence spell. Definitely the easiest dragon in
          VP, it was a fun fight. Samsonn and Batuda managed to land the <a href="shots/Xygox-spear-constriction.jpg" target="_top">spears</a>
          and Faie won the <a href="shots/Xygox-malevolent-runeblade.jpg" target="_top">blade</a>.
          Another <a href="shots/Xygox-062501-dead2.jpg" target="_top">shot</a>
          of him.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in peace - Druushk</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Druushk-062501-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Druushk-062501-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="224"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Druushk-062501-loot.jpg" width="119" height="134"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>On to Druushk, who had wiped us once the night before.
          His 1700 pt AE hurts, but the nukers had his number. Our shortest
          fight in the peak, the idiot had the audacity to drop not one, not
          two, but three necro <a href="shots/Druushk-Shissar-Deathspeaker.jpg" target="_top">staffs.</a>
          Grats Disruptor, Maylay and the destroy button.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in peace - Nexona</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Nexona-062501-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Nexona-062501-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="192"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Nexona-062501-loot.jpg" width="117" height="135"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>We forgive the pull team for the excruciatingly long
          wait in getting this dragon, for it's death rejuvinated us for the
          Phara attempt. We downed the mob on first go as well despite the fact
          that incorrect resist info caused a lot of casualties. The raid
          leaders can be forgiven for the lack of research. This was a
          Silverwing only raid after all <img border="0" src="imgs/smiley.gif" width="14" height="14">
          Congrats to Easier on the <a href="shots/Nexona-Howling-Cutlass.jpg" target="_top">cutlass</a>,
          Spellquestor on the <a href="shots/Nexona-Blackstone-Maul.jpg" target="_top">maul</a>,
          and Gurunt on the <a href="shots/Nexona-Star-of-Guardian.jpg" target="_top">star.</a>&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in peace - Phara Dar</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/PharaDar-062501-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/PharaDar-062501-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="136"></a><img border="0" src="shots/PharaDar-062501-loot.jpg" width="116" height="134"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>And ofcourse, last, but certainly not least, the hardest
          dragon in Veeshan's Peak. Or supposedly. We personally had more
          problems with Hoshkar. Phara died, despite Complete Healing herself,
          with only 1 or 2 casualties. And if there is any dragon that drops
          good loot consistenly in Veeshan's Peak, it's Phara Dar. We were lucky
          to get the rare <a href="shots/PharaDar-Robe-AzureSky.jpg" target="_top">Robe
          of the Azure Sky</a>, the second on the server, and I cant thank the guild enough for choosing me to
          be worthy of it. In other drops Boldair was awarded the sweet <a href="shots/PharaDar-Shroud-Veeshan.jpg" target="_top">shroud</a>,
          Dachunker the <a href="shots/PharaDar-Claw.jpg" target="_top">claw</a>,
          and Jagg the <a href="shots/PharaDar-Katana-FlowingWater.jpg" target="_top">katana</a>.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Thus concluded the successful raid put together by
          Thuulsa and Jagg, though the intent at zoning in was to just try
          Silverwing, with few expectations. After VP was cleared, Thuulsa
          appropriately responded.</p>
          <p ALIGN=center><img border="0" src="shots/Thuulsa-raid-comment.jpg" width="444" height="18"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>It was a wonderful weekend and Veeshan's Peak's dragons
          will die again, and again, till we have all the items we need from
          them. Good day folks.</p>
          <H3 ALIGN=LEFT><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Veeshan's Peak - Day 1 -
          Desi, June 24th, 2001</font></H3>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>In a surprise move 3 days ago, Thuulsa and Jagg started
          brewing a plan to take the 24 of us who did have VP keys to VP to make
          an attempt on Silverwing. Lo and behold, in a chain reaction, a lot of
          keys magically started getting completed and 33 of us and 3-4 invites
          zoned into VP, mostly for the first time today. Some of us had been
          waiting for this for a while, and excitement was at an all time high,
          with few knowing what to expect.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in peace - Silverwing</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center>&nbsp;<a href="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="158"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Silverwing-062401-loot.jpg" width="119" height="135"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Our first meeting was with the dragon we originally had
          planned to slay. To our delight the enounter was easier than expected,
          and only added to the excitement of the first slaying in VP for us.
          Congrats to Thuulsa and Batuda on the <a href="shots/Silverwing-dragornborn-hammer.jpg" target="_top">hammers</a>
          Talen on the <a href="shots/Silverwing-dragonclaw-gauche.jpg" target="_top">claw</a>
          and Lacor on the <a href="shots/Silverwing-blueflower-katana.jpg" target="_top">Katana</a>.
          Another <a href="shots/Silverwing-062401-dead2.jpg" target="_top">shot</a>
          of the dead enchanter. Having dealt with Silverwing earlier than
          expected we decided to try the dreaded Hoshgate, I mean Hoshkar.</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT><i>Rest in Peace - Hoshkar</i></p>
          <p ALIGN=center><a href="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead1.jpg" target="_top"><img border="0" src="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead1-small.jpg" width="300" height="249"></a><img border="0" src="shots/Hoshkar-062401-loot.jpg" width="119" height="231"></p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Not an easy encounter and it took us a few attempts at
          him, but perseverance paid off in the end. Hoshkar fell to our excited
          cheers and the beneficiaries included Thelon for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-burning-robe.jpg" target="_top">robe</a>,
          Kiliam for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-shissar-apothic-staff.jpg" target="_top">staff</a>,
          Talen for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-blade-fallingstars.jpg" target="_top">blade</a>,
          and Jagg for the <a href="shots/Hoshkar-Veldrak-shortblade.jpg" target="_top">shortblade</a>.
          More shots - <a href="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead2.jpg" target="_top">1</a>,
          <a href="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead3.jpg" target="_top">2</a>, <a href="shots/Hoshkar-062401-dead4.jpg" target="_top">3</a>.&nbsp;</p>
          <p ALIGN=LEFT>Already achieving more than we had hoped for, what were
          we to do now. March on, ofcourse. A majority of the rest of the time
          was spent figuring out the pulls for the other dragons and Druushk did
          survive an attempt on him. With fervor still running high in the gang,
          I'm optimistic I'll bring more good news tomorrow. Wraith will exit VP
          legitimately on their first trip, I promise. Ciao.</p>
