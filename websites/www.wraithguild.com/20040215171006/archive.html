          <p>Being as though our last Rathe kill was almost exactly 3 months ago, we were a little rusty on the encounter. With lots and lots of new faces, in fact, upwards of 40 people who had never even seen this encounter before, we knew we had our work cut out for us. The summer of 03 really took a huge toll. With a couple huge game titles released, lots of players feeling the usual July-August burnout syndrome, a fairly large chunk of the W/R officers taking leave of absences, vacations, the new school/college year beginning, etc., etc., it just seemed like time dragged major ass. Even after Coirnav went down, given the structure of this flagging system, we knew our work was far from over.</p> 
          <p>In a 3 day crunch, with over half the attendance not having any experience with this encounter at all, we completely owned it in around 3 hours. All those long, late night, snoozefest backflagging raids seemed worth it. </p>

          <p>We brought our A-Game and the traditional Wraith/Rev perseverance paid off yet again.&nbsp; I was very impressed with the way so many people showed up ready to learn one of the hardest encounters in the game. Given our very lenient uber-guild/alliance posture, non-mandatory raids and huge casual player crew, we've proved again we can accomplish anything the die-hard&nbsp; strict raiding guilds can. Many good updates to follow, as we press on to meet a multi-headed dragon somewhere in Plane of Time B.</p>

        <p>Question: Of each elemental god encounter, which one did SOE put the least amount of thought into?</p> 
        <p>Answer: What is Coirnav, The fagatard of Water.</p> 
        <p>So whats Wraith/Rev been up to lately, no updates, nothing new. Well, besides waiting for blowable encounters to spawn, we've been kicking it back and doing some ever-so- boring farming for the bling bling. Blowable spawns are rediculous, and you'd have thought Verant learned this back in the Emperor Ssra days. Oh well, wishfull thinking. </p> 
        <p>On our recent attempt on Coirnav, (4), we goofed some pulling, almost made up for it but lacked the strength to trod threw the last thick fog of shit the encounter creates. Needless to say, we are still learning this encounter and we will be jumping around like complete dickheads with fried calamari in hand much sooner then later.</p> 
        <p>Let me sum up some of the highlights of our thumb-twiddlingfest.</p> 
        <p>I voted not to kill it.</p>

      <blockquote> <FONT FACE='Verdana' size="2"> 
        <p>I know Desaran did a update on the Rathe event beat down a few hours ago but I just wanted to add a few thoughts of my own. The above verses are part of the lovely <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~andavall/Rubaiyat.html"> Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</a>, the famous 11th century Persian mathematician and philosopher, and are a personal favourite of mine. The verses have multi-context significance but I bring them up now as their relevance occurred to me after another long day in Earth B unraveled at the hands of the most minor of infringements.</p> 
        <p>It's SoE that's playing a game with us, one which is most asinine in nature. Day after day we come out to participate and with the ever increasing requirements for raid strengths, dependence on certain classes, multi-tiered flagging, it's enough to give one a feeling of despair at times.......... all of which culminates in a encounter like the Rathe event.</p> 
        <p>The Rathe Event. Where do I start. Although by any account we came out of this relatively unscathed making remarkable progress by killing it in 4 days total since first trying, each day left some of us so mentally and physically exhausted it was hard to cheer at the progress made. Certain aspects of it seemed to be included just to annoy and irritate like the shadowstep ability. The event is like building a house of cards and becomes increasingly precarious as one nears the zenith and as if it wasn't enough we have to do it outside and be subjected to random gusts of wind which is what the shadowstep ability is.</p> 
        <p>When the Avatar of Earth finally popped it was a overwhelming feeling of relief rather than joy that swept me, even though we did it with more than 3 minutes to spare. SoE really needs to retune the ridiculousness of some of these events. Although at 3 and half hours total that it took us to win was scattered with various delays and recoveries caused by LDs etc it's still pretty crazy to design encounters which require non stop concentration for so long and then put such ridiculous raid strength requirement on it.</p> 
        <p>So without futher ado, here's something to colour up this update.</p> 
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/AoE-dead.jpg" width="500" height="300"></p> 
        <p>Cheers Wraith and Reviviscence on a truly awesome accomplishment, the reward of 4 days of grit and determination, proving yet again the old adage &quot;Perseverance commands success&quot;. </p> 
        <p>Now it's &quot;Time&quot; for Coirnav. Incidentally I believe this is a first across all servers, killing Rathe before Coirnav, which is only a testament to how flawed the repop timer on the big fish is, moreso on a crowded server......... but that's a speech for another update, another day. Ciao.</p>

None of those screenshot quotes of inter-guild stupidity, stalkers and wannabe's, screenshots of loot you've seen one million times, and all that other who-gives-a-shit stuff at the bottom of every guilds webpage update that you have just grown to hate. /bow</p> 
        <p>We've been doing the same old, same old pretty much. Putting the same mobs on stretchers over and over, gearing up our brethren for the obstacles ahead. Sound interesting? Has farming ever been? Well, when you defeat an encounter you never have before it seems to spark a lot of peoples interest. </p>

        <p>After choosing Tictacs as opposed to DPS, we utterly wiped the floor with this guy. We had trouble getting an ambulance to him, we were all jumping and screaming like complete dickheads. </p> 
        <p>So, after some of the most fucking pathetic RvR I've seen to date, and with a big fish just down the hall, we decided we were not done yet, we proceeded to Captain Mc'nasty himself, Coirnav, the Avatar of Water. Impressive encounter to say the least. Very well tuned and made out, and sure as hell not the same designer of Xegony, The Queen of pleasedontfuckuptheCHrotationsoIlive. We fared very well, popping Coirnav on our first attempt with minimal casualties, not knowing much at all about the encounter. </p> 
        <p>A few minutes after Coirnav graced us with his ugly ass presence, we found ourselves in The Plane of Knowledge. Thinking I accidentally hit Exodus again, I started to jump and scream like a complete dickhead, totally encapsulated on the thought that I fucked the day for myself and the rest of the group. Seconds later, I see people start zoning in on top of me....whew, what a sign of relief.</p> 
        <p>We stamped a big W/R sign in the sand down there, Cajun Style Corinav Steaks ala carte to come very soon, served by your favorite Alliance, Wraith and Reviviscence. </p>

        <p>Almost 4 weeks since the last update when we managed to take down Xegony. Well since then we decided it was about time to farm Elem planes harder to gear up a bit. As an example on our kills of Fennin and Xegony the MT (who didn't die) didn't have a single item from the elemental planes. Didn't really stop us much but time to make things a bit easier on ourselves.</p> 
        <p>Since then we've farmed a lot. Still have yet to find Coirnav up or get a shot at that bugger, so a long learning process awaits us (if word of mouth is to go by). We DID however manage to play with the bugged rings in Earth a lot. That stupid dusty warder ring and resetting and bugged Triumvirates (9 at a time!!) was frustrating but we managed to wade through the mess and pop the Arbitor. Although I didn't mind the Peregin and Mudman rings much both the buggy nature of the dusty warder ring and the absolute boredem of the vegerog ring kind of gets to you when we spend 6 hours at a time in the zone. Arbitor himself happened to give us more trouble than he was worth, mostly due to our own fault. After managing to let him depop once and then wipe after winning (and hence no flags) we finally gave this lump the beating it deserved and got the majority flagged for Earth B. Look for more news from the home of the Rathe as we snag another Arbitor kill.</p> 
        <p align="center"> <img border="0" src="shots/arbitor-062803.jpg" width="450" height="401"></p> 
        <p>In the meantime we also managed to learn and take down the new Innoruuk as well which is only fitting as Wraith was there to take down Inny 1.0 and Inny 2.0 as server firsts as well. I actually enjoyed this new fight a lot, especially the first time we went at it with no prior info. A synopsis of the first attempt would sound like &quot;Adds&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;and adds&quot;, &quot;and more adds&quot;, &quot;and more adds..........&quot; ad nauseum. But we managed to revise the strat for what is pretty decent RvR especially considering the lack of Plate BPs to go around and also the relative lack of FT items in PoP. </p> 
        <p align="center"> <img border="0" src="shots/inny-062803.jpg" width="500" height="335"></p> 
        <p>We also managed to spend a fair bit of time in Plane of Water as well (what good elem farming can be complete without it) and have been pretty frustrated by it. Although we managed to score kills on Groihin the Wise, Hydrotha and Krizik the Mighty, the absolutely laggy and buggy nature of the zone is frustrating. It's absolutely ridiculous that soon as mobs touch a wall they manage to port whoever they melee to the zone. This has led to a lot of frustration and we're still unsure on what areas exactly are bug free. Also attemped this beast twice.</p> 
        <p align="center"> <img border="0" src="shots/ofossaa-062803.jpg" width="400" height="231"></p> 
        <p>Ofossaa the Enlightened gave us a pretty thorough beating in our 2 runs though we got him to like 30% or so. Pretty ridiculous RvR for this idiot which explains why he is always up. His time will come and RvR notwithstanding, he must die once atleast. </p> 
        <p>Our luck (or lack of it) with rogue daggers continues from the Luclin days (we got 1 khal in 10 Cursed kills and 2 BB in 10+ HP kills). I think our rogues are ready to throttle some folks as we have yet to get a Ifir or Gold Runed Mithril Knife in 5 Fennin and 7 Sol Ro kills. Maybe Warlord Gintoklan will be more kind to us.</p> 
        <p>Also somehow we managed to find Lord Inquisitor Seru up late night and we also managed to produce a key. So we proceeded to smack down this guy for a guild first. The fight was about as anti-climatic as expected but the RvR was better than expected, again mostly to the reasons I stated for Inny, as Seru coughed up a BP, the FT5 ring and his torque. No wonder he's almost never up. </p> 
        <p>Sprinkle in off hours Ssra / Kael clearings, one VT run, more backflagging and more comfortable repeat kills on all elem plane mobs we've killed before (including another kill of Xegony) and you pretty much sum up what we've been up to last few weeks. Hopefully I will have more info on our Coirnav / Rathe progression as soon as we get to work on them, which should be happening soon.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>So after working on the event about a week or so we finally managed to bring down Xegony. I say finally because IMO this is a pretty anal encounter. It's all about executing with an acute attention span. The fight lasted about an hour for us. Fact is there's almost no way you can guarantee complete heals between every round from Xegony for an hour and 2 consecutive bad rounds can kill any tank in the game. So you have to hope that the healing is on target and nothing too freakish happens. I guess that's where gear etc comes in (to increase the chances of successfully surviving bad rounds and sustain faster healing indefinitely). All in all it's definitely a team effort and an encounter we enjoyed breaking down and conquering. And there was the familiar rush from another challenged offed.</p> 
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/Xegony-053103.jpg" width="500" height="209"> </p> 
        <p>Managed to pick up 2 robes (vests rather) from her and were also lucky to pick up some plate legs. I'm sure this encounter will becomes lots simpler as we continue to gear up. </p> 
        <p>In other news we managed to find a lot of mobs up in Fire that we had yet to take out and so down they must go. The new versions of Pyonis, birds, generals weren't much different. Reparm had been over-rated in some of the boards I read and he was definitely a push over. Babnoxis proved to be more interesting but still went down without much ado once we adapted our strat a little.</p> 
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/babnoxis-052003.jpg" width="400" height="210"></p> 
        <p>The best challenges came from Blazaxx the Omnifiend and Arch Mage Yozanni. Arguably both these mobs are harder than Fennin Ro now, atleast that's what I thought. Some pretty whacked RvR for sure. Here's a <a href="shots/blazaxx-052403-large.jpg">very large pic</a> of Blazaxx in all his glory as he taught us a lesson in the earlier run before we managed to best him, but barely. Since then we killed him again and more smoothly, though the RvR is still pretty whacked compared to almost any other mob in the elem planes, except Arch Mage Yozanni.</p> 
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/blazaxx-052403.jpg" width="400" height="188"></p> 
        <p>The new Arch Mage Yozanni was a ton of fun to figure out. We tried some pretty whacky off-the-road stuff with some hilarious results before we managed to put together various elements from all the runs to put him down. The guy is absolutely a beast but a very fun fight to learn, adapt and execute. Though he went down, his RvR is also pretty out of whack. Definitely a fight that gets much easier once you have the right strategy for it. </p> 
        <p>Also managed to revenge the new Groihin the Wise in Plane of Water, another mob with stupid RvR. No wonder he's always left up. Dropped just one item for us, the so-so bard lute. Ummmm yeah. What's up with that? Not even 2 loots on this stupid mob with 2k quad + ramps + AE of&nbsp; 2kdmg/5sec stun that's pretty much unresistable, not to mention the leet ability of all named in Plane of Water to port ppl to the zone in or bind spot if they touch a wall at certain angles. Fun fun. It's not that he was much hard but the RvR on him is so stupid. We'll probably be looking to venture more in Water / Earth in the coming weeks (duh) so stay tuned for more updates in that regard. </p> 
        <p>Also managed to go up to hate late night and took out the new Maestro. He's like a Tier 1 PoP mob strength now, maybe slightly weaker, but definitely in the same vein (scripted event, low hps, etc etc). Dropped some loot in line with the fight, comparable to other Tier 1 PoP drops. </p> 
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/maestro-052603.jpg" width="400" height="139"></p> 
        <p>Also took a shot at the new Inny but having no prior info we were taken by surprise by what was held in store for us. Blowable events suck. Now that we know what to expect from him we'll go back sometime when free to take him down atleast once. Hope he drops something decent. </p> 
        <p>Cheers Wraith/Reviviscene on Xegony! Ciao.</p>

<p>Finally getting a shot at an elemental god we manage to run over and do some 
Luclin-style spawn camping till we had enough to take on the mob (hint: it was 
more than 20) so we wouldn't blow the spawn.</p>

<p>It took a few tries and few wipes before we managed to refine the 
pull/positioning/strategy enough to pull off the win in a exhilarating 6 min 
fight with our melee heavy army. Hopefully we'll cut the fight time some more 
next time. Though since MT didn't die and mana was not a issue I guess it won't 
matter significantly. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/fennin-throne-051303.jpg" width="500" height="231"></p>
<p>We were lucky to get the chain legs along with the 2 loot items (legs are a 
1/3 drop it seems) but didn't manage to get the essence (another 1/3 drop). The 
items from combining the 4 essences are subpar for the effort anyway. </p>
<p>Followed that up with a night-cap with our old buddy RZTWL. No BoWs agains. 
We're 1/6 now. Only 42 more kills before the other 7 warriors waiting can grab 
one, woohoo. Sucks it's so rare. The other guild that regularly kills him are 
also 1/8 or something similar. Oh well. He has to put out soon enough. All hail 
the power of the Random Number Generator!</p>
<p>Lets hope the Air elemental island bug gets fixed on patch so we can finally 
finish our Xegony key and start working on what should be a fun challenge.

weren't affected too much and went down with ease. Same for Pyonis whose AE we 
never used to dodge anyway. Babnoxious was slightly more challenging and need us

<p>Went to Plane of Air to try the only island we knew was up. Sigismond's 
island script is pretty exhaustive. With no prior info we were surprised by some 
of the script's elements and were certainly unaware of a depop timer and had to 
come back to try again to get the script done right. Sigismond died with much 
fan-fare in a fun fight. And the Avatar of Dust rolled over soon after to play 
dead, and we were able to pick up, among other things, a nice bard trinket.</p>

<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>Wow, been ages since an update. Well we got hit by a severe case of EQ-retardation 
aka burnout and lost a large chunk of the active playerbase. Had to recruit 
again pretty heavily and been flagging everyone back up again and just about 
done now. Also finally got the new Rallos Zek the Warlord event the spanking it 
deserved. I'll be updating the news site more often in the coming days. </p>

<p>A pretty uneventful month. We tried and killed lots of minis in all the 4 
planes including the bountiful named in Plane of Fire, the few in Earth, the 
named in the temples and the bosses and Avatars from the islands in Air, and 
more named in Water. Also had a run at Fennin Ro and more to come from that

<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>With the fall of Rallos Zek, we finally got access to the Solusek Ro chamber. 
Rather than have one guild wait to get access to Plane of Fire we decided to 
again team up with our friends in Vis Maior to grant maximum access to Fennin 
Ro's abode. Solusek Ro was an interesting fight, with the surprise factor of the 
AE (and the fact that it's lure) being the biggest obstacle. The fight was 
quickly brought under control and Sol Ro was prompty dispatched.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solusek-ro.jpg" width="499" height="141"></p>
<p>Went for Rallos Zek again as well to get those people flagged who had earlier 
missed out on the first kill. The fight was very smooth with hardly any 
casualties, though ofcourse the strength of the allies demanded such a victory. </p>
<p>Yesterday we spent adventuring in the Plane of Water. Took down Giridon the 
Wise or something and several other easy rare pops for decent drops. Went deeper 
and found another named up Ofossaa the Enlightened. We chose a spot to engage it 
in and cleared and then somehow found ourselves too near this guy and his 
guards, all of whom promptly butchered us.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/corinav.jpg" width="500" height="416"></p>

<p>Frustrated by limited attempts at the Rallos Zek encounter and artificial 
hindrances to our EQ progression, Vis Maior and Wraith / Reviviscence revived a 
three year old alliance to bring down Rallos Zek the Warlord tonight together 
for the first time on our first try. Last time Wraith and Vis Maior raided

2003 - Solusek Ro Tower - </b></font>
<font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Desi</b></font></p>
<p>Spent the last few weeks getting everyone who was missing flags upto speed 
and then worked on the Solusek Ro trials.</p>
<p>Anyone who has done them would realize that to say they were easy would be an 
understatement. It's surprising that one of the most beautiful zones in the game 
(up there with Vex Thal and Veeshan's Peak) is again locked away from the 
majority of the people, and AGAIN the mobs required to kill are harder than the 
mobs in the locked away zone. Trakannon was harder than all VP mobs except 
Hoshkar and Phara Dar. Emperor Ssraeshza was harder than all Vex Thal mobs. And 
now they bring the absurdity to another level. None of the Solusek Ro trials are 
harder than ................ Grummus. Probably Xanamech difficulty. Really the 
trials are ideal encounters for small guilds, small raids..... requiring about 
3-4 grps and guaranteeing a decent item reward after an hour or two of fighting. 
Oh well. Some random pics.</p>
<p>First trial we did. After an hour or two of clearing we met a boss mob which 
ended up being a slowable version of Vindicator !!</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-frontright.jpg" width="400" height="265"></p>
<p>This trial ended up with this beautiful flaming bird swooping down to attack.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-arlyxir.jpg" width="300" height="304"></p>
<p>Oh yeah, he's a gimp.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/solro-arlyxir-dead.jpg" width="600" height="177"></p>
<p>All trials were done upon availability and now we're at a stand still.</p>
<p>Rallos Zek the Warlord.</p>
<p>After being unable to access him for a couple of weeks since the guild first 
to kill him on the server was keeping him down because of his incredibly amazing 
and absolutely unsurpassed loot items, we finally managed to strike a deal 
allowing us access to the event........................ and now he's perma-killed! 
After trying the event a few times and getting our ass kicked by this version of 
Tallon Zek we have been unable to try him again since GMs are perma-killing him. 
More to come from La La land as we all sit and wait to try this sucker finally 
so we can move forward. Even worse, the PoP mob RvRs and itemizations are so 
sucky you don't even feel like killing them for the loot if you don't need a 
flag. Oh well, something has to give one way or another. Later.</p>

<p>Being on a competitive server limits your opportunities to progress somewhat 
and Quellious is one the more competitive servers around. Still we all strive to 
find our niche and we managed to find some opportunities and downed these 
respective mobs to continue the PoP storyline progression and opened a new zone 
for us.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Temple of Marr: Tier 3 
                            (Sub-zone)</font></p>
<p>Went again at Mithaniel Marr and this time he went down with ease.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/mithmarr-dead-011503.jpg" width="500" height="181"></p>
<p>Infact the fight proved to be too easy for some so in all our wisdom we 
somehow managed to train a lot of mobs on us after the fight (repops and beyond) 
and managed to wipe after hardly losing anyone to him. Ah the joys! Loot did get 
distributed and everyone got flagged so mission was successful.</p>
<p><font color="#00FF00">Crypt of Decay: Tier 2 (aka

                        than expected or perhaps we got lucky. Flags were 
                        collected and one more challenge was put to rest.</p>

                          to and including Saryn herself. Saryn is a 
                          surprisingly easy encounter, not much different from 
                          Terris Thule. With the Mithaniel Marr, Saryn and 
                          Bertoxxulous kills we managed to complete the 
                          necessary progression and Maelin now allowed us to

                          to come when we do explore it further. Right now 
                          Rallos Zek stands between us and access to Elemental

						<p>Not much's been happening. Lots of people took breaks 
                        during the last 2 weeks so the guild resorted to boring 
                        stuff like Vex Thal farming and etc. Although a little 
                        progress was still made along the storylines.</p>

                            (Sub-zone)</font></p>
<p>Made a few unsuccessful attempts at Mithaniel Marr. The zone possibly has the 
most frustrating graveyard compared to any other zone in the game, landing you 
next to the zone in portal where attempting to loot your corpse can port you to 
kos mobs in the Halls of Honor and ofcourse you cant drag your corpse out of the 
graveyard either. Mithaniel Marr himself was a fun fight and I'll report more 
progress along that front when we revisit him. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Bastion of Thunder: Tier 3</font></p>
<p>Visited the Bastion of Thunder to attempt to free Karana from the stormlord's 
cruel reign. Agnarr was a very entertaining bout, especially figuring out the 
events for the first time. The visit was successful and Agnarr went down.</p>

<p>Visited Tactics to meet the other demi-god we had not yet met. Tallon Zek was 
a harder than the pitifully easy Vallon Zek, and probably more fun too. 
Especially if you play with the graphics on and you see the flames burning 
around him as he reaches back on his arrow to land a 3k ish nuke on someone 
(complete with different effects / colors for different resists) and then see 
that person burning............. it's a colorful fight indeed. Much fun for all. </p>

                        feel he's worth the effort to key more people, 
                        especially since he doesn't progress the storyline.</p>

                          to figure out and complete the key for Saryn tower 
                          (pretty trivial to figure out really) and had fun 
                          slaughtering in the tower but stopped short of Saryn 
                          since we had not killed Bertoxxulous yet. With the 
                          restrictions being recently lifted, we are now able to 
                          meet the mother of torture and will report more news 
                          with regards to that as it happens.</p>

                        <p>Xanamech, the mechanical dragons, was discovered and 
                        promptly defeated, and again, and again, and YET again, 
                        till we finally got a bug free gnome which gave us 
                        access to the factory in the other part of the zone. The 
                        factory was penetrated and the Manaetic Behemtoh was promptly dispatched (albiet 
                        after multiple attempts). I have to say this is the most lop-sided fight 
                        ever. To post a spoiler and say &quot;kill it before it kills 
                        you&quot; won't be too far from the truth. The fight is so 
                        short there is no possible way to unload/burn all mana 
                        if you were nuking even. Too bad our wizards refuse to 
                        reinvest in Manaburn. This got us flagged for Tactics.</p>

                          <p>After the Behemoth kill we went to explore Tactics 
                          a little. A little investigation revealed Vallon Zek 
                          was up. Proceeded to it to test it out before calling it 
                          a night. The mob's encounter turned out to be 
                          delightful to say the least. Tactics indeed. Another 
                          unique event, which we had so much fun experiencing we 
                          stayed up late to finish the job. I'd say this mob has 
                          so far the best RvR to day that I have seen. We had 40 
                          people but almost seemed to be zerging it down. A good 
                          pull team and decent strategy and this can be done 
                          with 4 grps or less for sure. Quite a change from 
                          Behemoth.</p>

                          <p>More news to come from this zone as we proceed to Tallon 
                          Zek before at some point attempting Rallos Zek, whose 
                          Tier 3, Plane of War, zone was removed from the game 
                          at the last minute, and it's contents included in this 
                          zone. Hence I dubbed the zone Tier 2/3 since the 
                          content past Tallon and Vallon is certainly Tier 3.</p>

                        will remind myself to take more screenshots from now.

                        along all the different storylines and arcs as we continued 
                        to march towards the Lands of Phat Loots (aka Elemental 
                        Planes). So much to kill, so little time.</p>

Finally completed the buggy Save the Gnome quest in PoI and tried Behemoth(note thats Behemoth the big ass ugly mofo in Poi, not to be confused with Behemoth the big ass ugly mofo in Wraith). Also have been doing alot of key farming for Bastion of Thunder, and getting some exp. Cleared VT again, our fastest and cleanest yet, grats me on a whopping negetive 57 or so points /sigh.

						<p>I'd hate to be overdramatic but the win was so sweet 
                        which such a emphatic conclusion to months of keys and 
                        shard farmings that it's hard not feel so satisfied. All 
                        those days/night of emp key camps, the long waits for 
                        Emperor attempts, the shards camps etc all came together 
                        in a rousing crescendo. In a exciting 6 hour romp we ran 
                        from Thall Va Kelun to Aten Ha Ra exploring and learning 
                        all the content in between for the first time.</p>
						<p>None of the named or clearing mobs etc posed any 
                        issues with our  40-45ish member raid force, which only 
                        enhanced the feeling that VT was a reward zone for all 
                        the months of effort. Nothing in VT is close to the 
                        difficulty of the many more tougher mobs outside it, just tedious. The 
                        place doesn't need to have half as many mobs to clear as 
                        it does, but it wasn't an issue at all. We went from 
                        zone-in to TVK in 1 day and from TVK to AHR in another 
                        day, and two days seemed fair to me for the rewards. I 
                        know other guilds manage to romp through the zone in 
                        single 7-10 hour sessions and hopefully we'll manage to 
                        achieve that level of proficiency as well on repeat 
                        clearings. The zone is beautiful, the clearings were fun 
                        and we all thoroughly enjoyed learning and clearing it.</p>
						<p>Thall Va Kelun and Diabo Xi Va Temarial were next to 
                        go down after the Diabos on first floor. Both look like 
                        the same old 4-armers, and they look the same dead. 
                        First run on Thall Va Kelun posed some problems as it 
                        was late night and our 6 grp raid couldn't handle the 
                        repops on the longish fight. Second try we had better 
                        time management to cap off the first day with the kill. 
                        The second day of clearing took us to DXVT through the 
                        much discussed &quot;Hall of Doom&quot; although I didn't 
                        understand the big deal. DXVT also went down easily and the clearings became a lot less tedious 
                        after that as 
                        named lined up one after the other, ready to die.</p>

						<p>VXAHR was first new model we saw for a while, which 
                        itself was cause to cheer. Got trained by mistakes but 
                        still died easily as we learnt the mob during the fight. 
                        Next up were two versions of these identical goos.</p>

						<p>The buggy Gravty-fluxes managed to warp the entire 
                        wing below us onto us, but in probably the most 
                        challenging and exciting fight of the whole trip we 
                        again managed to avoid a CR and cleared all of them. And 
                        then nothing remained but Aten Ha Ra herself, and she 
                        followed the course of her comrades to eternal 
                        rest...... well, till repop.</p>

						<p>Yeah we picked up some nice trinkets and ancient 
                        spells along the way but I doubt anyone who comes to 
                        read this update cares for the list. Needless to say 
                        they were nice enough to warrant repeat trips. </p>

						<p>Frequent server outages have forced frustrating 
                        restarts on our Vex Thal clearing. I wanted to post pics 
                        of trains and disasters and corpses littered all over

						<p>They all have identical rooms, same model and died in 
                        the same spot, in the same position and with equal ease, 
                        so why take up more bandwidth than one pic. So far all 
                        mobs seem to be rewards for all the months of key/bane 
                        farmings for emperor and shard camps for VT keys. None 
                        of the mobs so far are harder than Vindi/Rumblecrush 
                        difficulty level, all mobs encountered so far died 
                        easily on first go with no prior info. Picked up some 
                        nice trinkets from them, but don't worry, I won't 
                        barrage you with a list of loots and names.</p>
						<p>Emperor also died again, for the first time since PoP 
                        and WOW! With the new hp buffs, lev 65 tanks, and above 
                        all the 40% disease slow available, the mob is a 
                        complete joke to its previous difficulty level. Atleast 
                        he's more accessible by smaller guilds now too, which 
                        means less farming for them and makes you wonder why you 
                        bothered. Right now Emperor is most definitely doable 
                        with 35-40 ish.</p>

						<p>Planes of Power is here, and we have nothing to do 
                        with it. Need to finish up some old stuff before we 
                        tackle this new beast.</p>
						<p>Killed Emperor twice more, this time without mod 
                        rods. This is after the patch in which the gimped 
                        version was fixed. The fight lengths were exactly 26 min 
                        and 27 min for the 2 fights and seems his hitpoints have 
                        been restored to what they originally were. Wasn't much 
                        of a problem and we managed to find several ways around 
                        the god rods. Dropped a

						<p>Finally managed to enough people with shards (40 or 
                        so) to decide it's enough to try out Vex Thal. I have to 
                        say the zone is fun and active. We've yet to have any 
                        trains (well, none we couldn't handle) and I'm thankful 
                        that the coffin crs we were warned about on first trips 
                        have eluded us. We've been cautious though, as we were 
                        trying to learn the mobs, their 
                        classes/levels/abilities/repop timers and etc. </p>
						<p>First mob up was Thall Va Xakra after a little 
                        clearing. Rumblecrush difficulty level. No I'm not 
                        joking. Also took out Thall Va Xakra #2. Loots were very 
                        good for the difficulty. 2

                        black. Another trivial fight. So far it seems everything

                        Ofcourse most of the zone to go still and more 
                        challenging mobs around the corner. This guy dropped an amulet 
                        and earring. </p>

						<p>Arguably the most valuable droppable item in the 
                        game. Incase you were wondering, yes the is indeed 41% 
                        as can be verified 
                        <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=27949">here</a>. Congrats Dupri.</p>
						<p>In other news, the dreaded death of God Rod is in and 
                        we've only done a handful of uber mobs since. The Cursed 
                        cycle we took down happened to be the gimped version. 
                        High Priest's AC/hitpoints were majorly nerfed, very 
                        disappointing and unnecessary as all clerics were above 
                        80 mana when he died. Same with Arch Lich, closer to 50% 
                        this time, but another unnecessary nerf on AC/hps. We 
                        never used rods on Itraer Vius and Shei anyway so those 
                        fights were unchanged. The upcoming Emperor fight will 
                        be a lot more interesting as it's supposed to provide 
                        more challenging mana management issues.</p>
						<p>Plane of Power patch goes in on Monday. Given my 
                        experience with the release of the Kunark, Velious, 
                        Luclin expansions, I'd advise everyone to gear up for 
                        daily patches for the next week or two. See you in the 
                        Plane of Knowledge as we all sit around and curse Verant 
                        when we realize 70% of the content is locked, each plane 
                        requires a laborious key process and you can't put 
                        points in Planar AA abilites without your class title. 
                        Don't be surprised if it's as big a grind as Luclin. You 
                        heard it here first. Ciao.</p>

						<p>Need I say more ? No........ but I will anyway. 
                        Emperor Ssraeshza is dead. And not just dead, he was 
                        comprehensively beaten in a manner we didn't dare hope 
                        for. MT died only once (coincidentally at about 
                        the 50% mark) and the next one didn't die in a totally 
                        clean fight. 27 minutes of 
                        pure adrenaline rush. The kind of emphatic win that 
                        makes you wonder why it didn't happen earlier. Grats 
                        Hayzel on shawl, Ittee on slippers, Lunara on torque and 
                        Desaran on Garrison nuke.</p>
						<p>Fiercely proud of our accomplishments, and having 
                        beaten arguably the two hardest encounters in the game (RoV 
                        and Emp), it's time to remove the artificial restrictions 
                        we had to cope with, regarding access to the mobs 
                        because we came to the scene late. Emperor should have 
                        been dead months ago but our 6 attempts were spread 2 
                        months apart. Time to change all that in PoP. It's all 
                        even now.</p>

						<p>Emperor attempt 4. Everything started wrong. We tried 
                        a new strategy which back-fired. Emperor jumped in camp 
                        and a bunch of clerics, shamans, mages and other classes 
                        bit it before the fight even started. From there how we 
                        managed to make even this progress is a testament to the 
                        skills of the wonderful folks I choose to play with. We 
                        never managed to fully recover from the initial mess and 
                        I hope to bring better news next time we go at him 
                        .......... which frustratingly won't happen for a week.</p>

						<p>In other more cheerful news, we've managed to lay 
                        into RoV well and good. Sometimes one wonders whether 
                        the RvR is worth the 4 hour raid until you pick up one 
                        of these gems.</p>

                        other goodies from here and many other farming mobs.

						<p>Emperor attempt 3. The bad news is too much stuff 
                        went wrong with the fight. The clincher being that a add 
                        woke up as one of the four enchanters we had for the 
                        fight lagged out. No excuses. It is a unforgiving fight 
                        in some respects. We'll get some backup enchanters for 
                        next time. </p>

						<p>Since there's not much new to report I thought I 
                        might as well comment on another successful Vulak 
                        beating last night. The significant thing was that it 
                        was by far our smoothest outing. This encounter still is 
                        a wild-ride. Sometimes a bit too intense for 3 and half 
                        hours of non stop action. Still our only source of 
                        Ancient spells and we'll take it. Loot consisted of

						<p>Nothing new to report from never-never-land. Summer's 
                        ended, and had a slight hit in attendance. Didn't affect 
                        much except force us to abort our attempt on Emperor. 2 
                        attempts so far only and we were well-schooled in both 
                        of them. And since you dont see his face plastered here 
                        in a 'horizontal' position, he's not dead yet.</p>
						<p>And the thought of camping more stuff for the next 
                        challenge (Seru weapons, Acrylia keys, VT components) is 
                        enough to make one sick. PoP can't come fast enough. </p>
						<p>We've been doing more than our fair share of farming 
                        though, as one would expect. Same old ssra bosses minus 
                        Emp, AoW, Burrower, RoV, Shei etc. I would have even had 
                        a chance to put a &quot;Flawless Victory&quot; headline for our 
                        recent AoW kill had the puller not inexplicably died on 
                        pull, but we still managed to 1-tank him for the first 
                        time for us. People used to say switching MTs was the 
                        hardest part for AoW. Well, he's a total bore now. Ciao

						<p>For the most part Quellious can be qualified as one 
                        of the most civil servers at the top end. All the top 
                        guilds are in contact with each, discussions are held in 
                        advance to pre-empt spawn disputes and hardly anyone 
                        races another. In this 'Pleasantville' equivalent of EQ 
                        servers we now have a spoiled brat. A new guild, Expoofit, has arrived to 
                        the scene. It's a up-and-coming guild, with a propensity 
                        for Velious kings, and Luclin minors. They also like to 
                        poof AoW and Shei every chance they get, hence the name. 
                        Unfortunately they haven't been blessed with the 
                        maturity to handle spawn disputes. </p>
						<p>Case in point, one late night Wraith/Reviv arrive in 
                        Kael to kill King Tormax. Rel in Por starts moving in as 
                        well and I talked to their guild leader. Apparently they 
                        had been camping him all day and had moved out of Kael 
                        15 or so minutes before he popped. We decided to be 
                        courteous even though we were at the spawn first and let 
                        them go ahead. So as RiP is gearing up, we headed to 
                        Arena to kill Vindicator and to wait to see if RiP would 
                        take down Tormax. Lo and behold, Expoofit decides to 
                        give up on Seru keys for the night (thank god he can't 
                        be poofed) and comes to Kael even though there are TWO 
                        guilds already in the zone for the spawn. At this point, 
                        brought together by a common enemy, Wraith/Reviv and RiP 
                        teamed up to pull Tormax through all of the Expoofit 
                        trains and kill him TWICE as a treacherous bard who will 
                        hereby go unnamed (aka Linaren of Expoofit) casted bard 
                        gate song on King Tormax when he was 10% hp. It was a 
                        lot of fun actually and one can only hope that the 
                        up-and-coming guild Expoofit also picks up some manners 
                        along with better skills in their evovling process.</p>
						<p>On the less dramatic side, we took down RoV again and 
                        picked up some loot along with Mage and Druid nukes for 
                        Kindir and Aguilera. 
                        Also farmed all other mobs you'll expect us to farm, all Ssra except Emp, AoW etc etc. But we also gave some 
                        shots to some new encounters. Here's the key to RoV 
                        fights, mages in unbearably bright lime green robes.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/RoV-mages.jpg" width="400" height="356"></p>
						<p>Finally we tried Emperor Ssraeshza. You don't see a 
                        ss of the dead corpse, hence it didnt go so well. With 
                        the current rotation we have in place with the guild 
                        currently farming him, we only get 1 shot per week on 
                        the spawn pretty much, excluding patches, and we hope to 
                        bring him down within the next few tries. I'll keep you 
                        guys posted if we do any significant damage to him.</p>
						<p>Also, in one of the most fun encounters we have ever 
                        participated, we also tried the Ring of Thule, the 
                        source of the best droppable loot in the game... almost; 
                        since all items in the new CT are droppable. We had an 
                        unbelievable time through RoT. Here's an action shot.</p>

						<p>We actually progrssed pretty far in the fight and 
                        managed to kill Dread and Fright and almost killed 
                        Terror. I hope to soon bring you guys screenshots of 
                        another encounter completed. Here's the loot we picked 
                        up from Dread and Fright respectively, new to the server ofcourse. 
                        The loot is as expected, sub par for the difficulty of 
                        the encounter, but the fun factor of the fight made up 
                        for it.</p>

						<p>
                        Also took down the new THO given the new resist rates 
                        and dot stacking. I must say that this is a most 
                        annoying fight now. One of the worst RvR out there and 
                        not worth the time anymore. Take your usual 3-4 grps for 
                        the fight and you'll have some fun. Although we were 
                        lucky to get unusually good loot (2 wiz nukes, orb and 
                        dagger), the loot table most certainly is not changed. </p>

                        when there's not much up elsewhere and we want some nice loots. 
                        Ciao.</p>

						<p>Without being able to find Emperor up at all (still 
                        need to have a go at him) we decided to take care of 
                        some unfinished business elsewhere. </p>
						<p>On our 4th attempt after about 3 hrs we were greeted 
                        by the boss of the Temple of Veeshan and Vulak'Aerr 
                        graced Quellious with his presence after about 8 months 
                        as this was incidentally the first time the Ring of 
                        Vulak was defeated on Quellious.</p>

						<p>Don't have anything significant to report. Quellious 
                        has had more outages and we've been incredibly busy 
                        mopping everything up. Cleaned out all mobs in Ssra 
                        except Blood / Emp in the last patch and were busy this 
                        patch too. Been getting good drops of late including our

						<p>Among new encounters we've been learning to take care 
                        of the guards in Emp room on non-loot Blood. Still not 
                        ready for a Emp attempt but our first go should happen 
                        within a fortnight. </p>
						<p>Killed some named in the Ring of Fire (Warlord, 
                        Warmaster etc) but the Underking eluded us. Will revenge 
                        him soon. Must get Ice Comet proccing skull !!!! =)</p>
						<p>Gave the Ring of Vulak a whirl. Got trampled on by 
                        the wave of splitter drakes. Been too busy finishing 
                        keys for Emperor to focus on these other encounters much 
                        but soon enough. Ciao.</p>

						<p>Classic perfect first encounter. Figured out where he 
                        was in the zone. Got to him. Got hit by traps two doors 
                        before (now we know), cleared to his room, saw the 
                        guards in the room, killed them, timed repop, checked 
                        debuffs on them, checked mezzes on them, checked mob 
                        melee, checked mob debuffs, mapped strategy for the

						<p>Cheers Wraith / Reviviscence for three awesome days, 
                        with the third new kill for us. Started with some more farming in Ssra and then word came that Shei Vinitras was up in 
                        Akheva Ruins. We've never had the pleasure of attempting 
                        this fellow before.</p>
						<p align="center">
                        <img border="0" src="shots/shei-070202.gif" width="450" height="367"></p>
						<p>First try and dead. If you know this encounter you'll 
                        know that if you lose a bunch of folks to him during the 
                        fight, you get lev 60 adds to deal with. Hence any 
                        winning encounter has to be relatively clean, but I must 
                        admit for a first attempt we surpassed our own 
                        expectations. The fight was clean, under control and 
                        remarkably easy, from start to finish. All the hype about this encounter's 
                        difficulty are exaggerations at best, and pure lies to 
                        keep others away at worst.</p>
						<p>Now the reason we went for this encounter was simple, 
                        we hadn't killed him before. But the reward we got was 
                        astonishing and made it all the more worth it. </p>

						<p>Hehhee. If we are going to be treated to more of 
                        these goodies you can bet we'll be back for more. Take 
                        care and make sure you don't miss the fireworks. Later.</p>

                        to find that the basement was up but we were already

                        attempt) the Glyphed cycle due to availability. I guess 
                        we'll be forced to wait another week for that chance.

                        little prior info the mob went down on first try. 
                        Everyone involved had more good time. People are pumped 
                        for more Ssra action, and we are taking action  to 
                        satiate them. Stay tuned for more Ssra adventures and ciao. </p>

						<p>But came up empty handed. The stupid thing warped 
                        TWICE in 2 tries to the zone. Although we got GM rezzes 
                        it still doesn't insatiate the desire for revenge. </p>
						<p>Also hit Tunare again like we have been when she's up

						<p>Gave the Ring of Fire version 7.32 a whirl and I must 
                        say it's a ton of fun. We were rather overwhelmed with 
                        our minimal damage output. The waves just popped too 
                        fast, so we'll need to come up with some alternative 
                        strats maybe or bring some more ppl than 30. Near the 
                        end we had 20+ mobs mezzed thanks to the presence of 2 
                        members (Alzedo and Einu) of our team of

                        Everyone knew their role and when the idol went down 
                        unslowed with no deaths we knew the time had come.

                        Nothing new - Desi</b></font></p>
						<p>Just got done with the most excruciating run in N ToV. 
                        4 days !!!! How you ask? Each day we killed all the 
                        dragons that WERE up in just about the shortest time 
                        possible. Apparently the guild before us took this long 
                        to crawl through the place. When questioned, they claim 
                        the guild before them are to blame. This rotation is 
                        becoming cumbersome if this is to be repeated. I'm sure 
                        steps will be taken to ensure this doesnt happen again.</p>
						<p>On a more positive note the fights themselves were an 
                        absolute joke, most of them flawless with no deaths. So 
                        the rooted dragons don't warp now, didn't change much. 
                        Vyemm was probably the most fun as our last strat 
                        moderately relied on warping but he didn't prove to be 
                        too much trouble as his pets popped during the fight but 
                        died along with him. Dropped the sweet Graudalek sword.</p>
						<p>Yeah yeah you've seen this ss a billion times on tons 
                        of other guild sites but we were particulary frustrated 
                        on day 4 on waiting for this stuff to pop and executed 
                        our revenge in full force.</p>

						<p>In other news, had a shot at AoW, got him to 70% or 
                        so on first MT and the switch never happened. Great. Oh 
                        well. Live and learn. Cleared Dain, CT, Tormax, Yelinak, 
                        Klan, Zlan, IV, N ToV and etc etc like a gazillion 
                        times. </p>
						<p>A couple of special things happened in NToV, for the 
                        curious minded. 1. We cleared Aary + 2 pets together 
                        along with all the hatchlings in a sweet long fight. Was 
                        fun. 2. We killed the rooted, spellfilter bugged, 
                        irresistible knockback Lord Vyemm in a nearly perfect 
                        fight (4-5 fights deaths at end enrage to... &quot;lag&quot; hehe). 
                        3. We cleared 11 or 12 dragons in a awesome 6 hr burst. </p>

Cheers).</p>						<p>So we proceeded to engage CT. I fully expected this to be a trial run while people managed to learn and cope with the knockback and snare and agro management.

CoH'ed to Telk, quick easy kill. Didnt drop anything too interesting that I recall.

We all knew there will soon be a patch to fix the patch. Unfortunately noone expected that patch to come 2 hours after servers were up. Pathetic. Why not just announce a 14 hour patch in the first place instead of making ppl wait with no ETA.</p>						<p>So we logged on and guess what. The most absolute bizarre and unexpected of things happened. It was a complete shock. STATUE WAS UP !! and NOONE IN KAEL !! Whoa !! so we ran over to finally get a shot at him. Had yet to kill him this time around. Was glad that people got in the groove relatively fast (relative to well.... someone slower, hehehe). Vindi dropped BP for Lotanz and Statue dropped BP for Revenger, Hammer for Shihhan and Scroll for Nysa.</p>						<p>So we also wanted to try the much talked about pull spot. First conceived by some smart tacticians in a guild called <a href="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml">Blood of the Spider</a> in Rathe almost a year ago for their Statue and later AoW kills. Later posted by <a href="http://www.fohguild.org">Fires of Heavens</a> in a ss on their website in their 44 man kill. Scroll down and you'll see it. Sorry I didn't take any screenshots (you can also see the pull spot in <a href="http://www.lotuscult.com">LC</a> and <a href="http://www.vismaior.net">VM's</a> websites for their AoW kills). Needless to say, the pull spot makes the Statue encounter beyond trivial. It was the fastest we've killed him since we first did him on the server 9 months ago. Any decent 4 grp effort can kill Statue in that spot. We had a bad pull, he warped to camp, killed 6-7 ppl, MT got hold of him, never died and no deaths after that.</p>						<p>Headed to Ssraa after that, killed Rhag2. Got the nice Smoldeshank weapon, the crap and inexplicable Druid root proc sword (which rotted) and some spells.</p>						<p>Quick trip to Umbral Plains after that late night netted some so-so loot from Zaelthiniwhatever and Rumblecrush.</p>						<p align="center">

Cleared the way to the Progenitor and maintained the streak of a new mob for us every few days =) Kind of. Well Progenitor was a fun kill. He is by far the biggest non-dragon mob I've seen dwarfing the likes of Statue / PoG Trees etc and simply the tallest mob I have seen so far, period. Alzedo's direcharmed pet hit for 291 (hasted ofcourse) and ate all rampages, hehehe which made things easier than expected. And he had the goods too. Primal Spear for Nemekis.

Besides the thrill of the exciting fight itself, there was closure finally for something that a lot have referred to as unfinished business. In our first real try at Sontalak this time around we finally took care of it in our 2nd attempt. Our army of non-epicced melee mowed down this meanie in a relatively clean fight. After we gave him one go, and came close, we refined our strategy and nailed this idiot through and through. 30 Wraith, 20 Reviv and 1 dead dragon. Anyone who has fought this mob would be nothing but impressed given our numbers, our armor and most importantly our weapons. People are learning fast and I am extremely proud to say we are finally coming into our own. All Hail Wraith - Reviviscence !</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>Before we dropped Sontalak we got together for another Klandicar kill. In retrospect, Klandicar might even be a slightly more difficult encounter than Sontalak in light of our excellent strat on Sontalak. But like I said before Sontalak will hold a special place for Wraith-Reviv's brief history this time around. We've surpassed our expectations, achieving first timers for us on almost a daily basis. We're not taking a detour for armor farming in ToV or epic completions. We're just mowing them down with our limited numbers, even more limited equipment and seemingly limitless enthusiasm and sensibilities =) Best example would be that tonight after we lost 10 melee and 2 clerics after the loss in the first attempt to Sontalak I proposed calling it a night, but I pretty much got vetoed by everyone there who urged me to try the new refined strategy and ultimately resulted in our victory. We're beginning to believe............ and it's a great feeling =)<br>						<br>						Congrats Nemekis and Annalyse on ST keys. Hope everyone had as good a weekend as we did.

End result: Master of the Guard dead. My first Statue kill, incidentally first on server, was a lengthy 18 minutes, first Vulak kill (with VM) incidentally also first on server, was an equally lengthy 21 minutes. Tonight's fight with Motg was certainly of a different nature but hardly less thrilling. Only fight longer (and definitely the most boring of this set) was the mindless 80 min killing of Bristlebane in PoM, lol also the first on server. So what did Motg put out? Actually we were extremely lucky, since we got only the most rare drop in ST now besides the stupid scale. Yes folks, I refer to none other than the elusive Primal Bow.

We went again and after some craziness executed pretty much as good an attempt as a raid with limited experience and a hoard of non-60 melees holding weapons like Defiance and stuff and mostly pre-ToV armor could =) Most definitely it was our most supreme effort on a mob of this caliber and all present there shared in my excitement with our improvement. I think there were no deaths till Klandicar was 30% or so and ~15 deaths of the ~55 man effort after that, all of them to the unresistable AE since the fight kept going on and on and on like the Energizer Bunny ~ 4 min !!! and 15+ AEs.

Only 1 hero died and the end result was Gurunt getting his ring (congrats man), Clavendale the Lance of Uber Taunt, Shamson the Helm of Uber Envy, Elof the earring (Fear the DA shaman), and Heio the Eye.

Had ~35-40 ppl and had a total blast. We still need better weapons though. Given it's got 100k more hp now ~250 total, the fight still went on far too long, probably 8 min. Actually with the dragon being perma-rooted it's actually fun to go to it's lair to gank it. Desaran (62k dmg from banes) observing his spoils here. Loots include Eye of Rigatorn for Dupri, and Cloaks of something for Leetah and Genix.</p>					</div>					<p align="center">

Rather uneventful (besides my train, so we wont dwell on this kill tonight). Cowl to Droz, Frak Tali to Faippo, ST Key to Alzedo, Zlan Heart to Doleiron etc.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>Also killed Velk at some point as well as Trakannon a few times when we were bored. Finished some epics including a run in at Chardok. Killed Zlan another time before that as well with drops being ST key to Rumuk, First Brood Talis to Jama and Lotanz, Frak Tali to Claver and Heart to Vilenn.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p><font color="#ff9933">Droz still learning<br>						<img border="0" src="shots/qotd/droz-hail.jpg" width="262" height="38"></font></p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p><font color="#ff9933">Naje still dreaming<br>						<img border="0" src="shots/qotd/naje-superman.jpg" width="319" height="26"></font></p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p><font color="#ff9933">And Valkon still likes it rough<br>						<img border="0" src="shots/qotd/valkon-rough.jpg" width="271" height="30"></font></p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p><font color="red" size="4"><b>Feb 7<sup>th</sup>, 2002 - Large update - Desi</b></font></p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>My apologies again for the long delay since the last update. I've been rather swamped with work again and updating points (which btw are now updated) is taking precedence and is more time-consuming that I had imagined.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>We gave Lendinara the Keeper a shot yesterday. Well, we need better connections for one. 150 ppl in zone and lag sucked. We also need better damage output, forget primals, ppl need to finish epics, lol. So this was our first go on a AE / positioning type mob and I was pleasantly surprised how fast people picked up. First try sucked. we had about 55 ppl, 5-10 went LD, most of the rest were lagging, dragon was in the casters, positioning sucked and we only got her to 40. Second try we had 35 ppl better lag, perfect positioning, Main tank held agro and stayed alive for 6-7 min (including disc) before clerics started going oom ( more rods plz ) and she was only at 50% hp !!! Yes after 6-7 min atleast. Hmmm.......... we need ppl to level up some and get better weapons !! In progress now ! =) All in all it was a great run, everyone had a blast, especially the last attempt and people picked up on the strat incredibly fast. Soon with some more levels and better gear she'll go down.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>We also got around to heading up the Plane of Air for some serious blade farming. And when I say serious I mean serious. ~8 hours, 51 Spiroc Lords, 13 blades. I think that pretty much puts to rest any contention on how often the blade drops. The sample size is large enough. It's 25%. The 13 un-epicced warriors were (in no particular order) Heio, Puvil, Puresmoke, Rumuk, Revenger, Tunset, Vortok, Torros, Ragnarz, Timok, Cabat, Inges (Pinga), Naje. And yes it sucked doing this boring crap. We were just way too exhausted to continue to I7 for crown farming but that too is looming in the horizon at some point. Also picked up 2 necro epics cloaks (grats Niruhtam and Vilenn) and finished Anyelle's Paladin FA. On Isle 4 all evil PCs got wiped due to Inadequate Research aka Anyelle =) Here's a pic of the marathon Spiroc Lord action.</p>					</div>					<p align="center">

I wasnt around to witness the fun but I heard it was an easy kill. Stay tuned for more Zlan farming in the weeks to come.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>We finally got around to triggering the 10th Ring War for Gurunt and I must admit, it is as much a blast as everyone who has participated in it before has raved about. Truly an event everyone should participate in atleast once. Not to be missed. It was our first time with little prior info. Our start messed up, our forces divided. Yet we managed to get to the last sub-wave of the third wave before Narandi spawns. Next time we will no doubt fare better, and I will hopefully be the harbinger of good news. I think this pic aptly depicts how confused the situation was most of the times.</p>					</div>					<p align="center">

We'll get him next time.</p>					</div>					<div align="left">						<p>A bunch of ToV farming besides this, and that pretty much wraps it up for now.
