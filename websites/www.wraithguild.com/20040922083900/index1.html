      <p>Died to THE goal a few times. Yes there are many goats in GoD. But at 
      the end of the day, there's only 1 more goat. The Goat. Pixxt Xxeric Kex. 
      The bane of all who enter Tacvi. We've been making decent progress on the 
      event. The last emote at 10% where she heals herself to 40% (gasp 
      spoiler!!) is pretty infuriating but we'll hopefully move past this event 
      soon.</p>


      <p>What's been keeping us up is the new expansion, whose incredibly smooth 
      lauch has surprised us as much as the amazingly fresh quality of the 
      zones..... or should I say retro. They finally seem to have brought 
      together what they've learnt from all this years and years of expansions 
      and world building all packaged in one expansion. Only one locked zone ala 
      Kunark/Velious/Luclin. Awesome huge zones with lots of named with 
      reasonable loot for casual players and enforcing tons of social 
      interaction like the best time of Kunark and Velious, especially in Walls 
      of Slaughter.</p>


      <p>All this infused with the instancing success of LDoN and GoD with 
      awesomely detailed and HUGE instanced dungeons off of Dranik including 
      some pretty hard dungeons... hopefully they will get the RvR right as 
      well. Easily accessibly (NO CLEARING, OMG!) roaming named mobs in a lot of 
      zone offering raid challenges, as well as tough trials with awesome 
      rewards in Muramite Proving Grounds which offer challenges for both raids 
      and single grps and here the raids are limited to 54 to fine tune 
      progression while the majority of the boss encounters are accessible for 
      all and you may bring as many as you like. This seems to me like the 
      perfect balance....... finally!!</p>


      <p>And then the zones where the big boys go to play. Had some fun in 
      Riftseeker's Sanctum and I am sure Anguish (the only locked zone) will 
      probably provide lots of fun. We (like all other guilds) are focusing on 
      leveling, getting new AAs, and new spells. Hopefully the increasingly 
      depressing looking Gates of Discord will be over asap with the help of the 
      new levels/AAs and we can focus on the new fun stuff in Omens of War. Here 
      are some pics from Muramite Proving Grounds and Riftseeker's Sanctum. See 
      you all around in the game. Ciao.</p>

      <p>And so we come full circle yet again. Another expansion. Another final 
      zone. And new challenges around the corner in Omens of War. </p>


      <p>A fantastic few days of learning on High Priest Nkosi Bakari concluded 
      with an asbolutely exhilarating beatdown of the painful encounter. I 
      wouldn't be exaggerating too much to say that while half of Txevu is 
      occupied by Aneuk Nyrt Ymosa, Aneuk Rilst Uskst, Ikaav Hsek Syat, Ixt 
      Quall Nalnn, Ixt Kial Ivesi, Ancient Cragbeast Matriarch, Ikaav Nysf Lliev, 
      and Ukun Packmaster, the area reserved for Mr. Bakari is almost as big!</p>


      <p>Another refreshingly challenging encounter. Gates of Discord's best 
      asset is the way it has managed to infuse new design elements and 
      innovations in the boss fights unlike almost any before in EQ. Each fight 
      actually feels like a new challenge with elements not seen before or being 
      used in a new way, and we're having a hell of a time learning them and 
      breaking them down.</p>


      <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="shots/highpriestbakari.jpg" width="450" height="273"></p>


      <p>Thanks to our 'friends' in Lotus Cult, Zun Muram Tkarish Zyk, the boss 
      of penultimate zone, is not up which allowed us access to Tacvi, the 
      expansion's final zone. Tacvi seems to be a refreshing departure from the 
      mindless clearing of Txevu and a return to the genius of Inktu'ta. Make 
      the event itself the challenge, and not the mind-numbing clearings, which 
      is what Txevu is chockful of. In Tacvi we ran into this </p>


      <p>Quellious has consistently been one of the busiest of all servers, 
      being the first one with 4 guilds in Elem Planes or 5 in Time etc etc, and 
      then again 4 in Qvic this expansion......... so it's sad to see that 
      multiple events in Txevu have not even been beaten (or even attempted 
      seriously) as the guilds have moved on to Tacvi straight away. I can 
      speak, atleast for myself, that it's not challenge of learning or dying on 
      the events that holds folks back but the mind-numbing clearings and often 
      hard CRs which coupled with the fact that Tacvi and Txevu are farther from 
      a bind point than any end game zones in EQ history makes for one annoying 
      time. Most servers have had guild's pass up completely on one or more of 
      the Txevu events. What a waste of time developing such exclusive content 
      that most of the game won't even see as they won't have access to this 
      zone and then design it in such a way that those few it's developed for, 
      choose to pass up on it as well. </p>


      <p>Lets hope SoE takes the strengths of this expansion, which includes the 
      challenging innovative and fun fights/encounters, and removes all the 
      mistakes they made which includes mind-numbing clearings, blocked 
      progression due to unbalanced content, incredibly tough CRs due to hard 
      access, and too few mob models (something PoP was incredibly rich with).</p>


      <p>Cheers to Wraith / Reviviscence on some well earned progress and it's 
      time to enjoy Tacvi on what seem to be a lot of unique and challenging 
      encounters without the stupid clearings for once.&nbsp; </p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So after dropping this goat, we happily 
      trekked over to try the High Priest event...... which turned out to be 
      bugged. GM intervention proved fruitless and supposedly a lot of servers 
      are experiencing this. So we await for the event to be reset while we work 
      on the other mobs in Txevu, and farm the Aneuks and Ixts. </font></p>

<FONT FACE='Verdana' size="2"> 
      <p>Also managed to do some random other events for added fun including the

      <p>Uqua was a delight to play in a learn, a very fun and zone to raid in, 
      with just the right amount of emphasis on all sorts of skills for any 
      raiding guild to be tested in, be it debuffing, crowd control, raid speed, 
      split-encounters, and ofcourse the all important tanking, healing and agro 
      management.</p>


      <p>If Uqua is an example of the challenges that lie ahead in Gates of 
      Discord and more in Omens of War, with more twists and turns and and 
      unique events, we have a bunch of very fun months coming up! Stay tuned 
      for Qvic and Inktuta updates. Ciao.</p>

      <p>We've started raiding in Uqua and contrary to all expectations we've 
      found the zone a ton of fun. </p>


      <p>To all the guilds who beta-tested it last few months and then got 
      frustrated or even quit, Thank You! We're enjoying the fruits of your 
      labors and are having a fantastic time in the place.</p>


      <p>We haven't been in Uqua for too long but have managed to get atleast 
      far enough to get Mr. Enraged pictured above dead. More news to come from 
      subsequent trips.</p>


      <p><b><a href="http://p209.ezboard.com/fwraith27960frm23">Recruiting:</a></b></p>


      <p>We've re-opened recruiting recently after a 2 month hiatus. We 
      feel we've trimmed down sufficiently from the PoP raid sizes to the ones 
      needed in GoD now to recruit a few active players who want to see high-end 
      EQ and want to raid in GoD.</p>


      <p>Ofcourse, we do like to be guilded with like-minded people. So if you 
      do not like to raid, do not know your class well, do not like to play with 
      skilled players, 











   <FONT  SIZE="-1" face="Verdana" size="2"> 
      do not see yourself playing much in the coming months,

   <FONT  SIZE="-1" face="Verdana" size="2"> 
      do not appreciate good natured conversations, and above all,


      </font>  
      do not know how to have fun in EQ, then this is not the guild for you. If 
      the above does not apply, head on over to the
      <a href="http://p209.ezboard.com/fwraith27960frm23">Recruitment</a> 
      section and follow the guidelines to post an application. </p>


      <p>All classes are welcome to apply but admission will depend on our

      <p>Yes that's the name of the Robin Hood spoof movie but it also happens 
      to be the name of the Wraith / Reviviscence super-group in City of Heroes. 
      I want to give a shout out to all old-timers, inactive and ex-W/R players 
      who I know still check up on this site now and then to hook up with some
      <a href="http://www.menintights.org/">old pals</a> if they are playing or 
      planning to play City of Heroes. I haven't played it, nor am planning to, 
      but apparently these guys have been having some fun. </p>


      <p>Was kind of funny to hear the first thing in /raid chat after Enraged

      <p>The new and improved Keeper of the Altar fell. Ikkinz Raid 4 is a 
      pretty fun and balanced raid now and we enjoyed the event though are still 
      perplexed by the long lockout timers (they're afraid we'll farm too much 
      loot?)</p>


      <p>Unfortunately we were unable to distribute loot this run as the raid 
      timer expired soon after, but we did manage to hand out a lot of juice 
      boxes!</p>


      <p>Full steam ahead!</p>

      <p>The Mindrider was a different fight from pretty much any other mob in 
      the game so was a ton of fun. </p>
      <p>These 3 below on the otherhand were much more straightforward fights, 
      like most PoP encounters. Lets hope they fix the riddle ring (used to open 
      the door to access these primals) so it resets when someone who has 
      triggered and answered a few questions (wrong) and leaves haflway - so we 
      don't get nasty surprises like we did. The spawned golems on incorrect 
      answer had zonewide agro! Ahem! My apologies to Explicit who were merely 
      clearing to Uqua on the otherside of the zone and wiped to those 
      ass-kicking golems.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;The rumors are true. I'm back to EQ to haunt all Quellious raiders once 
      more. Been a week or two and am actually having a blast in GoD *gasp* 
      something which I hear is quite unfashionable to say since as always 
      everyone loves to bash the latest and greatest from SoE. </p>


      <p>Loved the 1-grp trial events, the fact that some semblance of 
      difficulty is back to the game. Bye bye Tranquility/Knowledge and the 
      Graveyards. Welcome back naked corpse recovery runs!</p>


      <p>So far got flagged to Kod'taz and raided with the guild on their first 
      kills of the Ikkinz Raids. Been having fun and especially enjoyed the 
      Transcendence trial which will constitute the news this update. </p>

      <p>Great encounter, lots of fun. And has been the theme of this expansion 
      so far on other guild sites, already the stuff is rotting due to too few 
      slots available. Lets hope the itemization improves. </p>


      <p>So see you all online and ciao.</p>

      <p>So yeah, almost a month since last update.  Probably why I was recruited to start doing them.  I
	promise they'll come in more regularly for all you board trollers.</p>
      <p>What have we been up to?  Well, clearing Time on a regular basis. Still haven't cleared in a single-night
	but won't be much longer.  What else you say?  Well, other than Time we've been battling the DX9 bugs in Gates.
	With most of the guild finally Kod'taz flagged, we're finally trying the Ikkinz raids.</p>
      <p>Now, for those that haven't attempted them yet, let me tell you it's nice to finally be attempting
	the fun stuff in Gates.  Finally after all the anger and frustration of failing Vxed/Tipt/K1-3 over and
	over due to some small mistake (c'mon you know you have!) we are setting foot into the unknown and having a
	blast!</p>
      <p>I was unable to get a screenshot from the first raid but here's my one and only shot from the second.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/Glorification.jpg" width="504" height="378"> </p>
      <p>Grats to Thrilos and Gurunt on their brand new Jagged Onyx Staffs of 
      Gay Graphicness and expect another update with more screenshots soon. 
      Ciao!</p>

      <p>Due to the national shortage of juice boxes, I will keep this update short and sweet (more short than sweet). <BR> Quarm dies.. Yay!</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/QuarmDead3.jpg" width="516" height="467"> </p>
      <p>The picture below was taken very shortly after the 4 headed pound puppy died.</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/QuarmDead1.jpg" width="458" height="199"></p>
      <p>If you look closely, you will see Rurark stripping his clothes off.  Being an astute observer, it was obvious he was suffering from a case of "Dawgeth Corpus" or which is better known as "puppy love".  There was only one thing to do, and we had to act quickly.  We took the very last juice box from the Wraith/Rev reserve and we proceeded to hose Rurark down.  The "holy juice box", as it has been dubbed, saved Wraith/Reviv this most horrific event, that was about to take place. </p>
	<BR>
	<p> Anyway, we are all coping with this current state of juice affairs.  The tree suicide rate has jumped dramatically. This is due to Druids being less prone to tree-hugging, due to the ill-mood this juice box drought has brought to Druids. Also suffering, from
    ill-mooded casters, are wizard's familiars.  Quesci’s Familiar was quoted as saying “I hope this juice box shortage end’s soon.  I am not sure how much more of her
    *****ing I can take”. </p>
<BR><p>This national juice box shortage has taken its toll, but there is a glimmer of hope.  We have inside information that in the depths of
      Kodtaz, there is the mother of all juice reserves.  That’s right, there has been visual confirmation that there are multiple kegs of
      Cherry-lime-ade being guarded deep with-in Kodtaz.  As you would expect
      Wraith/Revivience has gone full tilt on getting flagged for, as we come to call it, "the promise land". Hopefully, we will soon have the force to liberate the oppressed juice.  Stay Tuned.

      <p>VZ's time finally ended to Wraith/Rev.. I believe we killed him on our first attempt this run..  Below is Vallon's Corpse... Well not his whole corpse, just his dead ass feet.</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/VZCORPSE.jpg" width="631" height="243"> </p>
      <p>After this kill, the officers handed juice boxes to everyone for a job well done.. After we announced the juice box distribution, this was the reaction:</p> 
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/GUILDVZDEADsm.jpg" width="492" height="713"></p>
      <p> On a side note I would like to thank the Wraith/Reviv anti-terrorism agency for their exceptional chat black out skillz.</p>
      <Br>
      <p> Anyway after juice boxes we all had to take a nap.. but after nap time we were ready for blood..  We promptly amputated Cazic Thule's many appendages. </p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/CTsm.jpg" width="488" height="559"></p>
      <p> Then all Hell broke loose.. Arariana asked for a rod in chat.. Rurark and Branoic, who most likely had 1 too many juice boxes,  both wanted to give her a rod.. Mages are known for their fiery temper, so it was no surprise that this situtation soon came to fist-a-cuffs. Because of this, the raid ended and both mages lost their juice box privileges..  But the next night, Bertox fell relatively easily and then Rallos Zek was in our sights </p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/RZsm.jpg" width="596" height="614"></p>
      <p> Lets please witness a moment of silence for all the mage pets who lost their lives to bring us this picture. </p>
      <p> With a push of the *RALLOS ZEK INC* hotkey and with flawless tank switches, the pet's lives were not lost in vein </p>
      <p><img border="0" src="shots/RZDead.jpg" width="615" height="461"></p>
      <p> I am officially renaming "Rallos Zek the Warlord" to "Rallos Zek the Snow Angel". Anyway, we gave Inny a try but we ran out of time..  We left time with only Inny and the 4 head dog still breathing... Till next time!</P> <BR>Viva Wraith/Reviv !!!
