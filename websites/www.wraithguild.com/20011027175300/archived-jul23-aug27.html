Seems like alot of people, quality people have decided to throw in their towls. Sad as it may be, lives evolve from Everquest, and would like to take this oppertunity during the news update to greet those people one last time. Havusin, Thuulsa, Muffo, Mandrax, Clawgrip, Disruptor, Oraa, Annalyse, Burl, Kalsto, Leonardo, Ramit, Growls, topping it off with a few de-tags as well. Message board was screaming for updates, i havn't found the motivation to play everquest since last week, and from what i have been able to read, not alot of exiting has been done from our part during the weekend. Assuming some random epic quests and similar. The norwegian community is also getting smaller by day with the departure of two of the oldest ones.</p>						<p>Not exactly the update some of you had in mind im sure, but that's reality at the moment.</p>						<p><font color="red" size="4">Plane of Sky Cleared - Nineveh, August 22nd</font></p>						<p>The last three isles was cleared today in search of the Crown of Elemental Mastery. Would like to take this opportunity to thank the creator of the magician epic quest for giving us the chance of visiting isle seven, can never fight enough drakes these days. Two of our magicians needed their crowns, and a grand total of two crowns dropped upon clearing the isle. I believe Jama is well under way turning in his random pieces all across Norrath as i am writing this update in order to complete his orb of mastery, congrats as well to Aethina on the second one. Having fought all the way up to isle seven, it would be a shame not to kill the Eye of Veeshan while we had the chance. One of the more popular events when in the plane of sky is naturally the prediction of the upcoming dt's.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/dt.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Zenfe as the picture also displays had an almost 100% accurate prediction record, and also had the timing down to a split second, amazing what the plane of air can bring out in a player. As mentioned in yesterday's update, Wilkion obtained the silk cape from the Keeper of Souls, and his final piece was none other then the far from epic fight in lake rathe. Congrats Wilkion on his scythe of the shadowed souls. We also recieved a complaint from the CaCd ( Canadians against Canadian discrimination ) in regards to our nickname for Zenfe yesterday, and we have promised to refrain from posting similar propaganda in the future.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/wilkion.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<blockquote>							<p></p>						</blockquote>						<p><font color="red" size="4">Plane of Sky - Nineveh, August 21st</font></p>						<p>Has been a quiet last couple of days, working on small epic pieces, Yasunaga recently finished his celestial fists, other then that not really much worth mentioning. Tonight we visited the plane of sky in search for more epic pieces. Airplane isnt really the nightmare its rumoured to be, atleast when its not spent merely on isle five in search of the damned spiroc wingblade. Wilkion finally obtained his cape for the necromancer epic, and Guukal got his spiroc wingblade for the warrior one. On the educational note we all learned that Zenfe is in fact a Canadian, and has been given a proper nickname, CaCw, contact Zenfe or Airik in-game for further details!

Needless to say this would also mean that our good friend Jorellag would visit the temple of veeshan once more this weekend. TOV seems to be a popular playground lately, with more than 100 people present during the entire weekend, our biggest problem today was the large amount of linkdead people as a result of every single pull. The server maintenance aftermath also seemed to increase the lag we all experienced, for some odd reason. Despite our connectivity problems the Jorellag fight went rather well, sadly enough when looking at our recent news update, i notice that Desi has been bold enough to post the name and stats of the items from Jorellag, ruining my whole project of foh-cloaking the drops. Drops of the night was a Crown, Earring and greaves. Decided not to attempt any other named dragons due to the constant lack of players thanks to linkdeaths, more to come during the week.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/jorellag3.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p><font color="red" size="4">ToV getting Wraithed - Desi, August 18th</font></p>						<p><font color="white">We all had a great time in N ToV today and a lot wonderful drops.

August 17th</font></p>						<p>Dain Frostreaver IV graced Quellious with his presence tonight. What you are about to see is live coverage from the actual fight. Dain was discovered wearing.. a lollipop. Im uncertain at this time what was going on in the private chambers of the coldain king, the servant girl was far from cooperative when confronted with this delicate issue.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/dainlolly.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Despite the oddity Dain fell to the force gathered in icewell, and drops of the night were as follows. Jama was the lucky recipient of the head, an aegis of ice was given to Spellquestor and a hammer to Poizn</p>						<p>Venril Sathir was reported up in Karnor's Castle, thus we headed there in hopes of getting a gnarled staff.

August 15th</font></p>						<p>Plane of fear was on the agenda post of the patch, and for mysterious reasons currently unknown, planning a raid in fear seems to almost make retired players reinstall eq and attend the raid. The turnout, only surpassed by one raid this summer, none other then the previous Cazic raid, by a grandtotal of two or so in favor of the earlier visit to this plane. All the right classes present, the numbers more than enough, Cazic Thule dead with minimal problems. Loot of the night was 3 copies of the bile etched chocker ( Haans, Talen &amp; Aesir ) and a fearsome cloak ( Brutalone ). The bard best of the best tournament was also held on Quellious today, none of our own bards entered unfortunately, the winner Linaren from Shadows of the Unseen, congratulations on a very impressive victory. Also a huge thanks to Sadara who kept me updated with live play by play from the Arena. -Nineveh</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/cazic2.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>After Cazic we headed over to some caster loot from Mr. Velketor.

August 13th</font></h3>						<p>Zordacius Ragefire, dreaded bottleneck of the cleric epic quest was found alive and hidden within the shell of a human merchant in Solusek B today. Despite it being quite early we had an adequate force to help our cleric Guelah kill this beast and obtain his Water Sprinkler of Neh Ank? Never knew how to spell that name. Congrats again, just a minor midday update. Unfortunately the norwegian isps acted up during the fight, and the mage ks team failed to accomplish their mission.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/zordak.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<h3><font color="red" size="4">Klan, NTov - Nineveh. August 12th</font></h3>						<p>Today was originally set aside for North Wing TOV, but mere minutes after settling within the wing, rumours about a certain Klandicar spawn was whispered amongst the channels, thus the zone was left in search of another sleepers key. Klandicar went down and this time the sleepers visum was given to the crazy cleric himself.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/klandicar3.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Returning to the temple of veeshan we noticed Jorellag had popped from our last encounter, and lacking a few important people for our main goal, we decided to give Jorellag an attempt. 3 new drops, and a solid victory.

And since the first time we've killed the Gimpicator, we've always followed it with the Statue. This time being no different. The second time we faced the dual weilding statue and this time he gave up <a href="shots/Statue-BP-Eradication-new.jpg">BPs</a> for Brutalone and Shamson and <a href="shots/Statue-Hammer.jpg">hammers</a> for Ramit and Choppa in a solid kill with only some recruits biting the dust. Hope you're having a great weekend. Ciao.&nbsp;</p>						<h3><font color="red" size="4">Dragonslaying - Nineveh. August 9th</font></h3>						<p>During the last few days we have been taking things easy, working on some random epic quests. Had an interesting fight against Ixiblat Fer, slowed and snared on inc and dead within seconds, times certainly have changed since the opening of Kunark. Speaking of evolution and progress, Klandicar was discovered within western wastes, and from what i was told, still being at work, the early europeans and the late americans sacrificed a few hours of sleep to get this done, congrats to Dachunker on the talisman. Zlandicar was next on the agenda, a fight which improved alot from the last encounter. Zlandicar's Talisman was given to Thuulsa, heart of Zlandicar to Quos, Frakadar's Talisman (Shroud of the Dar Brood) to Kalsto, cracked claw of Zlandicar to Trabieso, and a shard which i honestly dont remember who got.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/zlandicar2.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Nnight is still young, more raids planned tonight, just thought i would sneak in a brief update while waiting on the relocation of our forces, stay tuned.</p>						<h3><font color="red" size="4">North Wing TOV - Nineveh. August 5th</font></h3>						<p>Plans for the weekend turned out to be bigger then what we could gather people online for. Due to limited turnouts our previously scheduled weekend was set aside and it was decided we should try some named mobs within the north wing. Jorellag was the first challenge After giving him a testrun the tactics for this fight was prepared and the next encounter with the white dragon ended victorious. The first real dragon of north wing defeated, in another Quellious first. Drops were distributed. Rest of the Sunday was spent learning spawntimes, pathing and similar.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/jorellag.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Unfortunately it was a rather quiet weekend after sharing our stories of Jorellag, so weekends update will be short one.</p>						<h3><font color="red" size="4">Recent Activities - Nineveh. August 3rd</font></h3>						<p>Desi has been busy with real life activities lately and thus been held from frequently updating this news page, in his absence ill try to keep you all updated on what we have been up to on Quellious lately. Not sure on the exact date, patchday atleast, and we got the turnout of the century and finally dropped the upgraded version 2.0 of Cazic Thule. Everyone did an amazing job, especially the clerics, and the clerics was also the class smiling best post the fight. 3 x Halo given to Oraa, Redlance and Havusin.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/ctloot.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>The journey towards Sleepers Tomb has begun at a steady pace, Klandicar was first to fall of the many keyholders to the Veeshan's Peak of Velious. Encountered him two times within the last few days, talismans awarded to Jagg and Muffo.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/klandicar.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Believe it or not but we actually found a dragon within necropolis! We have been after Zlandicar awhile, but unfortunately until this date we have never had an oppertunity to fight him. Zlandicar's Talisman and further accsess to sleepers went to Kelle, Desaran recieved the Frakadar's Talisman, a cowl of mortality went to Sizare who was still up and kicking at 4pm est, no sleep the night before, along with quite a few other of our american members, thanks for sticking it out, meant alot to get the job done. Hurtun was finally given the dragonclaw shard.</p>					</div>					<center>						<p><img border="0" src="shots/zlandicar.jpg"></p>					</center>					<div align="left">						<p>Last but not least we have been working more on our Yelinak strategy: killing the white dragon lord, and our last attempt went well, hopefully we can display another dragon corpse at this page very soon.
