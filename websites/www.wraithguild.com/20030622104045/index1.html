                           <p>So after working on the event about a week or so we finally managed to bring 
down Xegony. I say finally because IMO this is a pretty anal encounter. It's all 
about executing with an acute attention span. The fight lasted about an hour for 
us. Fact is there's almost no way you can guarantee complete heals between every 
round from Xegony for an hour and 2 consecutive bad rounds can kill any tank in 
the game. So you have to hope that the healing is on target and nothing too 
freakish happens. I guess that's where gear etc comes in (to increase the 
chances of successfully surviving bad rounds and sustain faster healing 
indefinitely). All in all it's definitely a team effort and an encounter we 
enjoyed breaking down and conquering. And there was the familiar rush from 
another challenged offed.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/Xegony-053103.jpg" width="500" height="209"> </p>
<p>Managed to pick up 2 robes (vests rather) from her and were also lucky to 
pick up some plate legs. I'm sure this encounter will becomes lots simpler as we 
continue to gear up. </p>
<p>In other news we managed to find a lot of mobs up in Fire that we had yet to 
take out and so down they must go. The new versions of Pyonis, birds, generals 
weren't much different. Reparm had been over-rated in some of the boards I read 
and he was definitely a push over. Babnoxis proved to be more interesting but 
still went down without much ado once we adapted our strat a little.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/babnoxis-052003.jpg" width="400" height="210"></p>
<p>The best challenges came from Blazaxx the Omnifiend and Arch Mage Yozanni. 
Arguably both these mobs are harder than Fennin Ro now, atleast that's what I 
thought. Some pretty whacked RvR for sure. Here's a 
<a href="shots/blazaxx-052403-large.jpg">very large pic</a> of Blazaxx in 
all his glory as he taught us a lesson in the earlier run before we managed to 
best him, but barely. Since then we killed him again and more smoothly, though 
the RvR is still pretty whacked compared to almost any other mob in the elem 
planes, except Arch Mage Yozanni.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/blazaxx-052403.jpg" width="400" height="188"></p>
<p>The new Arch Mage Yozanni was a ton of fun to figure out. We tried some 
pretty whacky off-the-road stuff with some hilarious results before we managed 
to put together various elements from all the runs to put him down. The guy is 
absolutely a beast but a very fun fight to learn, adapt and execute. Though he 
went down, his RvR is also pretty out of whack. Definitely a fight that gets 
much easier once you have the right strategy for it. </p>
<p>Also managed to revenge the new Groihin the Wise in Plane of Water, another 
mob with stupid RvR. No wonder he's always left up. Dropped just one item for 
us, the so-so bard lute. Ummmm yeah. What's up with that? Not even 2 loots on 
this stupid mob with 2k quad + ramps + AE of&nbsp; 2kdmg/5sec stun that's pretty 
much unresistable, not to mention the leet ability of all named in Plane of 
Water to port ppl to the zone in or bind spot if they touch a wall at certain 
angles. Fun fun. It's not that he was much hard but the RvR on him is so stupid. 
We'll probably be looking to venture more in Water / Earth in the coming weeks 
(duh) so stay tuned for more updates in that regard. </p>
<p>Also managed to go up to hate late night and took out the new Maestro. He's 
like a Tier 1 PoP mob strength now, maybe slightly weaker, but definitely in the 
same vein (scripted event, low hps, etc etc). Dropped some loot in line with the 
fight, comparable to other Tier 1 PoP drops. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="shots/maestro-052603.jpg" width="400" height="139"></p>
<p>Also took a shot at the new Inny but having no prior info we were taken by 
surprise by what was held in store for us. Blowable events suck. Now that we 
know what to expect from him we'll go back sometime when free to take him down 
atleast once. Hope he drops something decent. </p>
<p>Cheers Wraith/Reviviscene on Xegony! Ciao.</p>
