            these rules. Also they should know and keep to the spirit of the 
            Charter. </b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>All guild members must obey Verant's code 
            of conduct. (i.e no KSing, no intentional training, no harrasment, 
            no fake trades). We support Verant’s “play nice” rules and encourage 
            all of our members to peacefully and equitably work out camp sharing 
            or grouping issues. If this is not possible, then contact a Guild 
            Officer or Guild Leader. Always keep in mind that the guild's reputation 
            is dependant upon YOUR actions.</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>This guild was created to help everybody 
            have fun and enjoy Everquest. If the guild isn’t going in the direction 
            you had in mind, please talk to someone in the guild about it and 
            make your feelings known. If it’s a matter involving a particular 
            guild mate inform a Guild Officer of the situation. Part of the 
            reason why people are chosen to become a guild officer is because 
            they are willing to listen and ready to do something about any issue 
            the guild and its members may face. </b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>The guild is open to characters of any 
            race or class, but you must have proven your dedication by reaching 
            level 30 or higher. Any guild member is free to bring in new members. 
            The new, want-to-be member needs to be introduced to any one of 
            the officers. The potential member is also asked to introduce him/herself 
            on the Guild message boards. After all Officers have decided, the 
            new member will be asked to join for a trial period of two weeks. 
            After the trial period, the member is either welcomed into the guild 
            or is politely asked to leave. Reasons of denial will be given in 
            a personal and private way to all persons involved.</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>No profanity in Guild Chat, OOC, Shout, 
            Auction or anywhere. Everyone is human and that at times we all 
            need to vent, but our guild is one with a range of ages and backgrounds, 
            so foul language is not needed. Remember that not all guild members 
            speak, write or read English as a first language, so always try 
            to be as clear as possible so everyone understands. </b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>The guild is here to help one another, 
            but do not expect guild members to provide their services whenever 
            you ask. If you are looking for a port, a buff or other assistance, 
            please ask politely in guild chat, stating what zone you are in. 
            Do not spam - if you get no reply, don't ask again for at least 
            10 minutes. If someone can help, they will send you a tell. If they 
            are busy, then respect that. The people you are asking have just 
            as much right to play the game with no interruptions as you do. 
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>We are not a Twinking guild. Do not expect 
            the guild or any of our members to twink you or you lower level 
            alts. We are aware that twinking is tempting but its hard to prevent. 
            Also is it hard to determine what amount of twinking is fair or 
            unfair.</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>Items can be given to you or an alt by 
            the guild but this will be done on a 'Need before Greed' and 'Can 
            Use, Will Use' basis. You are expected to replace the item from 
            the guild with a similar item that then can be handed down to a 
            other guildmember. </b></font></p>
            <p><font color="black"><b>Any item given to you by the guild is 
            to be handed down to another member of the guild or returned to 
            the Guild Bank when you outgrow it. It is in no way to be sold inside 
            or outside the Guild. Items given from the guild bank will be appropriate 
            for the character's level. Any item given to the Guild for use in 
            the Guild Bank will remain property of the guild. However, if you 
            inform us when donating it, we can and will return the item to you 
            if you ask for it back.</b></font></p>
