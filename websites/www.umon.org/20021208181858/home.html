  <h1>The United Might of Norrath on Sullon Zek</h1>
  <p>Welcome to UMON's newly revived Offcial web space. UMON is a good alligned 
    guild that seeks to peacefully co-exist with our neutral neighbours, so that 
    effort and resources can be conserved for the ultimate war against evil. </div>

  <h1>A long Awaited Update...</h1>
  <p>Well it's about time I got this done, it will be a work in progress over the coming week but we should have an up-to-date site by the end of it.</p>
  <p>Also with Planes of Power looming ahead of us I would strongly recommend to any European players to go take a look at <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">Castersrealm</a> for the rather anoying info about the European release and the new European version of EQ. I can't help but wonder what is going therough the heads of the people at Sony since they seem to want to segregate everyone off into their little corners of the world.</p>

  <h1>Mutual Efforts</h1>
  <p>A couple of months ago a large amount of tradeskill recipies were added in 
    one of the patches. Along with the recipies was an interesting quest involving 
    tradeskills, which results in a powerful Druid Spell and an earring for Druids, 
    which can be traded in for one for other classes (useful mainly for casters 
    as it has Flowing Thought I)</p>
  <p>Belrain, Uzeldin and myself thing the guild has sufficient tradeskill ability 
    to be able to do this quest, and hopefully do it multiple times. I also think 
    it is something we can get everyone involved with as it requires a lot of 
    component farming, forraging and collection which everyone can help with. 
    There is a good guide to the quest on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm">EQ 
    Traders</a> which goes into great detail. I am also going to start a thread 
    for the quest on the forums, so everyone can say whether they want to be involved 
    and which parts they think they can help with, the eventual goal of course 
    being to complete the quest once for everyone involved (probably twice for 
    the druids).</p>
  <p>A goal we can achieve relatively easily I think, so I hope you'll join in 
    the fun.</p>

  <h1>Sad News</h1>
  <p>Priyme, a longstanding member and officer of the guild, has decided it is 
    time to part company and follow his own path. I'm sure his presence will be 
    missed by everyone.</p>

  <h2>[News] June 25<sup>th</sup></h2>
  <p>This is some none guild related news, but I was pleased to see it so I thought 
    I would bring it to the attention of the rest of you, who may not have time 
    to browse the rest of the net for news.</p>
  <p>Below we have a link to an image of the fabled new and improved 'User Interface'. 
    Yup thats right, a little sneak peak at what VI have in store for us later 
    on. I have read many of the message boards about this screen shot and alot 
    of people are jumping to conclusions, moaning and saying "is that all for 
    a years work?" but I think its worth while to note that this is but ONE screen 
    shot and from a personal point of view, it is great and if this is just one 
    area I really cant wait to this what they have done with the rest.</p>
  <p>So without further ado here is the link <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/interface/" target="_blank">http://eqlive.station.sony.com/interface/</a> 
    - cheers</p>

  <p>The Forums are broke again. This is getting very frustrating. I am trying 
    to avoid a reinstall but it's looking more and more likely... I'll let you 
    all know what happens.</p>

  <p>Well I kinda made my deadline. The Forums are now fully open (even though 
    some people have already jumped the gun and posted!). The style is quite whaa 
    I had in mind, but as Uzeldin will testify customisind the look fully was 
    a nightmare job... so I gave up in the end and downloaded a pre-constucted 
    colour scheme from the same place I got the boards. Hope you all like the 
    result.</p>

  <p>The Forums are back!</p>
  <p>But, before you get too excited, they are currently locked so all you can 
    do is create your account (see below) and send private messages to others 
    that have already done so. The reason for this is that I want to fiddle a 
    bit and make the look of the forums a bit more in-keeping with the main site 
    before they go live and people get used to them. I have set myself a deadline 
    of Sunday to have them fully functional - lets see how well I stick to it!</p>
  <p>Account creation is pretty simple. Use your Sullon Zek character name so 
    we can identify everyone, anyone who doesn't do this will find their accounts 
    deleted, and provide a valid email address please. The reson for the latter 
    is that there is a nifty little feature that allows me to mail the entire 
    members list should the need arrise, which may prove useful on occasion. Other 
    than that please be patient, everything should be back to fully working order 
    soon.</p>
  <p>On another note, the members list now needs a lot of work with the influx 
    of people joining over the last week, so I'll need some help getting details 
    and pictures. Details by e-mail or on the forums please as I always loose 
    the little bits of paper I try to make notes on during play! If you want to 
    take a picture and send it to me... great! The trick is to use the '/shownames 
    off' command, switch to fullscreen mode (press f10 till all the windows disapear) 
    then press the minus key on the numeric keypad to take the picture. I find 
    it is actually more difficult that taking a real photograph cos getting the 
    positioning right is a bit tricky. Pictures are saved as .bmp files in your 
    EQ directory, so convert them to .jpg (you may need to zip them as well) and 
    then send them along through email. Easy huh?</p>

  <h2>[News] June 12<sup>th</sup></h2>
  <p>After a wee bit of time (and a bind death loop boredom experience) we have 
    finally got Umonstore up and running. Umonstore is an alternate character 
    of mine whos sole purpose in his EQ life is to store ALL of your old items 
    and save up donations from guild members. The idea behind this, is to store 
    any items which you no longer use, so that we can hand them out to some of 
    our newer guild members. The donations side of things is to handle the considerable 
    cost of getting stones for future raids to the planes.</p>
  <p>If this all goes to plan we should have a system where by our guild members 
    hand down any item(s) which their character has out-grown, or replaced, to 
    someone else who may need an improved or totally new item. Not only that but 
    Umonstore can store all of our resist based items, which you yourselves may 
    not have room for, and then when it comes the time for a raid to the planes 
    we can hand out whichever item is appropriate (FR, PR, MR, CR, DR etc)</p>
  <p>Umonstore is currently located at the Bazaar on the moon, so grab all your 
    old items, and sift through your old things and get them up to Umonstore.<br>
    Cheers</p>

  <p>Well, we're finally back up and running, thanks, in no small part, to Uzeldin's 
    efforts in the design and constuction of these new pages.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately when original server crashed it took everything that had been 
    posted on the forums with it so we'll have to star again from scratch there, 
    and hopefully this time they will see a bit more use, particularly for the 
    planning of groups/raids which we are slowly beginning to wrap our heads around.</p>
  <p>If you have any comments, criticisms or requests about the content of these 
    pages please post them on the forums.</p>
