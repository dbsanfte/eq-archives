  Michael was born in Orange, California on January 11, 1970.
  After his father returned from the Vietnam war he was taken
  to Fulda, Germany for a 3 year tour.  Being the son of an
  army pilot did have its interesting side to life.  After
  Germany, the family moved to Torrance, California for a bit,
  then out to Fort Rucker, Alabama.  Michael spent the next 6
  years here running through the woods, building forts, and
  generally having a pretty good time.  Once the two tours in
  Alabama were up, the family then moved off to Hawaii for a
  while.  It was always interesting to be the white boy.  He
  definately learned what it is like to be the minority there.
  Michael does miss the mountain climbing and the diving that
  he did there on occasion though.  Once the Hawaiian tour was
  over in 1985, Michael headed off to Oak Creek Ranch School
  (boarding school) in West Sedona Arizona.  This place was
  about 25 miles from the nearest town.  Not exactly a kicking
  place on a Friday night by any stretch of the imagination.
  Beautifull country, a lot of horseback riding, hiking, trav-
  elling, etc, but not a lot of people live out in the desert.
  After a year at OCRS Michael headed out to the New Mexico
  Military Institute.  This was an interesting year of changes.
  Eating square meals, wearing uniforms, being generally deg-
  raded to a non-person for a year tends to put things in per-
  spective.  Once the fun at NMMI was over, Michael decided to
  go to Oregon for a while and see what the people up in the
  NorthWest were like.  It is very art oriented up there.
  Generally not the best place to find work in the technical
  side of life, but it is a nice place to live and Bend, Oregon
  has excellent skiing!  After checking out Oregon, it
  was off to Dallas, Texas.  Once in Dallas, Michael finished
  off his BS degree in Computer Information Systems with Summa
  Cum Laude, took an 6000 mile trip covering the 14 western 
  states and 2 western Canadian provinces, got married, had 4 
  kids, got a position with GTE in Irving, Texas, and generally
  settled down.  About a year into his time at GTE, an offer
  came along that he just couldn't resist.  Almost double his
  salary and lots of stock to make games.  Pretty simple.  He
  jumped ship from GTE and went to make games!  Well, not all
  that glimmers is golden.  The company was 7th Level.  It was
  actually quite a great job.  We had lots of fun, blew lots of
  money, ate steak, ribs and lobster.  But, the company did not
  survive the leadership at the top and none of our 100+ hour
  work weeks were going to be able to compensate.  It was a
  little depressing after giving up days off for 4+ months,
  working 7 days a week, working 100+ hour weeks to have the guys
  at the top throw it all away.  That was one heck of a team that
  put the games together though.  Michael has not seen such ded-
  ication in an office, before or since.  As they used to say at
  the New Mexico Military Institute... "You just gotta love it!"
  After 7th Level layed off its staff, Michael took a few months
  off (To recuperate), then began again at Multimedia Learning
  Inc. as a Software Engineer.  Well, as luck would have it,
  Multimedia Learning Inc. was aquired by the Thomson Corporation.
  Hence another end to an interesting place.  Michael then went to
  work as a software engineer for Mik & Associates, a dallas
  based custom and point of sale system software company.  After
  about a year at Mik's place, the company had a little downturn
  in its ethics so Michael went off to play around with DSL
  modems for a while.  As the markets tanked, so did DSL.  Off
  he went again, searching for the next adventure!
