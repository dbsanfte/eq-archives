<p align="center"><font color="#66FF99" size="2" face="century gothic,arial,verdana">Dark Age of Camelot.  This game is stunning.  The textures, the animations, the combat system are all superb.  The character models are really sharp looking.  Most NPC's I've talked too offer some type of story or history of who they are or where they are from.  Generally suggesting you to talk to another NPC for more information which sometimes results in a quest.  Mostly newbie quests so far.  Resulting in coin and experience.  There is one I finished that rewarded a dagger.  Though I had a better weapon at the time.</p>
<p>Deciding which character to play was the hardest part of starting this game.  There are three different realms to choose from.  Each has its own races and classes to choose from. <a href="/foh/fohimages/camelot1.jpg"><img align="left" alt="This is the capitol of Hibernia" border="0" src="/foh/fohimages/camelot1.jpg" width="200" height="140"></a> Some classes are similar but vary slightly depending on which realm you choose to join.  After you decide which realm to be a part of, you then decide which base class you will play.  After you gain a few levels you then choose your proper class.  For instance, I started as a stalker class in the realm Hibernia.  After I hit level five I had the choice to become a ranger or a nightshade(rogue-like)  Those five levels gave me a little time to get accustomed to my skills. I decided which ones I wished to develop and choose my class accordingly.  The nightshade is the path I decided to follow.</p>
<p>As you level, you gain training points that you can apply to your skills vital to your class.  Using my class as an example, I can train in piercing, blades and staves(staffs) for my weapon choices.  The more training points I put into these skills, the more special attacks are available to me.  In EQ my special as a rogue was Backstab.  In DAoC, I get backstab as well as other special moves to use with my piercing weapons.  And when wielding a blade and a piercer at the same time, other special moves open up to me as well, when I advance my dual weild skill.  This makes sense in the ways of RPG'ing a character.  Why wouldn't you learn advanced moves as you progressed?  Sure, EQ has them post 50, but the refresh time on them (upwards of an hour) is just plain silly.  These special moves you aquire in DAoC are not unlimited however.  You have an endurance bar similar to the stamina bar from EQ.  As you perform your special moves some of your endurance is used up.  When it is all gone you can no longer do your specials.  And when your endurance is gone, you cannot sprint from danger.  Sprint?  yes..sprint. </p>
<p>Some characters have "SoW" like abilities.  But every character here has a sprint ability.  This is dependant on your endurance level.  The more endurance you have the further you can sprint.  That makes sense...  So, if you are going after a somewhat difficult mob, you have to gauge how many specials to use vs. how much endurance you wish to keep in case you need to make a run for it.  It does appear that you can out run the critters.  And when I have it seems to clear your aggro with them as well.</p>
<p>Zones are scarce.  There are only two that I have found.  One into the capitol of Hibernia and another into a dungeon.  Load times were on par with EQ load times.  And were flawless everytime.  There is quite a bit of land to cover.  And it is detailed, alive and colorful.  As I run along the paths or through the pastures, the landscape <a href="/foh/fohimages/camelot3.jpg"><img align="right" alt="The ranger is pulling and I'm ready for action!" border="0" src="/foh/fohimages/camelot3.jpg" width="200" height="140"></a>looks vast and without end.  The small towns scattered throughout the realm greet you with music and stone markers telling you where you have journeyed too.  At night, light can be seen peeking through doors and windows and crickets come out to chirp incessantly.  You will only find undead at night as well it seems.  They go into hiding as the sun comes up.  Lighting effects are also handled rather well.  Everyone gets a "torch" as a light source which never expires.  It comes in handy at night and in dungeons I imagine.  The trees of the forests are well done and the wild grasses, ferns, and flowers that one might expect to be in the forest are all placed accordingly.  As I run through the trees my view is often obstructed by the tall grasses.  There are many other touches to the scenery and animations that just have to be seen to appreciate.  You can tell that there was plenty of attention applied to the smaller details.</p>
<p>I started a caster to get a taste of the magic system.  He hasn't hit lvl 5 yet so he still has some basic spells.  And as I leveled I aquired new spells.  There is no need to buy the spells.  You have them open up to you as you level.  And as you progress and add skill points to that magic class your spells will get stronger.  They upgrade themselves.  Long gone are the days of the spell book and 40 lower level spells stashed in the back.  Never to be used again.  Though I haven't played a high end caster, the down time was nill.  Plenty of mana(power) to do my work.  However, casting during battle was tedious.  Casters definitly need tanks.  So they can stand back and nuke.</p>
<p>There are tradeskills as well.  I have yet to start that aspect of the game.  But I can see there are weapon and armor smiths as well as fletchers and tailors. <a href="/foh/fohimages/camelot5.jpg"><img border="0" align="left" src="/foh/fohimages/camelot5.jpg" alt="Romil plays a song, which we can hear, as we rest up from a scuffle with a critter." width="200" height="140"></a> Another neat feature is the dye system.  Anyone can dye their armor.  You simply by the dye from a vendor.  Then click the dye bottle on your armor.  Of course, black and purple are very expensive.  So it will be some time before we see anyone in Black armor, 30 gold per bottle.  Doesn't sound like alot?  Trust me.  If you have 1 gold in this game, you are rich.  100 copper=1 silver, 100 silver=1 gold, 1000(yes thousand) gold= 1 platinum, 1000 platinum = 1 mithril.  Back to  my point, Dying your armor so easily is a nice treat.</p>
<p>The object of this world is Realm vs. Realm.  From what I've read, you can build seige engines in the later game and take on the realms in a war of sorts.  Lay seige to their castles.  Capture special Artifacts which give your realm certain abilities to all inhabitants as long as your realm has ownership of the relic.   This is intriguing to me.  I'm anxious to see the high-end game here.
<p>Let me wrap this up.  This could go on for awhile, you know how I can get ;p</p>
<p>This game has some great features.  Such as the class features, the skill points and abilities.  Visually, it is romping EQ.  For now anyway(Shadow of Luclin).  I feel that this game is one notch down from EQ.  Though superior in many ways, EQ has a certain depth that I have yet to see in this game.  It is far better than Anarchy Online.  And is one of the most stable MMORPG I have ever played at launch.  Not a single bug have I found yet.  No crashes or hangs, smooth all around.  If you are a hardcore player, this game is a nice escape from the tedium of EQ.  Very little downtime, fast action and great visuals.  After I have a few more levels my views may change.  But so far, I see good things to come out of this one.  It was well worth my time so far.</p><p align="center">~Sauronis</P>
