<p>Things have certainly changed here at Founders of Honor. We have new leadership and have gained some new members. Kutter has chosen to step back and become more of a player, while I decided to step up and lead the guild. We will be seeing Kutter around and he should truly be more relaxed now! Some of our members have achieved the goal of being over 50; myself, Sphinn, Laris, and Jrod, to name some. Plus we have the thrill of our first FoH member to achieve the ultimate goal of 60. Congratulations Kineada!!! We are hot on your heals and I hope to report more lvl 60 Founders soon. I have laid the plans for many adventures for us, so keep coming back for more reports!!<p>
