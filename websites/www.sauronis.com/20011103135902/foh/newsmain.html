<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya, I hear there is some pretty cool stuff going down at Lake Rathe.  Bryng tells me that an AC9 +7INT robe rotted there last night when he was abusing some of the critters there.  It was ND and there was no one around who could use it.  Any of us get out that way and see anything decent?  Let us know!</p>
<p>I added some DAoC screen shots to the gallery.  If you play DAoC and get some good shots, send them to me.  I'll put em up.</p>
<p>Worked on the Roster a bit.  I need info though on who is what level and who is new to the guild.  I've got a handful of pics to work up for the gallery as well.  I should have them up in the next few days.  I'd like to have some individual shots of everyone if I can so I can update the members section.  Here's a scary thought, how about a RL photo section? eh?  Are you brave enough?  hehe...</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">A new month, a new leader!  Kineada was voted in last night as our new leader.  Let's be gentle with him as he gets a handle on things.  Also note that there will be big changes for the guild in the weeks to come.  I look forward to seeing where we will go from here.  Kineada will do a fine job.  It takes input from everyone though to make a successful guild.  Tight leadership too.  So, to those that remain in the guild, step up.  Let's here what you have to say.  To our officers, old and new, this is the time to come forward and help take charge.  Consider the guild re-born.  What will tomorrow bring?</p>
<p>As for me, right now I remain an officer.  I will be working a lot behind the scenes on the site and will try to be around for raids and the like.  I'm always around though.  If you have a question, issue or problem, I'm still here.  Send me an email, contact me in game if you can..I'm always willing to listen.  Never give up on FoH, we're here to stay.  We're over a year old now.  Though we aren't in the ranks of other big guilds, we hold our own.  Many other guilds have fallen to the way side.  Many that were bigger than us.  Some that were off-springs of our guild are gone now as well.  FoH is a small cornerstone on Terris.  I'll never let it fade away.  Do I think too high of our little guild?  Perhaps, but when it comes to family, what other way is there to think?</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Wow, it's been awhile since I've updated eh?  I've got sometime this morning so here goes.</p>

<p>As many of you are aware, I've been absent lately.  Some would think that DAoC has taken all of my time.  Well, it has taken what free time I've had.  RL has reared it's ugly head and decided to gobble up most of my time.  In a month or two that will change, but for now I only have a couple hours a night to play and half a weekend.  And since I feel DAoC is a better game and have become tired of EQ, I think this next step for our guild is necessary.  I'm going to step down as the leader of FoH.  It's only fair that someone else with more dedication to EQ takes the reigns.  I'm not leaving EQ, I'll still log in a few times a week to play or just chat, but my time has come.  I'll keep the website up of course and the forums.  I'll update what I can.  But if someone wants to work on the site, let me know.  I can setup a user account.  Or if someone wants to feed me the info to update, I can do that to.</p>
<p>So, you must now decide your new leader.  Dancwith has stepped up to fill the gap for the time being.  I posted this in the officers forum a few days ago so they have had time to mull it over.  I will hopefully catch Danc soon to transfer leadership.</p>
<p>I'll work on the roster tomorrow.  I have lots of free time then but won't be able to play anything.  So what better time eh?</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">I have a lot going on lately and that has cut into my time updating the site. :(  But since I can't seem to log into EQ tonight..what better time than now to catch up a bit. :)</p>
<p>Saturday the 29th we went to Kedge.  A new place for us all together.  I don't think many of us had ever fought there before.  We did a great job!<a href="/foh/fohimages/Kedge1.jpg"><img border="0" align="right" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_kedge1_200.jpg"></a> Everyone listened to instructions and kept on the ball as to what they had to do.  We scored a few mermaid locks for two of our rangers, Pantalaimon and Aade.  And late that night Aade finished her quest for the Rain Caller!  A sweet Ranger bow if you are wondering.</p>
<p>After a small wipe out above Estrella, that recovered from rather well, I decided to head back.  We were running short on time. <a href="/foh/fohimages/kedge3.jpg"><img border="0" align="left" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_kedge3_200.jpg"></a> So after one more pull on the Golden Mermaid I pulled Cauldronboil.  A named shark.  Somehow I pulled him through five other sharks that were blue to me.  That was scary...but we took him down like he was an Orc in CB.  Well...he was a little harder than that..but we whacked 'em with ease.</p>
<p>A few new members joined over the weekend.  Please make them welcome and pull them into our groups so they get to know us.  Sandaval, a 36 Warrior.  Zarie, a 21 Monk. Jrod, a 21 Rogue. And Ruvian, a 31 Monk.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed, there is a new section on the forums.  This is for quest related needs only.  Post here if you need help with a particular quest.  Don't be shy about it.  Let's use it.  For instance, I didn't even know about the Mermaid hair in Kedge.  We went there on a whim and turns out that it was a good day for two of our rangers.  It was the last piece Aade needed.  If we'd only known sooner...so.  Let us know what part of a quest you may need help with here.  We can't set anything up if we don't know.</p>
<p>As some of you know I'm working on my Epic.  The Ragebringer.  One part of it called for me to snatch The Book of Souls from the Plane of Hate.  With a little help from Yadan I made my way to Hate<a href="/foh/fohimages/HATE.jpg"><img border="0" align="right" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_hate200.jpg"></a>.  You wanna know what a rush is in this game?  Wander through Hate all by yourself.  I had to criss-cross the zone.  From the south east corner to the north west corner.  It's so crazy that this little game can have such an effect.  I made it past all of the mobs that could see me and made my way behind the Maestro and up to his bedroom.  Where my book was sitting on his nightstand.  I snagged the book and got the heck outta there.  That will be my most memorable experience ever.  And I can't thank Yadan and Bryng enough for helping me with that step.</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya!  It's been awhile due to some ftp issues with my host.  But I found a work around.  This ftp program I'm using has some nifty features.  So there are some elements to the site I may be able to implement that I haven't been able to before now.  Anyway....</p>
<p>Lots of changes to make.  There are alot of new faces in the guild.  I need info as I dig into the roster page again.  So spread the word.  I need Names/Classes/Levels/Stats/Pics!!!! </p>
<p>I have added a new page to the gallery.  About 20 new screenshots so check it out.  I have many more to get to and I will eventually.  It's more work than you would think.</p>
<p>As many of you know I've taken a hiatus from EQ for the last few weeks.  I had the most of this past week off and dug my teeth into EQ again.  Friday was one of those perfect EQ days for me.  It was a refreshing EQ experience to do so much more than the exp grind.  I topped the day off by living through a Naggy raid.  Swing by the Gallery to see pics from the raid.</p>
<p>I'll see ya ingame :)</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">The Wedding was a blast!  Serantha did the Honors and Kutter disappeared right up till the last moment.  Plenty of wedding cake and more than enough booze for all.  Former guildies, Danathor and Exarkunn even shared in the fun and entertained us with duel.  Exar won this time around.  We also had a very generous gnome handing out fireworks for the celebration.  A lot of fun!  Best wishes to the happy couple and safe travels in Norrath!</p>
<p>So, I've been gone for a while now.  Vacation, a cold from hell and a different game have been occupying my time.  I whipped up a few pages to describe where I've been.  Some of you have heard of it, maybe even beta tested it as I did.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="/foh/anarchy.html"><img border="0" src="/foh/ao_images/ao-banner.bmp"></a></p>
<p>I'm having a lot of fun with it.  It's a nice break from the monotony of EQ.  Read through the little bit I wrote and take a look at some screen-shots.  The biggest downfall of the game thus far is that all of you are playing EQ ;p.  Otherwise it's superb.</p>

That is the reason for the lack of updates as I have been absorbed by the news sites and television.  Soaking in all the info that I can.  I can't stop watching it.</p>
<h1 align="center"><font color="#00FFCC" face="monotype corsiva,coronet,brush script mt,aristocrat,"><b>Wedding Day !!</b></font></h1>
<p>As many may know, Kutter and Spirithunter, are going to be wed in EQ this evening.  Please, come and join in the celebration!!</p> 
<p>I have an announcement I'll be making sometime this weekend.  As well as some new material for the site I've been putting together.  I have to work this weekend so that means I'll have a bunch of time off next week.  I plan on getting back into the EQ groove during that time. So you will see more of me then.  I want to start planning a raid for the weekend of the 22nd/23rd.  I look forward to all suggestions brought forth on the boards.</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Well well!  After a week of home cooking and virtually no PC connection(long story short--AOL bites(no offense to those in guild who use it)) So updating the site was too much of a chore to even begin to describe.  I have many e-mails and updates to get to.  It will be good to get back into the swing of things.  I'm fighting a cold at the moment and wrapping up a few other games I started while on vacation.  I'll try to log on tonight.  I miss y'all.</p>
<p>As I catch up on the EQ news, I read that they did away with the the number of folks logged on onto each server.  In an effort to hide the number of subscribers from the competition. /shrug.  I remember when I first logged on the day the game went live.  I logged onto the Povar server to create my 1st Shaman and there were only 9 people logged onto the server.  That was March 16, 1999.  Whew...that seems so long ago.</p>
<p>AND!  Did ya see we'll get to purchase horses with the new expansion?  That's insane.  They said it couldn't be done so many times and perhaps it would be implemented in EQ2.  So this is a great surprise.  It should be quite a sight to see.</p>
<p>I'll talk to y'all soon.  I hope things went smoothly while I was away and I hope I didn't miss too much fun! ;)</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya heya!  I've been very busy the last few days between work and getting ready for my vacation.  I'm still working on the site a little each day.  And while I'm away I'll still be working on it.  I'll get some time to catchup on a few projects I've been working on.  The bad part is that I won't have a high-speed access line and will be confined to a dial-up.  So new pics may not be seen for awhile.  I'll try but can't promise anything.  I do ask that when you send pics to convert them to jpg first.  Many of our photographers do this already and it helps immensely.</p>
<p>Swing by the Forums for some updates on our new recruiting policies.  With 60 guildies that are active now, we are large enough for the time being.  Let's focus on getting better at working together.  We're doing great so far!</p>
<p>While I'm away, look to the officers to set things up and send all of your questions to them.  You can still e-mail me at my yahoo account.  Or Figleaf.</p>
<p>Good luck this weekend with the Freeti raid and anything else you folks get into!  I'll miss y'all.  See ya in the forums :)</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya folks!  Just wanted to remind everyone that we'll have a Kaesora jaunt on Friday.  Check the Forum for the details.  Hopefully we'll score some loot and a few coins for our Bards.</p>
<p>Last night we tried to get a Wurmslayer for Xenna.  Unfortunately we came up empty handed.  If you have ever finished the quest then you know how hard it is.  The final step involves giving an NPC the scales you collect.  You have to do it while this bugger is on the run.  And that is what makes it so hard.  If your pc is laggy in FV, it will be harder yet.  And that is the problem Xenna ran into. :(  So in the future, If I'm available to help with the quest, I can turn the scales in for you.  I have no trouble in that zone and I think it would work out better.</p>  
<p>We continue to hit BW for loot and EXP.  I find this zone extremely enjoyable.  The exp isn't bad and the loot off of the giants sells for 1-60pp and is fairly common.  You can easily make 100pp an hour here with constant pulls.  And there is alot more to fight here than giants.  The wasps give great experience I hear for those in their 40's, yet the loot isn't as good as the giants.<a href="/foh/fohimages/EmberHornet-03.jpg"><img border="0" align="right" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_emberhornet-03.jpg"></a>  And of course, hunting here will let you start a wurmy quest.  Which many of us want.  So if you're level 37+ and have a full group including a cleric and a druid, head out to this zone.  During the week it is almost always vacant.  I bet you'll have a good time with a new area to explore and new critters to hunt.  Give it a try :)</p>
<p>I'm working on some additions to the site.  A write up of rules are being worked on at the moment and as soon as I can I'll implement a chat system so those that can and want to can have some live chat.  Time is my biggest enemy.  So little time...!  Do me a favor and review the Roster section.  I've redesigned the roster yet again and divided it by Classes.  Take a look and let me know what you think.  I can always go back to the way it was.  Also clue me in to those I may have missed :( and any updates that are needed as far as levels go :).  See ya ingame!</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">What a great day Saturday was!  The Aidstation we provided in the Lake of Ill Omen was a blast.  I hope a lot of folks benefitted with our assistance there.  And we came across a few new members while there as well.  Glorfendel, a level 22 ranger joined our ranks.  Make him feel welcome.  Also, Icewine, has joined us temporarily to give us try out.  She went on her first raid with us to Droga yesterday and I hear she did a great job!  Make her welcome in our family as well.  She is a level 39 Ranger.  So those of you around her level seek her out.  I'm sure you'll have a good time.</p>


<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Our raid to Droga was a huge success.  Everyone did a fantastic job there.  We had 3 full groups come out for the event and I think everyone had a good time.  No loot this time around though.  But I was there for fun and laughs.  The next time we go hopefully the Chief won't be camped and we can get our hands on some loots :)</p>
<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">After Droga finished and we had a short break, A handful of us went to the Burningwoods.  Kineada, Kutter, Klaasie, Aade and myself went to the Giant fort there to help rid the land of giants.  And I have never had so much fun killing these critters as I did Saturday night.<a href="/foh/fohimages/bw1.jpg"><img border="0" align="right" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_bw1.jpg"></a>  Kin and Kutter would aggro one or 2 each and circle them around us.  We followed behind as the giants chased Kin and Kutter.  Bashing the Giants as we went along.  We did this non-stop.  For an hour it seemed.  The tactic doesn't burn mana and no one gets hit much.  Fantastic experience and great loot.<a href="/foh/fohimages/bw2.jpg"><img align="left" border="0" src="/foh/fohimages/tn_bw2.jpg"></a>After a good time spent doing this we decided to head to Trak to get in on the rare cycle.  About that time Nylva showed up and once we picked her up we went to Trak.  But to our dismay the cycle was already camped.  So, back to BW for giant barshin'  hehehe.  Saturday was a great day.  I had alot of fun in my travels.  I hope you all did too.</p>
<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Also, Please welcome Nylva as  New officer in the guild.  She has a lot of spirit and many ideas to help us grow.  She volunteered for the position and after talking to her extensively and with other officers one night we agreed she would make a good choice for a new officer.  Fresh insight will help us along the path we are already on to a brighter future.  I can see the strength we have..can you?  See ya ingame! :) </p>

Groupin with guildies is always fun imo :)</p><p>Let's plan a BIG event this weekend.  And don't forget the Aid station in LoIO on Saturday.  We all should be there to help others out.  We can have duels, work on alcohol tolerance, swap languages as well.  But the primary focus is to help others.  Also, scrounge up all the Words, Runes and pages that you can to swap with the classes that need them in our guild.  This should be alot of fun and will break up the monotony of the usual exp grind.  Hope to see you all there!</p></font><br><hr>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Well, it seems that my Host went and did a restore to the server my site is on.  And I lost all of the work I had done this week on the roster.  Luckily I had backups my self.  So everything is restored.  There are some tweaks I'll have to go back and fix after I look at my notes.  Send in your Character info!  And a Pic!</p><p>Baradak has asked to lead the raid this weekend.  And I believe he intends to Raid the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This should be alot of fun with the amount of people we have now.  Specifically in that level range.  I would love to come but I have to work :(</p><p>I'm sorry the news updates have been light this week.  I've been working hard on other sections of the site.  And trying to keep Ganes inline on the forums ;p.  Take care all!</p></font><br><hr

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Hey there!  The New Roster is up.  I know I may have forgot someone or maybe certain details.  I forgot my notes at home as I was adding the finishing touches today.  So if you see someone is missing let me know.  I'll get them up there pronto.  I can also set up a character info screen like you'll see for Saur.  Some of my info is wrong since I had to go from memory.  I know my resists are way off.  Let me know what you think!</font></p><br><hr>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya Folks!  Great fun was had by all yesterday at Droga.  Check out my recap for the event on the new forum.  It went extremely well.</p><p>Last night Nylva, Bara, Danc and I grouped up in KC after a short break from the raid.  We picked up a few extra's in KC and tried to fight.  If you've ever fought in KC when it's extremely camped, then you know you spend more time looking than fighting.  So I suggested we go out to the DL and pull.  That changed everything.  I think we killed more in 20 minutes out there than we did inside for over an hour.  I haven't had that much fun with Saur in a looong time.  We had some really hair raising fights.  We almost lost Danc a couple of times but his l337 (;p) kiting skills kicked in and saved his arse.  And Baradak, surrounded by 3 Ragers, our other tank almost dead, Nylva at 10m, was telling the group "we're fine".  hehe.  We pulled off many fights that could have ended very bad.  We had alot of fun last night.  Nylva got a new level as did Bara.  I am now past the halfway mark to 50.  I will get it tonight hopefully.  Saur's Bday is August 13th.  So I have to have it by then.  Boy do I level slow...bah..who cares.  It's about having fun.  Take care and hit the Forums! :)</p></font><br><hr>

I'll try to be on but RL may intervene.</p><p>I have to run to work on Saturday for a short bit but I'll be on for sure late afternoon and then for however long I can stay awake.  Lets try and do something that night too.  And don't forget, we'll try to get  the Droga raid going on Sunday.  How does 10am(cdt) sound?</p><p>I'm working on the roster and the gallery.  Everything will be up to date by next week.  But I can still use a few more pics :)</p></font><br><hr>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">A new month.  August.  Our guild started one year ago.  It's been a heck of a ride.  I have alot of good memories with this guild.  I'm sure there are many more to come.  So let's get down to business:</p><p>Last night a bunch of us went to the City of Mist.  hoping for a few rare drops and some exp.  I had a good time.  It was nice to get some exp for Saur.  I was distracted most of the time though since my sister called me just as we were getting underway.  So I may have appeared lost while I was there...hehe.  We did get a Wraith Bone Hammer from our little excursion which Soulier won with a roll of 187.  At least it was something to show for our little effort.   I had to leave early as I was exhausted.  So I hope those who remained got some other good loots.</p><p>Soulier will be leaving us for a while due to some real life stuff.  He won't be on much after this week.  So wish him well.</p><p>Weekend Plans:</p><p>This weekend I'm thinking we'll try Droga in Frontier Mountains.  We will need full guild support for this so please plan on coming.  As long as we go all together all will be fine.  Especially with our new clerics :)  I hope they can make it.  Use the links section of the site to do some research on the area we'll be hunting.  Skytocc had suggested a guild event in multiple locations depending on level.  I like to see us all together in one spot for our raids whenever possible.  As long as we have good turnout, levels 25+ should be fine.  Also I'd like to do this Sunday if possible.  I have to be at work on Saturday just as we'd be getting started.  Share your thoughts on the Forum and let's get this in motion.</p><p>I will be working on the Roster page in the next day or so.  Thanks to those who have sent in info.    I still need more so even if you think I may have the info send it any way.  And Pic's.  I need more Pics.  The Gallery will be overhauled soon as well.</p><p>That's all for now...see you ingame :)</p><br></font><hr>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Hello there!  Let's see.  We need to set plans up for the weekend.  I'm off this weekend and itchin to do a good raid.  Lets get some ideas flowing today and tomorrow.  We'll finalize the plans by Wednesday or Thursday.  A few nights this week I want everyone to group together that normally don't.  Make an effort to get our new members into your groups.</p><p>I need updates from you all!  I've had a few come in but I need more.  I need new pic's!  More more more....heheh.</p><p>After not getting much EQ in this weekend, I think I'm going through withdrawl.  So let's get some action going this week. See you ingame :)</p></font><br><hr>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Heya, I'm thinking of setting up a new forum.  One with a guild member only section.  I've started the process and the forum is just about ready to go.  Let me know what you think.  If it is strongly opposed then I won't implement it.  Of course old guild friends, such as Dan and Exar for example, will have access.  This is something I've wanted for awhile and with the recent intrusion into our Merger debate, I feel it's time to go forward with it.  But I want to hear from you about it and your thoughts.  One other thing, I will make it so that there are no adds at all on the board.  I know you folks hate 'em too so I will go the extra step and make it add free.  No pop-ups or banner adds.  Email me or start a thread.</p><p>I updated a few things on the roster and revamped the links page.  I got a few ideas for the gallery and am working on a revamp of that section as well.  It may make navigation through the pics a little easier.  Bradven suggested the idea, Thanks Brad!</p><p>That's it from my end.  Hope y'all had a good day.  See ya ingame :)</p>

<p><font face="verdana" color="#66FF99" size="2">Wow, we're finally back online.  I have alot of notes to dig through and alot of updates to make.  I'll have some time this weekend to get to it all. When I was last able to work on the site I was looking for a calendar cgi and perhaps a chatroom you folks could use.  I found a neat one based off of Flash but I'll have to play around with it to see if it works.  So if you know of any cgi's that could be helpful send em my way to <a href="mailto:figleaf@sauronis.com">Figleaf</a>.   And send me some new pics so I can update the gallery :)</p>

<p>I removed the older news so I have a fresh site to work with.  I keep it archived and am working on a way for everyone to go back and view it if they wish.</p>
<p>And be sure to swing by the<a href="http://pub52.ezboard.com/bfoundersofhonor"> Forums</a> to discuss weekend plans and a merger debate.<p>
