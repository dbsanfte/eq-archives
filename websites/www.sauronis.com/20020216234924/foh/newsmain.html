<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFF99">Well here we
are 2 weeks further down the EQ road, and I apologize now for not updating here.
I have been busy getting together the new Roster, which you will also find
complete (well as complete as it can be) please go and check it out. There are
players missing I know and I would like you all to check your details and mail
me <a href="mailto:kutteruk@yahoo.co.uk">kutteruk@yahoo.co.uk</a> with any
changes or additions please. Also to this address I would like some info about
what is going on in the guild, so that these news briefs don't always read about
myself and my merry band of EQ addicts:). Please send some pics to Sauronis also <a href="mailto:figleaf@yahoo.com">figleaf@yahoo.com</a>
so that he can update the Gallery section.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF99">Recently FOH has been pushing forward into some new
areas, along with all the favorites.. Danaby and I have been spending time on
Luclin, and with the help of Elonzo we have found some great places to fight
there. Kedge Keep has also become a new place to venture, and several parties
have managed to make it there over the last few days, although we haven't been
able to travel far because of numbers.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Our numbers are growing, and our older members are
leveling like it is out of fashion, and our newer members are proving their
worth.. To add to this a fond welcome back to one of our Officers 'Lillypeddle'.
After several weeks of computer problems she is back, and it is good to see her
again in the /who all founders list, she joined us yesterday in ToFS and im glad
to say she hasn't forgotten how to play LOL.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Level 7 in ToFS still avoids us however, and a push
towards Tserrina is in the pipeline for a near future event. '</font><font color="#FFCC00">Enigmatic
Council'</font><font color="#FFFF99"> have shown some interest in an alliance
with us, and I would be glad to have them come along, we could rip the place
apart :).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF99">What a day for FOH. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFCC00">'Bradven'</font><font color="#FFFF99"> is back with us.
WOOOT! After a brief break from guild
life, Brad decided he just couldn't live without us :), and I for one am really
glad to see him back. I spent most of the day with him knocking over CoM with Neg,
and Cendy. After much monster bashing it was time to move to ToFS for an
unfortunate CR that left Turi stranded. We did GREAT :). </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF99">Add to all this that Neggy made Champion, and got a
full set of ToFS keys. Ganes is back online as her new Necro persona '</font><font color="#FFCC00">Trisia</font><font color="#FFFF99">'
and I invited a good old friend into the guild, some of you may remember the
Char he used to have called '</font><font color="#FFCC00">Fennwood</font><font color="#FFFF99">'. Send him a tell and say hi, his name now
is </font><font color="#FFCC00">Xaks</font><font color="#FFFF99">. All in all a good day :)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">But good days as so often in EQ have some bad points,
and the new year also bought another loss to the guild :(. '</font><font color="#FFCC00">Pytheia</font><font color="#FFFF99">'
had been with us for a long time, nearly as long as Aade who originally invited
her and it seemed that in that time she felt like she didn't belong. She says
that it was with regret she was leaving, but found that her character was best
served by being alone. She pulled herself through many levels with the guild,
and she was never a stranger to any of us, but she felt that groups crowded what
she wanted. The fact that she is out there alone is the sort of thing that Ganes
may find interesting for her story. But whatever happens send her a tell so she
knows were still here if she wants us.</font><font color="#FF0000"><b><br>

<p><font color="#FFFF99">Hey all, I haven't been on much over the Christmas period. RL and work have seen to that, but it's FRIDAY! Woot, later tonight we have a meeting planned and I hope everyone will take the time to come and join in.  
Recently we lost Maggilie and Kumak, and although their loss is felt heavily FOH is still burning strong as before. Several new members have joined us recently, and I am pleased to see that they are finding their way here, welcome to you all, I hope your time with us is enjoyable.</p>           

<p>Negativeawn is going to turn 50 soon, and im so pleased for him. Everyone give him a real hard time about being so OLD :) and lets do our best to keep up with him, I know Ddracco isn't too far away, and others I have seen lvling just lately include Danaby's ALT Gromite, and I do believe Knites has been making lvl's. My very own Geeda is now Lvl 17, and as tuff as a coffin nail, Expect to see him soon in The sleepers tomb LOL.</p>

<p>That's all for now people, make our newest members welcome, enjoy yourselves and keep smiling.</p>

<h2><font color="#FFCC00" size="3">December 23, 2001</font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Well I thank you for your kind words Sauronis, 
and I will be doing my best to make that bond as strong as it can be. 
FOH is
beginning to show signs of better order, and concentration. The general 
feeling is becoming good again, and i thank everyone for lifting it 
from the depth it had sunken to. Sauronis, as always is in full support, 
and he has generously accepted the task of keeping the website
up to date, and I will endeavor to make sure that between us we can 
make this happen.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Christmas is now upon us, and over the next 
few days leading
up to and including new year we will only have one scheduled guild 
event, and that will be the meeting next week. (please check the forum for 
details) Due in most part to the fact that i want to Lvl too, and most 
of my time has been dedicated to other areas. I am sure Ddracco, 
Negativeawn, Danaby, Aade, and my lovely wife will be fighting by my side. 
</font> </p> 
<p><font color="#FFFF99">I am fully dedicated to FOH, and I will not 
let it falter, we have a strong group of friends which
I am glad to see growing. Lets keep up the good work, and before we 
know it we too, can go and die in the planes :).</font>

<h2><font color="#FFCC00" size="3">December 18, 2001</font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">A new era for FoH.  There are many changes in 
progress for our guild and will be more in the future.  I've always 
said this guild is capable of becoming more and going further.  Kutter is 
taking the charge of leading FoH through this next stage.  He's 
determined to take the guild to a whole new level of play.  If you're a member 
of FoH, your participation is key.  If your a guest to our website and 
looking for a new guild thats on the rise, FoH is on the move and 
looking for good, mature players.</font> </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">So what's next?  Watch the forums, get active 
in the guild.  How?  Take 10 minutes before you log on to hit our 
forums and discuss the vital guild issues and events.  Ingame, get with a 
guildie.  Always hook up with guildies.  Find a way to get to them even 
if it costs you some pp for a port.  Go to the events, join the pickup 
raids, even if your the 7th group member.  FoH has a certain bond.  And 
this bond has kept it alive for over a year now as other guilds have 
folded.  That says alot.  Are you part of that bond?</font></p>
