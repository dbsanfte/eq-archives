<p><b><font color="black"><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva">It is on this day that
the founding laws of the guild will be laid forth by myself, and those who stand
with me, for the betterment of the guild as a whole, it's members & all of
Norrath. It is by this doctrine that we believe the correct path for our guild
& it’s members is known and will be the path we undertake for years to
come. Yet as time changes so shall we amend to this doctrine to reflect the
current age , but doing so as a group and not without the prosperity of our
guild in mind.</font></font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">The creeds are presented as
follows…</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are EQUAL. Our views,
backgrounds, races, professions & social stature all differ but we all unite
under one flag as equals. No one member is any more important than the next, and
for this reason no rank structure exists within our guild. We do have many
positions within our organization but none hold more "power" than any
other. The only member that takes precedence over any other is the member in
need of aid.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are VIRTUOUS. Where as we do
not support or restrict membership to one kind of alignment or class, we are
obligated to help those in need. Should we be in a position that we can aid
another and it is not in conflict with the guilds needs or threatens the well
being of your self or another member then we should attempt to offer our aid.
The land of Norrath is vast & filled with many people, it is only right we
try to offer aid when the opportunity presents itself.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We SELF PRESERVE. While we do
offer aid when it’s convenient, we are not a public service and no member is
REQUIRED to help another non-member in need of aid. Especially, if it puts you
or another member in jeopardy. If we were to help everyone that requests it, our
advancement will become stagnant & our quest for knowledge stalled.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are TRUSTWORTHY. No member will
intentionally lie to another member. No member shall partake in dealings that
conflict with the guild’s interests or its members. Nor shall anyone partake
in dealings that will foul the guild’s name as a whole. These include theft,
partaking in a fraudulent deal, ripping off others, price gouging &
slandering people as they auction. Most importantly, no member shall partake in
Kill stealing or looting what does not belong to you. Greed above all is grounds
for removal from the guild pending an advisory review. All loot from battle will
be divided evenly to it’s members, more generously to those in financial need.
When our word is given we will follow through till the end as promised.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are LOYAL. We will stand by
each other at all costs. One speaks for all and all speak for one. We will fight
any threat to the Guild or our members with full ferocity and at no time abandon
our companions. No member is to partake in the slandering of the guild or any
member & is expected to speak up for the guild should others slander our
good name. For when they slander our guild they are bad mouthing YOU & what
you stand for. No one is to EVER abandon another member in a hostile situation.
Running in the heat of battle, & abandoning your fellow member’s side is a
blatant violation to this creed and appropriate disciplinary action will be
taken. Cowardice at the expense of a fellow member’s life WILL NOT be
tolerated. We stand together, we fall together.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are DEVOTED. Members are
expected to keep a certain level of participation in the guild. Missing
excessive amounts of meetings or events will lead to a review of your membership
by a selected counsel.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">But above all….</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">We are ONE. Together united and
bound under one name. The good of the guild & it’s members always comes
first. When a guild member requires aid we shall respond with god speed and with
out question. Should a member become threatened, we will come to that member’s
aid at all cost and without hesitation. You are in a group now and should think
like minded for the group. Those with trade skills are requested ( not required
) to offer their services at cost or close to. If this isn’t feasible than at
least a discount compared to others outside the guild. Help on quests will be
given if requested. Lower level members will be assisted as much as needed by
more experienced members. We will all gather on issues such as recruitment of
new members, guild ran quests, and events. Please give your input as much as
desired for a guild with separate interests cannot stand.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">Our members are expected to live
by this creed; read it and take unto them its words and the purpose behind
it’s existence. Any clear violations to the creeds shall be seen as a hostile
act to the guild and shall be presented to a counsel for review. Should this
counsel see the documented act as a violation to the guild’s charter,
appropriate disciplinary actions will be made.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">…And so it shall be. Walk with
pride and know that the dawning of a new era begins with us. Carry the guild’s
creed with you and represent the guild’s name well. The face of Norrath will
be changed by our existence….make us proud.</font>
<p><font face="BlackChancery,Monotype Corsiva" color="black">"Gathered by
destiny…..United by Friendship…..Bound By Honor"</font></p>
