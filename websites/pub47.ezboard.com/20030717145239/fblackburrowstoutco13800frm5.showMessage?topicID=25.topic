Sometimes me and my friends go out to this area called Jim creek to have a few beers and hang out around a bonfire and rally our cars.  Well after 3 of my &quot;friends&quot; begged me to go i finally went ( I was really tired).  Turns out they had decided to steal 2 uhaul trucks.  David (who had just gotten fired and had access) Eric ( who drove them to steal them) and Bruce (who drove 1 of the trucks) were the ones that got em.  I figured david wasnt dumb enough to steal them cause like i said he worked there so i thought they were rented and were being used to bring the pallets and other wood out there for the fire.  So i asked them what they were planning on doin with them and they said the were gonna drive em around a bit then return em.  So i was like ok cool no biggie everything is fine.  Eric told me to hop in and wed go for a ride.  He hit about 70 on the flats which have huge bumps in them (its not flat ) and went off a jump while still excellerating.  He landed so hard i thought my spine was gonna break and broke the rear axle and maybe stripped the tranny.  So i was like wtf man and at first so was everyone else.  So i got into the bed of the other truck to drive back to my camp so i could get to my car.  Took about 3 min till everyone decided that iw would be a good idea to destroy the living fuck outta it and they started ramming it with the truck while i was in the bed.  They rammed the 2 doors off and generally beat the hell outta it.  It gets better, some other kids we dont even know pulled up and were like &quot;awsome!&quot; and proceeded to pour gas all over the truck.  They set it on fire..I screamed for everyone to get back finally they pulled away.  I thought the thing was gonna blow up but it never did.  So its about 2 or 3 am everyone but me is smashed im in the bed of a pickup watching the other one burn and a middle aged man in a pickup truck pulls up.  I think fuck plz no one say anything (by now I knew they were obviously stolen =P) the guy goes wow this is the coolest thing ive ever seen! did you guys steal these just to burn em? ...EVERYONE  said YA pretty much.  So now i figure well were fucked what do i do what do i say etc etc these are suppose to be my friends.  I shoulda gone back to my car and taken off but I had had a few mysefl and was worried about gettin pulled over.  So were all cool chillin by the fire with 1 truck still good its fine no damage.  Well Rudy another one of my friends walks up to the truck and im lookin at him wondering what hed doin.....he takes a beer bottle and shatters out the side window I say WTF are you doin man why the hell did you do that??  David and Bruce say ya we have to drive back in that dont do that.  So im like ok there gonna take it back i didnt do anything theyll get themseleves busted i wont have to rat on my friends.  *sigh* took about 3 min till everyone ( and their was about 7 people there some i dont know) started destroying the truck.  People were breaking the windows mirrors running on the hoond jumpin on the hood etc.  Then they decided that they should rip the muffler off so itll sound cool.  So they tied the muffler to a tree and tried again and again but the muffler got wraped around the axle.  So now were really fucked so I go and sit up by the fire wondering whats gonna happen while they take it apart.  David eventually comes and sits next to me on the tailgate of one of our friends trucks.  A little while latter we see a flashlight in our face.  David says who are you? we hear &quot; im a state trooper&quot; david says &quot;ya know you really shouldnt say stuff like that its not funny&quot; and he says &quot; you being a smartass&quot;? ya it was a trooper OH did i mention david had brought about 5 guns with him and rudy and everyone had been shooting shortly before the cops arrived.  Anyway I was sober at this point and was doing everything i could to cooperate.  David had told me to hold an unopened bottle of whisky so i removed that and my wallet from my inner jacket pocket.  He asked whos cars were whos i told him the Kia sportage with flames was mine.  So he took us down to the group by the truck who were all in ciffs by now.  So I was tryin to keep everyone calm I was being the most talkative cause i figured I hadnt really done anything my friends were prob gonna go to jail and my car would be impounded but i could be at my apartment that night.  The police managed to get out there in big police expeditions.  Eric had his tools out on the truck with the hood open and was atakeing out the radiator when they got here.  Bruce was in the drivers seat.  So me and david were the only ones not in cuffs.  The cops asked if anyone wanted to talk and informed us that all our vehicules were being impounded.  I made a big mistake and tried to protect my friends when i talked to the cop I said look I really just wanna tell you what part i played in this and told him all i did was ride passenger for a short time.  Well obviously they thought i had done more cause a little later i was put in cuffs and taken out to palmer jail with david while ERIC THE SON OF A BITCH WENT HOME THAT NIGHT.  Anyway my arms were going nmb at this point it was like 5 or 6 am and i was in a tiny holding cell with bruce david and some guy with no shoes.  The cops questioned me first. Heres a tip if the cops ever question you no matter how great they make it sound JUST DONT SAY ANYTHING.  I again thought i was gonna be in on a misdemeanor for minor in possesion or something so i was still trying to protect daiv and bruce.  Well they wouldnt tell me what i was being charged with so eventually the whole story came out but he had said he thought i was the one that drove em there and that i knew they were stolen and blah blah and that if i was planning on being a doctor i must have a good ehad on ym shoulders so dont play dumb and   another cop came and played good cop bad cop it sucked.  So i got to go to the main jail to a different holding cell for awhile.  On my way in they asked if i was gonna amke bail I said ya I can call someone I fgured i be on like 500$ bail or something so they said umm do you know how much your bail is?  I said what like 500$? they said no 30,000$ I said WAHT WHAT THE HELL AM I BEING CHARGED WITH? they said 4 felonies 2 counts of grand theft auto and 2 counts of criminal mischeif in the 2nd degree (mighta been 3rd but they were felonies) I spent 3 days in jail before i had a herring and the judge reduced my bail to 15,000 cash or corporate he thought it was funny how all 3 of us were in for a first offense lol.  So ya theres more to the story but thats it ina nutshell.  Im back living with my parents atm and under total house arrest.  David and Bruce both reapeatedly told the cops i had nothing to do with the stealing or destroying so hopefully itll all work out but its costs my dad 15,000 for bail and 4,500 to haire a lawer so no summer facation for him and my mom.  So ya I feel like shit and I feel pretty stupid as I should but i still think my charges are ridiculous.  Anyone more happened but thats it ina nutshell.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/bblackburrowstoutco13800.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bigjimstinny>bigjimstinny</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/15/03 11:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my post had allot o typeos i was typein fast</span><hr size=1> btw sorry for all the typoes and i ahd to drop my chemistry class because of my being arressted grr !<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/bblackburrowstoutco13800.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnipgnoppikpok>Gnipgnop Pikpok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 617<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/15/03 11:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my post had allot o typeos i was typein fast</span><hr size=1> 3 words for you!<br>

I hope you dont get in too much trouble. You might get charged for being there like if a party full of underage drinkers gets busted you get in trouble even if you havent drank.
