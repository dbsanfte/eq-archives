The only person who can approach my tenure being attached to the Aquilo name is Aalaandro.  I've never even been a member before, but I seem to be the one remaining hold out from a time long gone when Aquilo was founded.<br><br>I think maybe Aal understands why I am so sad because he knows I've been around from the beginning.  All the original people have been gone for so long it's extremely rare for them to even make an appearance.  Those who left to form Unleashed don't come around anymore because their own world is the priority.  I knew it would be that way, despite all of the predictable claims of always staying in touch and helping each other out and blahblahblah.  It's always the same scenario that plays itself out.  Time doesn't take long to separate once the decision is made.  The same thing happened when Ferox became Phoenix.<br><br>That is why I was so sad when the split happened.  I knew it would be the way it is.  No matter how good the intentions are, it's just inevitable that people are going to do their own thing in the end.  I sure don't see very many Unleashed people visiting here all that often and demonstrating the close ties that were promised and vowed.  I see a few Aquilo di Arcis members at their Message Boards at times at least.  I can only speak about the Message Boards of course, and that is all I am referring to.  I don't doubt for a minute that there are still times ingame that interaction occurs that I cannot be aware of.  But I state the obvious in terms of what is in front of my eyes here.<br><br>Amsra has so much class and grace.  He keeps ties in both places constantly Message Boardwise, with little to no reciprocation from what I can see.  Much respect for someone who gives much respect.  You would all do well to remember the importance of such things when you go your separate ways.  If you truly value the friendships forged and made, then do not neglect them.<br><br>My point is that it seems ironic that so many who were attached to the Aquilo name for so long aren't even remotely associated with it anymore as it fades away.  I have been gone from the game for over a year, was always an independent player who thrived on proving one could succeed being guildless, and I alone have never left the family no matter what struggles it has gone through.  Well, I think I should mention Sister Miraa as well out of respect since she visits very often too, and has always cared about the family.  It is for this and many other reasons that I am sad and speak about my feelings in this place.<br><br>I'm not upset with anyone because they are moving on in a way that seems necessary to be happy.  That is the one position I have always been an advocate for.  People should always do what they must to make the game enjoyable.  Otherwise, what the heck is the point of playing.  I am just upset because something that still has meaning for me personally will be ceasing to exist.  It seems to have more meaning for me than anyone else, and I respect and understand how that could be the case, but it makes me sad nonetheless.<br><br>It's been a long and beautiful journey.  Some of the nicest, most skilled players I ever knew have come and gone from the Aquilo name.  Those of you who were part of the Arcis family must have similar attachments in many ways I presume.  I have nothing but the deepest respect and sympathy for your earnest feelings at seeing the Arcis name disappear.  I speak of the Aquilo name though, because it has existed for so long.<br><br>Those who left to form Unleashed I supported for doing the same thing that is being discussed here, so I'm not about to criticize people for doing what they feel is right.  The truth is the people who formed Unleashed don't belong to the Aquilo name anymore.  At least that's my opinion as one who was a part of its vision long before even the oldest of players from Unleashed ever knew about the Aquilo name.  They have formed a unique and vibrant family that is fulfilling their unique wants and needs as they perceive them, and that should be celebrated.  But, what they have is not and never would have been true Aquilo.  I am grateful that they all seem to be happy and play with a vigor that was lacking a few months ago.<br><br>I think they are happy because they took many of the positive aspects of what being Aquilo was all about, and they combined them with the desires to advance within the game.  They have a classy leader who will always keep them grounded in ways that will ensure they are different from other achievement oriented guilds.  I imagine that is the same type of environment that everyone from Aquilo di Arcis is going to seek out.<br><br>The Aquilo name will always be special to me because it never gave a rat's bootay about focusing on the aspects of the game that relate to status or capability or placed an emphasis on *advancement*.  This is exactly how I felt as an individual player, so I have always had a special attachment to the very idea of Aquilo.  I just happened to be very fortunate to become who I became, and accumulate what I did.  I never cared about it or prioritized it.  There isn't anything wrong with approaching the game from more of an achievement perspective of course.  Most people play it that way and always have.  Most of my time was spent interacting with and helping those types of players, so I'm not trying to say anything negative about that approach.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that Aquilo at its foundation never gave a lick of attention to that side of the spectrum, and being who I am, that is why I valued it so much.  Those who have moved on did so because they wanted something more.  That is just plain fact.  It's not something bad, or something that needs to be defended in my opinion.  It just is.<br><br>Aquilo has always had people come and go.  Invariably those who wanted more out of the game ended up leaving.  Whether it's switching servers, switching guilds, or leaving for real life, Aquilo never stopped having people enjoy it for what it was and then move on to get more out of their gaming experience.  Most of the elite and highly capable guilds on the server have very influential and valuable members that were once Aquilo.  I think that is a credit to its appeal but also a testimony to the fact that most people want more out of EverQuest than to just hang out with friends and do whatever whenever simply because it's how you are.  Aquilo just happens to be more my style, so I speak about it from that point of view.<br><br>I can't help being how I am anymore than anyone else can help being how they are, and the truth is Aquilo fit my play style perfectly and knowing it will be gone still makes me sad even though I haven't played in a long time and won't ever play again.  Basically, it comes down to Aquilo representing the most simplistic and romanticized notions that one such as I valued.<br><br>I think that because its concept was so simple and so understated it represented the ideal of what could be strived for.  It's just my opinion, so it really doesn't mean that much, but that's how I feel.  And that's why I'm going to miss it so much.  I believe it proffered the closest thing to being the type of model for a *happy* guild that would endure.  I personally think the concept and presence of guilds in EverQuest is awful, and I held true to that principle by never joining one.  But Aal will remember that I always said if there was one guild I thought of as a family I liked being part of, it was Aquilo.  Simple is better, and it was the best for almost 3 years.  People can think that's nuts or goofy or what not, but it should help them understand why (given that it's what I think) I feel the way I do.<br><br>The people of course are what made it the best.  From the original crew, to the vast members of Unleashed that wonderfully carried the mantle for so long, to the determined members of Aquilo di Arcis who strived to never give up and keep the name alive, all of you made it the best.  I have never been a member of any of the guild's incarnations, but I have always been and always will be part of the family.  When the name Aquilo disappears forever from the Norrathian landscape, it will not disappear from my heart.<br><br>May Blaze bring each of you all that you seek, and may you never forget the special heritage you were a part of for a small time in a small place in a big way.<br><br>Splos   <br><br>  <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ukircheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kirche EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Church</span><br>  Posts: 698<br> <font color=#ffff00>(5/22/02 11:53:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sigh</span><hr size=1> *hugs Splos*<br><br>I only saw you once in-game, Master Splos...

But, as you said, for those who loved it and stayed with it, it will never be gone.  I will always, always remember my time here, and the people, and I will never forget to enjoy it in memories and in the present with people I have shared it with through the years.<br><br>Your thoughts...are on everyone's mind.  Thank you so much for voicing them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><B>Kirche</B><I><BR>Reborn Rogue of The 49th Marking of Mischief<BR>Scout of <A HREF="http://www.aquilodiarcis.com/">Aquilo di Arcis</A><BR>Obscurum per obscurius -- explaining the obscure by means of the more obscure</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uallanonne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>allanonne </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffff00>(5/23/02 9:21:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sigh</span><hr size=1> hello everyone, i want to say i am sorry to see the breaking up of such a fine guild. i have known many members  of Aquilo, since the old Aquilo phoenix  guild, and have never ever met any that were anythiing less than great people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>  It is good to see tho, that even if you are disbanding, you are going out with grace and style, instead of with a lot of hard feelings.<br> I know many of you seem to have already found a new home to move to, but if any still need a  guild to go to, and prefer a smaller family type guild.

Although we often say there is a difference between the two, many events and memories experienced in the land of Norrath are imprinted in our minds and hearts for many ages beyond the existance of Everquest.<br><br>Aquilo happens to be one of these experiences for many. I don't think anyone that ever passed through these guild walls was uneffected by their time spent in her home. I know I sure learned alot through the experience, countless memories and emotions that will stay a part of me forever...as I'm certain most members, present and former feel similar.<br><br>When the second form of Aquilo was created, (Aquilo Ferox) we chose a unicorn as her symbol. It wasn't for the reason I heard from later members who thought it was due to a girly infatuation for unicorns, but rather for the symbolism. &quot;The Wild North Wind&quot;. A unicorn is wild, and the horn...always points to the north. <br><br>I hope that every member feels her wind at their backs and continues to travel north in life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Even if Aquilo is gone, her heart isn't...every person that was ever a member has a piece of it..or that's how I feel anyway.<br><br>By the way, I have one of those annoying anonymous ezboard accounts.

Most of what the guild feels is resignation, that and PROUDNESS.  <br><br>WE are very proud.  <br><br>We are proud of those that came before us and those that we have known.  This guild has been able to stand up proudly through some incredibly tough times!  Those of us who made the decision to stay, through the split I believe would still make the same decision today.  I personally, am just as proud of being a member or Aquilo and the friendships I have found here, as the day I first joined.<br><br>So, do not be sad, but instead think of us with a happy heart.  Because the guild tag may fade into history, but our friendships?

But I've no desire to open old wounds.<br><br>The last incarnation of the Aquilo and Arcis names, Aquilo di Arcis, was a noble experiment.  I will never be ashamed of my part in orchestrating the merger, when I was guildleader of Aquilo Phoenix.  Unfortunately, sometimes experiments fail-- that is their nature, after all.  Otherwise they'd be called "certains", not experiments.<br><br>Deguilding after having spent almost 17 months with some form of the name Aquilo floating above my head was the most heart-wrenching decision I've ever had to make, one that came after several nights of staring at the ceiling after I logged off for the night, willing myself to fall asleep.  But though the guildtag will soon be dead on Povar, Aquilo's spirit lives on.  It lives on in Unleashed now, where we support our guildmates when they need a hand or a shoulder to cry on, where we carefully consider their needs versus our own desires and err in favor of the needy, and where we heartily cheer even the smallest victory.  It will live on in Asatru, where it already exists, bolstered by the new guildmates that worthy guild is about to receive.  It will continue to live on as long as one heart that holds those ideals still beats.  <br><br>The guild name will die, but not the spirit.  For Aquilo is not merely a concrete entity like a guild, any more than  you, my friends, are merely the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, iron, and other atoms that make up the bodies your souls inhabit.  Carry that spirit wherever you go next in your time on Povar and on Earth!  And do not forget to pass it on, so that-- like the phoenix-- it may rise up from the ashes of what was and be reborn anew! <p><br><b>Kohpry Mossarrow, Warder of the <a href="http://pub69.ezboard.com/bunleashedeq">Unleashed</a>, Povar</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ullwyendraigcanwyr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llwyen Draigcanwyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffff00>(5/24/02 11:50:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sighs deeply*</span><hr size=1> I will hold my tongue save to say that it no longer should be a matter to contend.
