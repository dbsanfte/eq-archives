<br>
I would like to take the time to fill out an application for AdA, so here goes !<br>
<br>
+ You must be invited to apply for membership by a full member, your sponsor.<br>
<br>
--I am sure some of AdA know me, but since the roster is down, i cant put a finger on any one person.  I do konw Vual from playing (a lot) and i know Jelt and Kataleena in real life.<br>
<br>
<br>
Application Questions<br>
<br>
Applicant (Name, Level and Class) <br>
<br>
--Main Applicant is Bludsongg Manabettery (51 Half Elf Minstrel of Tunare) but i would like to bring Bludthirst Antidruid (53 Wanderer of Tunare) along also.  They are on 2 accounts (i have 2 computers) and i usually use the Druid on port situations or on raids where his buffs are welcome.<br>
<br>
Alts (Names, Levels and Classes) <br>
<br>
-- Along with my 2 mains (Thirst and Songg), I have Bludbattle (37 up and coming Half Elf Warrior of Tunare) and Bludsboy Antidriud (31 Half Elf Pally of Tunare) on one account and actually am working on PLing a cleric (for rez purposes) on a third account (3rd pc coming after xmas)<br>
<br>
Who is sponsoring your application to Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
<br>
--Vual (and Jelt and Kat, if necessary)<br>
<br>
What made you decide to apply? <br>
<br>
--I know Jelt and Kat IRL and we fight quite a bit.  I also know 2 other soon-to-be applicants IRL and with our toons, we can pretty much make a group.  I truly want to stick with friends, for it makes fighting a lot easier.<br>
<br>
What guilds were you in previously? Why did you leave? <br>
<br>
--Angels of Wrath - Guild broke up<br>
--Mensa D' Morte - er, guild is slowly deminishing.  one of the most painful thing to watch is a guild that starts to come apart.  i was one of the founding 10 of mensa, was an officer and the webmaster for quite a while.  when the guild starts to lose interest in itself and noone can lead them out of the doldrums, most leave right away.  i have held on as long as i can.<br>
<br>
What does a guild mean to you? <br>
<br>
--A group of friends or family that would kill with you, and die for you if necessary<br>
<br>
What do you expect from being a member of Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
<br>
--To be treated fairly and to have a blast doing it !<br>
<br>
What time zone do you live in? <br>
<br>
--Central time zone, but about to move to Quebec in Febuary for about a year (what time zone is that?)<br>
<br>
Aquilo di Arcis is currently siding with Dragon faction, are you prepared to join this faction? <br>
<br>
--GIANTS SUCK !  DRAGONS RULE ! (already have good dragon faction on Songg, but Thirst has yet to truly side.<br>
<br>
List some Aquilo di Arcis members you have grouped with and describe some of the things the group was up to at the time. <br>
<br>
--AdA is fairly new, but i have fought with quite a few Aquilo Phoenix memebers and a couple of Arcis memebers.  I group with Jelt and Kat whenever they are online (done KC, Velks, Kael and several other zones.  Vaul and I did some growing up together and have fought in many zones).  I also think Dome (RL ex mother in law and kickass cleric) was in Arcis.<br>
<br>
Have you had any negative experiences with any of our members? Explain. <br>
<br>
--Not for Aquilo or Arcis do i have a discourging word.<br>
<br>
Do you have any trade skills? <br>
<br>
--My druid is my main skiller with 194 fletching and 89 jeweling.  Those skills you can work on while medding.  Songg is 122 in pottery for Thurg Potions, while other toons need some skill work (mainly using warrior for camping Gornit, he still gets exp)<br>
<br>
What is the one item you want most right now? <br>
<br>
--er, dont really NEED anything, except education and experience.  one day ill get an epic, but dont think i am quite ready yet<br>
<br>
List some of the keys you have. (Ex: Howling Stones, Veshan's Peak, Cobalt Scar tooth) <br>
<br>
-- Bard has all teeth and Seb key.  druid has all port spells and teeth<br>
<br>
How do you feel about twinking? <br>
<br>
--I love nothing more that to see a level 1 in some 00ber ph4t gear.  All my toons have been twinked (cept for the druid) from the fruits of my druids many labors.  <br>
<br>
Where do you normaly hunt? <br>
<br>
--Currently working in KC, the Hole and velks<br>
<br>
List some of your closest EQ friends.<br>
 <br>
--wow, i have quite a few.  worst part of my gaming experience is logging on each night to TELL HELL, but it is worth !.  i know lots of peeps !<br>
<br>
List some of your EQ enemies. <br>
<br>
--um, shinzule.  while PLing my bard in FM, i was taking giants one at a time (23 peeps in zone) so as to not hog them.  Shinzy is quad kiting !  i ask the zone if they think that is fair that he gets 4 and everybody else waits.  they say &quot;no&quot;.  i wait and sure enough, he snags my pull, so i remove my snare spell (thanks to Nullify Magic) as well as the snare from 2 of his other mobs and they commense to making a druid puddle.  I haven't heard from ol shinzy since, but i hope he is playing nice now.  Other than that, i think of GM's as children with loaded guns.  If you see one, run.  If the talk to you, say what they want to hear so they will go away.<br>
<br>
Describe yourself in one word. <br>
--obsessivecompulsivepotheadthatlikesbutterandisalwayshorney<br>
<br>
Give us a little history on your main character's life so far. <br>
<br>
--Thirst was created about a year and a half ago and has been my scout when new zones came up.  he has seen and done more things than imaginable.  I started my bard as a birthday present to myself (RL b'day and toon b'day are the same) and also because Myschief Makker and Xenwise made bards look so darn fun.  While PLing my bard, i learned the easiest ways to PL a toon using a 50+ druid.  i know some people dont like the PL idea, but if done right, none of your skills suffer and you can get to lvl 30 in 24 hours of play time or less.<br>
<br>
Druid is currently lacking in a bit of wisdom (187) and not too terribly twinked.  Bard on the otherhand, has PoG BP and GM event items.  almost all but 4 or 5 slots are bard only items.  he also has a bag of resist gear in the bank ready to go.<br>
<br>
On a big hunt with a group you loot a monster and find it has a great item no one was expecting. What do you do? <br>
<br>
-- duh !  if no drop, you tell the raid leader of the item and a call for a roll is done.  if it is tradeable, you loot it and immediately turn it over to the raid leader or loot leader.  please dont let it rot !<br>
<br>
You are hunting with your group in a dangerous area. A pull goes bad and the group is suddenly swarmed by mobs. You battle it out for a little while and suddenly the healer dies. With no healer left the person you were counting on to possibly evac you out is now laying dead on the floor as well. You have a near full health bar and your tanks are taking a beating. What do you do? <br>
<br>
--well, being a druid, i would get an evac out if that is what is called for or start healing and expect to die.  if im on as my bard, i mez as many as i can and juggle my mez song and speed song and hope for the best.  lets face it, if you dont die during a wipeout, you either have FD or you are not willing to die for the cause.  dont get me wrong, the object is to NOT die, but on big raids, i come prepared for a 3 hour CR.  While I should be carrying a Thrug potion on me, have a camped out cleric to do rezzes, no one should be afraid to die. <br>
<br>
You come across a game bug that benefits players greatly. What do you do? <br>
<br>
--well, you tell the guild about it, but only the guild.  this includes 00ber items that you think will be nerfed if it gets out that it is too good.  some things are better left unsaid.  as far as reporting it, in my experiences (pathing bug in Paw and again in ToFS) reporting it has been the same as &quot;hey GM, I am breaking a rule!  come give me a warning&quot;.  Reporting a bug has been viewed by GMs as USING AN EXPLOIT.  Needless to say, i have a warning on my account for using (reporting) a pathing bug.<br>
<br>
You log into the game and cannot find anyone your level to group with. What do you do? <br>
<br>
--i would either hook up with a pick-up group or log on a different toon, or quad kite drolvargs in KC to PL an alt.<br>
