I will start with one that I will remember for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Mine was a room break in Howling Stones.  I was but a mere lvl 52 at the time.  Our group was enchanter, rogue, warrior, druid, cleric, and necro.  Well we came into a room that had 5 skeletons in it.  Needless to say it was not a pretty pull either.  We got spanked badly about 5 times trying to break the room.  We were determined on learning the best way to handle a room like this with no room to have tatics for monk pulling.  <br>
<br>
Well upon the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tries we were getting frustraited.  The enchanter never could get them all mezed fast enough or was resisted.  We always had something go wrong.  Once we even miss timed it and had some extra adds in on us.  Well the last time we discussed what might work.  We ended up decideing to charm a couple mobs.  Myself and the enchanter each charmed a skeleton and it was a blast from that point on.  We even had 2 extras to kill before it was over with.  I would also like to add my necro charm lasted longer than the enchanters. LOL<br>
<br>
I was on the edge of my seat the entire fight and was truely amazed at what we finnaly had done when it seemed almost impossible.  We each learned more about what each could bring to a group and how well we worked together when we put our minds to it.  We were all still learning more about the power of each class and this truely taught us alot.  <br>
<br>
I guess some might say that would have been easy to break that room.  But it takes working together to enjoy things and learn things.  We ended up with some nice loot and exp that night and a feeling that we had each taught one another something about the others ability to play there class.<br>

<br>
I was like level 52 or so. We had 2 groups, and Nibbler says "let's explore" So we dropped down into the pits, and slowly crawled thru the maze. We eventually ended up going thru this water tube and ended up smack dab in the face of several not to happy to see us golems. Somehow we prevailed and beat them, and found ourselves standing right in front of Velk's castle. I remember when we first went into the keep, and that dispell trap went off, and we immediatly got attacked by several gargoyle statues. We eventually fought our way to the top of the ramps in the center of the keep. Everything in that part of the zone conned red to me, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, cause I was the healer for the caster group, and the chanter kept getting smacked around. I was always worried I wouldnt be able to keep the poor soul alive, but somehow managed.<br>
<br>
When we decided we were done, I remember a massive respawn, we had so many mobs attacking us, and Noitide shouts EVAC NOW!!. I did, and man it was actually an adrenaline rush, seeing all those golems and gargoyales rushing us and counting the 9sec it takes for a succor to go off, and hoping noone ate it befor the evac landed.<br>
<br>
We all survivved, and I had a blast, was one of the more exciting moments for me in EQ.<br>

<br>
Like obtaining my Cobalt Scar tooth, and the ordeal that ensewed from it.<br>
<br>
Or my first incounter with the Kromriff spy in SS and the VERY LARGE train of MoBs that followed me out the zone.<br>
<br>
Or the time I forgot that Velious dragons don't to much care for illusions, when standing near Sontalak I cast Form of the Howler on my newbish self.  Hehe, thanks to Cennas for rezzing me.<br>
<br>
Or the OMG Awful train I witnessed in Chardok so long ago when someone cast a heal on our monk who was attempting to split a pull, deep in chardok on a royals raid for the herbie and Prince. I think most of the named came to say hi to us on that one.<br>
<br>
My first trip to DLs / Kunark. Hehe, its posted in my guess what... thread, thanks for the memory Cim  :)<br>
<br>
Oh man, my first ever attempt at soloing a Mountain Giant, and the nice "Train to Omen zone" that I created. Fortunately that one happened real early in the morning, and I was the only one in zone  :p<br>
<br>
My only Vox raid  /shiver, Kirche knows what Im talking about on this one  :)<br>
<br>
My many many run ins with the Kromriff death squad while working on this stupid shawl quest!!!!<br>
<br>
Hehe, there are soo many other funny moments I have had in EQ. So much entertainment.<br>

It's a fairly high level zone, with many creatures from level 45 to 60+ in the zone..I'm not sure if they actually get as low as 45..but you get the picture. We were camping right outside the Ahkeva Ruins zone entrance, where the &quot;4 arms&quot; spawn. These creatures can be ether a level 52-54 spawn, or a 57-59 spawn..depending on which you get. The higher level one is a friggin cleric..and loves to CH itself, hits for about 170ish max on me...well, in this group..we had no cleric. So Caliktil pulls the creature the first time, and we proceed to begin beating it down..things are going okay until it begins to cast a spell..I try to stun, resisted, I try to stun again as it's still casting, resisted again. 4 arm creature has been completely healed. Crap. Malasa (my wife, 55 druid is our main healer) is now at about 20 mana from keeping my butt alive to this point. We start to beat it down again..we get it to about 50%..and it CH's again...now we're thinking...ohh...good..this is NOT GOOD! So out come the LoH's.....after 2 LoH's, and luckily, an oom creature..it died. Dropped nothing..bastard thing! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well, at this point, we've used 2 of the LoH's in the group of 3 Paladins, a bard, a wizard, and my wifey, the druid. We have one LoH left, and everyone else is FM, and the level 58-59 cleric spawns again. So Caliktil pulls it again, and we, as a group, came so close to death last time, were kinda freaked out with only the one LoH left..once I had gained sufficient agro, and we got it snared..I proceeded to run around in circles to let the others beat on it. As now Malasa is oom again (get more mana woman!) and I'm low on health..well, the &quot;4 arm&quot; thing starts chasing after me, not even caring that the others are beating on him as he chases me. Luckily enough, I toss in the occasional stun to keep it real mad at me..and it just chased me until it died..so from now on..we know we can do that camp without a cleric.<br>
<br>
I'd like to say that Caliktil is a great puller, and the group we had worked amazingly together. 5 of us were Aquilo. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://jennymarie.freewebspace.com/aal-new-sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ukircheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kirche EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Church</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/13/02 12:29:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=564.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kirche.freewebspace.com/images/lovers.gif WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HUGE BONK heehee</span><hr size=1> OMG I know what Grey is talkin' about...rofl<br>
<br>
Scene:  Raid on Lady Vox; in prep hall, people fidgiting, waiting for Sulien to give his call...<br>
<br>
Sulien shouts, &quot;GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kirche and group (5 others) run up the correct ramp, wailing battle cries -- they feel the glory of battle before them in the next room as they race to be the first in!<br>
<br>
But alas, it was not to be for all but Kirche...<br>
<br>
We went RIGHT past the hidden rock door that hides Lady Vox's Lair.  Nobody had told us there was a rock that you had to slide open.  We kept going, turned right, and found ourselves hovering (we had levi) over the highest pitfall.<br>
Cursing in groupsay, all six of us slowly floated down, knowing full-well what was down  there waiting for us...<br>
<br>
I quickly cloaked myself in stealth and silently went down with my groupmates into the pit.  Once we hit bottom, we were swarmed with mobs.  I had no SoW, and I knew I had to get back up to the main fight quickly, so I risked catching aggro and came out of hiding to a full sprint throughout the pits.  I really had no idea where I was going!!  I ran in circles once or twice, saw some nasty mobs that apparently took no interest in me, had a few close calls with even more, and eventually found my way back up to Lady Vox, where I proceeded to pummel her with jab upon jab and backstabs.<br>
<br>
It was just after I ran back to get a heal and got caught with her AoE for 500 damage some 5 minutes later and died that I realized I was the only one who didn't die in the pits and made it out to the fight -- everyone else fell victim to the pits!  I was pretty proud of my accomplishment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It was fun, but we didn't kill Vox in the end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   What an incredible experience though!  Next time I won't miss the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for my best experience in the game..the best thing that ever happened to me was meeting Missa, and every moment of every day I spend with her is like heaven to me and becomes its own special moment in its own, each better than the last.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><B>

The ones that gave you that rush feeling.  The other to me is for those other EQ stories to go in.  I wanted to make sure to see people's really special events that happened to them.  <br>
<br>
In my almost 3 years of EQ playing, I have had one truely RUSH feeling.  But have had a ton of things happen that I will never forget.  Perhaps someday I will have another one of those RUSH feeling's happen again.<br>
<br>
Storrme,  I also remember that night in Lfay also.  I think at one time there was around 130 people in that zone.  I know Valor of Virtopia came to give there respects as well.  At least 15 or more came by that night.  I seem to remember a GM also came to give there respects also.  That was the saddest night I have ever been on EQ.<br>

If he is on, type the following into you chat box...<br>
<br>
/tell Nibbler CHARGE!<br>
<br>
Ok...there was 2 groups in Sebilis one night (i think). We were all heading to the Jail if i remember correctly. We had cleared the path and there were a remaining few Mobs in the room we where heading in to camp.<br>
<br>
Nibbler had been pulling. When it was time to rush the room, Nibbler came back to our current camp spot and gave us the following instructions:<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, we are ready to take the room. Is everyone ready? When I yell charge, everyone run into the room and beging the fight&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone respond as ready and we were all set...<br>
<br>
Nibbler proceeds to yell &quot;CHARGE!&quot; and run into the room. The rest of the party just sits there. I don't even know why no one ran in, but Nibbler was the sole, brave sole that actually followed the CHARGE! orders. Needless to say, he died a horrible death...<br>
<br>
Nibbler loves me for telling this story over and over...<br>
<br>
Other memorable times are as follows:<br>
<br>
-Slarena's Funeral (who can forget /hugs storrme)<br>
-Slek falling into the lava in Sol a<br>
-Countless groups in Sol A bar without a chanter (Daecue, Qeabria, Grimblade, Greegan...those were some of the funnest times i ever had)<br>
-My epic camp (/HUGS talania and Qudelle and the rest that spent a weekend with me)<br>
-Vail falling from the spires in NK (i still have a screen shot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
-And many others that i cannot remember right now (hmm...i guess those would not fall into the memorable category, eh?)<br>

I remember that Kithicor had been changed to a hell zone already but it had been only a couple of weeks since its change. <br>
<br>
Simple rules -  Different Server and No Teleports allowed. If you chose to spend the time begging for a SoW or a Bind in a city on the way (not as prevelant as it is now) then you lost time. All of us were guilded under the same guild and nobody was allowed to go /anon or /role. The leaders were the ones keeping track of where everyone was zone by zone.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has been in EQ since '99 can remember what it was like running around as a newbie. The HGs in the commons slaughtering the whole zone, Kithicor went from a newbie zone to a 40s zone, Evil eyes and Minotaurs ran all over Beholder, Misty Thicket KS'ing guards, Minotaur Hero running around killing everyone in steamfont, etc.<br>
<br>
Well let me just say, I NEVER had so much fun. <br>
<br>
We started at Akanon with  Level 1 gnomes and the first one to the Library in Erudin was the winner (Peece an old Arcis member won). We all started at once at the entrance to Akanon and ran to the LFay zone. If you died, you went back and kept running. <br>
   The first stop was at the dock at Butcherblock. 20+ naked level 1 gnomes standing on the docks, waiting for the boat. We all got on the boat and zoned into OOT and taunted the players in the zone, telling them that we were going to invade Freeport or telling them that we were camping the Seafuries. We got lots of people laughing. <br>
   We zoned into Freeport, some people got binds, others got SoW, others just kept running. Then came the fun part. It was Night time and Kithicor stood between us and Erudin. Some people decided to run thru Kithicor and died, others made it or waited for daybreak to make the run. The other major decision was to go through the Orcs in High Hold (at level 1!) or thru Rivervale, Runnyeye and Beholder. <br>
   Some of the people chose to get bound at this point, once they made it thru Kithicor, either at High Hold or Rivervale. Amazingly enough there was one guy who never bound anywhere and he almost won. Freeport and Kithicor was what broke up the pack of level 1 gnomes the most. So when we ran through the Karana's we only had maybe 5 in the zone at once.<br>
   When I entered Qeynos there were only 4 of us in the zone. I went straight for the dock. Of course as luck would have it, the boat was just leaving and I jumped to try and make it on the boat. I barely made it on and have no idea how.<br>
   Needless to say there were 4 of us on the boat when we zoned into Erud's crossing and I crashed when zoning so I did not finish. The last part of the race was actually won by Peece using one of the other 3 as a springboard off of the shuttle, jumping on to the dock<br>
   I was laughing so hard all night, I couldnt see where I was running or if anything was chasing me. The guild channel was filled with screams of agony as the other competitors died and cheering those who were in the lead.<br>
  I would love to do this again, but it isnt the same since all the servers all have 50+ characters on them and it would make it easy. Perhaps if EQ opens a brand  new server, we can do it again.<br>
