<br>
just stopped by to see how things were going without me, and well...damn.  The guild is falling apart at the seams.  Beta and Nin are gone.  Gouf, from what I hear, is also gone, and there may be others I don't know about.  Gut check time.  Yall need to re-evaluate what the guild means to you.  You ALL need to sit down and talk about what you want from the guild and where you want the guild to go.  I thought that, before I quit, we had gotten the guild to a good point where ppl were enjoying themselves.  Hunting together and bullchittin.  <br>
<br>
Now as far as raids go, FB has never been a raiding guild.  People have never been able to follow instructions, everyone did thier own thing, and that just not how it works.  Communitcation and punctuality are necessary in a raid, but was never practiced.  With the exception of a couple good ToFS raids, all they have ever done is flare tempers and get ppl pissed off.  You may want to try to avoid raiding until things get sorted out.  Just a suggestion.<br>
<br>
I realize that since I'm not a part of the guild anymore that I may be out of place posting this, but f*u*c*k it.  I've put as much blood, sweat, and tears into it as anyone, so I feel it my right and responsibility to say something.  Stay cool Brotherhood, and take care of each other.<br>

I have walked through many guilds, and i can tell u that none could compare in spirit or heart to whatt Forest Brotherhood has, Raids arent everything they are just a bonus... But without Trust,Friendship,Companionship,Love how can a guild grow  These qualities are the treetrunk in which the tree relies on, the base of everything , the trees whole world, and as Forest brotherhood grows that tree that is us grows, and soon when everyone knows the lesson taunt in this guild some may break off to form trees of there own in RL while others may stay and watch the tree grow stronger and taller than any other in that forest.<br>
 <br>
   I say this from the heart without you guys we wouldnt be...and without the knowledge you guys imparted upon us we never could have been. And i swear to you all that soon enough,,, Forest Brotherhood is gonna be strong and tall enough to spit on top of Midnight Fury or any other guild when they ask hows the weather up there.<br>

Any ways Hello Es how is life outside EQ hehhe glad to hear from you even though it’s a spanking lol. I’m not sure what all took place other than reading the posts because I was not there, but I will not take sides only to the Forest Brotherhood to further our cause….Beta,  Nin and Gouf and all that were involved I will always be your Brother and no hard feelings are kept here I’m glad to hear that you have made up and even though we have lost some to other Guilds I still call you Friend and hope to stand at your side in battle again soon! <br>
    Agreed we are not and have never been much for a raiding guild perhaps as we grow and learn each others habits better this may come natural to us but the key will always be how good it is planed and how well we listen to the leader and work as a team.<br>
    I haven’t been on for the last few days I’m not sure why just not in the mood for EQ… no other reason honest! :/  I hope soon I will be back to myself and join you all. So until then stand up for what you believe is right, honor your feelings and remember to try to think of others and their situations as you journey in these realms, unless your evil of course and just hate everyone lol…then at least we know your intentions hehhe.<br>
<br>
See ya all soon.<br>

This is not a rant or a flame so PLEASE don't take it as such.  and BTW, this is Zuhalter describing it for Zugzog because Zugzog can't articulate the way I can...  :-)<br>
<br>
So here is the deal from Zugzog's angle...<br>
<br>
I had planned a raid for last friday to raid Sol B, it was decided (Not by me) to raid ToFS instead.  I wasn't upset by this and went along with it.  This was fine until I was asked what was going on...Everyone was looking to me for answers, looking back I should have said directed them to someone else, but I wasn't even sure who to direct questions towards.  I was asked to setup groups and such for an area I had never been too.  I am NOT trying to pass any blame and am not even going to mention names.  I know a group of people went ahead of everyone, and this was a misunderstanding.  When I was asked if they could start clearing I agreed, I didn't realize this meant going to the 5th and 6th floor.  A number of people asked what was going on in channel and in group, noone answered us and I explained I didn't have any idea.  After trying for a while and dying a few times, the group I was with got fed up and gated out because they were not getting answered.  I am sorry I left the raid and made it appear that the raid leader had left.  I want to let everyone know that I will never leave my OWN raid without notice.  I will be sure to clearly voice my concerns in the future.     <br>
That was the first thing I wanted to explain and apologize for.<br>
<br>
The second thing is is the matter of people leaving Forest Brotherhood.  I wanted to start off with the fact of Zuhalter leaving the hood.  I spoke with Rognok about this and let him know that I would still love to be part of the guild but it has become increasingly difficult to have a character in 2 guilds and Zuhalter is in the world of Norrath alot more then Zugzog lately.  I will have a character in the hood as soon as I get one leveled up to a sufficient level.  Now, while I am talking about people leaving the guild, I felt it necessary to let everyone know that I did NOT recruit either Gouf or Alizabeta.  When tempers flared and Beta was removed from the guild, she was of course offered to join us as she has always helped us in the past.  Gouf was also upset at the fact of how things were handled and left the guild, he then asked to join us.  <br>
     <br>
The third and final thing is the fact that I don't want to lose Forest Brotherhood as an ally.  The night that everyone was upset I wanted to call everything off, I wanted to give up on my guild, give up on raiding, etc, but I decided to wait it out and tell everyone what happened with a clear mind.  It would have been dumb to call everything off now that I see it in type especially.  I wanted to let you all know that you will always be welcomed by NdF and you are still very welcome on our raids.  I want to see you guys grow and be succesful at what ever aspirations you may have.  I am sorry it took me so long to explain my position on all of this, but I have needed the time to think.  If anyone has any questions you know how to reach me.  I know that all of this will soon pass and be forgotten, but I just wanted you all to know.  <br>
