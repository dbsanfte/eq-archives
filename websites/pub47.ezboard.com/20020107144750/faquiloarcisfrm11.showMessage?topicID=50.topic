<br>
Who is sponsoring your application to Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
Dolph<br>
What made you decide to apply? <br>
I am looking for a guild where I feel like family and everyone acts like family. I feel I will find this atmosphere with Aquilo di Arcis.<br>
What guilds were you in previously? Why did you leave? <br>
I was in House of Serenity (HoS). I left because no one could get together to accomplish much anytime it happened it was because one or two people really pushed for it and it never happened often I didn't feel part of the family or team.<br>
<br>
What does a guild mean to you? <br>
A guild is a family, friends, team work, feeling I am part of something much bigger.<br>
<br>
What do you expect from being a member of Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
I hope that I feel like family to help when needed and to have fun.<br>
 <br>
What time zone do you live in? <br>
MST<br>
<br>
Aquilo di Arcis is currently siding with Dragon faction, are you prepared to join this faction? <br>
I side with my guild, I also hope to complete my epic but will put it off if needed to further the guild.<br>
<br>
List some Aquilo di Arcis members you have grouped with and describe some of the things the group was up to at the time. <br>
I have only grouped with Dolph he was in HoS at the time. He helped me Kill Sir Lucan for the soulfire quest and I helped him do the same. There are many times I have grouped with Dolph for many reasons always enjoyed the time.<br>
<br>
Have you had any negative experiences with any of our members? Explain. <br>
No I have not.<br>
Do you have any trade skills? <br>
I am a master smith and fletcher, currently working on my brewing and baking skills.<br>
<br>
What is the one item you want most right now? <br>
I am trying to get the Fiery Avenger. As that is almost impossable trying to get Natures Defender.<br>
<br>
List some of the keys you have. (Ex: Howling Stones, Veshan's Peak, Cobalt Scar tooth) <br>
I have the toothe or the great devide but the new expantion has nulled that one other than that I have none.<br>
<br>
How do you feel about twinking? <br>
I tried it on my baby pally and found I didn't enjoy the game as much so I would have to say I prefer to earn all  my equipment and armor. I have completed all the ro quests but two to get decent armor for myself enjoyed it alot.<br>
<br>
Where do you normaly hunt? <br>
I hunt everywhere been hunting in EW, GD, Burning wood, and DL the most trying to get on a few plain and naggy raids at the moment as well.<br>
List some of your closest EQ friends. <br>
Dolph, Mufesa, Matmortagan, Dalink, Kaediin, Doughty, Azzamenya, Samina, Mekik<br>
<br>
List some of your EQ enemies. <br>
None unless they haven't told me.<br>
<br>
Describe yourself in one word. <br>
Paladin<br>
Give us a little history on your main character's life so far. <br>
Well umm He went into cb at lvl 4 with Dalink. (first character I ever created). I soloed and teamed up with Dalink most of my time in CB. At lvl 12 joined HoS with best friend Mufesa and tried to catch up to his lvl so we could group together. Pretty much grouped with HoS till lvl 30 then semed not needed or wanted to group with any HoS members. At lvl 34 Married Ualilu and grouped with her and Mufesa. Organized a Lucan raid for Soulfire quest for myself then one for Dolph. Been on a few raids with the Guild. I have left my group on many occations to help with corpse retrievals and lost Guildies, sat and helped lower level family members with heals and buffs. Died to try and save group and much more.<br>
<br>
On a big hunt with a group you loot a monster and find it has a great item no one was expecting. What do you do? <br>
I tell the group and see if anyone there can use it if they cna and only one can use it they get it if no one can use then do a random for those who can use it or all if none can if there is a guild treasury then it should go there but that is up to the winner of the roll.<br>
You are hunting with your group in a dangerous area. A pull goes bad and the group is suddenly swarmed by mobs. You battle it out for a little while and suddenly the healer dies. With no healer left the person you were counting on to possibly evac you out is now laying dead on the floor as well. You have a near full health bar and your tanks are taking a beating. What do you do? <br>
Well I would have used lay hands on the cleric before they died so I would hit the mob/mobs and heal the tanks till mana ran out then I would keep fighting till the mob/mobs were dead or I was dead. If I could get the argo would tell rest of group to zone.<br>
<br>
You come across a game bug that benefits players greatly. What do you do? <br>
I would first ask if anyone else new about it and then I am not sure as it has never happened to me yet but woul like to think I would report it to get it fixed as it would be the same as cheating and where is the fun in cheating?<br>
You log into the game and cannot find anyone your level to group with. What do you do? <br>
I see if anyone in the guild wants my company if only to heal or buff them if not run around on my own killing mobs.<br>
