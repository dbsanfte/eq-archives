I know LoW said ok.  Please change my request for you to post here. If it is not good or good for you, please send mail to luciferini@hotmail.com.<br>

In fact, I ended up getting killed not by Vox, but by an IG that popped while we were doing Vox.  Anyway... it does seem that level helps with the resists a bit.  Just my $.02 though.<br>

Two attempts were made to take him down.  I only made it to the second. Budd and Hik were at the first and second.  <br>
<br>
We successfully retrieved Voldric's body and moved him safely to DL.<br>
<br>
I added 10 to my MR and didnt get feared for long and maybe only a couple times. I got many swipes on him this time. I took him down 20% before I dided.  I didnt run back for a heal, didnt know that was what I was supposed to do.<br>
<br>
If we can org 40 folks, we can do it. We had 32 the other night.  We were short Wizards and maybe could have used a couple more tanks.<br>
<br>
Last night was unsuccessful. First time naggy got down to 20% I think. Second time 5%!<br>

<br>
I don't think FoJ has any problems leaving the remaining loot for BBSCo.  Those of us that came were grateful to be there to participate (and would like to be invited again!!)<br>
<br>
As for my looting snafu-- I thought I had lost the roll and was told to roll-off.  This was not a &quot;need&quot; item in any way, and I would only use the +13 wis/int for tradeskills.  I was trying to figure out if anyone could actually USE the item before I looted it, then I lagged out and it was gone.  I would never have rolled for such an item had I known there was someone else who could use it--- so I was trying to find that person in time... didn't tho...<br>
<br>
Even though it was a &quot;closed Raid,&quot; thanks for making Aldrahn feel welcome.  I thought we could use another wizzy, and he was Naggy and Vox experience.  Obviously that didn't help too much though... lol<br>
<br>
I don't know what happened with the Fire Giant train... but I was told that a DE char pulled (someone thought it was me in DE form).  I heard that some other group thought they could go in and pull the king before we went in, and then ran a bunch out to us... that sux.<br>
<br>
As for my tale, I waited for Pow and the pallys to do their think... saw Pow going down and then heard &quot;All Attack!!&quot;  I ran in, got in position and did my think.  All of the sudden, all of the &quot;real&quot; tanks were either feared or ran back for heals and Naggy set his heated vision on me.  I resisted fears and fire breath...UNTIL he started dispelling me like mad.  Then I bolted for a heal and he summoned me... 500, 500, 500... I bolted again, and he summoned me again!!  500, 500... going down!!!!  <br>
<br>
Had fun doing it-- we had a lot of disadvantages going in, but still a fun time!!!<br>
