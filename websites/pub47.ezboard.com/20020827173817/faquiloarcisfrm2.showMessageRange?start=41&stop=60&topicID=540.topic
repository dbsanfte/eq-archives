<br>
As far as duelling goes..I could never defeat splos in a duel. Nor would I if skill and luck were on my side. It's just never been something I saw as a feat. For me, it would be like killing my own father, now, perhaps if I were a rogue (glares at Jordinn) this would be a great feat..but as a Knight who learned so much, I would stand with weapon in hand, but never would I swing at him.<br>
<br>
However, my duelling skills have raised a great deal over the last few months. I find myself with the protection of a warrior, the spells of the cleric, and the damage (when jousting) that only a Paladin can put out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Though it has been a very long time since I have seen Sir Tybertank, I believe his skills have grown very strong in the past months. Still with all his skills, Splos would defeat him. I have no doubt in my mind.<br>
<br>
However..Splos, where I shall defeat you is on the course of champions, where the fairways are narrow, greens firm, land dry, and skies clear. This is my true place of greatness. Face me if you dare. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://jennymarie.freewebspace.com/aal-new-sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ustorrme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Storrme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch!</span><br>  Posts: 801<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/12/02 12:56:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.slip.net/~mehudson/pics2/Storrme.gif width=46 height=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Memories of a time long past</span><hr size=1> I Shall tell you a tale of a long ago time in a very strange land...<br>
<br>
<br>
Slarena (my best friend) and I had grown up together and traveled the world of norrath side by side. One day we noticed some new docks being built we were very curious at this new development so we waited until they were finished and took the very first ride on the shuttles to this new land the sailors called kunark. At the time Slarena and I had only seen 30 or so seasons under the instruction of our guildmasters, we caught the boat in the middle of Timorus Deep and watched as the Shuttles went back to Butcher block. The Boat itself was amazing more beautiful than any other boat we had ever seen and it sailed so swiftly at times that you couldnt see the islands you were passing. When we arrived at the Docks in Firona Vie, the new outpost on Kunark, we walked about the city a bit trying to soak all the splendor in the place was so wonderful and buildings so different we were in awe and wonder.<br>
<br>
Shortly after arriving we met up with a few other adventures and decided to venture beyond the city gates which we were told that we were crazy that there were dangerous creatures about, we took caution and carefuly found a place to sit and chat while we took out creatures that might threaten the city.<br>
<br>
On of these people we had met was Suddyn she was a very soft spoken elven Druidess, another was Vestas a dashing swave half elven Rogue, who always seemd to have his eye on the ladies more than the creatures I belive he wished to steal thier hearts... Truth be told he was very handsome even if his armor was more mismatched than a Dwarf and a Highelf standing together.<br>
<br>
After some time we started feeling more confidant in our ablitys as a team and decided to venture forth to new lands again we decided to meet up the next day after rest and food and venture to the place of the giants called Frontier mountains. The next day we met up but some of the team didnt show it was only Slarena, Vestas and I. We talked and decided that we were strong enough we could go anyway so we did, we had a great time running and laughing and vestas with his charming personality tried to swoon both ladies and giants into droping thier armor for him *Grin*<br>
<br>
This was one of our First adventures in Kunark and it is something that was both scary and exciting all in the same I hope you enjoyed the little tale maybe ill write more later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

Lady Malasa <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I lived in Florida all my life until just over a year ago.  My wife and I moved to Atlanta hehe.  I lived in Gainesville for the last 10 years.  My wife and I went to school at UF, and ended up staying in Gainesville because we loved it so much hehe.  I have been to Clearwater more times than I can count hehe.  I love the Clearwater area, and I'm sure you are quite familiar with many of the surrounding areas I have been to often.  Crystal River, Homosassa Springs, Tarpon Springs, Tampa of course, Largo, Brandon, St. Pete and so on hehe.  I love the MOSI there in Tampa &amp; Busch Gardens is always fun too.  I think the place my wife likes most though is the big mall in Brandon HAH.  I've been there countless times hehe.  There is also a great Prime Rib place called Jessie's in Brandon that we like very much.  It's so neat that you live there YAY <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I moved away for 5 years while I was married but now that I am divorced I realized how much I missed my home. Funny how my kids will attend the same Elementary school I went to. And will have the same teacher I did. I have been attending St petersburg Junior College in Clearwater. The only other place I love as much in Florida would have to be the Everglades. So much nature, and Beauty. <br>

I love that town! I have two fond memories of Gainesville, both involve food.  Falafel King near the university and Burrito Brothers next door. At least I think that's what they were called. They had amazing homemade corn chips and to die for sloppy bean burritos awash in guacamole. *drools* <br>
<br>
The area is beautiful with all the natural springs about. I remember swimming in Poe Springs, a beautiful little icy swimming hole with crystalline water and turtles.  Someone I was with said it reminded them of Ferngully <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I simply cannot believe that my freckled sister has been to Falafel King and Burrito Brothers in Gainesville, FL ROFL!!  Aye they are both right near the main campus entrance to UF heehee.  They are right next to a similarly dilapidated place called Chinee Takee Outee HAHA!  Goodness me Lady Miraa, if you loved those places I can't imagine how much you would like the many many MANY places that are far better hehehe.<br>
<br>
Indeed there are literally dozens of wondrous springs surrounding the area that are amazing in their beauty and untainted serenity.  The beaches of Clearwater, where Lady Malasa calls home are also quite extraordinary.  The west coast of Florida in general is far far nicer than the Atlantic side hehe.<br>
<br>
Goodness me Malasa, it's just so neat knowing you live there hehe.  I wonder if you remember a place called the Kapok Tree that used to be open there years ago.  It was quite stunning and had many wondrous gardens and a great restaurant before it closed shop in the late 80's.  I have spent most of my time out in the Brandon area because that's where my friends mostly lived.  I know Fowler and Fletcher roads like the back of my hand out by the MOSI and campus of USF though hehe.<br>
<br>
I've also been to Bradenton and Sarasota quite a bit, which is just the other side of St. Pete as I'm sure you well know hehe.  But of the entire area, Clearwater is the most lovely in my humble opinion hehe.<br>
<br>
The Everglades are a wonder of nature to be sure, and I share your love of them.  Every time I go to the Sawgrass Mills mall in the Ft. Lauderdale/Coral Springs/Plantation area on the Atlantic side hehe, I always think about how the Everglades once stretched that far down towards Miami.  Huge HUGS to another native Floridian <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Maybe Aal can come visit us sometime instead of us going northward hehe.  Especially for your sake since even the gigantic Sawgrass mall doesn't compare to the one in Edmonton 8P.<br>

Sorry I havent been around, took a tumble on the ice a couple weeks ago. But I played Ainthara the other day and saw Faiena.  I was reminded of this.<br>
<br>
Early one Saturday morning back when I was in VoV, I was goofing off with an Alt.  I get a /tell from Kiisk, LOG AINTHARA IN NOW! Got the Frenzy camp for you.  Well Ain was still a young little thing and even though I knew I wanted an FBSS (cause everyone wanted an FBSS back then) thats about all I knew.  Well, we camped that thing for about 20 hours and didnt get a belt.  But that didnt matter.  We had so much fun that day.  So many people in guild came to help off and on.  Someone would log, someone else would come in.  I think just about every class was represented at some point that day.  And the froggies.   All the frogs most of the players were higher levels there and I swear it seemed like they were pulling them a hundred at time just for fun.  I still remember feeling the blood drain from my face the first time I saw the INC message and then saw about 15 frogs coming.   I not only wanted to zone, I wanted to get up and run out of the room away from the computer hehehe.  I was thinking to myself (and probably screaming to the screen), Theyre bigger than me, they should just know better than to pull all that.  I cant taunt all that at once with just a silly necro pet being the other tank. They should just know better!!!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well needless to say, they were older and they did know better.

My goodness I can remember so many adventures in LGuk and the Frenzy room it's staggering hehe.  I can certainly imagine how much fun that must have been for you gentle lady.  Thanks so much for sharing it with us.  Feel free to tell more stories 8P.<br>
<br>
I remember a night long ago when Norrath had only been fully activated for a week.  I had just attained my 8th degree and was feeling particularly adventurous hehe.  I had heard that there were wonders to behold far away in other parts of the world, so I decided to brave the unknown.  I left Qeynos behind and began a journey that I will never forget.<br>
<br>
The majesty and splendor of the lands I saw as I made my way East and North were awe inspiring.  I had to carefully navigate vast forests, mountainous areas, and be ever on the lookout for all manner of spectacular beasts and creatures.  Great giants and griffons, mighty lions and bears and wolves, nomadic gypsies, and one-eyed behemoths all did I encounter in utter amazement hehe.<br>
<br>
I finally came to a bustling metropolis of a city known as Freeport, after enduring many hours of perilous and harrowing adventure.  Huge spiders and Orc tribes surrounded the approach to the bustling settlement.  I had a vision quest that revealed to me another Monk Order located there, so I set out to find it and commune with my brothers and sisters from a different land.<br>
<br>
Eventually I made my way to the docks and booked passage on the greatest of all ships that I had ever seen.  In those days there was very little certainty of anything heehee.  I knew not where I was going, only that it led to some other continent with butchered mountain tops serving as a welcoming.  It was rumored that stout creatures called Dwarves dwelled in those parts, and I had an insatiable curiosity to learn about them.<br>
<br>
And so at long last I set foot on the grounds of a shore countless leagues from my homeland.  The beings around me were strange indeed, but most quite friendly.  I was an enigma to many there as well, for most had never encountered one such as I from such a distant land.<br>
<br>
I ventured forth and came upon a shining lady of immeasureable beauty.  She was of the ancient order, the high elven ancestors of all the elf kingdoms.  Her name was Aaladinae, and she had never seen my like in all her days.  I startled her greatly and she feared for her life at my approach, for it was not then known what is taken forgranted now hehe.<br>
<br>
I came up to her and she seemed hesitant, but inquisitive.  I introduced myself and she returned the greeting with a warm and kind one as befits one of her station.  We ended up chatting for quite a bit about where I came from and what my people were like.  She too was kind enough to tell me a bit of her world.  We then set out together to go to her home city of Felwithe.  It was the most beautiful place I had ever seen.  The people who dwelled there were of such refinement and beauty that my eyes hungered to soak in all that was within view.<br>
<br>
Then we made our way to an ancient tree village where the woodland cousins dwelled.  Lady Aaladinae showed me the wonders of that land, and I was struck by powerful emotions of awe and joy.  I met Lady Katrina, Wolf Princess of Kelethin, and became attached to her from the start.  So many of her village had never even seen one of my kind either hehe, so my next few nights were largely spent adventuring with strangers in a faraway place.  But, the journey was such that I was a humbled man at my good fortune.  And so the newness of the world we all had suddenly inhabited became closer knit and peoples from different lands began to learn about one another.<br>
<br>
More adventures of these early times can I tell.  For I was one of the original missionaries to seek out new peoples and new things in the earliest days.  Fear and danger were constant, but so were curiosity and courage.  Ever the vagabond, my destiny was set early on hehe.  I shall share more of those initial days soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
Oh and Ainthara, I do remember that Guk day.  Our 50 plus Wizzys, Chartrez and Syroq, teaming with Kiisk and Tenderloves AOE's were doing all the dmg.  hehe I think the big toll was 15 frog's at once. LOL  <br>
<br>
Back, way back about 2 or so years ago, Aeawen was but lvl 12.  Myself and a friendly wizard named Nennyin set out to journey to Quenos from Gfay.  Well we had no maps, and only a terrible sence heading to guide us.  Once we got to Freeport, Nennyin bound me there.  This was the easy part of the trip.  Once we left on this new land, we spent around 2 real life hours being a couple lost newbies in a new game.  We went thru east commons, west commons, hit Kithacore and into Highhold pass.  Well not thinking we did not bind here in highhold pass.  We set out and spent the better part of an hour trying to get out of highhold pass.  We finnaly reached east karana.  <br>
<br>
We invised up and started following the road.  I will remind you we had to no sow either.  So all this traveling was at the slow run speed.  Well we reached the wooden bridge and kinda felt like we had done something.  We have traveled so far and we knew Quenos was only a few zones away now.  So we reinvised and started following the road.  We did not relize we should have just followed the water. LOL  Well anyway after a long time and many inviso's wearing off, we finnaly reached west karana.  Now we were feeling good at this point.  We were one zone from Quenos hills and this seemed like this day long journey would soon be over.  <br>
<br>
We stayed inviso all this way and with little problems.  We started crossing West karana, following the road just as we had been.  When all of a sudden, Nennyin's inviso wore off.  He was quickly killed by a big flying monster called a Griffon.  While Nennyin was getting hit, I was the dumb druid and tried to heal Nennyin and after that Griff got Nennyin, he quickly killed me as well.  <br>
<br>
Now after around 3 hours I was back in Freeport, Corpse sitting in god knows where in West karana.  Nennyin and I had to do this journey over again to get our corpses.  At least after this day, we learned what bind was for and also we learned to stay clear of those Griffon's.  I think we spent the better part of about 6 real life hours traveling from Gfay to Quenos.  <br>
<br>
What a trip.<br>
<br>
This was the first road trip Aeawen took in his life and it was not fun then.  But looking back on it I get a good laugh everytime I think about it.<br>

My guild, House of Serenity, was falling apart...leader leaving. So having looked about at various guilds I decided upon Sanctus Covenir due to friends there and their fine reputation. So Tyberious tells me, come on down to Rathe Mountains bro, we are killing sphinxes. At this point Amsra was maybe 45 if that. So off I go, having no clue where I am going or what I will be fighting. Finally find them and meet many old friends and new. Spent 5 or 6 hours whacking about anything in the zone and had a blast, even tho those silly sphinxs were deep red to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  By the end of the day, I had my invite to the guild and knew I had found a new family.

Stories huh?<br>
I got lots of stories, its just which ones do I tell?<br>
<br>
Back in the days when a RTS was sought after, FS weapons, and bronze armor were considered being really twinked. I was not yet even an officer of the Knights of Povar.<br>
My loving family(KOP) discovered my birthday was coming up and made plans among themselves to throw me a surprise birthday party. They recruited my soon to be brothers, the wizard I consider a sister, and other close friends of mine to gather and hide in the paladin guild of Felwithe. Then one of my usual hunting partners claimed the need to use the bank, train, and sell and thus they got me to go usnsupectingly into their party. For my birthday I recieved many nice things like a platinum ruby veil, a brown chitin protector, and gator leggings.<br>
As always they had some games and fun things planned for the get together, we had a drunken swimming race, Dyre the guild enchanter did his running Troll impressions which turning into racing the gaurds to the zone and seeing how many times he could beat them. We also had a contest to see who could stagger in the widest when drunk, who could drink the most, and who could get the highest w/ lev on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Some of us got to know our guildmates better, while some got to be closer friends. Then at the end of our all night party we fired off some fireworks, did one last toast and took to the beds they'd rented at the Inn just for that purpose.<br>
<br>

And Aye Amita my fair lil preistess I remember those days in the Temple of Caziac Thule quite well, and fondly.  I remember the time Ugug thought twould be an excellent time to take a wee nap in the middle of exit corridor.  Of course I could nay let the poor brute come to harm and so sung the mighty song of sleep upon those 10 or so lizards that thought to wake our sleeping friend.  As I recall he awoke in time to flee and I was cast off to my last bind point... Freeport if I remember correctly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

This was before, during, and after the release of Kunark hehe.<br>
<br>
I know that the list they came up with was amazing hehe.  I had to take screenshots to prove I had actually gotten where they challenged me to go 8P.  These guys were serious and ruthless HAH.  And of course Lulu just loved it since it meant she was able to play hard to get BLEH hehe.<br>
<br>
I remember that I had to go all the way to Nagafen through the fire giants solo heehee.  I had to go all the way to Vox through the ice giants solo.  I had to make it right up to Innoruk and take his picture hehe.  It was crazy things like that.  This was back when 50 was the level limit hehe.  Man was that fun, but I sure did have some bruises and such after that run of a few days LOL.<br>
<br>
I think the last challenge was making it to Venril or some such hehe.  We had only found him a few days earlier SHEESH hehe.  Kunark was only out for maybe a week or so at the time.  I remember sending Ookie Monstah all my screenshots a week later and Lulu agreed I was worthy ROFL.  Dukalek was a bastage too and tried to make me do crazy things as well heehee.<br>
