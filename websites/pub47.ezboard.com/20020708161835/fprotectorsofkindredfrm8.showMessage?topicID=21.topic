<br>
To earn the Element of Water:<br>
1- Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water<br>
Phinigel Autropos, Kedge Keep<br>
<br>
To earn the Element of Air:<br>
2- Crown of Elemental Mastery<br>

I only need these three items.  Marle has the Burning Embers for me, and Resheval is holding the Pegasus Feather Cloak for me to also be MQed... I just need to help him make at least level 46 so he can go to PoA to turn it in.<br>

Snear will be the one to schedule it, and you've done your part by requesting another day in COM.  My gut reaction would be toward the end of June at the earliest for another COM event.  We're trying to get Hate booked for mid June, and we do have a few other epic mobs for others to squeeze in sometime in June as well.  We've got a few druids/rangers who need VSR killed so they're up a little bit further on the list (I would guess) since we were just in COM last weekend.  And there are a few others who've been waiting for assistance who we haven't tried to get once yet.<br>
<br>
KK is another one that's a step down the priority list, only cause we've gotten our current members their item from there (who needed it to go further) and again we have members who have been patiently waiting for help for a bit longer hehe.<br>
<br>
Don't fret though, we will be back to COM because we still need to get more druid/ranger jade reavers, and we will need to make another KK run also.  <br>
<br>
Rest assured, you are currently next in line for the COM torch as of today (only thing that could possibly change that would be if we inherited a mage who's last piece necessary was the COM torch but the likelihood of that happening is pretty much 0% since the crown is always harder to get than these other pieces; we go by closest to epic finish and then level if exactly tied -which was why Marle got the first COM torch drop over Mia even though Mia had been in the guild and waiting longer-those 3 mobs we did for Marle that week before pushed her ahead of Mia hehe).<br>

And I did mention it was my gut speaking (not anything guild officiated).  To do a whole day in COM like we did last Saturday, that takes resources, and we usually only do a big full raid like that 2x a month.  Everyone's been clammering for a planes raid, since our first Fear flop hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and so that request came up before the request for a repeat in COM.  <br>
<br>
Phinny doesn't take a full guild effort, and neither does COM itself (as long as you're not planning on spending a ton of time there), so everyone's always welcome to request a group or so in guild chat.  Keep tabs on Phinny and when you know he's up, give a shout and if there's the right mix on, of course people will help.  When you see a good number of high levels on, you can see if anyone's interested in heading back to COM as well.  It's just the full guild sponsored raids (gem reimbursement, etc.) that need the planning.<br>
<br>
In the last three weeks, we've spent a LOT more time helping mages with epic pieces than any other class (6 neh spawns, rottgrime, BW wurms, Slix, Undertow and Phinny attempts), so we need to devote some time to those who have been waiting longer ([this is what I said in my post hun] and who can't go any further in a section of their epic quest without help - for example, Greystorme and Kitihi need only VSR killed to get their scimitar weapon and have requested help earlier).<br>
<br>
You, Jondis and Crichton still need an epic drop from COM (to name 3 people off the top of my head), so we will be back, but because of your mob spawn, it's more for a weekend day than a weekday/weeknight.<br>
<br>
You weren't with us about two months ago or so when we went through an epic mob craze.  For about 3 weeks, we ran and did over 20 epic mobs if I remember correctly.  It was complete burnout for most of the core guild members (myself included) and so we put some holds on epics for 2 weeks (minus an exception or two).  <br>
<br>
It's easy to get excited about getting close to the end, but please remember we're doing the best we can without loosing members to burnout and other related factors.  We decided as a guild after that first craze that levels &gt; epics, which is why I've been saying some of this cautious stuff.  We're only devoting so much time to epic help during a specific time span in order not to go insane again hehe.  It got really ugly for a while afterwards (we weren't ourselves, peps didn't talk, requests for help didn't garner help on stuff like ports, rezzes, epic stuff-there were exceptions) because everyone had gotten stressed out.<br>
<br>
Remember hun, there's nothing stopping you from looking outside the guild for assistance as well.  Everyone's using all of their resources to get the help needed to finish their epic.  (Heck, I've been waiting to get a scroll off the chardok king since February 23rd so I can sit on the RF list for the next year- I even posted on the MT boards looking for help, had two guilds offer to help me=one guild disbanded and the other one lost their leader and is getting torn apart.  Mia's made 4 Hate trips and counting with other guilds, I think, trying to get his Hate staff.)<br>
<br>
We're not ignoring you, we're just trying to do the best we can, with what we have, without becoming too greedy of our members time on one aspect of the game only (epics).  Everyone's here for a different reason - because they like hunting, doing epic stuff, questing, chatting, etc.  We're trying to look out for everyone.<br>
<br>

1- I understand where you are comming from in your post, and I have no ill feelings about it at all.... I guess I just simply misunderstood your original messsage about waiting until June.  I hope all is well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

2- I do NOT want you or any one else that reads my previous post in this string to think that I am accusing anyone in PoKS of ignoring me... if there is anything that PoKS has NOT done to me it is ignore me.  You guys have been wonderful to me!  Please do not think I was acusing anyone here of ignoring me.<br>
<br>
3- If my post here (before this one) sounded like I was disapointed or upset... I was not.  I was trying, in a smartarse sort of way, to make a silly point.  Hehe<br>
