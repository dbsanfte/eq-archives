<br>
Thanks to everyone who lent support on our successful Plane of Fear raid on Sunday 2/2/03. You all were vital to its success. A special thanks to Docat, Budderz, Peleg, Miggichic, and Grakok for joining the raid lead team and helping keep the raid organized and flowing. Our goal was to primarily get Pow a Block of Everliving Golem or Sele a Head of Shissar, one or the other, but only 1. With it appearing CT was taken out the previous day, most of the epic mobs had been taken out including the Golems which would have given Pow his block and Docat his Iksar Child. <br>
<br>
This post includes a section called “recap of the day” which just reviews what happened for those who could not make it. The other section is called “something is wrong with this picture” where I begin a discussion of what we could have done better and how this is not a typical fear break in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Recap of the day</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Folks started to gather at the Rathe Mts/Feerott zone line at about 9am. I was away from the crowd organizing the raid team and chat lines. Docat was given the go ahead to put together the break in groups. I do not recall everyone who was put into these groups, but they did consist of Monks, Tanks, Clerics, Druids, and Echanters. The plan was for a monk to zone in and FD immediately and another monk run to the West wall ledge and FD. It was suggested by one of the raid leads/advisors to go west, but then go south a bit. This advice was taken and Docat and Budderz lead their groups to this spot. Not one death!<br>
<br>
While Docat and Budderz’s groups worked the zone in, I organized the remaining 29 peeps outside. Yes 29! Before I could write everyone’s names down, the break in party was already calling for more groups because the zone was clear. I scampered to put groups together with a healer, tank, and where possible, haste. Then I started to add anyone I could to those groups to get them in there. In the end, I think those groups came out pretty good. =). We mobilized groups 3-8 to the zone in. We started to get ItU on everyone, but that was becoming futile and with a clear zone in, I sent groups in 1 at a time with about 10 second in-between. All made it to the zone except one. I am unsure what happened, but he ended up further north. Possibly wrong turn or taking one for the team and leading the mob away from us.<br>
<br>
We had a good location to pull to and we changed pullers based on level only. The original puller had done a great job! Rocz pulled all the mobs from the North. We realized the epic mobs were not up and were going to have do something fun. Some peeps got a bit anxious and wanted to move along. We then followed the raid plan and pulled from the east, but changed plans because of those who wanted to move. We moved along the east wall rather than pulling it all. We did creep along to be safe. When arriving at the east wall and killing a few mobs, we took a quick AFK for those who needed it. I then realized it was almost 2pm PST. We had been in here for almost 3-4 hrs now. <br>
<br>
We got the Wraith of Shissar on target, my notes said I needed the Spirit of Shissar, but another chanter set me straight. We worked our way north, then west to the firewall. Chryys and Rocz tracked the wraith and we ended up pulling the entire temple. About 15 mobs or more (squid heads) invaded our camp and took our clerics and casters first. Rogues got camped out, I went LD after Sele died. Pow came back alive with a bit of health. Yild swooped back in and Rez’d us lickity split. I’ve never seen a more efficient CR!<br>
<br>
Zek, I believe was his name, suggested we get a bard to train the mobs and we pull off the train. I’ve heard great stories about this method in the past and Meow was willing to give it a shot. Meow and Rocz went in to get the mobs. Rocz died but sure enough, Meow had a train. Trew pulled off the train and we spent about 30 mins plucking mobs off. The Wraith came and we took it out. Sele got his drop as planned. We finished the train and we had enough druids in groups to get everyone out safely. <br>
<br>
WOOT to you all!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Something is wrong with this picture</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Now this raid went way too smoothly. I’ve heard and read about fear break ins not going quite like this. I’ve never heard of it being this easy. Upon zone in we should have been mobbed or lost many more peeps.<br>
<br>
The epic mobs were mostly down. If these mobs were up, we should have stayed with the plan to pull to the ledge or where we ended up on the SW side. <br>
<br>
It is possible the yard trash had not fully re-spawned since the previous day, but I believe they are on 6-8hr timers and were all up. They just didn’t seem to have the ambition to kill us. Maybe having CT up or the Golems gives them a larger aggro range? Not sure, but for those who were getting impatient and confident, please don’t because this was too easy for some reason.<br>
<br>
What could have gone better? Not much. <br>
-I logged in early to prepare, but not early enough. We ended up going into Fear a bit late. <br>
-Not everyone had read the planning posts or the loot policy. <br>
-We lost some loot to rot because it was tough to find and lots of chatter. <br>
-We ended up with too many chat lines. I intended to use /fear and /fearraid but after we setup the raid, we began to use the raid channel as well. <br>
-We broke away from the plan by not going to the ledge and by moving early. (This was not detrimental and may have complimented the raid.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again all and I can’t wait to go back to help others.<br>

We did get many mobs on us when we zoned in, but nothing like I was planning.  We didn't have one death until much later..clerics were bored to death.  Did we just get really lucky???

<br>
I'm glad to have been there early and was happy to help with break in to provide melee damage.  About 1/2 the mobs saw through my sneak/hide (which means they would have seen through reg invis and IvU).  This WOULD HAVE made CR a bit tricky, except the fact that I only had to pull one dead body the whole time I was there.  (Granted, I had to go after only a few hours).  <br>

Very fun and I wish I could have stayed.
