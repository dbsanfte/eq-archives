Lets take the killing of abortion doctors for example...How is this justified in the kind, caring hearts of fundementalist lunatics? And of course...No one expects the Spanish Inquesition!<br>
<br>
Let's just face the facts. Those who want to distort religion for their own goals will do so. It will happen with all religions, not just Mulsims, Christians, or Satanists. EVERY RELIGION will have those people who use and twist the words of the founders in order to further their personal goals. (see my above post about wearing black wigs.)<br>
<br>
To Quote the only true gods, Monty Python....<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who....&quot;<br>
<br>
There are bad muslims in the world, there are bad christians in the world, there are bad pagans (points at amsra), etc, etc, on and on forever in every religion we can find...<br>
<br>
What i want to see is people to stop laying blanket statements down about a group of people when it is a small minority of the people who we are really talking about. If you are going to talk shit, please be specific.<br>
<br>
All scripture whether it is the Quran, the Bible, or the script to the Brady Bunch can be interpreted 800 different. Lets stop nit picking. Because if we start nitpicking the myths and stories of every religion, we will find things that can be bent to prove our points where ever we look. It is a no win situation....<br>
<br>
To quote Rodney King:<br>
<br>
Can't we all just get along!<br>
<br>
Do we really need to judge each other so much? You live your life and believe what you want. I will live mine. Debate is healthy, but name calling is not. <br>
<br>
When it boils down to it...we are all just looking for explanations to the things that we cannot explain. Some look to old texts like the bible or the Quran. Some look to the new Religon of science. Who is right? Who cares!! Everyone sees the world from their own perspective and guess what? They are all valid.<br>
<br>
It is when certain groups decide to force their beliefs on others that we begin to see the problems. Whethere it is killing abortion doctors or suicide bombing, it is still forcing your belief on some one else.<br>
<br>
I am glad that people have decided to believe in something. All the power to them...just don't tell me what to believe and we won't have a problem...<br>
<br>
I would love to see people take off their fighting gloves and have a nice conversation about what they really believe in. I mean YOU personally, not what you think you are supposed to say as a devote christian or a confirmed aethist. <br>
<br>
AND NO NAME CALLING!! If this thread needs a whipping boy, i will step forward...Call me an Agnostic, Anarchist, Gay-postive, Pro-feminist, Left Wing, Radical who is too lazy to stand up for what he really believes in, who instead makes self-righteous posts on gaming boards because he feels to inadequate to do anything else worth while....<br>
<br>
There...no more religion bashing...lets stop generalizing and get personal...if there is one thing i cannot stand, it is generalizing....there are so many reasons to dislike some on a personal level, lets not bring stereo-types into it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have taken Islamic history as part of a political science degree, and the Palestinian teacher was quick to point out that according to the Quran &lt;as interpreted by many Sunni who are not radicals&gt; that since Jews and Christians believe in God...they will also go to Heaven even though they dont share ALL of Islam's views. <br>

We can go back to the time of the Crusades when Jews Christians and Muslims all lived in peace in the holy city until the Crusaders arrived and the streets ran red with the blood of all who were not Christian.<br>

The church is not representative of Christianity...it adopts its name and perverts it. Christianity was deep underground during the monopoly of the Catholic church...if you believed in scripture over what they told you to believe, you were executed. Hence the inquisition; a power grab. The church (not necessarily the Catholic church) replaces the Bible with their own traditions and teachings. <br>
<br>
So I ask you, do not judge based on the actions of the church. It is, unfortunately, a poor model. However, the same may be said about many individuals. <br>
<br>
These muslims are not 'extremists', they do not 'pervert' their religion...they merely follow it. The muslims who DO change and interpret Islam to their liking are the ones who (I am including 3 different translations)<br>

"004.034 <br>
YUSUFALI: Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) <b>beat them </b>(lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). <br>
PICKTHAL: Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and <b>scourge them.</b> Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great. <br>
SHAKIR: Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and <b>beat them</b>; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."<br>
<br>
On an aside, the word 'lightly' is not in the Arabic. <br>
<br>
Volume 4, Book 52, Number 260: <br>
Narrated Ikrima: <br>
<br>
Ali burnt some people and this news reached Ibn 'Abbas, who said, "Had I been in his place I would not have burnt them, as the Prophet said, 'Don't punish (anybody) with Allah's Punishment.' No doubt, I would have killed them, for the Prophet said, '<b>If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.</b>' " <br>
<br>
Volume 9, Book 84, Number 64: <br>
Narrated 'Ali: <br>
<br>
Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Apostle, by Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, <b>kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection." </b><br>
<br>
"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits...191And slay them wherever ye catch them. and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for persecution is worse than slaughter; But fight them not at the sacred Mosque unless they (first) fight you there; But if they fight you, slay them.  Such is the reward of those who reject faith.  192 But if they cease, Allah is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.  193And fight them on until there is no more persecution. And the religion becomes Allah's.  But if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression" (The Qur'an, Surah 2:190-193). <br>

Maybe this will help make it clear why the Mideast will always be in turmoil.<br>

Those &quot;radicals&quot; are not Islamic radicals, they are merely doign what thier religion clearly teaches them to do. Just because thier actions seems &quot;radical&quot; from our point of view, does not make them radical. <br>
Myrklan, are you trying to tell me that a significant amount of Muslim's believe that if you believe in God that you will be saved? Why then are not demons saved? They believe in God, though hate him and despise his name. The point is that some religions disagree on very fundamental things, such as the difference between right and wrong and characterizations of each. <br>
Derrida, you are taking the Crusades out of it's historical context. Lets look and see what was going on before the Crusades...Muslims brutally rampaging through the middle east, through Turkey, and into lower spain brutally slaughtering any that opposed Allah, such as Christians. The Crusades were merely an attempt to stop them from further ransacking Europe, not a bloodthirsty quest. Though you do bring up a good point...yes there are bad people of every religion. But to say there are bad Christians is wrong...these people are not Christians by any means. Just because they claim to be a part of the church means nothing. A true Christian would not murder an abortionist, it is entirely against every thing they believe. To a true Muslim, murdering infidels is not. If I were to call myself a bird and go jump off a building and fall to my death, would that mean that birds cannot fly? Or perhaps some birds cannot fly? No, it would not mean these things at all because I was never really a bird to begin with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/udethbeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dethbeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/11/02 5:46:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About Those Books</span><hr size=1> <B>In none of those passages you quoted does it say anything anti-christian or anti-semitic.</b><br>

<br>
It's [the Surah] the one that tells you will attain paradise by killing infidels with whom you are at war. Once you get to heaven, there are curvacious women with black eyes. These women will eager to please [have sex with you] you. Wine flows in heaven (disallowed on earth). YES it says that. I guess its paradise for straight men and lesbians that are into Arabic looking women, go figure. Go find he text hehe, Im not going to do all the work for you :=.<br>

I guess they don't serve lasagna in heaven, its most likely fallafals and cous cous and maybe some bean dip you eat with pita bread in the Middle Eastern heaven....then you men go climb another one of these Arabic women for yet more sex in between wine drinking while you puff on your pipe.  <p><HTML>

You are the one purporting to be the creation of a god, you prove it. The onus is on  * YOU * to prove such a far fetched claim. I dont have to prove negatives. <br>

All that &quot;geological&quot; data is rediculous. It is measured using the half life of Carbon-14, and is horribly innacurate. In one instance a scientist recorded a fossil being 1.6 billion years old, and upon his next analysis came up with the conclusion that it was merely 4,500 years old. Evolution is pathetic. It is one of the very reasons I became a Christian in the first place. It is not like evolution can't explain everything, it can't explain anything! Lets take one of its basic principles, mutations. Mutations are supposedly how animals gradually became humans, or vice-versa in some cases =). Mutation is loss of genetic information resulting in abnormal physicalities. Now, if an ameoba evolved into a human ( a being with a billion times it's genetic information ) through mutations (LOSS of genetic information) then where did the genetic information come from? Even the leading evolutionists of this time have no idea how to explain this, the very foundation of evolution.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/udethbeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dethbeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/11/02 6:02:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About Those Books</span><hr size=1> And I dont have to 'prove' anything to you.

<br>
Noi you choose to believe science holds the answers and such is your right but understand that science IS a religion of and by itself.  Not reality.  Science over the years has had more then its share of contradictions some of them far more impossible even then creationism.  Even Einstien one of the greatest minds believed in a higher power and force in creation he merely wished to explain how it was done.<br>
<br>
You say the onus is on one group or another to prove but you get to keep your view?? No no no Noi that is not how the scientific method works.  ANY assertation must be proven again and again, and more then once what was proven turned out to be disproven later.   <br>
<br>
I am tired of seeing everyone using 9/11 to preach about one thing or another.. So let me be clear here.... NO MORE!!!<br>
<br>
No more bashing of viewpoints<br>
<br>
No more excusing insane policy on our fallen heros<br>
<br>
No more superiority do you really think its religous people carrying out this insanity?  Its desprite fanatics and ego manical power mad fools.  Its not about Islam and its teachings, Its not about bible crusaders, and its not about agnostics and aethists.  Its about insanity its about the darkest parts of humanity.. and my brothers deserve better then to be used as a pulpit.  <br>

Pleeeease don't turn our boards into a middle-east-esque area?<br>
<br>
<br>
And..HerkeLee...I REALLY have to correct you on this one..<br>
<br>
A genetic mutation is not the LOSS of genetic material, my friend.  A genetic mutation can be any number of things, such as...<br>
<br>
1.  Genetic material lost<br>
2.  Genetic material added<br>
3.  Genetic material duplicated<br>
4.  Genetic material cut-and-pasted into a new area along the chain of DNA<br>
5.  Genetic material being rearranged in any fashion<br>
<br>
You might ask how these can possibly come about...<br>
<br>
1.  Genetic material lost  --  The body screws up sometimes during mitosis, it's a fact that's been observed thousands of times.  This can also be caused by destruction of DNA by radiation.<br>
<br>
2.  Genetic material added -- If genetic material is added, it's most likely some kind of duplication or cut-and-paste phenomena, but if it's literally ADDED, then the only way I can think of right now is via a retrovirus.  A retrovirus injects its own RNA into a cell, where it is transformed into DNA onto the host's DNA strand during mitosis and thus gets duplicated with every cell division thereafter.  HIV is a retrovirus.  Once you have a retrovirus, you have it for good...  Now, since the number of gametes in a person's body (cells with half the amount of chromosomes as normal ones, they are sex-cells that are used in reproduction (when the sperm fertilizes the egg and makes a new organism)) is FAR less than the number of every other kind of regular cell (with all the chromosomes instead of half), retroviruses usually don't infect the gametes and are therefore not usually transferred to offspring.  If the gametes are infected though, the retrovirus DNA becomes one with the human DNA, so it can be passed along...<br>
<br>
3.  Genetic material duplicated  --  during mitosis, genetic material can accidentally be duplicated.  It's random.  It's also been observed to have happened thousands of times in labs.<br>
<br>
4.  Genetic material cut-and-pasted -- during mitosis, genetic material is sometimes placed out of order.  Yet another random mistake in our cells duplication, which has been recorded thousands of times in labs.<br>
<br>
5.  Basically, the rearrangement, insertion, or deletion of any amount of DNA is a mutation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I just read this article I stumbled upon in a search engine pretty randomly..<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/genetic-mutations.html">www.christiananswers.net/...tions.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I just want to point out that the idea that &quot;mutations will eventually turn the human genetic code to gibberish&quot; is completely nonsensical.  Sure, you can catologue thousands of negative effects of mutations; VERY VERY VERY few are beneficial, and the chances are that if it was beneficial it wouldn't even be noticable by our standards.  If you grow another eye in the back of your head, chances are there's something REALLY wrong with your genetics, even if it does let you know if your sibling is sneaking up on you...  Plus, it won't be passed on very well to your offspring if you mated with a 'normal' human.<br>
<br>
The basic idea is that DNA isn't always removed.  An amoeba COULD turn into a human-like creature with billions of years worth of evolution.  It would merely have countless mutations that would for the most part be bad, but one in very very few would be beneficial, and it would grow on that and then the next and the next until it was a human.  DNA can be added and mixed around, not just removed.<br>
<br>
Another little fact...did you know that almost all of the human genome is useless jibberish?  That's right.  Most of our DNA is garbage that we don't really need.  In fact, our bodies don't even use a lot of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the age of the earth...well...  Dating a material by radioactive decay IS accurate.  They can measure how much of a certain material decays into another material over a given amount of time, and then calculate the half-life of that material based on how much did decay, and then looking at how much of the material there is versus how much of the decay material there is in an object, one can see how long the radioactive material has been decaying.<br>
<br>
One more thing...what about the dinosaurs?  How come there aren't any records of dinosaurs with humans?  Because they came before...at least, that's the most logical explanation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but when it comes to science and mathematics and logic -- that's MY &quot;religion.&quot;  But it can be proven.  It HAS been proven.  The only things that cannot be proven are things like postulates in math, such as the &quot;line-segment addition postulate,&quot; which states that...<br>
<br>
Line segment AB plus line segment BC equals line segment AC.  It's so damn simple you can't prove it!  You might say, &quot;Well...it is!  It's simple!  It's logical!  You have two things right next to each other, so it has to be!&quot;  But you'll never really be able to mathematically PROVE it.  It's just accepted, because it has never, ever, ever, EVER been untrue.  Show me one instance where the line segment postulate fails us!  Hehe  Or this nifty little postulate:<br>
<br>
If a equals b, and b equals c, then a equals c.<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe in logic and things that can be proven.  But that's not all that I believe in.<br>
<br>
I believe that every person has a responsibility to do good and to be accepting of other people.  I believe that people should strive to be good to themselves and people around them.  No person has the right to discriminate against any other person based solely on their beliefs.  Every person should strive to be good and loving.  People need to be helpful, kind, courteous, and respectful.  Now, nobody's perfect, and nobody will actually be able to do all of that, but upholding a good moral code is essential (for me) to keep the world wonderful.  Those are my personal beliefs.  No God, no Allah, no nothing.  Just you and me.  Us.  Here.  Right now.  WE make the world what it is!  Let's make it good. <p><B>
