The countries named in the secret report -- provided to Congress on January 8 -- were China, Russia, Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Syria, the Times reported. <br>

He views his actions here as apocalyptic; I assume he thinks we are living in the &quot;end time.&quot; He constantly retorts of his enemies' actions as &quot;evil&quot;, indicative of the religious way he sees things. His faith has convinced him all the more of his actions I have read. For the record, I am an atheist. <br>
<br>
Religion-please read this carefully<br>
<br>
Bush refuses to validate what Pat Robertson says about Islam: that Islam is an &quot;evil&quot; religion, whose Quran depicts mulitple scenes of violence and encourages violence against Jews and Christians. If any one person here has ANY belief that Pat Robertson is not 150% RIGHT, click this link and spend a few hours reading the Quran for yourself at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/">www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Read it, its worth a few hours to understand the mindset. <br>
<br>
At this point you may be wondering how I can defend Pat Robertson. After all, the bible is filled with nearly the same stuff as the Quran. What you don't see is that in the West, we no longer really take this stuff seriously. If you chose to believe you can, and most do believe something. But then don't take the bible literally. Preachers in the US preach off of one passage or at most a chapter (Catholics). Always a small passage is discussed at length and expanded upon, sometimes for hours. Contradictary texts are of course, not going to be heard here. In a secular west, we simply allow citizens to believe what they chose, but do they REALLY believe evey passage? Because if they believed every passage, we could not have our modern way of life. Do you beleive the genesis account of creation is accurate? So which is it? Do we admit that both these books are not to be taken literally, or do we tell them to just be believers and &quot;good&quot;?<br>
<br>
Islam has never been reformed and the a large percentage of the populace still sees it as literal. Read the violent texts, and see if they scare you too. I like what they do to non-believers like me, Christians and Jews. Tickets to heaven are faster when you kill one of these. Is this to be taken literally by followers of Islam. Stop listening to the media and read the texts yourself. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Afghanistan<br>
While I reluctantly agreed with the action in Afghanistan (provided US casualties and Afghan casualties were minimized), the actions beyond that nation are far far more complex. We need to get over this simplistic mentality we have in the US. As soon as we bomb a country, we have &quot;cleansed it&quot; with our bombs as we did in Kosovo, Iraq and Libya. This is a long story in this country, I dont want to get into a long discussion on it. <br>
<br>
Iraq<br>
Against Iraq, he will find the US going alone. The US will only sew far deeper resentment in the Middle East with this policy. This is no cake walk. Had the US gone in earlier, the populace would have been more receptive. Im not suggesting to know Iraqi opinion, but I assume that a decade of sanctions has not endeared us to the ppl here. <br>
<br>
N Korea<br>
Clinton's policy of sending Albright to give them more $ to prevent them from making WOMMs, really was silly too. On the other hand, lumping N Korea under the axis of evil was silly too. N Korea and *cough* Iran? Nonetheless, the Bush adminstration backed away from this preemptive strike idea v Pyong Yang, instead going back to Clinton's policy hehe. With respect to N Korea, is making MOMM such as medium range missles and selling them to Iran justify a nuclear strike? You tell me. <br>
<br>
Iran<br>
Ok well Bush might have screwed up here. Iran was actually liberalizing. Why lump them into this &quot;axis of evil&quot; and make life harder for the far more liberal students there? Well was that comment enough to blame Bush for Irans becomming more and more conservative. And on Iran, this &quot;liberal&quot; Khatami is a religios Mullah, how Fing liberal can he be.  <p><HTML>

. Iraq....that's gonna be dicey. Saddam is an bad man and we need to get rid of him, but another war there would be very dicey in terms of our alliances. Bush way f'd up with iran....they actually been supporting us. Course on the other hand they still supporting Hezbollah. Korea, we were actually making head way with them til the 'evil of axis' speech. I was initially impressed with this Bush's ability after 9/11, but it is eroding very fast. I still can't help but think the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Look at the whole Israel/ Palestein thing....All it is doing is getting bigger.<br>
<br>
But actually my main point of the initial post is that we have a pres who is actually considering nuke war as an option....that just blows me away.Thank the goddess I did not vote for him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If Bush knows ANYTHING about being diplomatic, you don't make secret documents stating that you're willing to NUKE other countries...<br>
<br>
Bush really pisses me off.  He's only good enough to be able to maintain the post of the Presidency.  Hell, I'll bet I'd do just as good as he's doing if I had all his advisors!<br>
<br>
Him and his religion...<br>
<br>
You know what...<br>
<br>
I'm atheist...and proud to be it.  Know why?  I don't have any obligations to &quot;god&quot; and people who are atheist can't blame stuff on some higher being.  Oftentimes, religion ticks me off.  People who follow it don't bug me at all,  unless they do something bad in connection with it.  The SECOND that a person relates violence with religion, or stones someone to death because they don't believe in their religion, they have earned my utmost contempt and hatred.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  And...<br>
<br>
I read a little bit of that, Noitide -- the Qur'an, that is.  Hardly any of it, really, but a little..  I like how they mention in the first little bit that people who don't believe in Islam and Allah are themselves at fault.  The Qur'an states that nonbelievers are wrong...yet it gives no reason.  It says it multiple times repetitively, yet still no reasons...<br>
<br>
And what's ever better, is that if someone grows up listening to and reading texts (Not just the Qur'an, but with any religion), they WILL believe it.  Just because they do.  You can't make someone not believe.  Belief and opinion are completely based on a person's experience and feelings...if they don't want to change, they simply won't.  So the problem is that you end up with all these people around the world believing in all this stuff...and...and....blahhhhhh.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I also like how even if it's the &quot;word of God (Allah),&quot; that God apparently likes to talk in the third person.  I'd say that many religious writings could have been written by a madman in a cave..but...if I said that, I might have people trying to kill me, what with beliefs and all.  *sigh* <p><B>

Islam is in no way a religion of peace, and it is quite evident in the Quran. It's very foundation is in war and hatred. But where I disagree with you is your veiw of Christianity. I am a Christian. I was not raised a Christian, I was for a very long time an atheist much like yourself. Before I start, I would like to say that I do not consider myself any more &quot;enlightened&quot; then anyone else, but I would like to share my viewpoint.<br>
          <br>
           First of all, after extensive studies of the Bible I have yet to find any of these alleged contradictions. Never in the Bible does it teach or tell ANYONE to attack non-believers, rather treat them better than you would yourself. The Bible is meant to be taken literally, with the exception of some religious symbolism in various places. Every Christian I know takes the creation, resurrection, and prophecies literally. The difference between Muslims taking the Quran literally and Christians taking the Bible literally is that the Quran teaches destruction of the infidels, whereas the Bible does not in any way. Christianity is truely a religion of peace.<br>
          <br>
           Secondly, do not let stereotypical Christians like most right-wing republicans (including Pat Robertson) to be the basis of your view on Christianity. Many of them, well actually most of them, are using Christianity as a political device rather than a guideline to live by. <br>
          Kirche, I respectfully disagree on your veiw of religion as a hindrance. Christianity has made me a happier person, a better family member, and an honest man. It has changed me, made me stronger in many ways. The laws and guidelines are not what Christianity is about, though it may seem that way. Once you truely accept it in your heart these become natural and a blessing rather than a hindrance. I know this sounds stupid to you, and I wouldn't be surprised if you stopped reading it before this. I was much the same way, and again I do not consider myself any more &quot;enlightened&quot; than anyone else. <br>
          I wrote this post to share my opinion. It is not a flame, not an argument, not a speech. I saw these posts, was impressed by them, and felt that I should post my thoughts. If I offended you, I am truely sorry.<br>
                                                          Sincerely,                                                                                 Blake aka Herkee Lees <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uherkeelees.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HerkeeLees</A> at: 3/10/02 7:47:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ukircheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kirche EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Church</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/10/02 8:07:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://kirche.freewebspace.com/images/lovers.gif WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=178></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is he insane???</span><hr size=1> No, I'm not offended...<br>
<br>
See, if a good person chooses to follow a religion and they *are* good, like you, and they don't use their religion as an excuse to kill, hurt, steal from, or abuse others, then I think that's cool.  If believing in a religion makes you feel better and makes you a better person to everyone, including yourself, and it helps you maintain morals that you believe in, more power to you!  It's only when people are stubborn and violent and radical and hateful towards others for no reason other than the way those others believe, not based on their actions,  that I have a major problem with them and their &quot;religion.&quot;  Religion is in quotes because it is the person who is at fault, not their religion.  People who do bad things and associate themselves with religion hurt everyone in the religion though.  If there was, say, a Christian uprising that killed a few thousand people just because they didn't believe the way the Christians did, it wouldn't mean that all Christians (like you) are bad...but it certainly would taint the religion.<br>
<br>
I actually like people who believe in religions and are good people.  If a person is good, and they use their religion to help them better themselves and to be kind to others, that's really awesome, and I admire people who uphold good principles like that, be they Islamic or Christian or Mormon or Catholic or Wiccan/Pagan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
EDIT:  I just want to point out that I didn't call religion a hindrance...at least...I think I didn't.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ...I just look around and see it causing so many problems in our world.  I apologize, since I know there are those who follow religions and are the absolute antithesis of all the horrible things that I see related with religion, but those few taint the entire religion with their association...whether it's justified or not..  Humans are prone to be prejudiced; the best one can do is appreciate that not all people are the same. <p><B>

With all due respect Herkee,  you believe the Genesis account of creation or is that just symbolic? Can you find a single LEGITIMATE scientist that believes that account? Even most &quot;Christian&quot; Universities, save theology schools, after 150 years post Darwin- are no longer teaching it as literal. Why? Cause it's not erm true and they are erm ashamed because even the professors refuse to teach it? Go read it and tell me for sure before  I post it here in its entiretly. Please go read and tell me if you believe Genesis is accurate. Go, now tell me if you believe the world is about 6k years old. And you believe soandso begat soandso and lived 712 years. Moses parted the red sea. Staves to serpents = more effects than EQ has. Oh and I have two words for you, DINO SAUR. I want you to read it or Im going to post it here. <br>
<br>
Oh and its there's any part thats wrong, creation for example, how can any of it worth a dime? I refuse to accept your slamming of Islam and not accepting your own slamming. Shoot our out nations Priest, i mean attorney general was ashamed of a DC statue which had a women's bust on it exposed-a Burqa would have been more appropriate. Fundementalist christians are pretty much taliban themselves, arent they? And why is that? Because they interpret the bible literally!<br>
<br>
New flash: your bible (or your Quran) was written by men, by men who didnt rarely knew each other, over centuries; much of it jumbled, some lost; hardly sacred; NONE written by a god. <br>
<br>
As for your comment on &quot;good people&quot;. What a bunch of crap. Priests molest kids, Preachers steal from the church goers (or TW watchers as the case my be). I have personal knowledge of 'religious' persons perjuring themselves in civil cases to get ph4t $$$. So what is religion worth? nothing. It causes much more harm than it does good. It causes wars. <br>
<br>
What we should teach our kids is not to fear a god, but to: 1) be kind to one another; and 2) decent; and 3) helpful; and 4) non violent; and 5) honest; and 6) help your fellow man because its the right thing to do, not due to a non existant deity; 7) respect the law-or work to change it where needed -but obey it. <br>
<br>
Now I will grant you this Herkee, at least under the teachings of Christ (the dude that said he was god like thousands of other folks), you are toldto b humble, turn the other cheek etc etc etc, this is a departure from the first testament which  was much like the Quran and is some progress if viewed from afar.  <p><HTML>

It in fact is very similar to the bible. Same basic beliefs, same basic do' and don't 's. No where in the koran does it say that it is good to kill innocents, in fact it explictly says that killing innocents is wrong.<br>

<br>
Personally, i am agnositic...which means i don't believe it til i see it...When God comes and has a conversation with me, i will believe he exists. I will not believe blindly...<br>
<br>
I agree with much of what Noitide has posted (even if it is a bit harsh at times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    /hugs Noitdie). The bible to me is like any other set of myths. They might have some basis in reality, but they are more stories that teach you how you are supposed to act by offering examples. <br>
<br>
I was forced to go to crutch....err...church for 18 years of my life and i know almost all the bible stories. My preacher or any other religious person i talked to never had the answers to my questions, so i have begun to look elsewhere for the answers i seek. Since my liberation, i have decided that for myself, i need a different path. Everyone has their own path and should not be lead away from their path by cynical, jaded folks like me...If you found your path, i salute you...you are further down the path than me...My path has led me from forced christianity to Heavy Metal Anti Christ to aethieism to agnostic (now that i am not so angry)....I would like to think that i now have an open mind and am ready to experience things that my aetheism would not allow...<br>
<br>
Religion taken literally seems a bit dangerous to me. Religous parables should be taken as all parables from greeks Like Aesop to modern sit coms like the Brady Bunch. They contain moral stories that show us how the writers of the parable think we should act. Find the parables that agree with your morals and out look on life and share them with your family, friends, and children. But please, don't wear a black wig like Jan Brady just cause you want to look different than your sisters...The point of that episode was to be comfortable with yourself...not to wear black wigs. It is often very dangerous when the parables are mis-interperted or twisted. This is the things that pisses me off most about &quot;Religion&quot;...<br>
<br>
Ass far as Bush goes...err...did i say ass?? I meant...as far as Bush goes...Please pray to whoever you currently worship that he does not do as much damage to the world as i fear he will...&lt;insert-your-god here&gt; SAVE US!<br>
<br>
As i continue on my path, i am sure i will find what i am looking for spiritually...but it will not be in an organized religion...because i always try to stay away from mind control...<br>
<br>
--edit--<br>
When i re-read this post, i thought it was kind of ironic that there is a picture of cleric beneath it...I hope i have not offended Brell! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

It is a religion from India that is around 5000 years old.  I have over the past few years begun to not follow the Hare Krisna because I personaly do not believe that alot of what is said in this or most any other religion can hold true in a modern society.  Most religions are several thousand years old, and were written with old superstitions and limited knowledge of science and how the world works.  Simple things were taken as miracles.  The parting of the red sea in the bible has been proven could happen with the right tide levels and wind pattern.  Various things like that.  The main problem that I have with any religion is the way they treat and prosecute those that do not believe what they do.  Every religion does it, no matter where or when it was created.  Well I never read anything in the Bagavagita, the Hare Krishna religious text, that had anything about that, but anyways....Christianity has the crusades, the spaniards that came to the americas and tried to force the mayans to convert, Islam does it, so many do it.  And why?  We are all human, and treating each other well should be well enough.  You should not have to be forced to become sheep and be told what to believe as long as you are not doing things that would hurt your fellow man and society as a whole.  If I am not out murdering and stealing and am living a normal life, why call me wrong? <p>Dark Age of Camelot<BR>

Kinda like a character delete except the info is not retrievable in a data base except in the memories of those who remember. This is why we should strive to &quot;leave a good mark&quot; on this planet with fantastic thing(s) we can do, because it might assure memories and perhaps even a mention in text- that's quasi immortality. Unfortunately, those that have merely stained the world, have quasi immortality. <br>
<br>
I tend not to be a vocal atheist btw. But High Priest Bush seems to get the juices flowing. This guy has the power of destruction on this planet that is TERRIFYING. The US population is asleep, enamored of his talk of a better economy, &quot;crushing evildoers&quot; and waving flags.<br>
<br>
9/11 was BOUND to happen (read numerous Congressional reports), it happened FAR too late. There were some even in the 70's that wanted to use airplanes in this fashion. We didnt even have cockpit doors that locked!!!!!!! What the hell did we expect. Our xray procedures were a joke. All the aforementioned crap was a result of the governments innept nature (erm yes Republicans too) and inability to do anything. <br>
<br>
9//11 CAN happen again. Bombing half the planet will not stop it. Being one sided in the Middle East helps a lot too :/ What might stop it is having a real border-with real checks, a real system to check incoming cargo freights -can you say mini nuke? But Bush and others like him think 9/11 happened because America lost its faith and its 'aura of invulerability' ceased working :/ hehe. I like to call that Rune 6.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for this, we have to justify so many things, among them telling Welfare mothers they have to Marry LOL, have prayer in schools, end abortions (since thats why we had 9/11 didnt you know?) <p><HTML>

...was simply that the Bible uses literary devices such as symbolism (especially in books such as revelation where the church was under heavy persecution) that are not meant to be taken literally.  Those contradictions listed on that page are, in my opinion, horrible. I have heard every one of them at least a dozen times and they all break down. I would love to go over them all with you, but I simply do not have 9 hours to spare atm. If you have a particular one, please feel free to bring it up to me as I would love to clear things up.  www.carm.org is a decent site for that kind of material, also. Anyhow, to say the Bible is jumbled or lost is hardly accurate. Even most atheists I know at least give it credit for being a decent piece of literature. And yes, the Bible is written by different men- each with his own technique and style. God did this purposely, as the Bible is not meant for just a select audience and certain styles or techniques may be able to make things clearer to some people. <br>
Amsra, I have read the Quran. A few times, in fact. Yes, you are correct in saying it does not teach the killing of &quot;innocents&quot;. But where they differ from Christianity is thier definition of innocents. You have to remember that any unbeliever or &quot;infidel&quot; is not considered an innocent, but an enemy of allah. Therefore, we as unbelievers are not innocent but thier enemy, and they have the divine &quot;right&quot; to kill us. Again, I meant not to offend anyone. Just trying to have a somewhat educated discussion. =)<br>

Pretty much all the people in every religion whom *I* know haven't fully read their own texts, either.<br>

I sense tension growing...the problem is that we both have our own opinions and we both have reasons for our opinions and for thinking why the other might be incorrect.  One person's reasons are valid to them, but incorrect to the other, and vice versa...  That's the whole problem with beliefs (NOT religion, just beliefs about anything in general...like if you like cheddar cheese or not..) -- we all think we're right. <p><B>
