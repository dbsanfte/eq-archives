I would like to apply to your guild, as I have been invited to by Corseil. As I am a bit long winded, I will try to answer all the questions in paragraphs rather than question by question as you will end up with a short novel (I promise you will), so here goes.<br>
<br>
My name is Nueinx Justlight, Tunarian paladin of the 51st season. I was invited to apply to your guild by Corseil who intends to be my sponsor. I am interested in joining you as I have had nothing but positive experiences raiding and grouping with several of your members. Just a few of them include Makavelie, Aalaandro, Vual, Myschief, and obviously Corseil. I have grouped with some of them in KC, and it has been a pleasure to go on several Vox raids with many of them, including Makavelie helping me try to hold together a patchwork raid against her about 2 weeks ago. I live in the CST timezone. Now to tell you a bit about me, and where I come from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of you may never have heard of me, and that is for good reason. I have only been playing on this server for 3 months or so. I started on the Terris-Thule server. This is my first character, and so I am a tad attached to it. When I found out that several of my RL friends play the game, I began playing on Povar. Some of you may know a few of them, but the one you most likely know is Aelf. <br>
Well, they successfully managed to convince me to try playing Povar hardcore for a while, to which end I created my highest lvl alt, a 25 Iksar monk named Povus. However, I missed my original char (and who wouldn't?=P) and decided to transfer him here. However, while on Terris Thule I belonged to a very prominent guild called Silmindo - a Tolkien elvish word for 'purehearted'. We strove as a guild to help others, and were known for this. We were heralded as the guild you could get that emergency port or CR from, as we were also known as 'Druids R Us', but I digress. I largely left them because I knew I would no longer be playing on TT, though I do sill go back there from time to time to say hi to friends.<br>
After moving Nueinx here, I met some of my best friends in EQ...Valcor (60 warr, member of RA) and Kargrath (60 warr, member of FU). I consider these guys brothers, along with my RL friends that play- Nasena, Almore, and Yukiko. Two other people you can find me constantly chatting with are Brooze and Tamymae, old friends from the only other guild I have belonged to on this server- Asatru. I left Asatru do to a misunderstanding I had with a few members abotu a miscommunication as to when a raid was supposed to start. Several of them did not show up as they had promised, even though they were online at the time. After it was said that nothing would be said to them about it, I left the guild. I hold no hard feelings for them however. Since then I have been solo, except for joining a guild for a few days to help out a friend that no longer plays. I have managed to obtain my Seb Key thanks to the help of Valcor. It is also in this short time that I have met my nemesis, Mystafull - I would prefer not to go into that subject, as I want you guys to actually accept me=). Suffice it to say, that I care neither for the way in which she has built her character, or obtained said character. If you are really curious, just ask me in game=P. I currently do not pursue any tradeskills, as I have never found any use for them as I do not possess high enough int or wis to really do well with them, but that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
Now to answer some of the more abstract or hypothetical questions. How do I feel abotu twinking? I think some twinking is cool, but I do not care for uber twinking at all. What is the point of having a lvl 2 warrior running around in full Cobalt? I think that takes away from the fun of being a low level and going nuts. In this same category, I assume PLing falls. I don't care much for that either, cause I really think you miss out on the game. The main reason we make new characters is to get new experiences. Well going through say Blackburrow is very different as a monk, than as a wizard, and thus more fun to check it out, but that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
As for situations involving me and my group. If I find some insane item we didnt' expect, well then who can it benefit best? Certainly a range item with 5ac and effect: Flowing Thought 2 benefits the healers and casters most, so it goes to them, but I feel the same for melee heavy gear. However, if it better answers your questino, I have a list of people I have banned from the raids I lead due to being a melee and whining abotu not rolling on caster gear, or vice versa. As for what happens if the pull goes bad, I am usually the one that bites it=P. Hey I'm a pally, ie meatshield, and that's just what we do. If you have a problem with me being a knight in shining armor, then too bad, cause you're gonna live and I'm gonna die. Or maybe that's what you'd rather anyway....<br>
<br>
As to what I would do if I found a bug, simply put I would report it. I really hate exploits as I find those take the fun out of the game. If I can't find anyone to group with, then I will usually just port out to GFay and sit down, listen for some crazy deals (never know what you'll find), and check in on m friends to see how their day is going. I guess that's how I would sum myself up, a friend. Let's face it, that's why we all play this game. We dont' play it for loot, we play it cause we have friends here. If all we wanted was uber toons with crazy gear, we'd sit at home and play Diablo 2 instead of losing sleep on this game. To me, that is what a guild is. It's a bunch of cool friends that like to hang out together. If it ever reaches the point that I don't feel I'm among friends in a guild, then I'm gone, simple as that. I expect the same of my fellow guildmembers. I expect them to treat me as friend, just as I will treat them. Granted, I am opinionated (as I'm sure you can already see), but I care about those people that carry a name with me. <br>
<br>
And the one question I forgot to answer, what item do I most want right now. I most want my Vox Book, but I'll settle for some good companionship among cool people, that are willign to try something, ie RAIDS!<br>
<br>
I hope that answers your questions about me. I know I am a bit longwinded, and for that I apologize, but YOU asked all them questions, and YOU told me to post em here, so here they are. If you have anything else you want to ask, gimme a tell in game. I'm usually hunting in Maiden's Eye or KC currently, though I'll soon be in Seb with a lil help from my big brother Valcor lol. <br>
<br>
Faithful paladin of Tunare, <br>
Nueinx 'longwinded-pally' Justlight<br>
