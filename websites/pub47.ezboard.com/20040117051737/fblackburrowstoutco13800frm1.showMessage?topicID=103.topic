Tonight a group of us went spur of the moment and did a major part of my epic.<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to Aruga, Grakok, Peleg and Rowlf and Grakok's very nice friend Myauw (DOH i probably mispelled name! ACK)<br>
<br>
There are 2 ways my epic can play out now..the short way and the subquest way. If i get lucky the it goes short and i am basically one major battle away from epic....if the major battle doesnt drop one item then i have to battle Phinney in kedge as well as other things. BUT the dark elves on the big battle also sometimes drop the same robe as phinney and the others so even that is sometimes skippable...ROGUES HAVE IT EASY EPICWISE.<br>
<br>
Anyways I was worried I would have to go to a highend ubah guild BUT after seeing us and our alliance take down the 64 SK today in hate I am thinking we can do the general! I shall research more and get a plan together.<br>
<br>
In case you are interested:<br>
Here is my epic laid out as simple as possible and where i stand:<br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 1. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Top from Founy Jestands in North Kaladim. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 2. Pickpocket the Stained Parchment Bottom from Tani N`mar in Neriak Third Gate. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 3. Pickup the Book of Souls from the Maestro of Rancor's nightstand in the Plane of Hate. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 4. Give the Stained Parchment Top and the Stained Parchment Bottom to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold. Stanos will then give you the Combined Parchment. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 5. Give the Combined Parchment, two bottles of milk (unstacked), and 100pp to Eldreth in Lake Rathetear. Eldreth will give you the Scribbled Parchment. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 6. Give the Scribbled Parchment to Yendar Starpyre in Steamfont Mountains. Yendar will give you the Tattered Parchment. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 7. Give Tattered Parchment and the Book of Souls to Yendar Starpyre in Steamfont Mountains. Yendar will despawn and Renux Herkanor will spawn. Kill Renux and loot the Translated Parchment and the Jagged Diamond Dagger from her corpse. <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; 8. Give Translated Parchment to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold. Stanos will give you the Sealed Box. <br>
<br>
9. Give Sealed Box to any of the Dark Elves in the house at (+800, +2400) in Kithicor Forest. This will cause General V`ghera to spawn. Kill him and loot General's Pouch and, IF HE DROPS IT, the Cazic Quill off his corpse. If he does not drop the Cazic Quill, you will need to do the Cazic Quill sub-quest (detailed below). <br>
<br>
10. Give the General's Pouch, the Cazic Quill, and the Jagged Diamond Dagger to Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold. Stanos will give you RAGEBRINGER. <br>
<br>
POSSIBLE SUBQUEST I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TO DO<br>
If General V`ghera does not drop the Cazic Quill when killed, then you must instead do the Cazic Quill sub-quest, which involves the following: <br>
<br>
DONE &gt; (zalimand is borrowing robe in the meantime heheh)A. Kill the Oracle of K`Arnon in Ocean of Tears and loot the Robe of the Oracle off his body. Alternatively, you may buy the Robe of the Oracle from another player, as it is not NODROP. <br>
<br>
B. Kill the Ghoul Arch Magus in Lower Guk and loot the Shining Metallic Robes off his body. Alternatively, you may buy the SMR from another player, as it is not NODROP. <br>
<br>
C. Kill the Ishva Mal in Splitpaw Lair and loot the Robe of the Ishva off his body. Alternatively, you may buy the Robe of the Ishva from another player, as it is not NODROP. <br>
<br>
D. Kill Phinigel Autropos in Kedge Keep and loot the Robe of the Kedge off his body. Alternatively, you may kill the Dark Elves in the house in Kithicor forest, as some of them will occasionally drop the Robe of the Kedge. This Robe IS NODROP, so you may not buy it from other players. <br>
<br>
E. Give the four robes (Oracle, SMR, Ishva, Kedge) to Vilnius the Small in the Western Plains of Karana. He will give you the Cazic Quill. <br>

I would like peep's opinion on this mob. Can we as a guild with our allies FoJ and LOW, take this guy and his minions? After taking out that 64 SK i am excited!<br>
<br>
I want to hear from guildmates and alliances, especially folks who went on the raid to Hate. I don't want to be overzealous cause if it wipes I have to start over...ugh...so if you think we need some higher level help then I need to know before hand.<br>

<br>
Well, your mob is a 63 SK it appears, so yeah, we can do it. And he will only have 1 friend left it appears if we pull the house properly.  <br>
<br>
I thought, I mean was sure our force could take the Maestro in Hate who also has 32,000 hps.  This guy casts some nasty stuff, so there will be death, but lets do it!  Shoudl be able to org this and get it done within 2 - 3hrs at the most.<br>

Yes please, lost my roll on that Tainted Breastplate.  Oh and that level 64 Shadownight is known to be an easy kill, so we may not want to get too hasty on the level 63 SDK but then again any mob in Antonica should be easy for us to do as long as there isn't a level cap like Naggy or Vox.<br>
<br>
If we do hate, lets just plan on people dying.  If we go in with that idea then people will feel much better about it.  Just get the cleric to camp at Safe Spot (I think we should have used Invis to Undead insead of regular invis, but not sure if that would have helped much).  In many of the high end Plane raids, it is De Facto that everyone kill themselves to get around easier (there is a very complicated manner of doing this for Plane of Air, pre-PoP.  Yes there is now a Plane of Air and a Plane of Sky).<br>

<br>
As for the General, you can count on FoJ support for this (especially from me, as I will be doing the same thing).  In fact, I would suggest the following:  <br>
<br>
Wait for me to kill Renux too and do my turn in.  As long as you leave one DE in the hut alive, you can spawn the General as many times as you have the turn in piece.  We could do it 2x in a row!!!!  <br>
<br>
Gnip-- How about we set up an ally raid to do a &quot;dry run&quot; -- that is we take a raid force to Kith and pull and slaughter the DEs in the hut.  That way, everyone will be ready for the day that the General goes down!!!  <br>
<br>
Give me a tell or post info and I'll be there ta help ya, whether on an epic or Hate or anywhere else!!!<br>

As part of the devastating Rogue Epic team, I can say that the chick in SF was pretty easy.  Grak was the bait...errr... kiter I mean, then we had druid, shaman casting and all pets attacking (including our favorite pet, Gnipgnop).  I will say that she has really insane MR.   I landed 2 ebolts and 1 malo the entire fight and used up all my mana to do it.  As for those stinkin' DE's in Kith, whenever you rogues are ready, wondermutt and I will be there to lend a hand.<br>

A day after the Hate raid, I paid a Wizzy to get me to Hate and did the solo run for the book.  After all the experience pulling corpses to the safe spot and the fact that the book was not that far from the safe spot, it was actually very easy.  Trusty Everfrost gate potion got me out-- P.S.- -Peleg, you MUST get to the level you can make the various port potions.  They are a lifesaver in some situations, like this.  <br>
<br>
I have been to HHP and been to RM, and now am ready to hit SF for Renux anytime.  After that, I'll be ready to go General.  BTW-- I also have 3 of 4 robes (yeah, might need Phinny, but we'll see...) to do the subquest if I need...<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think about a dry run-- taking out the DEs in the hut only.  I think it would be a fun precursor...<br>

<br>
...we got creamed during out scouting when a mob (bixie i think) went near the camp and towards us, the DE's chased the mob, killed it then were close enought to aggro us and we went down fast.<br>
<br>
The hit for high 100s i believe and many seemed to be casters.<br>
<br>
We are devising new non-monk ways to split these suckers using a bard and 2 pallies...Bard for selos speed. Pally 1 to root a single elf in the cabin and Pally 2 for the Force spell to break the root on the single mob and pull it in the opposite direction, after the rest of the DE camp runs after the bard and pally combo...or something to that effect. We are still testing it.<br>
<br>
We are trying to do this non-monk for numerous reasons...but mostly so we ourselves learn new, different ways to do the usual things<br>
<br>
but also those suckers stayed tight in a pack and the splitting looks like it will be a pain in the arse and time consuming. Also if a monk gets hit with all of them at once they are gonna die fast. <br>
<br>
Anyways, we are still researching it... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=103.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=103.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=103.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.threadControl?topicID=103.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=103.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=103.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub47.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm1">General Discussion<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm2">Raids and Events<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm7">Tradeskills<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm10">BBSCo Codes of Conduct<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm31">Applications to Join BBSCo<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm4">Rants<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm5">OOC<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm6">Polls<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm8">Links<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm3">Officers Only<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm9">Membership Tracking<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm30">Membership Voting<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm11">Armory<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm12">Research Items<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm13">Guild Only Discussion<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm32">Alliance Council<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm14">General Epic and Quest Information<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm16">Bard Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm15">Beastlord Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm17">Cleric Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm18">Druid Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm19">Enchanter Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm20">Magician Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm21">Monk Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm22">Necromancer Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm23">Paladin Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm24">Ranger Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm26">Rogue Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm27">Shadow Knight Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm25">Shaman Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm28">Warrior Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm29">Wizard Epic<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm33">BBSCo Pub<option value="blackburrowstoutco13800frm34">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/bblackburrowstoutco13800>Blackburrow Stout Co</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.blackburrow.com">Blackburrow Stout Co.</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
