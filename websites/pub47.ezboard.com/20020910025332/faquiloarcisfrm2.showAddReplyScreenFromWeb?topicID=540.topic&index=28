I always loved the lady monk's feign death sound myself LOL.  It was sooooooo much better than us manly types CACKLE.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the night I took on my sister Danodare's persona.  I had been helping her with Fear and was trying to help her get some Shiverback items.  She camped her character just outside the portal so I could log her on if appropriate.  I remember logging her on and spending the next 15 minutes feigning death over and over and over again LOL.  People in the Grey Council family kept asking what the heck was wrong with her heehee.  I revealed to them that it was me in a much more alluring form hehe.  Then they all understood that I had been captured by the irresistible female feign death bug HAH.<br>
<br>
Lady Noitide, what an interesting story to be sure.  I have many fond memories of the Fireblades family.  Those who moved on to populate even larger families also came to be near and dear to my heart.  My associations with the Aquilo and Arcis people are well documented, but I also had significant interactions with the last 2 you mentioned.<br>
<br>
I remember Lady Tynadinia well.  She was a prominent member of the Triton family for a long time.  I remember helping her obtain her Epic in that zone where all the big golem types were hehe.  I also remember older days when we fought side by side in Fear together.  It was rather new back then and was one of only 2 planes hehe.<br>
<br>
Lady Portree, however, I must say I have had the longest attachment to.  I have known the gentle lady of magic longer than almost any other who now resides in any of the families you mentioned.  When many of you were not yet even born, much less of great capability hehe, Lady Portree and I roamed the Rathe Mountains together.  She was always granting my poor human eyes the advantaged sight of a coldstone.  This was well before the many options of various masks were available to those like myself.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the kind and beautiful Portree I consider to be one of my oldest and dearest friends.  We have so many fond memories of adventuring together in days long ago that it brings a tear to my eye.  Noitide you shall be happy to know that Portree is quite well.  I spoke to her not even a week ago.<br>
<br>
In fact, she has rejoined that ancient family so populated long ago by many of you who come here still.  Fireblades once again hosts the magical lady and she is surrounded by old and dear friends.  She left Aquilo with little notice in late December, and thought it best to do so since her role was uncertain.  She seems quite happy and fond of her times spent with those who have moved on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I will never forget her, and I could tell countless stories of our adventures in the lower 30s threshhold hehe.<br>

<br>
Ah yes Portree. I was with her in many forms. Though I am half human by birth, and half elven, the form Lady Portree remembers me well  as another spirit, that of a tiny gentle Gnome. <br>
<br>
Lady Portree spent a great of time in Rath Mts. There, a tiny lass - a Gnome Magician named Smini added her pet to fight alongside Lady Portree's; added her fire to Portree's fire; her inabililty to snare or root, to Lady Portree's hehe. Together they were able to destroy terrible creatures in Rath Mts. However, the partnership was very perrilous and generally led to one or more deaths. <br>
<br>
The tender Gnome entered the realm of history books and lore, and a new spirit was born, Noitide. Noitide was born into a world in which all druids scorned her. Wood elves mistrusted her because they viewed her as a human. Humans were not accepting of her. <br>
<br>
The elves ridiculed her lacking wisdom in this race they didn't understand. &quot;Such as you is better suited to take up arms, than learn Natures Magic,&quot; remarked the frail wood elves. &quot;Sing, be a bard, fight, but be not a Druid you fool,&quot; still Elves told me. Humans were no less cruel in describing my half elven traits as: disgusting. The cruel Halflings cackelled gleefully at Noitide's inability to grasp the ways of Nature as readily as they could. Still others remarked that Noitide wore flared pants (bell bottoms) when they had long gone out of style. Many groups shunned her and questioned why a tearful half elf had chosen to follow the path of Nature. Noitide had to work much harder than most. <br>
<br>
Knowing that the druidic  circles in Kelethin, and indeed throughout Norrath had shunned her, Noitide vowed she would continue to learn her craft. Noitide honed her skills carefully, vowing to prove a Half elven girl from the wrong side of the tracks could be a Druid like all others. Indeed, Noitide hoped to one day prove that she could gain great skills and perhaps someday, with Tunare's blessing,  near mastery of her Powers of Nature (tm). Noitide still strives for ever greater Knowledge. Noitide can only hope that Tunare (when RA or triton doesnt kill her) will continue to bestow her druidic blesssing upon the humble , now Venerable Half Elven Heirophant they call, Noitide.  <p><HTML>

I was fighting her in FM fighting giants, it was my second night there.  Knew in a general area where the FV zone was.<br>
<br>
I was fightinger with a mage friend (rl) close to midnight. Letting Mage friend lead, we wandered off to find the zone, getting more and more lost.  We got hit by a gobblin, successfully fought it off just to be jumped by another gobblin.  THen I saw the fatal words LOADING, you have returned to your bind spot.   My friend was gone, thinking the best of the situation I figured he was LD, and i'd find hiscorpse and mine close together.<br>
<br>
I sighed, looked at the time, rememed Cim's spells and got a sow from a nice druid then ran back to zone.. still waiting for my friend to come back from his ld'itus.  <br>
<br>
Fearing  the worse as her Mage friend had a tendency to go ld a lot.  She thought nothing of it.. and went on  her  corpse run.  With the help of a druid friend, she was able to recover her corpse load up and leave.<br>
<br>
IT was the next day at work when  I  realized that as i was valiently fight off teh second gobblin and dying for the party, said friend had gated to save his skin.<br>
<br>
thus my friend gained a new name at work... <br>
<br>
he is forever known as..<br>
