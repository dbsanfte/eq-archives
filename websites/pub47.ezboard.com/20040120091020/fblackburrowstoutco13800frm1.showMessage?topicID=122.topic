<br>
Twas but another mist filled and oft raining day out on the fertile plains of Lord Karana.  I, the ever so humble Grakok, chosen messanger of our great Lord was out for but a brief stroll across the grand plains and rolling hills of the eastern most reaches of the Karanas.<br>
Merrily I stumbled...err...walked along, occasionally sipping from my ale ( I had lost count at some point of exactly how many).  Being a druid, naturally I found myself communing with the creatures of this vast land.  One lion matriarch, a fine, proud looking fellow, came to me with some disturbing news.  It seens that there had come to the lands a creature of vile nature, who held no respect for the animals or people of this place.  Hatred he held in his wretched heart, and a desire to cause strife and termoil.<br>
     &quot;How can this be?&quot; I wondered in beausement.  Surely the evil blight that has corrupted the rest of Norrath could not have crept into my lords land.  We the faithfull of Karana would never allow such to occur.  I decided that I must investigate this strange tale of the mighty cat, for as we all know, cat's lean towards essageration when in conversation.<br>
     I knew haste was of the utmost importance, so I pulled from my pack my book of spells which I had collected during my travels abroad.  Finally finding the spell I needed, I bent my will towards the task at hand.  Calling upon the power of Karana, magical energy flowed through my body, light coalesced at my hands.  The transformation had begun.  Bones elongated, tendons and sinew stretched and reshaped themselves.  Hair, sleek and white began to erupt from my skin, elongating to a smooth, lush coat.  Teeth and claws gres and sharpened, weapons of nature, deliverers of justice.  The momentary pain of the transformation was immediately forgotten as the exhileration of my change caught up with me.  Where once stood a halfling, a white wolf now looked across the plains.<br>
     The wind blew in gusts from the west, bearing upon it a strange, foul odor which my now extremely accute nose detected.  This surely was what I was searching for.  Pushing my body to the limit, I ran with all of my might, fur gleaming in the few rays of sunlight that had managed to penetrate the cloudy skies.  The feeling of the hunt, wind blowing in my face, the sights and smells would have overwhelmed me had it not been for the gravity of my mission.  I reached the rivers edge, searchin for anything out of the ordinary.  All seemed at peace.  Could I have been wrong about the smell?  Could it have been just a trace scent of one of the vile dog men who roamed the land?  Everything seemed normal, almost serene.<br>
     A lone warrior sat upon the mighty bridge that spanned the river.  His once gleaming weapons covered with blood and gore sat beside him, his head hanging low, his breath shallow and labored.  He wore around his neck a string, lined with teeth of the reavers of the far corners of Karana.  This was pleasing to me, for he aided my cause of irradicating those foul creatures.  Silently I slipped forward so as not to disturb his slumber.  The closer I got, the more obvious it became that the reaver had indeed delivered grievous wounds to the poor soul who sat before me.  I began the chant I knew was necessary.  A soft light surrounded the human, and slowly his wounds began to heal.  He would, by the grace of Karana live this day.  Chanting soflty once again, I called the foilage of the plains to lend me their color, and slowly I faded from sight.<br>
    At that moment a slight tremor shook the ground, vibrating my sensitive paws.  From the distance a loud rush of water reached my alert ears, as if some massive weight had been thrust into the river.  Curiously I began to run towards the sound.  As I ran down the rivers edge my eyes caught sight of something disturbing.  The hair on my back raised, and a low guteral growl escated my throat.  There, embedded in the mud at the bank was an enourmous foot print, three times the size of a full grown halfling.  One of the occursed giants had come down from the hills!  This was not good, for they are evil, hate filled creatures, with a wanton desire to destroy all that is beautiful.<br>
     There, up ahead in the distance, waist deep in the river stood the yellow skined mountain!  i could not help but be apprehensive, for the thing stood as tall as the trees, with muscles bulging that could be seen from even where I stood.  Using my stealth I slowly crept up behind the giant.  As is well known, this is the best method to attack a giant.  There is after all no reason to attract his attention before you are ready.<br>
     Light erupted from my hands as a loud roar shook the valley.  Roots, thick and black erupted from the earth, showering the area with dirt and small debris.  Even as they entwined the creatures legs, something in the back of my mind kept telling me that all was not as it seemed.  The roots grasped mightily at the tree trunk thick legs, and with an enraged shriek, the mighty beast turned.  I was taken back by the sight before me.  This was no hill giant, but a thing more hideous than any of my worst dreams.  Angrily it yelled at me in a foul gutteral tongue which I could not understand, yet I knew what was intended by the words.  More disturbing than the hatred that dripped from the screams was the one, dull yellow eye with which it stared at me.  A Cyclopse!!  Only had I vaugely heard of these creatures from passing bards who had traveled to foreign lands.  How had it gotten here, and why had it come?<br>
    My mind raced even as i worked to destroy this abomination.  A swarm of insects of all stinging and biting kinds descended upon the cyclopse, even as the mud became a sucking, slogging quagmire around it.  I had long ago learned that even the longest of giant legs can only run so fast in mud, even when it managed to escape my entrapping roots.  Spell after spell I cast upon the behemoth, and with each spell my body became more weary.  this battle was taking its toll upon me, even as I stayed out of reach of those huge grasping hands that longed to crush me and take my lifes breath.<br>
    With a final shriek the cyclopse fell to the earth in a thunderous roar, sending up a choaking cloud of dust and small rocks.  I have heard the death cry of many creatures while defending the lands, but this one disturbed me.  It was unlike any I had ever heard.  Thunderous foot steps in the distance!!!! then, .... realization!!!  That was not a death cry, but a plea for help.  From the rumbling of the earth, I knew help was arriving.  Now, I am no coward, but as wracked and weak as my body was from interweaving my mighty battle spells, I knew I could not withstand another fight without rest.  I spun and ran to the protection of the forrest at my top most speed, for as all know, when a halfling druid wishes to conceal himself in the protective folds of the forrest, none can find him.<br>
     Off I ran through the forrest in search of my wandering sister Fidjet, and the human Driarch who had been made my brother by the ancient laws.  I would need their strength and wisdom.  We would seek council with the brotherhood of the Blackburrow Stouts, a group of trusted collegues and friends.<br>
     So my story ends here.  I take my case before the Stouters and seek their aid.  The blight that has been spreading throughout the land has crept into the Karanas.  I fear that when I travel into the outer reaches of the plains I will find more corruption and destruction.  Karana protect us in these troubled times.<br>
