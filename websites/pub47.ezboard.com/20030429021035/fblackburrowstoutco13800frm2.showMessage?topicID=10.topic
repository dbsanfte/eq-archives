Not following these tactics on a guild raid can lead to you being removed from the raid.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
The RL may modify these slightly to fit any raid situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What Is A Raid/What Isn't A Raid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
A raid is a gathering of multiple groups to defeat a foe, journey deep into a dungeon, or to get a chance at some difficult loot.<br>
<br>
A quote from a great raid tactics site, &quot;Raids are not meant to get your character up to level 60 or to give you the latest 20,000 plat item. They are meant to defeat creatures that cannot be defeated by normal groups. If you want experience and loot, go to Sebilis. Raids exist to have fun. This should be made clear to all who plan to attend your raid. With up to 40 people, the odds of good loot and good experience are slim.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What Is An Event</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
An event is multiple groups sitting in an outside zone pulling mobs. (example: multiple groups pulling in Dreadlands)<br>
An event is any time we gather the guild to do something that doesn't have to do with killing a bunch of mobs. (example: adoption party)<br>
An event is any time we gather the guild to not pull mobs, or journey into a dungeon, but mobs may have to die (example: scavenger hunt)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What Is A Group</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Any of the above, but with less than 7 people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Terms Used In Raids</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
RL = Raid Lead<br>
SL = Secondary Lead. This is the person who will take command if RL goes LD or dies.<br>
MA = Main Assist. The person you will assist when fighting. Generally the puller.<br>
SA = Secondary Assist. If the MA dies or is unavailable, assist the SA. The SA is also in charge of taking mobs off unfortunate casters who healed, over-burned, or got agro in some way.<br>
GL = Group lead. The person inviting into the group.<br>
ML = Mail Looter. Assigned role in the group by the RL. <br>
Push = Everyone gather on one side of the mob to push it back. Rogues stay in back. Commonly used on caster giants in Kael.<br>
Root N Scoot = Used on adds when there is no bard or chanter who can mez.  Someone roots the mob and everyone moves away with the engaged mob.<br>
Tank Mez = The SA attacks the add mob to keep it occupied so casters do not get aggro’d.<br>
Pull = If you don't know what a pull is.....I'm not telling you<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Planning</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Raid Lead (RL) will have a back up plan incase event location is already camped<br>
RL will know where they are taking the guild/raiders<br>
RL will have a run or evac plan ready in advance to the raid and discuss it with all group leaders. The group leaders will send through the ranks.<br>
The RL will have maps available on calendar<br>
The RL will note where to bind on calendar<br>
The RL will determine who can pull bodies if needed<br>
The RL will assign roles (see below)<br>
The RL will determine the best communications methods based on the Communications section below<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Getting To A Raid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We cannot count on someone being able to teleport you to the event/raid just before it starts, so please plan in advance to get to the location the RL specifies.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Preparation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Turn off all screen extras. IE Hits, Misses, and Spells, even yours! Your screen needs to be clear to see messages.<br>
Make sure guild chat is turned on and that you have joined designated chat channel(s).<br>
Bind close by! In the event of a death, do not rely on a Rez to get you back to your corpse. See Resurections for details.<br>
Clerics bind VERY close. The RL will have good suggestions on bind spots.<br>
Sneakers, Camo'ers, and Invis'ers bind VERY close, we may need you to drag corpses.<br>
Do not buff folks until RL says to. See Buffing for details.<br>
Before raid/event begins, RL will explain how everyone will leave at end of raid/event (whether ports/tl's, running out, etc).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Grouping</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Grouping takes time, please be patient<br>
While raid lead assigns groups, please refrain from using /guild speak, /bbsco:raid, or /tell to the raid lead unless requested.<br>
Groups may be rebuilt throughout the raid depending on how many folks need to leave for various reasons.<br>
Start a group with 1 Healer and 1 Tank. Add tank or pure caster. Add Utilities.<br>
The healer should be the group lead because they will be sitting further back and can monitor for adds and decide when to stop pulling.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Define Roles</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
RL = Raid Lead. This is the person who will call the shots<br>
SL = Secondary Lead. This is the person who will take command if RL goes LD or dies.<br>
MA = Main Assist. The person you will assist when fighting. Generally the puller.<br>
SA = Secondary Assist. If the MA dies or is unavailable, assist the SA.<br>
GL = Group lead. The person inviting into the group.<br>
ML = Main Looter. Assign one per group.  The MA will need to report back loot to the RL or the officer in charge of loot management.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Setting Hot Buttons</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Create hot buttons for assisting MA and SA. Hard code their names. IE /assist powpow NOT /assist %t.<br>
Casters should have hot buttons for Heals, Mez's and other important announcements. See Communication for proper method of communication.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Buffing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Raid lead should say when to buff initially.<br>
Buff just before the first pull but allow time for buffers to med a bit.<br>
In extreme cases, we may do a buff cycle and request those who buffed, log off and log on to an alt and join the raid channel. We have not run into a situation where we need this yet.<br>
When needing a buff, ask using the proper communication channel. In tight mana times, you may not get your buff right away and buffs will go to the most appropriate folks first. Example: Clarity to pure casters and healers before hybrids.<br>
Healers buff when you can, healing is more important<br>
When fighting mobs that can cancel magic, buff junk buffs first.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Communication</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We will use the Chat Channels (or raid channel). The RL will setup a chat channel for you to join. See your EQmanual_suppliment.doc or our Chat Channel web page for details on how to use.<br>
The Blackburrow Stout Co. raid channel is /join bbsco:raid<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pulling</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Number of pullers depends on raid and up to the RL. <br>
On difficult raids, there will be one puller assigned for all groups total. <br>
On smaller events, one puller per group may be assigned.<br>
Use INC %t in appropriate communication method (see communications above). Please do not get fancy with your pull message.<br>
Know your pull.<br>
If you pull something that is too tough for the group. Warn your group to RUN, EVAC, or run yourself to a safe spot to die. Don't bring back to get the group killed.<br>
Try to single pull unless group is prepared.<br>
All casters will be set up to the back of the group. All melee's to the front.<br>
When there is an MA pulling for all groups, and all melee's have been set up in the front (casters in back), let the MA pull mob to group. Group does NOT rush forward to assist puller. Everyone stays in place. <br>
On difficult pulls, let the MA get the taunt on the mob. The RL will decide when to use this method. The MA will attack for 15 seconds or so to get taunt. The MA will ask everyone to join in the attack when he/she is ready. All healers will rotate on heals to ensure the MA remains alive. On all melee mobs, everyone but the MA will be at max melee range in a circle around the mob. On caster mobs, everyone (but rogues) will be on the same side as the MA (not off to the sides, all in front) so that we can &quot;push&quot; the mob and keep it from casting. Remember, do NOT attack until the MA says to so that appropriate aggro is built. If you get the aggro, turn off auto attack, FD, evade, and back out of range until the MA gets aggro back. This is very important!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Assist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
See setting hot buttons and always assist the MA first.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Adds</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
First line of Add Defense – Enchanter should mez adds. The Enchanter should not mez the mob the MA has engaged. The Enchanter may wait a moment to see which mob is being hit. The Enchanter may use an AE mez and then tag each with a full mez afterwards, just continue assisting the MA.<br>
<br>
Second line of Add Defense – Bard should mez adds. Just like the Enchanter.<br>
<br>
Third line of Add Defense – Root N Scoot.  Someone roots the mob and everyone moves away with the engaged mob.<br>
<br>
Fourth line of Add Defense – Tank Mez.  The SA attacks the add mob to keep it occupied so casters do not get aggro’d.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Looting</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
See loot rules for details<br>
ML will do the looting for your group.  The ML will report loot back to RL or an officer in charge of loot management.<br>
Rolls on good loot will happen at the end of the raid.<br>
RL and Loot Manager may change the loot rules to fit a situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Healing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Healers discuss healing tactics when you are both in a group<br>
Use the appropriate communication channel for &quot;healing %t&quot; before pulling off a heal unless its an emergency<br>
If you need a heal and you know one is incoming, stay within healing range.<br>
If your group healer is OOM and you need a heal badly. Feel free to panic and /SHOUT HEAL ME HEAL ME<br>
Do not beg for heals if your healer is in good mana standing. The healer knows their job and will heal you appropriately. <br>
Do not cast a CH on a tank if they just pulled a mob. You will die!  <br>
Tanks should leave for a pull with full health.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>When to Run/Evac</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
As a guild, we decided that the puller of the group should have 2 buttons so that everyone can see that we need to run or evac amongst the clutter. The puller will make the call to Run or Evac.<br>
<br>
One that is:<br>
/raidchannel# (or designated raid channel) RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN<br>
/gs RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN<br>
<br>
The other is:<br>
/raidchannel# (or designated raid channel) EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC<br>
/gs (or designated raid channel) EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC EVAC<br>
/raidchannel# (or designated raid channel) Protect Your Druid or Wizard<br>
/gs (or designated raid channel) Protect Your Druid or Wizard<br>
<br>
What does RUN mean? That means, get your butt in gear and run to the zone. The group puller will sacrifice her/his self for the group and be the last one to run, so you can get out safely. <br>
<br>
What does EVAC mean? It means the Wizard or Druid in the group will cast their evac spell (a quicker group tp spell).<br>
<br>
EXCEPTION: Those who HAVE NOT engaged the mob and can sneak, camo, or invis are welcome to do so! However, if you are able to evac the group, we need you to perform the evac. I cannot confirm this is a safe strategy. Its up to you to learn this. Gnipgnop is a pro...check with him.<br>
<br>
EXCEPTION: Clerics may be asked to camp out.  The MA will only ask clerics to do this if he thinks it is a safe place after the mob wanders away and the MA expects to be able to get to the site safely to make sure it is safe for the cleric to come back on.  The cleric who camped should log in as an alt before logging back on as the cleric.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Going LD</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you go Link Dead and you are unfamiliar with the zone. We suggest you log in as an alt and ask fellow raid members if it is safe to log back in as your main.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resurrections</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Don't keep yelling &quot;what about me&quot;, we know you are dead and will get to you.<br>
Remain calm<br>
The group will get a rez for the cleric first if they died<br>
Body puller will be rez'd second (someone who can invis or sneak)<br>
Bind close by! In the event of a death, do not rely on a Rez to get you back to your corpse. It’s possible the higher level cleric is deeper in a dungeoun and may not be able to get back to you. If available, a rez will come at end of an event, so leave something on your body so you can get back into the fight.<br>
