I'm afraid I don't even remember who the other players were or even what classes.  But I think it may have been my finest hour to date as a cleric.<br>
<br>
I was grouped in Highpass, at the gnoll ledge. There were 4 of us there: 2 melees, a caster, and myself.  Our timing had gotten off, and we ended up way over our heads due to repops.  Epsecially when the main tank went LD.<br>
<br>
I started chain healing on the remaining melee, and of course got aggro.  I didn't last too long, I'm afraid, but I spent all my mana on Heals.<br>
<br>
I respawn at my bind point, in front of High Keep.  Amazingly, my groupmates are still alive, but dropping.  I mem my healing spell (only) and run back over.  Two gnolls are left, and the caster in the group is OOM and using his dagger.  I get there right before the melee drops and start healing him.<br>
<br>
We were too stubborn, I guess, and should have run when the main tank went LD... but somehow we managed to pull it off with just me dying... and if I hadn't have died, we wouldn't have pulled it off because I had no mana. <p>Kimbera [Aquilo di Arcis] 50 human cleric <BR>

I remember one night a friend of mine fell to his death from the very top -- just before making it to the zone hehe.  We all had a great laugh over that LOL.  His name was Elyas, named after the character in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  I always called him Wolf Brother <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Sheesh I could fill this thread up with stories from Highpass alone, much less stories from Aviak village in South Karana, and even moreso Blackburrow hehe.  Aal you may be interested to know that Blackburrow is where I spent most of my earliest days.  I spent levels 4 or so through 17 mainly there.  And since I know you met him long ago, I'll mention that a good part of my time in Blackburrow was spent teaching a young Monk named Arlan hehe.<br>
<br>
He was struggling through a few things, and I helped him master some skills.  More importantly, I schooled him in the arts of how to carry yourself as a Monk.  I remember many fun times helping him along and watching him grow from there heehee.<br>

Who do you think showed him how to get to Guk himself LOL?  I also remember taking him to SolA and showing him how to get to the Bartender so he could camp Drake Hide Leggings hehe.  He always seemed like a very kind chap who loved asking questions about Monk stuff.<br>
<br>
I remember Arlan leveling very quickly too hehe.  Indeed he was a gifted Monk of great skill.  He first joined Ashoc, and was an integral member of that family for a long time.  Most of his upper 30s through mid 40s development was spent with that family.  When Triton formed, he ended up going there with most of his Ashoc friends.  He and I have stayed in touch all this time, and I know that he is well.  He has recently graduated from college, so I imagine he is still job hunting hehe.<br>
<br>
The first Monk on Povar to acquire the feign death skill however, was neither Arlan nor myself hehe.  It was Wiktor.  I remember seeing Wiktor practicing feign death all over Blackburrow.  I used to crack up laughing at him falling over pretending to die so often hehe.  I obtained my 17th degree a few days later, as did Arlan hehe.  I remember the 3 of us having a laughing fit over my discovery that feign could be practiced over and over while still lying down hehe.  Thus preventing everyone around you from having to listen to it over &amp; over &amp; over again LOL.  Poor Wiktor hadn't known it could still be trained that way heehee.<br>
<br>
He and Arlan then went on to level with great speed, since that was part of what brought them each joy from the game.  I, of course, cared little for such things hehe.  So I leveled at my own pace, and made my way here and there.  Never once did I lose touch with Brother Arlan.  He was always very kind to me and never forgot the lessons I taught early on.  We shared much, he and I, in the way of technique and strategy.<br>

<br>
I am very proud to say I was a Fireblade Sir Splos. Most of those fireblades are in my guild currently, though sadly FU has taken many as well. <br>
<br>
From my 27th level, I  stayed at HK (on waiting lists for a group-often for hours) until my 37th level due to its ease and relative safety. At around my 38th level, I discovered that the trolls in lake rathe were fantastic exp and fantastic loot (200pp a night) for a person as poor as myself. I stayed at those boring trolls grouped all the time. By around my 46th season I soloed at the trolls. Prior to my soloing, I met Cammus, a Brazillian Enchanter Erudite. I also met his wonderful Druid wife, Graycie.  Cammus told me how exicited he was of being in Aquilo. He urged me to apply. I did apply and was accepted to Aquilo Ferox. I was still a noob when I joined Aquilo despite being 53d level. No wait, I still am!<br>
<br>
I stayed in Aquilo Ferox, after Ookies' disbanding, after the server split. I served in it as an officer. Later if became Aquilo Phoenix. Then Aquilo of course merged with Arcis (heavily Fireblades too-Aarnwulf, Storrme , Slarena, Ceten, Lenoin, Kiisk, Tristansebast, Uasu-perhaps others) and AdA was born. But many of the former Arcis left and went to Forces Unknown. <br>
<br>
Well then now Im Unleashed, with the same family spirit I once enjoyed in Aquilo. I sure hope that AdA has this family spirit. From what I hear they do and its good to hear. <br>
<br>
With Raidon joining, we have a large chuck of our old Fireblades, aside from the ones FU has taken /sigh. We also brought in Stormwatch folks (goodfolks) and of course the Wolf Hounds (were always close to fireblades and OTW) and a few others to form a new family. In spite of this, we remember many members of AdA fondly. This is also the reason some of us, like myself,  keep coming here. <br>
<br>
One lost Fireblade is Tynadinia who is now GL of a new small guild. Another lost one is Portree /sigh I dont know where she has gone.  <p><HTML>

I always loved the lady monk's feign death sound myself LOL.  It was sooooooo much better than us manly types CACKLE.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the night I took on my sister Danodare's persona.  I had been helping her with Fear and was trying to help her get some Shiverback items.  She camped her character just outside the portal so I could log her on if appropriate.  I remember logging her on and spending the next 15 minutes feigning death over and over and over again LOL.  People in the Grey Council family kept asking what the heck was wrong with her heehee.  I revealed to them that it was me in a much more alluring form hehe.  Then they all understood that I had been captured by the irresistible female feign death bug HAH.<br>
<br>
Lady Noitide, what an interesting story to be sure.  I have many fond memories of the Fireblades family.  Those who moved on to populate even larger families also came to be near and dear to my heart.  My associations with the Aquilo and Arcis people are well documented, but I also had significant interactions with the last 2 you mentioned.<br>
<br>
I remember Lady Tynadinia well.  She was a prominent member of the Triton family for a long time.  I remember helping her obtain her Epic in that zone where all the big golem types were hehe.  I also remember older days when we fought side by side in Fear together.  It was rather new back then and was one of only 2 planes hehe.<br>
<br>
Lady Portree, however, I must say I have had the longest attachment to.  I have known the gentle lady of magic longer than almost any other who now resides in any of the families you mentioned.  When many of you were not yet even born, much less of great capability hehe, Lady Portree and I roamed the Rathe Mountains together.  She was always granting my poor human eyes the advantaged sight of a coldstone.  This was well before the many options of various masks were available to those like myself.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the kind and beautiful Portree I consider to be one of my oldest and dearest friends.  We have so many fond memories of adventuring together in days long ago that it brings a tear to my eye.  Noitide you shall be happy to know that Portree is quite well.  I spoke to her not even a week ago.<br>
<br>
In fact, she has rejoined that ancient family so populated long ago by many of you who come here still.  Fireblades once again hosts the magical lady and she is surrounded by old and dear friends.  She left Aquilo with little notice in late December, and thought it best to do so since her role was uncertain.  She seems quite happy and fond of her times spent with those who have moved on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

<br>
Ah yes Portree. I was with her in many forms. Though I am half human by birth, and half elven, the form Lady Portree remembers me well  as another spirit, that of a tiny gentle Gnome. <br>
<br>
Lady Portree spent a great of time in Rath Mts. There, a tiny lass - a Gnome Magician named Smini added her pet to fight alongside Lady Portree's; added her fire to Portree's fire; her inabililty to snare or root, to Lady Portree's hehe. Together they were able to destroy terrible creatures in Rath Mts. However, the partnership was very perrilous and generally led to one or more deaths. <br>
<br>
The tender Gnome entered the realm of history books and lore, and a new spirit was born, Noitide. Noitide was born into a world in which all druids scorned her. Wood elves mistrusted her because they viewed her as a human. Humans were not accepting of her. <br>
<br>
The elves ridiculed her lacking wisdom in this race they didn't understand. &quot;Such as you is better suited to take up arms, than learn Natures Magic,&quot; remarked the frail wood elves. &quot;Sing, be a bard, fight, but be not a Druid you fool,&quot; still Elves told me. Humans were no less cruel in describing my half elven traits as: disgusting. The cruel Halflings cackelled gleefully at Noitide's inability to grasp the ways of Nature as readily as they could. Still others remarked that Noitide wore flared pants (bell bottoms) when they had long gone out of style. Many groups shunned her and questioned why a tearful half elf had chosen to follow the path of Nature. Noitide had to work much harder than most. <br>
<br>
Knowing that the druidic  circles in Kelethin, and indeed throughout Norrath had shunned her, Noitide vowed she would continue to learn her craft. Noitide honed her skills carefully, vowing to prove a Half elven girl from the wrong side of the tracks could be a Druid like all others. Indeed, Noitide hoped to one day prove that she could gain great skills and perhaps someday, with Tunare's blessing,  near mastery of her Powers of Nature (tm). Noitide still strives for ever greater Knowledge. Noitide can only hope that Tunare (when RA or triton doesnt kill her) will continue to bestow her druidic blesssing upon the humble , now Venerable Half Elven Heirophant they call, Noitide.  <p><HTML>

I was fighting her in FM fighting giants, it was my second night there.  Knew in a general area where the FV zone was.<br>
<br>
I was fightinger with a mage friend (rl) close to midnight. Letting Mage friend lead, we wandered off to find the zone, getting more and more lost.  We got hit by a gobblin, successfully fought it off just to be jumped by another gobblin.  THen I saw the fatal words LOADING, you have returned to your bind spot.   My friend was gone, thinking the best of the situation I figured he was LD, and i'd find hiscorpse and mine close together.<br>
<br>
I sighed, looked at the time, rememed Cim's spells and got a sow from a nice druid then ran back to zone.. still waiting for my friend to come back from his ld'itus.  <br>
<br>
Fearing  the worse as her Mage friend had a tendency to go ld a lot.  She thought nothing of it.. and went on  her  corpse run.  With the help of a druid friend, she was able to recover her corpse load up and leave.<br>
<br>
IT was the next day at work when  I  realized that as i was valiently fight off teh second gobblin and dying for the party, said friend had gated to save his skin.<br>
<br>
thus my friend gained a new name at work... <br>
<br>
he is forever known as..<br>

But this was back when my druid Aeawen was my main and only around lvl 40.  My friends and I were killing oggre guards most every night back then and I can't count the times I kept seeing you pop in from where you died in Fear.  You were always a cheerful person and always made us laugh.  <br>
<br>
I actually learned from you just by seeing how you joked about dieing and always was so cheerful to be around.  You to me were one of the ones that taught me to continue to have fun in this game and enjoy your friends you meet.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if you remember Aeawen but I now play Faiena which is a necro.  hehe To go from a traveling druid to an evil necro. hehe <br>

PS. Splos, I was at the golf show yesterday here in Edmonton, and I tested out the new Jazz driver..first I hit the Ping, then the Taylor Made...then the Jazz....All I have to say is that soon they're going to have clubs you just have to point in the directions if where you want to go, tell it how far, and it'll just hit the ball there themselves.....the reason I say this is because the Jazz driver had like a 500cc clubhead!!! 500cc!!!!!! THAT'S SICK! It's like 5x the size of what the pro's used to use... Anyway..they were fun to hit, but it was just hitting into a fence, so I don't know how far they would have been going. I'll be able to tell you some stories after my vacation in like a month and a bit.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://jennymarie.freewebspace.com/aal-new-sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/usplos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Splos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Master</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/11/02 10:11:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heehee</span><hr size=1> Why yes I certainly do remember a kind druid by that name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I'm quite sure there were even times we adventured together hehe.  Perhaps caused trouble together would be more appropriate haha.<br>
<br>
Yes I certainly died my fair share of times in Fear hehe, but it was no matter.  It was always better for one such as I to do so than those who toiled so long and hard for their guild families.  It seems that I looked at dying much differently than most heehee.  I always thought of dying as a means of spending more time having fun.  The more experience you lost, the more time it took to recover hehe.  The more time it took to recover, the more time you had to spend playing the game.  The more time you spent playing the game, the more time you spent with friends you loved being with WOOP hehe.<br>
<br>
I'm excited hehe, we actually have some people starting to come out of the shadows and POST hehe.  Hmmm, I need to scold Lady Storrme, and get Jordinn and some others to pay a visit hehe.  Since most of you current family members seem to be shy about sharing fun stories, I need to get to work on bringing those into the fray who aren't so hesitant 8P.

Yes Splos we did do some killing together.  I don't remember where but we did do some.  I for one still miss my old friends Runebender, Vrrost, and Olini.  There was another shammy we fought with some but dang if I can remember his name.  I'm sure some others will remember the three I listed for they were in the original Arcis.  And now they are sadly retired.<br>

He was level 56 or so and I was level 52 or 53 I forget which hehe (I went back &amp; forth so much it's hard to remember HAH).  Anyway hehe, I remember he danced all around &amp; did all this crazy stuff and cast all these spells &amp; neat things hehe.  He was really quite a sight.  The boy could dance quite well I must say hehe.  But, after I grew tired of watching him prance around I smited him down quickly &amp; he grumbled something about getting me next time hehe.  He fought with great skill and much honor, but he always hated the fact that all his prancing around never seemed to get him anywhere with me 8P.  He always exclaimed that he liked girlies hehe, but his actions toward me left me in doubt GRIN.<br>

<br>
Sooth I remember much most of it from the very begining of days when Norrath was young, when the boat captains knew little of how to travel the seas, I remember then as now and so shall I speak of what I know.<br>
<br>
I remember when lands first called and woke my eyes from the skys of wonder.  The city of freeport bustling and busy.  I learned to hold sword and carry song there, until the day I walked off into the lands some fool called east and common.  Aye common they were to Griffon wonder, alas non then knew how tame such a beast, nor had gift to do it.  Once in the darkness of the night so afeared was I an others that we did route from justice upon orcan evil that in every direction did partake.  When in final safety I though myself to find twas in trueth and eerie site, for it glowed in moonlight with sickly white and bone pale walls a tavern from a time long past twas then I saw the plagues dark warning and yet movement did I see slowly then upon the roof in sick transfiction did I remain as slowly marks of yellow and of black did grow upon the sickly roof indeed what there to see that which of all things became my bane..... upon the witching hour a spider as large as I and twice then my humble power and with song aided by dragon did I flee for I knew not then nor did any other if it might pounce upon its supper.<br>
