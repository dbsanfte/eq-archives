I can say that it did contribute to mild depression because I let other things in my life slide: didn't go out with friends as much, let my apartment get dusty and dishes piled up, lost physical fitness. <br>
<br>
If someone does not have a social network, or neglects it extremely because of the game, this game can be isolating and addictive. You find yourself stuck in a virtual world with your only connections to others being through the game. If one has emotional or social problems, it can provide access to controlled intimacy with others. <br>
<br>
Having said that, I also met someone I care about deeply, and have made many friends whom I talk to long after I stopped playing. Currently I have not played EQ for a year and my account is long gone. I sometimes miss it, but I like DAoC better. It's not as immersive and I find I enjoy myself without finding myself investing so much time into it. What can I say, I'm addicted to gaming <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
EQ isn't bad.  It's just how some people play it that is.  I have probably played EQ more than I should have at times, but I don't play it more than I think is reasonable.<br>
<br>
Of all the things in EverQuest that I hate and all the things that I enjoy, the one most valuable thing that has ever been done for me has happened to me here, in EQ..  I met Missa in EQ, and yes, she has a name, and YES, I have been with her in person (/cheer!!!), and she is the one very best thing that has ever happened to me, and it happened because of EQ and our interest in online gaming.  I'm soooooo happy that I met her -- nobody save her can ever know how happy -- and I will always, always love her.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
See...EQ can't be that bad.  Without it, I would have never met my love, and I wouldn't like that at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
I know two people whom I met on EQ who don't play any more..  I met one before she knew the other, and met him after she and he had met.  They liked each other, and had never seen each other, but they got together and talked and talked and grew to love each other, and now they're married and living in the same place.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
If you didn't know the people I was talking about, they were the wonderfully entrancing Latharia and the kind, goodhearted (but iron-headed!) Balthus.<br>
<br>
I still talk to them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>

(being that you won't make money at it, this can be disputed, but you know what I mean) Miraa was one of my best friends when she played, I miss her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For me, EQ at certain points in the last 3 years had become more than just a game, it was my life for a couple months, I did pretty much nothing but eat, EQ, and sleep the odd time. I didn't get burnt out by doing this either, I loved it. Then school came, and I found myself skipping classes to stay home and play EQ, my dad found out. He threatned to cancel the internet (to my dad, EQ=internet, both are evil to him, he can't turn on a computer) unless my grades picked up. My school was talking about banning me because it was a waste of their time having me in class once or twice a week. Fergy, you remember how many times I had to go see Timko? /cackle<br>
<br>
So I left EQ, I left for 6 months, I graduated from high school with not bad marks, but I had to do it without EQ, because if I wouldn't have left EQ at that point, I don't think I would have graduated. <br>
<br>
I came back about 7-8 months ago, and I play casually. I now own a health food store, sort of a bodybuilding store at the same time, it's midstream, not heavy into either side. I work, and I've NEVER missed work for EQ, nor will I ever. <br>
<br>
After seeing what my life became with only EQ, I've decided that a game can be a game, unless it takes over. For some people, they don't recognize when it takes over, I was lucky enough to realize it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ has also brought about some of the best friends I've ever had. Now I've also introduced some of my best friends to it. (dear lord what have I done)<br>
<br>
EQ can be bad, but like everything in this world, only if it's abused. Everything in moderation.<br>
<br>
If people would listen to that advice, then the Health and Protection Branch (similar to the FDA in USA) here in Canada wouldn't have banned ephedrine or ephedra containing products. (with over 7.5mg per serving)<br>

Although, Aal, I do have to say I'm worried about you... you said your school was considering &quot;banning&quot; you?

I used the term banning me because I couldn't think of the correct word, but you hit it on the nose with expelling me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It was something they spoke of in my second half of grade 12, never happened because I got my ass in gear though. I pulled off very good grades once on my break from EQ, raising all my marks by about 20% near the diploma time. (we have a % system in high school, not the letter system, 100% is pretty much impossible to get, but 90's aren't uncommon entirely)<br>
<br>
I now own and work full time in the health food store I mentioned, it's called The Vitamin Guy, it's doing very well actually, even though our <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thevitaminguy.com">website</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> isn't the best in the world. (shameless advertisment) I only play AFTER work, and I still go to the gym regularly, my body is in the best shape of my life, my mind continues to expand, and my future looks very promising. EQ hasn't had a very negative impact on my life at all, I use it for fun now, if it wasn't a &quot;game&quot; for me, and it became a necessity, I would not play.<br>

I was once told that Magic: The Gathering was an evil game that was going to send me to hell because it had skeletons and demons on it. But God didn't strike me down for playing it. And if i shot myself every time I lost a loot roll... geesus... I don't know if I have enough flesh to be damaged by that many bullets....<br>
<br>
Video games and music can't turn you into a serial killer. Why? because they might teach you to shoot some other guy, but they don't really teach you a damn thing about how to aim or fire a gun. <br>
If video games and music lead to suicide, I HIGHLY doubt that that was the intent of the artist. <br>
<br>
To make this short, I want you to ask yourself, or anyone who would say that incidents like this are the result of desensitivity from Games, Music, or TV one simple question. <br>
<br>
What about all the other people who do these things daily? <br>
<br>
Take the entire population of America and Europe, ages 10 to 60. Find me one person in that group (that does not have some form of disability or inhabition towards this example) that doesn't see at least one person a day get killed or commit suicide. I know for a fact that at peak time, there are approximately 120,000 people playing Counterstrike. now if every match lasted the full 3 minutes, that's about 37,400 people getting killed via shooting every minute. <br>
<br>
If people want to scream about games and music being the root of evil in their children, then I want to see them fighting to have EVERY video game, song, and tv show that depicts or describes violence and/or death removed from existance. Every educational program. Every news broadcast. C'mon people! If you want a scapegoat for some problem you overlooked or never saw in your kid or friend, do it right! <br>
<br>
Or, shut the hell up, sit down, and realize that for whatever reason this thing has happened, it probably has nothing to do with these mediums, and more to do with the fact that the person just had some neurochemical inbalance or some really, really poor influences.<br>

 &quot;Shawn was playing 12 hours a day, and he wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic, and the game would cause seizures,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably the last eight times he had seizures were because of stints on the computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.<br>
<br>
&quot;This fed right into the EverQuest playing,&quot; Woolley said. &quot;It was the perfect escape.&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
So you're telling me that you knew all this, and what? did he put a gun to your head when you tried to unplug the computer? OR... didn't you ever think of that??<br>
<br>

 After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation, Parker said.<br>
<br>
&quot;He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing him,&quot; Parker said. &quot;He was running through his neighborhood having hallucinations. I can't think of a drug he could have taken where he would have disintegrated in 15 weeks.&quot; <br>

Tell me how many people have camped the AC for an entire week.. that'd be more likely to drive me skitzo.<br>

 &quot;Could a person get so engrossed that they become so distressed and distraught that it could put them over the edge?&quot; Walsh said. &quot;It probably has something to do with the game. But your average person or average gamer won't do this. It's a coming together of a number of circumstances.&quot; <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, maybe a few people out there are starting to get the idea. <br>
<br>
<br>
but... ya know what's REALLY gonna steam me about this? I'll bet anyone $5 that this kid's mom wins the lawsuit. Why? because that's what we do in America. we sue people. like that bitch that sued McDonalds because her coffee was hot. she shouldn't have gotten money in a law suit. if i was the judge and she walked into my court, i'd grab an ink stamp and stamp a giant &quot;NO SHIT&quot; on her forehead.<br>
<br>
<br>
oh, and i thought i might mention.... <br>
they probably had no problem watching John Wayne shoot people. <br>
<br>
<br>
again, i apologize to anyone who is offended by my use of language here, but times like this it's the only way i feel i can appropriately express myself. what can i say? i'm tactless :-/<br>

Did the mother try to get her son to stop? apparently not...she had to have been supporting him and his habit because it is stated in the article that the man had NO job because he had quit and he lived at home.....this alone tells me that the mother only aided him in his fall.<br>

My German exchange student, Michael, and I must've seen at LEAST 10,000 things die on my computer screen yesterday.  We played Serious Sam Co-Op for 5 hours from start to finish... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Let's see...<br>
<br>
Grenades blew up everywhere<br>
<br>
Launched rockets into crowds<br>
<br>
Minigunned crowds of mobs for minutes straight (the game has sooo many creatures...)<br>
<br>
And it's all accompanied by blood and guts and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
<br>
But....<br>
<br>
I don't really feel the urge to go kill people.  =P  Not to mention, if *I* tried to hold a minigun I'd probably fly backwards the minute I pulled the trigger -- IF I could even hold it!! <p><B>
