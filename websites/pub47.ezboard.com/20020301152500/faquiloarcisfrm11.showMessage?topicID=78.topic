We do not "require" participation in any event, and encourage individuality in play style.<br><br>Aquilo di Arcis is first and foremost a family of friends.  We have formed this guild in order to better communicate and enjoy our playing experiences.  Guild members are highly encouraged to help as is within their powers but will not be required to do so. <br><font color="fff000"><br>Guild leadership:<br></font><br>The Guild Leader is:  Talzain.<br>The officers are:  Amsra, Sillair, Qudelle, Talania, Brimztone, Faiena and Aalaandro. <br><br>The officers of Aquilo di Arcis are here to provide support for our members and to create a more enjoyable playing environment for not only our guild members but also the rest of the residents of Norrath.  Please feel free to contact any of them with complaints, issues, problems or compliments whether you are a member or not.<br><br>Those who join the guild by invitation of a full guild member (sponsor) will be a "ward" of that member.  Called Mentors, the sponsors are information sources for new members, ie: the website, the registration process for the roster, the location and process for being admitted to the message boards.<br><br>Lastly, one need not be an officer or a mentor in order to be a leader within and outside of the guild.        Those who can lead should lead.  Raid leaders, group leaders, and event leaders are always needed and       welcome.  You are encouraged to take the opportunity to lead when it is available. <br><font color="fff000"><br>Member responsibilities:<br></font><br>Members are asked to keep these basic principles in mind. <br>1. All of Vertants rules of conduct are also Aquilo di Arics' rules of conduct. They are viewable <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/index.jsp"> here.</a> <br>2. Treat those around you with the same politeness and respect that you wish to be treated with.<br>3. Be mature in your words and deeds, and let your conduct be an example for others to follow<br><br>Strive to be the best player and person you can be.  Know the abilities and limitations of your characters       and try to know those of the other classes you group with.  Follow directions when appropriate and give       directions when the situation warrants it. <br><font color="fff000"><br>What not to expect:<br></font><br>There are class dependencies that exist and while other guild members may have abilities that you are in       need of, it is not reasonable to expect others to drop everything in order to satisfy your need.  We       encourage Druids and Wizards to provide transportation when they are available to do so.  We encourage       Clerics to Resurrect their fallen companions when they are able.  We encourage Necromancers to summon      corpses when guild members get in over their heads.  But in all cases, none of these are expected every time. <br>It is expected that those wanting help put forth at least as much effort as those providing the help.<br><br>You should not expect to be power leveled or twinked.  <br><font color="fff000"><br>Joining our guild:<br></font><br>First and foremost, you need a sponsor to apply. Any full member of Aquilo di Arcis can be a sponsor. Applications that are posted without a sponsor will be void and removed.<br><br>Currently, the level limit to apply to Aquilo di Arcis is level 51. Changes to this will be announced and posted.<br><br>Aquilo di Arcis respects the right of people to apply to other guilds, however if you apply to Aquilo di Arcis, we ask that it be the only open application at the time.<br><br>RL spouses/significant others are exempt from the application process. They will be granted membership immediately upon showing interest.<br><br>RL friends and family will be exempt from the level limit, however, must still complete the application process set forth in this post and on the application sections of our boards.<br><br>In order to apply to Aquilo di Arcis, you must first read the application procedures. These can be found <a href="http://216.171.164.247/application.html"> here</a>. Once you have read the rules of applying, you can then answer the application questions and post a new thread <a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11"> here</a> using your character name and level as the thread title.<br>Once an application is presented, it is moved to the voting area of our message board. It requires 4 member votes and 1 officer vote to become a Trial invite(total 5). Once a member is invited for the trial period, he or she must gain a total of 9 member votes and 1 officer vote to become a full member(total 10). 30 days are given for this process to be completed. The voting takes place in a private forum to insure the privacy of our members.<br>Please note that it is the right of our members to Veto any applicant. A veto will immediately close any application, and void the bid for membership. After 30 days, you may reapply to Aquilo di Arcis.<br><br>This concludes the Charter section.<br><br><br><br><br><br><font color="fff000"><b><br>The Code of Conduct:<br></font></b><br><font color="fff000"><br>Some specific examinations of policy:<br></font><br>Conflicts with other people or guilds should and will be handled by Aquilo di Arcis officers.<br><br>As a general rule we do not allow the use of /anon as it will completely hide you from the rest of the guild. Likewise,  /roleplay may be used in situations where you feel like you need to be able to play and not be hounded for the services your character may be able to provide (ie: Clerics while traveling, druids and shaman while banking in Faydark, and druids and wizards when their transportation skills are simply unavailable at the time.) There should never be a time when you need to use /anon.<br><br>All members of the guild realize that each and every individual in this game has their own right to enjoying       their time and we by no way own a "camp", a "quest", or any locations or creatures in Norrath.  If a guild       member is denied the right to something of the like listed above then no member will take matters into       their own hands.  We believe the best way to reach others is not by threatening them or alienating them       but by demonstrating effective cooperation. No member of Aquilo di Arcis is permitted to intentionally Kill Steal if they feel their right to a specific area has been denied.<br><br>No member will practice deliberate training.  Accidents happen however and the guild will not suspend a       member because of this without investigating the incident(s).  Training constitutes anything that the       trained person believes it is.  Guild members realize it is within their power as a human being to resolve       these conflicts with simple reasoning and compromise. <br>If an Aquilo Di Arcis member is involved in creating, contributing, or causing an involuntary train that ends in the death(s) of other(s), then the honorable thing to do for that member would be to assist if at all possible in the corpse retrieval/resurrections, to foster a better interguild relationship and reputation on the server as being one of honor and integrity.<br><br>Threatening language, excessive profanity, and other bannable speech such as sexually explicit depictions       or any form of racial, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status based commenting will not be tolerated via any communications channel.  We expect members to treat others with respect at all times in the interest of providing the most enjoyable play experience for everyone. These instances will also include what has been deemed as "Hate tells": The intentional harassment of a member via tells based on a piece of loot they have won, rolled on, or been asked to loot by an event loot dealer. Abuse of this medium will result in the member being warned, and then suspended if it continues.<br><br>If you feel that members of another guild have wronged you, report the specifics of the incident immediately to one of our guild officers. They will attempt to resolve the situation. It is not acceptable for you to insult, badger, provoke, or otherwise engage members of another guild. Nor is it acceptable behavior for you to insult or belittle another guild in any public forum, including /say, /ooc, /shout, /say, message boards, or guild chat. Remember, guilds don't behave poorly, people do.<br><br>Guild chat is here to help us communicate not to spread hate propaganda or used as a trading post for the   mistreatment of others. Excessive negativity in guild chat will also not be tolerated, as it is considered an abuse of your guild mates. Abuse of this type will result in the member being warned, and then suspended if it continues. *PLEASE NOTE* This is the only rule which will allow an officer that finds themselves online alone to temporarily remove an abusive member from the guild for the express purpose of the comfort and enjoyment of the guild members currently online. The member will be guild removed, and allowed a cooling off period in which to get their actions under control before being allowed back in the guild. Instances of abusive members will still require the opening of the Halls of Justice and will follow the stated guidelines for removal from the guild.<br><br>As previously stated, the use of the /anon feature is not allowed by Aquilo di Arcis members. Using this feature will result in a warning. If it is used again, the member will be suspended.<br><br>Aquilo di Arcis does not allow alts in other guilds.<br><font color="fff000"><br>Removal from the guild:<br></font><br>Membership in the guild is based on past actions and intentions.  Comments about our members are       welcome, however, members will not be prosecuted unless their actions are extreme or part of an ongoing      pattern.  Our guild allows and expects individual freedom so the views or ideas of any single member may       not necessarily reflect the supported views of the guild itself.  We work as a group and think as a family,       we are not a collective. Reports of member abuse of the rules should be taken directly to an officer via tell or E-mail and will be investigated by the officers of Aquilo di Arcis, not the members.<br><br>Suspensions from the guild will be temporary removals and can be done with the agreement of any two       officers either currently online, or in support on the Officers section of the message boards.  Suspensions will last 24 hours to two weeks, in which the suspended individual will be given a chance to state their side and attempt to resolve all conflicts in a forum created for this purpose called the Halls of Justice.  Permanent removal from the guild will require a 2/3 vote from all officers and final approval from the guildleader. If a vote to permanently remove a member passes, that person can reapply in 60 days.<br><br>If a member chooses to guild remove themselves, they will have to apply again. If the guild removal is due to a conflict with a specific person/event and said member feels this is the only way to handle the situation at the time, an IMMEDIATE tell, post, email or some form of communication with an officer is required to circumvent the application process. If there is no record of such a communication, then the application process holds true to the member. This is defined as having a full application posted in the Application forum, and going through the set 5 votes, 30 day trial, and vote on full membership process.<br><font color="fff000"><br>Base loot rules:<br></font><br>A complete writeup of our loot rules can be found <a href="http://216.171.164.247/loot.html"> here. </a><br><br>A general description of our loot policy is if you are able to use the item, will use the item, have a certain need for the item, and feel you have done enough to deserve the item, then you may roll for the item. At no time can anyone roll on/win any item and "pass" it to another member.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uqudelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qudelle</A> at: 2/19/02 7:36:32 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=78.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11.threadControl?topicID=78.topic><img src=http://www.dndwebdesign.com/Dawn/locked.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=78.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub47.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="aquiloarcisfrm2">General Public Forum<option value="aquiloarcisfrm10">Public Events<option value="aquiloarcisfrm8">Guild News<option value="aquiloarcisfrm11">Applications<option value="aquiloarcisfrm3">Members Access Request<option value="aquiloarcisfrm16">Trading Post<option value="aquiloarcisfrm24">Public Polls<option value="aquiloarcisfrm6">Members Lounge<option value="aquiloarcisfrm27">Members Voting Forum<option value="aquiloarcisfrm7">Guild Events<option value="aquiloarcisfrm15">The Butterfly Ballot Room<option value="aquiloarcisfrm14">Guild Bank<option value="aquiloarcisfrm17">Members Trading Post<option value="aquiloarcisfrm12">Tactics and Strategies<option value="aquiloarcisfrm19">Ballot Room<option value="aquiloarcisfrm23">Epic/Quest Needs<option value="aquiloarcisfrm25">Member Polls<option value="aquiloarcisfrm26">LFG Coordination Room<option value="aquiloarcisfrm18">Epic Hall of Fame<option value="aquiloarcisfrm28">Officers Lounge<option value="aquiloarcisfrm9">Hall of Justice<option value="aquiloarcisfrm13">Vault<option value="aquiloarcisfrm5">Admin Vault</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffff00>- </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/baquiloarcis>Aquilo di Arcis</a><font color=#ffff00> - </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm11>Applications</a> <font color=#ffff00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
