Real life health has kept me pretty much out of the whole, staying awake for any amount of time thing.<br>
<br>
Our raid last night was in Teneborous Mountains.  We took out vampires from the coterie fort.  The raid was slightly delayed in starting due to my late arrival, which I apologize for (damn DSL, wtf, no connection????)  Once I arrived in the designated meeting place (as Budderz), I got the groups set up quickly and moved us out as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
Makiko was designated puller and did an excellent job.  Asharad from LoW was our MA and did a very good job.  Our raid plan was to have all melee up front and casters in back.  Everyone paid attention to this and was very good at keeping all chat in the raid channel to a minimum.  Everyone did a great job at responding quickly to all commands and we only experienced one death last night.  It was a very well organized raid and I feel everyone did a superb job on the raid tactics.<br>
<br>
We still need to work on having everyone in the designated meeting place at the raid start time.  This means you should have either camped there the night before if you knew you were going to be logged in right at start time, or you need to know that you have to log in before raid start time to get your port, a bind (if necessary) and do you run.  We cannot continue to have people logging in at 7p PST and asking for a ride or asking for a bind in a zone away.  Because of the 7p PST start time, we must start as close to that time as possible so that we have more time all together before our eastern time zones and other continent time zone folks have to log.  <br>
<br>
Everyone needs to make sure that if they have to go afk, they inform their group immediately and the group leader needs to let the raid force know, especially the raid leader.  If we move out and someone gets left behind, this only causes delays and in some case death as the person that was afk was left sitting alone, or they tried coming to us but brought some nasty friends along that we were not prepare for.  If you have an emergency, it only takes you 20 seconds to type /g AFK .  If we dont' know you are afk and move out, it is then your responsibility to come to us.  We cannot afford to call a halt and send people back to get one person.  Everyone in a group needs to be aware of their group mates.<br>
<br>
If the RL gives an order, follow it.  Do not ask questions, do not hesitate, don't stand there scratching your crotch saying, wtf??  The RL is giving an order for a reason.  Listen, follow, and stay alive.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Direct questions to your group first.  If they cannot help, then take it to the raid channel ONLY IF IT IS RELATED TO THE RAID.  Do not send tells the RL unless you are the group lead, the puller, MA or SA. The RL has got to stay on top of the whole raid and is trying to watch everything.  There is no time to deal with 10 tells from 10 different people.  <br>
<br>
Raids are not for experience. I repeat, RAIDS ARE NOT FOR EXPERIENCE.  There will be times when we will schedule a raid just for experience grinding but unless that has been stated in the raid details before the start of the raid, know that you may not get any experience.  If you whine about your lack of experience, know that you can be removed from the raid for the rest of the raid.  <br>
<br>
Loot is handled by the RL.  If an item is looted that you really, really, REALLY want, the RL doesn't need 5 tells explaining why you think the loot should go to you.  Loot is almost always NBG.  If a no drop item drops, it will immediately be rolled on by those that need, and will use, the item, knowing that the item they are replacing will go to another member who will use that item.  That is how NBG works.  There may be times when we raid and all loot will be rolled on by everyone and NBG will not apply.  It's open season.  <br>
<br>
The reason for these posts is to get input from all members and friends that attended the raid.  We (the officers and I) need to know what you thought worked well, what didn't, what you think needs improvement.  The only way we continue to improve our raid tactics is if we get feedback.  Negative, positive, if you want to kiss my butt, do it here. <br>
<br>
See you in game!<br>
