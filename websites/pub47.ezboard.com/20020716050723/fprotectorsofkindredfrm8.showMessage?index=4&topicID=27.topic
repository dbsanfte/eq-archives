align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir's Remains (Druid and Rangers reread pls)</span><hr size=1> OK if you don't want to follow the links then I'll try to write it out here.  Sit back, kick your feet up, and have a glass of cold lemonade, cuz this might be a long read.  <br>
** Venril Sathir's Remains. Groups: Two to Four. Levels: 45+ <br>
Classes Needed: Warrior x2 (or pally who's good with aggro management), cleric x2 , Enchanter x2, Ranger, Rogue, Monk, and druids. All classes have a role, but not all are needed. I've been successful with VSR with 4 rangers 5 druids, so it just depends on gear + levels I guess. <br>
---No resists are needed, just HP/AC for MT, and max attack for other meeles. <br>
--- Venril Sathir (jr. the one your spawning) has about 20-32khp, doubles for 330 max, and has a 1500 single target DD.<br>
---If you wipe, you will need a rogue with 200 lockpick skill to open the door, and a monk FD&quot;d inside to grab the corpses and bring to the door. Make sure the zone knows you all died, if they try pulling, an EXP group may pull VSR by mistake .. this would be BAD, hehe =( when he gets freed, all hell breaks loose. tells hands/wl and Basement groups to either A) Hold on pulls a sec, or B) be ready to free sathir, a pathing bug from there crosses his antichamber and frees him. <br>
---Make sure to summon a firefly globe before starting the raid, telling everyone to wait for nightime so you can do this would be BAD! lol. Also, have the level 49 cleric spell, Ressurection, on hand. I believe it can be bought in FV. Also, make sure to pick up two stacks of Peridots, you're gonna need em. <br>
---Venril Sathir's Remains can be tracked from the zone in at KC, I beleive it is level 55. When your raid party arrives in KC, let the LCY + hands/wl group know you are OTW to kill VSR, and to make sure their spawns are pulled and out of your way as not to KS. <br>
---Head to LCY, Head up the stairs, and follow the battlement a bit. You will reach a corner on the walls, three way cross area. Turn to your right, and begin walking that way. Take your first right you see, and basically track to VSR. Dont lose anyone, if you do , you can't go back for em! Now, let everyone know to NOT attack him. This is the time to buff, assure everyone your gonna kick some leezard arse, and explain to them what's going to happen. Tell everyone to not attack unless it's named VENRIL SATHIR and nothing else. The strategy continues below. <br>
---Hailing Venril Sathir's Remains, he asks for the fires of life. Hand him the Firefly globe, and then Spirit of Venril Sathir will spawn. Now is the time to go over strategy. <br>
---Venril Sathir (jr. version, the one you're spawning) procs a single target 1500hp DD. You Can nullify this, by having the two enchanters casting RUNE on the Main Tank in a chain. Now that you understand that, I will Introduce you to Focus Tanking. <br>
---Your Main tank, the person with best ac/hp, will be the ONLY one getting hit. Let's name him Joe. Joe has 3500hp and 1070ac and is fully buffed, having best ac/hp of the whole raid. When you spawn Sathir, EVERY MELEE EXCEPT JOE should be BEHIND Sathir.. Why? Remember that 1500proc? he cant proc on you if he isnt hititng you. Also, you avoid Riposites, and VSR has a huge melee for your levels. When you do hand in, have Joe be the FIRST to engage VSR, and tell everyone to NOT ATTACK yet!!! When 15 seconds has past, call the order for melees to go in, make sure Joe Pisses VS off as much as possible, beg/taunt/disarm/stun low dly weaps just make sure he makes it mad. Tell all your taunting classes to NOT taunt except joe.... if Joe dies, have your 2nd tank take over, getting aggro ASAP . Nukers may nuke at 70% hp... if people start dying, have the monk FD asap.. the corpse run isnt very fun from here. <br>
---Choose an Enchanter to Tash at the beginning of the fight, and choose a shaman to slow. if no shamans are present, have the same enchanter slow. Not slowing VSR could do alot more damage then people of your raidforce may be able to take .... Try to not let that chanter die, you'll need him for rune rotation later. <br>
---Healing isnt too tough, i'll show you CH chain and spam healing here. Now, when you spawn Venril Sathir, have the druids begin healing the MT Right away!!!!! Then, have your clerics do a CH chain... being low leveled, you'll need this. Have Cleric_01 say (have him program it as a hotkey) in your raid channel: Complete Heal Joe, Cleric_02 next! then cleric_02 counts to five, (or has the delay hotkeyed, I like counting better) and then casts CH , saying Complete Heal Joe, Cleric_01 next! Have them do that until VSR dies. Have a 2nd tank set up JUST IN CASE JOE DIES. Make sure your clerics know this 2nd tank so they know who to heal. Druids, be watching Joe's HP, it's okay to make a filler heal and save the MT. It's actually a very good idea, but Spamheals here are very crucial, cause if a CH lands right before he gets lifetapped , Joe just lost 1500hp and wont get a clerical heal for another 5 seconds. <br>
---Have the enchanters do a chain Rune, similar to the cleric's CH chain. This helps Nullify the Proc (if the melee doesnt knock it off). <br>
---Time to fight. make sure everyone knows what their role is, and what they are doing, Communication is the key here, you only want to do this once ... Hand in the rez scroll, and then it's time for some fun. Follow what I stated above, and you should have yourself a VSR stone. Every druid/ranger needs one of these in your guild, so you may want to farm him a bit to get it for everyone. it's a great feeling when this lizard dies.<br>
---With luck, you had a wizard with you, and can now Xloc everyone to wherever they need to go. If not, have casters gate (except druids) and port your melees out ... if you cant port everyone out, have the rogue pop open the door to RCY and walk out ... or, have a druid succor 1 group, then run back invis and port another group.<br>

Thanks for the info hun.  We're all supposed to be experts on our own epic mobs, but having 30 people follow links to sites for someone else's mob gets a bit crazy at times which is why I asked for a post here.<br>
<br>
The info here is good and tells us a lot of what we're going to be getting ourselves into.  I didn't realize that the VSR who spawns from VS wasn't the one you kill and a bunch of other things or that you could (I'm gathering from your post) kill him over and over again without waiting for the next VSR spawn to kill the next round.<br>
<br>
I think Crichton said VSR drops one druid and one ranger epic piece with each death.  Are they no drop?  If so, are they MQ'able?  I think those are the last two questions I've got personally.<br>
<br>
:-)<br>

Though I've not heard a personal account about MQ's this item, from the instructions given to complete the epic, it IS MQ-able so long as the MQuester is not KOS in Firiona Vie and to any druidic factions. A person can hand in VS's gem to Foloal Stormforest in FV and the druid/ranger can then hand in their gem from the foraging part afterwards, and the druid/ranger should receive a 'warm pulsating stone'.  The druid/ranger can then turn in that warm stone to the appropriate epic NPC (Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket) and receive their Elaborate Scimitar.  Nice item!!!  I need only VSR to get this and the singularity of steps for me to get it gets me anxious sometimes lol please forgive me.  Also the price of MQ from someone is unknown, I would imagine that someone could ask for whatever they want if the druid/ranger wants it bad enough, Lord knows I'd spend every cent I have if it could get me this, but selling the MQ of this step in the epic is unheard of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td
