This story is posted to give fair notice to all those who <br>

<br>
One evening while grouped with a Barbarian Shaman and a <br>
Halfling Druid, we decided to rid the region of Cobalt Scars <br>
of the Siren infestation that is currently prevailing. After <br>
first putting on my resist gear, for I knew what powerfull <br>
enchanters they are famed to be. The evening went well as we <br>
killed the first two (conned blue to 53) with no ill effect. <br>
Then on the third pull (conned green to 53) the Evil Little <br>
Halfling Druid decided to switch sides and fight with the <br>
Sirens. Next thing you know I see the following message:<br>
<br>
You have been slain by Habben.<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
<br>
Evil I tell you , Evil little halfling druid!<br>

Luckily a kindly Dwarf Cleric by the name of Kaddishx <br>
traveled from afar to use the mystic powers his god had <br>
bestowed upon him to ressurect me.<br>

Before I met Splos even. I was hunting in my usual hunting grounds, Lower Guk, and I happened to stumble upon this group of friends in need of a tank. This group's leader was a ranger named Rangen, the cleric was Phordin, mage was Advid, and druid was Dukalek. They lacked an enchanter also, but that wasn't my department.<br>
<br>
We hunted night after night in Lower Guk, and slowly, I became part of their little family. At the time, I had just exited my previous guild, House of Serenity, because the guild was shut down. (The leader disbanded it due to RL stress) So here we were, a near full group of friends in search of a guild. We continued to hunt together, and one night, Rangen told me about a lady named Heather, and her family called Aquilo Ferox. He told me I should speak to her and see if I could get invited to join them, because Rangen, Phordin, Dukalek, and Advid were all doing the same. So I did, and a few days later, I was invited by Heather into Aquilo Ferox.<br>
<br>
This is when Aalaandro was born really...from that day on, I've grown with the guild, seen it in every shape, size, strength, I've seen it appear to die, then be rebourn, then die again, then come back. The idea of the guild will never die, even if one day the guild no longer exists.<br>
<br>
This isn't much of a story, but the main part of it is that without meeting Rangen that night, I might never have had a group with them, might never have met Heather, might never have joined Aquilo, and might never have known many of those whom I consider my best friends, and might never have met the woman I call my wife. So as much as this was a story, it is a way of saying thanks to everyone in my family, and all those who've made me who I am.<br>
<br>
Splos, you are unbelievable...when I think I've forgotten something, you manage to refresh my memories.<br>
<br>
Miraa, I think I remember that PoF break..you had an afk message of &quot;Can't talk now, being woo'd&quot; Or something similar as you were alone with Splos in the Plane of Fear....<br>

Heck, 2 of the 3 aren't even ingame anymore hehe.  Come on you goofy Aquilo types.  I know you must all have fun little stories to share, or wonderful memories to talk about.  Thanks so much to Alhtel for sharing a fun story.  Amsra better get his bootay into this thread and share some stories.  If there's one thing I know, it's that Amsra has caused lots of trouble with his stout little Dwarven self hehe.<br>
<br>
I would love to hear some stories from some of the lovely people I never got a chance to know very well, if at all.  I just have to believe that people like Sillair and Qudelle, among many others, have some amazing experiences to share.  That is what keeps people like me interested in the events that happen here.  Those of us who have moved on, but still care about the family, wish to hear of your adventures and funny stories.<br>
<br>
I just love the story Aal told.  I remember it very well hehe.  I remember those early days and now cherish them with all my heart.  I spoke to Rangen yesterday Aal and he is doing very well and is in good spirits.  He remembers very fondly our times together too.  I was in LGuk one night and I remember Rangen fussing at me for single pulling the Lord from a fully spawned room for the group in Ass/Supp instead of his group HAH.  He wanted me to come join your group of friends, but as always I was there helping everyone hehe.  I think I bonked Dukalek in the head once or twice too LOL.<br>
<br>
As for my sister Freckles hehe, well I am just not even going to comment.  Dear lord I am embarrased enough as it is hehe.  All that mischief and I didn't even have a clue, while the rest of the guild just ate up every word LOL.  And Denei was almost as bad SHEESH hehe.  But, nobody made things more fun than Lady Miraa did.  Her gift to us all was her fun loving nature and that spark of trouble that just lit up her eyes hehe.<br>
<br>
I remember Moorgard coming through whatever the zone is where the main druid ring is for Kunark hehe (I forget hehe but it's where Gorenaire is).  Anyway, Miraa was running along behind him, and Moorgard came up to me and said Miraa was to be his Padawan WOOP heehee.  He had been mine, and now Miraa was to be the next in line hehe.  Instead of her paying attention to her elder when he called for her to come, she just stood there and pinched my tushy over &amp; over ROFL.  Crazy woman!<br>

I was a wee chit of a monk, my freckles not even fully developed, racing across a zone (West Commons?? I forget EQ already), daring to send Master Splos nervous tells/questions about feigning strategies. Behind his considered responses, I sensed a great power. I had not seen the master face to face, nor had the opportunity to witness the Grand Master Derriere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The first time I met Master Splos, he was focusing his Chi outside Sol A, bathed in the fiery glow of the lavapool. I felt immediate peace... followed shortly by a nagging desire to trick him into getting up from his meditative pose. At the time, I did not know why.<br>
<br>
And then... and then the day of my fateful trip to Fear. Buoyed by adrenaline as I nervously pawed at the Portal, I had no idea what was in store for me. Splos and I entered Fear. I remember entering a blasted and foreboding landscape, dotted with innumerable horrors, I remember being excited. The rest is mostly blank: Splos began jogging the training path around fear, his chi-focused butt wiggling with every step. I ask you my brothers and sisters, do you blame my obsession that night? *shakes her head in awe at the memory*<br>
<br>
That is my final word on the power of Master Splos' wiggle. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The rest of the guild just sat outside the portal awaiting the call to zone in and kill the creatures the two wonderful monks would bring us. Miraa seemed to be a natural, I had seen many a monk try the feat, but she seemed to get it right away. To her amazing learning there are 2 explinations, 1: Splos was a truly amazing teacher, and 2: She was so mezmerized by his bottom that everything he would say would just sink right in and she'd find herself doing things but not knowing why.....<br>

Hmmm I remember many fun times I shared with those of you who descend from the Arcis family as well.  I was talking to Lady Storrme last week about the time Aarnwulf asked me to come rescue the family from a tragic attempt at breaking Fear.<br>
<br>
I had been materialized in Norrath for all of 2 seconds when I got spammed with Aarnwulf tells heehee.  It wasn't funny at all at the time, but looking back it sure is hilarious hehe.  And the night ended up being a rousing success and so many who had suffered so much throughout the day ended up having a wonderful night.  One of my fondest memories of spending time with the lovely Arcis family.  Maybe Storrme can come by and visit us and tell more stories herself hehe.<br>
<br>
Spread the word folks.  We are going to have a lovely thread filled with fun and fellowship, even if it takes spamming over and over by a couple of goofy monks and one of your new officers hehe.<br>

Was playing my chanter, Korazon, in sol b...think I was maybe 41 at the time, hadn't been playing there long. Had a great group in the LR and we'd been happily killing for a couple hours. Puller brings in 2, I mez 1, we start killing the other.....Suddenly without warning, some idiot trains the entire KR onto us, something like 12 mobs. I start mezzing, tanks start killing. We got down to about 5 left and the group leader starts saying run.....I say no....I got it. At this point I was almost continuely OOM, sitting and medding just long enuf for another mez. Another 5 minutes or so, and we finally beat em all down. Only lost 1 person and that was a tank. Truely, of everything I have done in EQ, this gave me the biggest rush and feeling of accomplishment. Hehe, the whole group was kneeling in reverance to me for a good 2 minutes afterwards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Last night Malasa and I were happily killing frogs for simple xp and 2 necro's ask me if it's alright for them to pull to where we're pulling to. Being nice I decided to let them do it, thinking they'd be smart about what they pull...<br>
<br>
I see the two of them beating on a couple frogs and I run past to go pull some of my own, I gather a couple frogs, knowing full well I can kill them with no worries. Then, on the phone, I hear Malasa telling me that the two necro's just FD'd right beside her and there are now 3 frogs beating on her. I begin running back, and get there just in time to begin taunting them all off her, she has to heal herself a few times because the mean frogs beat on her for a few seconds.. I now have 5-6 frogs on me, and 2 necro's afraid of death still FD's on the ground. (how ironic is that?) So I decide once I've been fighting for a few moments that I want them dead fast. Malasa puts her damage shield around me, and the frogs start killing themselves on my spikes. I then, under Splos' guidance, focus my chi and make myself an instrument of mass destruction to the undead. Suddenly, my weapon is bathed in a divine light, my discipline of holyforge has started. My blows gain in strength throughout the battles, and I begin slashing for 200-400 points of damage randomly. Needless to say, the poor frogs did not know what they had got themselves into, one by one they fell to my blade and my love's thorns. <br>
<br>
By the end, what was left standing was a knight and a preserver, a man and his wife. The frogs of lower guk know the power of my blade now and are afraid..<br>
<br>
PS. I hit a crip for 499 last night, a new high! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://jennymarie.freewebspace.com/aal-new-sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/umalasaforestmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malasa Forestmoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/8/02 12:19:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Story Time</span><hr size=1> The Day my life turned around<br>
<br>
<br>
I was at a point in my life where I thought everything was against me. This was the day that everything changed. On this Cool Fall day I was looking for something to do as usual. I asked in guild if anyone wanted to do something  and I got only one reply. This Paladin sent me a tell, I had hear many things about him but had not yet met The Great Aalaandro. So we set out to have some fun this day. I cant remember where I picked him up from but we were headed in the direction of Plane of Growth. To spend a quiet day together. <br>
We visited our Mighty God together, I picked flowers with the animals, but most of all I realized that there was still good in this world. We talked and talked about everything. He just sat there and listened to everything I had to say, Never complaining nor judging me. He gave me his opinion, It wasnt always something I wanted to hear but it was the Truth and it came from the most noble person I know. <br>
After our stroll thru the place we call our home, He wandered to Waking lands. Aalaandro needed some mobs killed for his epic but this is where i had to end our day together. This is where I wish I could change the past and stayed to spend more time with him. <br>
But  In the end That Knight and The Preserver married a few months later. And they have what we all long to find, Love and Friendship. I married my bestfriend, My Soulmate. I look back and I know everything happened for a reason and I am happy I had to experience the bad to find the good. <br>
<br>
I also gained the most wonderful bestfriend in Real Life.  With whom I dont know what I would do without. No matter what happens he doesnt Judge me or think any less of me. When I need him to tell me the truth when normally someone would tell you something you wanna hear, He tells me just that the truth and it may hurt but It is what helps the most. <br>
<br>
I have learned many things from Aalaandro, things that cant be replaced by any other person. But most of all I learned what it is to be loved. <br>
From Roch I learned what it is to have someone just listen and care for me in a way I never knew. <br>
I hope that I give him the same in life. Someone who will listen to him at all costs. Someone to be there when the day doesnt go so good, or he feels like giving up. <br>
<br>
Splos, you have had such an effect on Aalaandro and I want to thank you. He always speaks highly of you. He looks up to you with great Admiration. <br>
<br>
<br>
Malasa <br>
<br>

Love you Aalaandro ! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/umalasaforestmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malasa Forestmoon</A> at: 3/8/02 1:16:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/usplos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Splos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Master</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/8/02 2:20:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Another Good One</span><hr size=1> Great story Aal heehee!

Malasa thank you for sharing such a lovely tale.  It is always nice to see a close friendship develop and prosper, no matter what the setting.  Your words are far too kind when they concern me, but they honor me and I thank you for them.  Please share more stories with everyone.  I'm sure you have plenty hehe.<br>
<br>
Another fun story of mine centers around a night soon after Denei had given me permission to court her hehe.  I was being my usual goofy self HAHA, and decided I wanted to spend an evening running all over Norrath and hitting as many zones as possible just for fun hehe.  Denei was happy to do this and agreed that it sounded like loads of fun.<br>
<br>
So, we set out just outside of the Karnor Keep hoping to cover much of Kunark before heading back to the older continents.  The first zone we came to (darn I can't remember the name of it hehe) was one that led to the Lake of Ill Omen.  I knew the way, but always had difficulty finding the exact path.  It usually took me a pass or 2 to find the right path hehe, but I always managed to find it.<br>
<br>
Well I must admit that the beauty of the lady I was attempting to woo had me a bit off, but one such as I makes no excuses LOL.  To make a long story short, we ended up running all over the silly zone and it took almost an hour for me to find the zone line HAHA.  Needless to say Denei was quite impressed.  It just so happens that she was impressed by my ability to get so lost in a place I knew so well and find a way to take so long just to get one zone over ROFL.<br>
<br>
Anyway hehe, we ended up not getting very far in our original plan for the night, because 1/2 the night was spent trying to find our way out of just 1 zone HAH!  Now, she didn't have a clue where the heck to go either, but I was the one trying to be all suave and cool and take her places.  So, it was me who was at fault hehe.<br>
<br>
The good news is that we ended up in Lavastorm and she told me she thought my chances to woo her were good; since I was able to goof up so much so quickly into our courtship and yet still had a cuteness that she couldn't help liking WOOP hehe.<br>
