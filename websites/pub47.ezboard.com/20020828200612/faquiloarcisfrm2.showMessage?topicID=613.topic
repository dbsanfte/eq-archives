I really think they are the worst ones to duel.  Necro's are only bad if they use dots and get you feared.  hehe   <br>
<br>
But Faiena has and never will duel using dots cause I don't want to see someone die from a dot and lose exp.  But anyone is always welcome to beat on my pets. hehe<br>
<br>
Truthfully you will spank my spec like theres no tomorrow. hehe  So have no worries about that.  <br>

while my pet is attacking them i start hitting with a murk blast and maybe even a speed debuff.<br>
and if that doesnt work i either run to the guards or die..lol<br>
its funny when i catch an Celt or Elf sneaking across the river, unlike EQ your swimming speed does not increase, i send my pet after them and watch them freak out because they cant get away fast enough, they usually swim like Jaws is in the water.<br>
my pet chops them up while i nuke from the beach.<br>

And before you complain about why I would forsake our brotherly love, young Aalaandro, to help the lady hehe, well my goodness man when she blinks her eyes at you what are you supposed to do HAH!<br>
<br>
In general I will offer some opinions based on my time playing.  Take them for what they are worth, since I am quite sure much has changed since a year ago.<br>
<br>
Dueling between the classes is amusing at best in terms of parity or balance being close enough for the combatants to have an equal chance.  Some classes are better designed to go up against others, and vice versa.  The best example I can think of are melee hybrids.  For a very long time they were thought to be the jokes of all classes in the game (mainly after Kunark was released).  And yet they have always been excellent classes for dueling.  They are just set up well to match up against many other classes.<br>
<br>
There are so many factors that come into play that help determine whether or not you will be successful in a duel.  The vast majority of those factors have absasmurfly nothing to do with your skills as a PVP player hehe.  That is what I always found so amusing.  Anyone who says the quality of your gear doesn't matter is just goofy.  It matters a great deal.  If you cannot see or admit that a monk with a fungi tunic has a dramatic advantage over a monk without one, then it's not worth even having a discussion hehe.<br>
<br>
Even more important I believe is something very simple, and entirely unrelated to your skills or even gear.  Your connection speed says every bit as much and more about what your ultimate capabilities are.  If my connection speed enables me to run circles around you because your connection speed is much slower, well you should get the picture hehe.  Those players at the high end who have the best gear and have honed the best skills are often so equally matched it's ridiculous to claim one person is better than the other.  If everything else is equal, but there is a dramatic disparity in the connection speeds, the fast connection wins.  Period hehe.  Anyone who disputes that just doesn't get it.<br>
<br>
It's also absurd not to realize that random luck has a great deal to do with your success.  If I use Flying Kick and it hits for 3 points, as opposed to 95 points, what explains the difference hehe?  I press the button the same way each time I use that skill hehe.  In other words, the random number generated has nothing to do with skill.  You have no control over whether or not you're going to hit for 3 points or 95 points hehe.  It is that way every single time you cast a spell, land a strike, or use a special skill.  Your skill doesn't determine its effectiveness.  The random number generated by something totally outside of your control does.<br>
<br>
Does skill matter a great deal (especially when most other factors average out to being virtually equal)?  Yeppers it sure does.  Is PVP in EverQuest truly a battle of pure skill, and its outcome based in large part on that aspect?  In my humble opinion not even close hehe.<br>
<br>
So, dueling comes down to fun and experimentation.  Practicing in the arenas against other classes will teach you a great deal.  I was an excellent dueler mainly because I practiced against all other classes and I made it a point to do so against people who were higher level than me.  Many of you know Mikel to be an excellent dueler.  He did the same thing, and it paid off for him big time as he advanced.  Most other people who honed their dueling skills as Mikel and I did I recall being the better duelers I knew.<br>
<br>
Learn which classes you are predisposed to match up well against, and which classes you aren't.  For those you don't match up well against, learn what strategies to employ that may give you a better chance.  In the end, much of what happens will be beyond your control.  The important thing is to develop your skills and strategies, so that what is within your control is of high quality.<br>
<br>
The last thing I will mention is determining what rules you will establish with each given opponent.  I've always thought it absurd that any mana class would take the time to enhance their every ability as much as possible, do the same for their pet if relevant hehe, and then pause to med back to full.  Hmmm gee hehe, let's see here.  Yep that is so completely fair and realistic it's laughable hehe.  I refused to duel people who made that stipulation.  I didn't think it accurately reflected what would represent actual dueling conditions.<br>
<br>
Some people will only duel based on certain criteria.  They have that right hehe.  Those who disagree with my opinion on mana for example have every right to feel that way.  Bottom line is that they weren't ever going to duel me hehe.  At least not do so and then proclaim with any certainty that they are better than me hehe.  Are damage shields agreed to?  Is shadowstepping agreed to?  Are pets agreed to?  How much time is allowed for buffing and such?<br>
<br>
All of these example matter a great deal.  As a pure melee class, if you allow a necro or enchanter or mage to keep trying until they've made the best pet they can make, then allow them to self buff &amp; enhance that pet to maximum, then allow them to med until they are fully powered again, what kind of chance do you think you have hehe?!?  Is it realistic that such activity would take place if a real duel were being established?  It's up to you and your opponent to agree on those terms hehe.  If you allow your ranger foe to self buff with 10 buffs &amp; then at the very end damage shield himself or herself hehe, well the fight is pretty much over before you start.  Is it because you have less skill than the ranger?  Nah hehe.  It's because Verant designed their class one way and yours another.  A class that has limitless damage shield ability vs. a class that doesn't hehe, well do the math.<br>
<br>
I could say more hehe, but I've rambled on long enough.  I will email you with some suggestions for facing paladins GRIN.  I never lost to one, even when they were 4 levels higher than me heehee.  But, a prepared monk matched up well with paladins back in those days, so I had design &amp; luck on my side at the time.  It may be different now.  In any case, for any one class to claim they are the best is foolish.  Anyone can be beaten at any given time.<br>

I just had to say nice post; also I could also use some of those highly coveted tactics against paladins. Since Aal is the one that got me started in the EQ world, and has taught me most of what I know (thanks BTW) I have set it out as a personal quest for me to defeat the Knight Aalaandro in a duel (kind of "the student becomes the teacher" stories).<br>
I don’t know just how long this will take me to achieve this goal but is it some thing to strive for. I realize that a Rogue of the White Rose is not exactly the ideal class to take one a paladin such as Aal, so any help that I could get would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
I'll get you one day Aal  /Clannfhearghuis gu brath  (that is the Ferguson Clan war cry, not a clue what it means) <p><br>

He is a pathetic little worm who would be forced to lick my boots in groveling defeat if he was even worth my time to bother to find and kill.<br>
<br>
Will add a little to what Splos said, I assume you are asking for advice on dueling with your warrior. I will concentrate on melee vs melee duels, as caster vs melee duels usually end up just as a contest to see if the melee can catch the caster running around.<br>
<br>
While Splos is correct in what he said about many factors besides player skill coming into factor in determining the winner, it is my belief that dueling is probably the thing in game MOST effected by player skill, with the possible exception of pulling. I can and have beaten others with higher levels, better gear, and better computers, simply because I simply had a clue and they did not. <br>
<br>
Dueling however requires a different mindset then what is needed for PvE. Thats how come non-duelers often get defeated so easily by experienced ones, even if the non-duelers have better equip. <br>
<br>
Fundamental rules:<br>
<br>
1. Know what you are fighting. What can this class do? What would you do win the fight if you played this class? How do you counter it? If you are facing a casting class, put on resist gear to counter their spells if you can. Paladins are formidible if they are allowed to blind you and stun you, so trading tanking gear for MR gear when fighting them is important.<br>
<br>
2. What can you do? What special abilities does your class have that gives it an edge? Post 50 every class has something that could really whoop on someone if its used right, figure out how to use that ability.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you are a dual wielding class, throw away those one handers and get a big freaken sword or staff when you want to duel. If I had a nickel for every monk or ranger that gloated to me before our duel about how they will outdamage me three ways from Sunday with their dual wield, who ended up eating dirt with me barely hurt, I would have, well maybe a dollar, but thats still 20 nickels! Use a big two hander to &quot;joust&quot; your melee opponent. Head towards them, and when you get close enough to hit, turn autoattack on to swipe at them, then back off until autoattack refreshes and go again. For anyone unprepared for it, it totally rocks their world, and usually ends up with them cursing you for &quot;being lame&quot;, usually while they are eating your sword (and their words, hehe).<br>
<br>
And finally, as Splos said, you gotta practice. Gotta challenge people that you know will kill you, learn how to fight. When you fight at a disadvantage, then you get good. Eventually very good. Good enough to give anyone, even a nicely equipped character, a run for their money. <p><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/pbakas/mikel_sig2.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/umikelmorbidus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mikel Morbidus</A> at: 3/29/02 12:32:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uferguson41.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ferguson41</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Random EQ Addict</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/29/02 8:11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=613.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ferguson.freewebspace.com/FERG.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about dueling</span><hr size=1> I'm suprised that post has been up for as long as it has and Aal has not posted. <br>

<br>
I can tell you one thing, beating someone like Mikel or Splos in a duel may be a great feat, but winning a duel proves only that you bettered that person on that occasion, not that you are better than that person. Never am I better than anyone else, no matter how many times I defeat them in mortal combat. Well..semi-mortal.<br>
<br>
Splos, I only wish you were still around to teach me still, I would love to practice with you.<br>
<br>
Mikel, if ever you and I are on at the same time, and you'd like to practice, give me a hollar, I'd love to play around a bit to see what you are like in a battle.<br>
<br>
Ferguson..you're never going to beat me, without me, you're nothing, literally, I own everything on you... /cackle Oh wait..that just means that I /own you. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52938"> My Equipment</a>

His post is quite informative and said much of what I would have added myself had I not already rambled on incessantly heehee.  I think the differences between our positions concerning the skill factor have more to do with semantics than substance.  He is quite right in my opinion in every regard hehe.<br>
<br>
I also think Aal's post was excellent.  The main thing everyone needs is practice.  As I have said, and Mikel eloquently stated too, we both became duelers of prowess because we did the work it takes.  You have to be willing to take on those who are higher level than you, and it doesn't hurt to challenge someone with better gear.  If you can hone your skills to a degree that enables you to compete with such opponents, then you will accomplish what Mikel talked about.<br>
<br>
In the end though, remember as Aal said that winning or losing a duel doesn't really mean much more than the ball bounced your way that given time hehe.  Those who have the best skills, as Mikel points out with great effectiveness, will end up winning a lot more than they lose.  That is how you separate and distiniguish yourself as one who is challenging to face.  Never get so cocky that you don't believe anyone can lose to anyone else at any given time.<br>

By the time he's done debuffing you, you're weapons with 20 delay would have about 80, you'd have -50 MR, and his pet would have killed you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as killing the lot of us, I have never fought a 60 chanter, and I lack huge offensive attacks but could stand with you for a long time. (assuming I'm slow'd) What it comes down to, as splos said, how much time do you get to buff yourself and your pet? If we both started the fight with full mana, but buffless, and petless, I don't think you'd last long Lyth, you just don't have the hp. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Eat Mike's HT, or advanced HT which he might have now, and you'd be at 25% hp before you started..heh <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52938"> My Equipment</a>
