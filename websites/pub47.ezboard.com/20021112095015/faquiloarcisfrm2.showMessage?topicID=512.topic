Lawful Evil Dwarf Fighter Bard<br>
<br>
Alignment:<br>
Lawful Evil characters believe that a nice, orderly system of life is perfect for them to abuse for their own advancement. They will work within 'the system' to get the best that they can for themselves.<br>
<br>
Race:<br>
Dwarves are short and stout, and easily recognizable by their well-cared-for beards. They are hard workers, and adept at stonework and engineering. They tend to live apart from other races; generally in deep, underground excavated systems, and as such tend to be distant from other races.<br>
<br>
Primary Class:<br>
Fighters are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.<br>
<br>
Secondary Class:<br>
Bards are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.<br>

<br>
Alignment:<br>
Lawful Good characters are the epitome of all that is just and good. They believe in order and governments that work for the benefit of all, and generally do not mind doing direct work to further their beliefs.<br>
<br>
Race:<br>
Half-Elves are a cross between a human and an elf. They are smaller, like their elven ancestors, but have a much shorter lifespan. They are sometimes looked down upon as half-breeds, but this is rare. They have both the curious drive of humans and the patience of elves.<br>
<br>
Primary Class:<br>
Fighters are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.<br>
<br>
Secondary Class:<br>
Paladins are the Holy Warriors. They have been chosen by a God/dess to be their representative on Earth, and must follow the code of that deity, or risk severe penalties. They tend towards being righteous, but not generally to excess.<br>

This matches exactly my character I've had in D&amp;D for almost 15 years hehe except he was a human.  I don't know where the elf thing came in, but it matters not hehe it's close enough.  Of course he isn't in any way a druid, but it makes sense to me if I was to be a secondary class that it would be a druid hehe.<br>
<br>
Man I have had some amazingly fun times with my character.  His name is Stewart Blaze and he has been 18th level for about 10 years now LOL.  Splos was largely adapted from the story I made up for Stewart long ago.  Since there weren't Monks available in the 2nd edition, I made my next favorite class, which is Ranger.  Perhaps that is why I always rplayed Splos as someone who had an intense love for nature and for the rangers and druids who are closest to it hehe.  It's also why he was great friends with Tunare 8P.  Monk is my favorite, but being a Ranger sure is neat and fun too hehe.<br>

<br>
Alignment:<br>
Chaotic Neutral characters are unstable, and frequently insane. They believe in disorder first and foremost, and will thus strive for that disorder in everything they do. This means that they will do whatever seems 'fun' or 'novel' at any given time.<br>
<br>
Race:<br>
Elves are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.<br>
<br>
Primary Class:<br>
Fighters are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.<br>
<br>
Secondary Class:<br>
Mages harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.<br>
