I am currently number 59 on the list and wouldn't expect my turn to come up for several months, at the very least. I'm not sure if PoKS can take down Ragefire or not at this time. No offense, I just haven't gotten familiar enough with the guild yet. From looking at the recent postings on MT boards, Ragefire is a very hot issue at the moment and may break into total FFA at any time. There are some 75 clerics on the list as of today and we're all only in need of this one spawn. It's a very hotly contested debate and right now the rules are being rewritten. I will keep us updated as I get new info worth posting. My main point for posting was to let the officers know of my status, in order for them to contact the rotation moderators as PoKS is not currently on of the guilds listed as Ragefire capable.<br>

I know this is a new server to me and all, with new rule, but this is just stupid. Why should a perfectly capable guild be held back because 59 other people said they get to go first. On CT it was FCFS. The first guild to get 18 people ready to engage could claim the camp. This forced guilds to actively camp the area and hope to get him. Im not 100% on how things work now that he is in SF and not naggys lair (i was on vacation when it all changed) but 59 peeps is a long ass time to wait for a clicker. Just plain retarded and something should be done ASAP. I think the spawn should be changed to where RF is a triggered spawn. Just like a thousand other spawns for everyone elses epics. I think of Lhranc, Trakanon, Jaeil The Insane, Dark Elf Corruptor, and countless other TRIGGERED spawns. This is 100% BS! <p>______________________<BR><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=161292" target="_blank">Hajime's Junk</a><BR><BR>Jealousy is all apart of being inferior......Just go with it!!<BR><BR>Hajime Saito<BR>50th Wood Elven Ranger<BR><BR>Dragantis Xy`Rath<BR>55th Iksarian Revenant (RET)<BR><BR>Daliandra<BR>

There are 100+ pages of posts on the Rotations board on the MT community forum website for people to get into that.  Nothing that's been mentioned here is new or hasn't already been discussed, so if anyone is truly interested in seeing what's been said check it out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Just for a little background information ONLY:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(1)  There is a list for Ragefire.  Once you have done your epic up until Ragefire (that means every other step), you get added to the list.  Currently there are 73 people on the list.  I'm at #72 and Boraf is at #58 now I believe.  What that means is, 57 people got to this stage before Boraf did, and as such, 57 people should theoretically get their epic before him.<br>
<br>
(2)  Ragefire spawns every 3-7 days normally and every 3 days or so after a server outtage or patch.<br>
<br>
(3)  When he spawns, the #1 cleric on the list has 3 hours in which to gather his/her forces and Kill Ragefire.  If Ragefire is not killed by the #1 cleric within the 3-hour time frame, Ragefire becomes FFA <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WITH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the following stipulation:<br>
<br>
a)  The highest listed cleric with the forces sufficient to kill Ragefire <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is ready to engage, i.e. finished buffing prior to the 3-hour mark, gets the first crack at Ragefire.<br>
<br>
b)  This is not a true FFA, but it's FFA in the sense that it is advantageous for the top 20+ clerics to watch and camp Ragefire once they hit those top spots, because since Ragefire can spawn any time of the day or night, only those who are diligently camping him (as you indicated it should be) are those who may get the chance at him - if the #1 cleric doesn't take him down.  This speaks directly to the FFA and due diligence camping aspects.<br>
<br>
c)  If the #1 cleric does not kill Ragefire, they remain at the #1 spot until they kill him.  However, no Ragefire spawn goes unused; every spawn goes to some cleric, thereby moving the list for all those who joined the list after the one who gets the loot.<br>
<br>
(4)  The bottleneck with Ragefire is not because of the length of his random spawn timer, but rather because the cleric epic became extremely popular in the last few months and approximately 30 people or so have been added to the list in that time frame - this is the backlog.<br>
<br>
***<br>
MT (claims to be) is more civil and more respectful than many other servers.  You will not find a lot of PnP GM calls here.  <br>
<br>
The rotation thing was something set up a long time ago - and a vote was just taken in the past month whether guilds/clerics wanted to keep a list or go FFA.  Overwhelming, people wanted to keep the list.  One reason was there were already 70 people on the list and to go FFA without letting them take their turn on the list would be disrespectful to those who already had done their epic up to that point.  Regardless, the decision was to keep the list (and not to keep the list just until those 70peps got their epic then go FFA after that).<br>
<br>
Another vote was taken that ended on May 25th - whether, after the 3-hour mark for Cleric #1, it should go completely FFA, go FFA but give first shot to the highest cleric on the list and a third option.  Overwhelmingly, the vote was not total FFA - it was to defer to the highest cleric on the list.<br>
Another reason is to maintain order through the list.  With the list, only those clerics ready for their epic (i.e. done EVERY other step up until killing Ragefire and the final turn-ins) can kill Ragefire.  If it went FFA, people would not necessarily get their epics faster, some would, some would not.  It would, however, allow non Ragefire-ready clerics a chance to kill him and get a piece ahead of those ready for the final kill and who have been on the list.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is on a list, Trak and VS are on rotations, all planes and Chardok nobles are on a calendar system (all supported by the MT server not Verant).  All other mobs are FFA!<br>
<br>
***<br>
Changing him to a triggered spawn and making him harder would be something I could back (as if I actually got a say in it hehe and it wasn't done until those on the list have done their turn in), but making him FFA I will NEVER NEVER vote for or advocate.<br>
<br>
For this server, the list needs to be in place and maintained as is (at least at the current time)!<br>
<br>
***<br>
The mobs you mentiond below are not the bottleneck for any of those epics.  Each epic has a bottleneck, and Ragefire just happens to be the bottle neck for clerics, but again, more because of the popularity of the epic than the mob itself.  A 3-7 day spawn is very typical of epic mobs, the epic piece is always dropped (unlike many epic encounters - Mage, Wiz, Rogue, Enc, etc.) and every time the mob spawns, he dies quickly.<br>

As always, you've been able to sift through the ocean of &quot;information&quot; that's been posted regarding this highly controversial topic. You've managed to distill it down to the essentials of the topic and done a great job of passing this info on to others.<br>
<br>
/salute Crystilla   yer da mostest!<br>
<br>
FYI fer the rest of us...<br>
<br>
I'm not entering into the debate at all on either side, in this forum. My viewpoints on Ragefire have been made public on the MT boards.<br>
<br>
As far as expecting a cleric epic for the guild, don't hold yer breath. Not to be a party pooper, but it's gonna be well over 6 months, prolly closer to a year before I get my shot at him. I just don't want folks gettin too impatient over this, because waiting is not nearly filled, and there isn't a whole lot I or anyone can do to change that. Only things I see speedin up getting a cleric with an epic is through recruiting one higher on the list than myself, or already in possession of the epic. Stranger things have happened, I will give you that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Who knows, mebbe we get lucky, and Crystilla or I will just happen to be the highest listed cleric in the zone during a kill.<br>
<br>
Until then, I have a great idea...  Don't die and everything will be fine.<br>
