<br>
Last night there was a question asked in guild chat about duel wielding.<br>
<br>
Having just started a duel wielding class for the very first time 2 months ago, I have read probably 200-300 articles on the subject and I am going to summerize what I have seen for you now.<br>
<br>
First off I have to thank Grune for killing off one big misconseption about duel wielding for me.That is the topic of off-hand weapon delay. You see I was ALWAYS told that off-hand weapon delay doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
WRONG!<br>
<br>
Off-hand wapon delay plays a HUGE factor in overall damage per second ( dps ).<br>
<br>
When you have successfully had an off-hand &quot;check&quot; the game restarts the counter to again have an off-hand check.<br>
<br>
By &quot;check&quot; I mean that the game has attempted to do an off-hand attack successful or not.<br>
<br>
Now think about this for a second:<br>
<br>
You have two weapons that can be equipped off-hand. One has a delay of 30 and a damage of 15, the other has a 20 delay and a damage of 10. The 15/30 has the same ratio as a 10/20 , but you would be surprised how many people will take the 15 damage over the 10 damage because they mistakingly believe that they will do more damage with it in the secondary slot.<br>
<br>
It's all about ratio! Thats it thats all, ratio is your new best friend, the one that makes ya smile when you reach under the covers and....um NM...thats a different story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The faster the game does a offhand check, the faster you swing your offhand weapon again.This does wonders for raising your duel weild skill too.<br>
<br>
By level 50 you have swung that 30 delay offhand weapon a few thousand times, you would have had 40-50% more secondary swing checks with the 20 delay. <br>
<br>
When you add in all the blocks, ripostes and dodges etc that mobs do, you will do 10-20% more dps by keeping the delay low along with a great ratio.<br>
<br>
If the delay is 20 the internal timer of EQ starts to count off as soon as the swing is complete to then have another offhand swing and so on.<br>
<br>
The best weapon to have in your primary slot will be the one where the weapons damage is closest to it's delay and that weapon having a low delay.<br>
<br>
Primary a 5/10 weapon will destroy a 10/20 weapon in overall dps because it's damage bonus is applied more often.<br>
<br>
Damage bonus doesn't apply to an offhand weapon.<br>
<br>
The question last night was a general one:<br>
<br>
Do I put a high damage weapon in my offhand?<br>
<br>
Most replies were Yes.<br>
<br>
My reply was that you put a weapon with a great ratio offhand and once you find a ratio you can afford , keep the delay low as well.<br>
<br>
Big numbers impress,fast attacks will do more damage overall.<br>
<br>
2handers are a different story all together, they are the best dps you will do in the game if your skill is equal and you have a great ratio.<br>
<br>
Unless you are a rogue or if you are a warrior trying to keep aggro by using two weapons with procs to maintain aggro, you should be using a two hander anyways.<br>
<br>
The results can be found on the ranger and monk boards concerning two hand weapons, they are in and you can get some huge dps numbers by using them.<br>
<br>
As a beastlord I don't have the same 2HB skill as I do with H2H, so it is different for my class, but if you are a monk or ranger......GET A 2 HANDER!<br>
<br>
If you need to duel weild get a good ratio.....screw the numbers that impress the noobs.<br>

<br>
While ratio is the primary determinant for offhand weapon choice, it should not be the only. Yes, a 10/20 may do slightly more dps than a 15/30 over a long period of time (10-20% seems significantly high, but I'm not a parser and haven't seen the data of anyone who is *shrug* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). But other factors play a role. <br>
<br>
- Auxilliary stats - I'm currently using a 14/24 weapon in my offhand. I had the opportunity to use and possibly buy a 13/22, which has a 0.02 better ratio (1.69 v my current 1.71). However I chose to keep the 14/24 because of what came with it. With the Tae Ew Dagger, I get 50hps and 7 poi and dis resists (especially key for CT fighting, but useful many other places).  With the Bile Drenched Main Gauche, I'd have 2 more atk (2 more str) and 10 dex, but it's the 50hps that will keep me alive longer and is more useful (at least for me).<br>
- Procs<br>
- DELAY - Yes, a smaller ratio will allow for slightly higher damage potential when comparing weapons with the same ratio. However, for every swing you make, you increase your aggro against your target. For MA's, this is crucial and the reason many tanks will take the faster weapons over others. But for any class that prefers little to no aggro *wave*, good ratio with higher delay is better.  It's the reason LSoEE has sold so consistently well for so long, it's a weapon with a minimum ratio of 1.813, which is very decent, but it has a high delay, which makes it ideal for rangers and rogues and anyone else who wants as little attention as possible.<br>
<br>
Still a valid post and some points worthy of keeping in mind.

I started EQ with a rogue, and read A LOT about melee topics during that time, then switched to all casters, and came back to a rogue with Rumbl.  <br>
<br>
I agree with a lot of the info you found, but here are some points:<br>
<br>
Of course, delay is essential.  It might seem obvious to most that you want the highest damage for the lowest delay (Most &quot;bang&quot; for your &quot;buck&quot;).  This is the concept behind everyone wanting haste items/spells.  More swings = more potential to hit = more damage.  <br>
<br>
When training dual weild, you want THE fastest delay you can find for your off hand.  Skill ups can occur each time your dual wield skill is triggered.  In combat, each time your off hand weapon is set to trigger, you make a dual wield check. If you pass (based on several factors, largest of which is dual wield skill), then you swing the weapon.  At that point, you make a hit check based mostly on your weapon skill.  So you need to pass 2 hurdles to even hit with your off hand weapon.  The lower the delay, the more chances your have to make dual weild checks and hit checks, and the more often you'll have a chance to up these skills.  <br>
<br>
As your skill in dual wield and a particular weapon maxxes out, though, you will fall into line with your main hand weapon and low delay is not AS important.  I don't miss very often with my off hand, and now actually double hit with my off hand.  Of course as a rogue, I have to switch in a higher delay weapon often to contral agro -- but that's not the issue here.  I've had my damage parsed with same ratio weapons (no other bonuses or effects), one with higher damage, higher delay and one with lower damage lower delay, in my off hand.  DPS was greater with the higher damage weapon.  This surprised me, but in looking at the log you can see why.  I didn't always hit max damage with the lower damage weapon but was often hitting max damage with the higher damage weaopon.   Chalk this up to stats, ATK bonus effect, or whatever -- all i know is that i was getting more bang at lvl 53 and 54 with the higher damage (same ratio).  <br>
<br>
Now I don't play a warrior, but I thought that warriors wanted the higher damage weapon main hand (for more benefit from the damage bonus) and highest delay from off hand weapon.  That's what some have told me, but on this I'm not sure.  <br>
<br>
2 handers are great for doing damage and not taking as much agro.  I had a 2hand piercer for while, but they nerfed it and took rogue off the list of usable classes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=106265"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Rumbl Ragebringer</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color: red;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I piss in your general direction&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->54 Rake<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer-Fists of Justice</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/bblackburrowstoutco13800.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grunemoonprowler>GruneMoonProwler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/03 2:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Regarding duel wield</span><hr size=1> Having played a rogue and a warrior I can tell you that they are very different when it comes to weapon choice for a particular hand.<br>
<br>
For a warrior who wants to hold agro, you want the lowest delay weapon in your main hand.  The more times you hit the more agro you generate.  (procs and over all damage not withstanding)<br>
<br>
Since we were so over powered last night in Kael, I had the oportunity to play around with different weapons in different hands.<br>
<br>
My damage seemed to go way up when I put my SBoZ which has a delay of 18, in my off hand and had the Frostbriger in my main hand.<br>
<br>
Having the delay of 18 in the offhand caused my double attacks and quads WAY up.  I hadnt' been doing that when I've been duoing with Berak.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say I picked up a higher damage weapon for my main hand when I'm not worrying about keeping agro.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
