<br>
It is my understanding that recently some officers were stripped of officer status.  My questions are:<br>
<br>
1) What was the process that preceeded this removal?<br>
2) How are the steps of this process documented (and where)?<br>
3) Which of the remaining officers were involved in this decision?<br>
4) What were/was the reason(s) for this purge?<br>
5) Why has nothing been said to the Guild at large after it happened?<br>
I would think that something pretty awful had to have happened for this to come to pass. As a long-time guild member I think it is my (and all of the guild's) right to know the details.<br>
I would like to appologize in advance if I am mistaken in this matter, but given the &quot;Goodbye&quot; posts of late, I dont think I am.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

I agree that not only would this be out of character for the governing body of this guild (the officers), but I would also propose that it would be contrary to all of the other above board, fairness-based policies we tend to pride ourselves as having (at least I do, anyway).<br>
<br>
Hikmer- Thanks for your opinion, Hik, but if this secret purge DID happen, I refuse to further hide things from my guildmates by getting some *private* explanation.  Our guild leaders are some of the nicest people I have had the pleasure and honor of knowing (some in RL), but they lead only because we (the guild general membership) *allow* them to lead.  If major decisions are only made &quot;in-game&quot; w/o any sort of general announcement that this is happening, then we have a problem.  I would liken it to only being able to vote for president if you *happen* be at the polling booth at 3AM next tuesday (oh, and BTW... No one actually TOLD you it was going to occur then).<br>
If this demotion of officers occured (and I am still hoping that it didnt), I would like to be the first to step up and volunteer to assist in the creation of explicit procedures that would govern future possibilities of this nature (ie 1st warning and consequences, 2nd Warning...etc).  I would also encourage other rank and file guildmates to step forward and do likewise.  <br>
<br>
If this guild is based on fairness and fun (like it was originally chartered to be) then it is EVERYONE'S responsibility step forward and speak their mind *in public* and voice their concerns.  I am not thumbing my nose at the Guild Leadership.  Quite the contrary.  I am hoping that by me saying, &quot;If this happened, I think it is very wrong&quot; that they can govern the guild better.  (You dont know how happy I will be if someone involved says &quot;This didnt happen the way you feared&quot;).<br>
BBSCO forever!<br>

If you have an alt that I play with on a continual basis, then I may have different feeling toward this.  But just starting rumors and accusations on our site without asking the leadership before hand seems a bit hasty.  I wasn't suggesting a secret answer, but perhaps more of a question to the leadership that is a bit more discreet.  If the issue is not addressed then perhaps a general post on our guild site.  I do not wish to cause bad blood between anyone, but I just request a little sensitivity on an open post that anyone can read.  <br>
<br>
Maybe we should have a memebers only section of our site for these kinds of posts.  I just hate to put up our dirty laundry for all to read, when it may or may not be true.<br>

<br>
As for you not knowing me (not sure why this makes a difference) you have not only grouped with Eariel but you have grouped with my Alt Jorg... Having a senior moment, Hik?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   BTW... While I wouldn't necessarily call myself a &quot;founding member&quot; of the guild (like Pow and Nambic would be), but I was definitely one of the first they recruited after the Guild started (I know many of the &quot;old timers&quot; in RL).  I'll let you read between the lines on not only my time-in-guild but also the question of whether I am talking about &quot;rumors&quot; or not.<br>
<br>
As for non-Guildies snooping these posts (apart from the obvious &quot;Get a life&quot; statement I would have for them)... maybe they can learn how a Guild continues to work towards fairness to better itself and can become a better place for its members by communicating in the open.<br>

<br>
I am not speaking for Avallyn, i am just speaking for myself, as a member of the guild who happens to be an officer.<br>
<br>
I don't see the problem. Avallyn is guild leader. She does have the right to demote officers as needed. As she has the right to promote officers.<br>
<br>
This isn't really a democracy. Yes some things are voted on, some things aren't. Some things are kept a little quiet just so folks can go on enjoying the game and not get sucked into the drama. This is a game. Ava tries to run the guild smoothly and to keep morale up. I think she does a great job. I also think she knows more of what's going on than other's do and she makes decisions based on that.<br>
<br>
If all the dirty laundry and decision making was to be aired and voted on by everyone there would be no reason for a password to the officers forums.<br>
<br>
Some folks have decided to move on to other guilds, some folks have decided to stay with us. Lots of us have been on a leveling streak and are getting into our 50s ready to do some damage. Lets all stick together and keep this guild strong and rolling into our high 50s and 60.<br>

<br>
Yes, there have been recent changes within the officer ranks.   Those involved wished the events to not be publicised, hence the non-public post.  However, since the topic has now been brought up in front of everyone, here are the details:<br>
<br>
The officers that were reduced in rank were no longer involved in day to day guild activities and officer responsibilities.  Some were wondering why they were still an officer and one even stated that they no longer wanted to be an officer.  And yes, there were a couple that expressed very strong emotions over this decision.<br>
<br>
In order to not force members and other officers to, in effect, choose sides, a vote was not offered.  <br>
<br>
Regarding the issue of recent members saying goodbye, they have all talked with me and have expressed the desire to move on and meet other friends that were doing more of the &quot;end game&quot; raids.  One of the recently departed joined a guild that is strongly in to tradeskills and I think this is wonderful.  Everyone that has left the guild knows that they are welcome to come back at anytime and are more than welcome to attend any of our open raids. We are still family and all involved know this.  I know many of them in RL in we are all still very good friends.<br>
<br>
The remaining officers and I want to continue to maintain the family we have now. We have many members now reaching their 50's and some that are beginning to work on their epics.  With the guild alliance we have established with FoJ, we are now able to move in to higher zones that may have been very hard for us to break in to and can now focus on more of the higher mobs, ie. Naggy, Vox, and plane raids.  Yes, we have our first plane raid scheduled!!  (see posts in raids/events).<br>
<br>
If any members or someone outside the guild reading this, has questions about anything I've said here, please don't hesitate to respond to this post.  If you prefer to email me, my email address is xev_avallyn@hotmail.com.  <br>

<br>
Thanks so much for replying.  I was wondering if you could speak to the numbered questions of my orginal post?  While you partially answered one or two of them, my core concerns are still there.  I think explicitly answering these questions will go a long way towards explaining what went on *prior* to all of these demotions.  <br>
<br>
I promise I am not trying to bust anyone's chops on this.  I just want to know for myself, if I should ever start the long task of becoming an officer, and anyone else thinking of trying, what it would take to get this kind of demotion and whether or not I would be entitled to any sort of due process (ie. warnings, rules explicitly stating what I have to do as an officer...etc).  I think these are reasonable questions.<br>

These officer guidelines have been re-inforced many times in discussions amongst the officers.  I'll leave the details to Ava if she chooses to disclose them in public.  Please respect those demoted officers who have requested that this be kept on the down low. As Gnip said, nobody wants to stir up the guild.<br>

In the end, the entire officer structure will be revamped before we bring others on.  Once it is straightened out, we will post it for all. <p><center>

<br>
2) How are the steps of this process documented (and where)?<br>
<br>
The officer guidelines have been posted and discussed many times on the officer board.  Each officer knows his/her duties and what is required to be an officer.  The requirements for being an officer are posted on our guild website and indicate that some actions must be continued to maintain that status.  Please note that the requirements for an officer will be changing and are currently being reviewed by myself and the officers.<br>

3) Which of the remaining officers were involved in this decision?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In order to not force members and other officers to, in effect, choose sides, a vote was not offered. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
To add to this, it would not be fair for me to publicly state each officer's name in the public forum.  If they would like to state their support, they are free to do so.   Please note that as is any society, not all changes or decisions made by the leadership can be made public.<br>
<br>
4) What were/was the reason(s) for this purge?<br>
<br>
See answer to #2.<br>
<br>
5) Why has nothing been said to the Guild at large after it happened?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Those involved wished the events to not be publicised, hence the non-public post. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
We are also in the midst of updating the officer responsibilities and the steps taken for members to become officers.  While these changes are going on, we wanted to wait until everything was in place to announce the changes to the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
I hope that clears up any remaining questions you may have Eariel.  If not, I will continue to try and answer them to the best of my ability.  Please be aware that anyone that has any questions is free to send me a tell in game or email me at xev_avallyn@hotmail.com.  I'm more than happy to spend time discussing anything you'd like to talk about.<br>

In the time I've been with BBSCo I have never known the leadership to do anything that would be prejudicial to our guild or the guidelines that the leaders created.  All that I have had the priviledge to play EQ with have all been honest and hardworking players who have put the good name of BlackBurrow Stout Company ahead of their own needs.  I joined the guild at the urging of GnipGnop, who I have been playing EQ with since I started playing EQ in may of 2001 and have not second guessed my choice to be a &quot;stouter&quot; since.  Once again, the BBSCo has my backing and I know that the decision was made in the best interest of the guild.<br>

If you are not an officer and not in the decision making process, maybe that is a good thing.<br>
You keep kicking the same dog over and over again.  Maybe there is a reason the leadership chose not to address the issue with just anyone.<br>
Sounds to me like the appropriate people discussed the issue and it is done and over.  If the folks who were removed as officers chose not to have this made public... why are you trying so hard to make it so?<br>
<br>
If you are not the leader or an officer... this issue does not concern you.<br>
People move on to other guilds in this game daily so what is the big deal?<br>
<br>
I feel that Ava have explained the issue fully.<br>
