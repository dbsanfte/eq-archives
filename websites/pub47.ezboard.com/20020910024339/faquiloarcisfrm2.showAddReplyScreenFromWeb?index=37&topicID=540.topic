Hmmm hehe need another story to make this belong here I suppose LOL.  I remember dueling TyberTank at a picnic one night hehe.  He was level 56 or so and I was level 52 or 53 I forget which hehe (I went back &amp; forth so much it's hard to remember HAH).  Anyway hehe, I remember he danced all around &amp; did all this crazy stuff and cast all these spells &amp; neat things hehe.  He was really quite a sight.  The boy could dance quite well I must say hehe.  But, after I grew tired of watching him prance around I smited him down quickly &amp; he grumbled something about getting me next time hehe.  He fought with great skill and much honor, but he always hated the fact that all his prancing around never seemed to get him anywhere with me 8P.  He always exclaimed that he liked girlies hehe, but his actions toward me left me in doubt GRIN.<br>

<br>
Sooth I remember much most of it from the very begining of days when Norrath was young, when the boat captains knew little of how to travel the seas, I remember then as now and so shall I speak of what I know.<br>
<br>
I remember when lands first called and woke my eyes from the skys of wonder.  The city of freeport bustling and busy.  I learned to hold sword and carry song there, until the day I walked off into the lands some fool called east and common.  Aye common they were to Griffon wonder, alas non then knew how tame such a beast, nor had gift to do it.  Once in the darkness of the night so afeared was I an others that we did route from justice upon orcan evil that in every direction did partake.  When in final safety I though myself to find twas in trueth and eerie site, for it glowed in moonlight with sickly white and bone pale walls a tavern from a time long past twas then I saw the plagues dark warning and yet movement did I see slowly then upon the roof in sick transfiction did I remain as slowly marks of yellow and of black did grow upon the sickly roof indeed what there to see that which of all things became my bane..... upon the witching hour a spider as large as I and twice then my humble power and with song aided by dragon did I flee for I knew not then nor did any other if it might pounce upon its supper.<br>
<br>

<br>
As far as duelling goes..I could never defeat splos in a duel. Nor would I if skill and luck were on my side. It's just never been something I saw as a feat. For me, it would be like killing my own father, now, perhaps if I were a rogue (glares at Jordinn) this would be a great feat..but as a Knight who learned so much, I would stand with weapon in hand, but never would I swing at him.<br>
<br>
However, my duelling skills have raised a great deal over the last few months. I find myself with the protection of a warrior, the spells of the cleric, and the damage (when jousting) that only a Paladin can put out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Though it has been a very long time since I have seen Sir Tybertank, I believe his skills have grown very strong in the past months. Still with all his skills, Splos would defeat him. I have no doubt in my mind.<br>
<br>
However..Splos, where I shall defeat you is on the course of champions, where the fairways are narrow, greens firm, land dry, and skies clear. This is my true place of greatness. Face me if you dare. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://jennymarie.freewebspace.com/aal-new-sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ustorrme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Storrme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch!</span><br>  Posts: 801<br> <font color=#ffff00>(3/12/02 12:56:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/faquiloarcisfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.slip.net/~mehudson/pics2/Storrme.gif width=46 height=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Memories of a time long past</span><hr size=1> I Shall tell you a tale of a long ago time in a very strange land...<br>
<br>
<br>
Slarena (my best friend) and I had grown up together and traveled the world of norrath side by side. One day we noticed some new docks being built we were very curious at this new development so we waited until they were finished and took the very first ride on the shuttles to this new land the sailors called kunark. At the time Slarena and I had only seen 30 or so seasons under the instruction of our guildmasters, we caught the boat in the middle of Timorus Deep and watched as the Shuttles went back to Butcher block. The Boat itself was amazing more beautiful than any other boat we had ever seen and it sailed so swiftly at times that you couldnt see the islands you were passing. When we arrived at the Docks in Firona Vie, the new outpost on Kunark, we walked about the city a bit trying to soak all the splendor in the place was so wonderful and buildings so different we were in awe and wonder.<br>
<br>
Shortly after arriving we met up with a few other adventures and decided to venture beyond the city gates which we were told that we were crazy that there were dangerous creatures about, we took caution and carefuly found a place to sit and chat while we took out creatures that might threaten the city.<br>
<br>
On of these people we had met was Suddyn she was a very soft spoken elven Druidess, another was Vestas a dashing swave half elven Rogue, who always seemd to have his eye on the ladies more than the creatures I belive he wished to steal thier hearts... Truth be told he was very handsome even if his armor was more mismatched than a Dwarf and a Highelf standing together.<br>
<br>
After some time we started feeling more confidant in our ablitys as a team and decided to venture forth to new lands again we decided to meet up the next day after rest and food and venture to the place of the giants called Frontier mountains. The next day we met up but some of the team didnt show it was only Slarena, Vestas and I. We talked and decided that we were strong enough we could go anyway so we did, we had a great time running and laughing and vestas with his charming personality tried to swoon both ladies and giants into droping thier armor for him *Grin*<br>
<br>
This was one of our First adventures in Kunark and it is something that was both scary and exciting all in the same I hope you enjoyed the little tale maybe ill write more later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I lived in Florida all my life until just over a year ago.  My wife and I moved to Atlanta hehe.  I lived in Gainesville for the last 10 years.  My wife and I went to school at UF, and ended up staying in Gainesville because we loved it so much hehe.  I have been to Clearwater more times than I can count hehe.  I love the Clearwater area, and I'm sure you are quite familiar with many of the surrounding areas I have been to often.  Crystal River, Homosassa Springs, Tarpon Springs, Tampa of course, Largo, Brandon, St. Pete and so on hehe.  I love the MOSI there in Tampa &amp; Busch Gardens is always fun too.  I think the place my wife likes most though is the big mall in Brandon HAH.  I've been there countless times hehe.  There is also a great Prime Rib place called Jessie's in Brandon that we like very much.  It's so neat that you live there YAY <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
