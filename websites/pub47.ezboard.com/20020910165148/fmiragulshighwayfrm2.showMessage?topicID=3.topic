Not necessarily Highway-related, but ... (?)</span><hr size=1> Well I read the thread on the safehouse and immediately went to check this out.  I first tried sitting, ducking, camping, etc. at the entrance to the mystery tunnel near the wretched firepot.  No luck, I could only get a glimpse of the tunnel entrance as I sat down.<br><br>Then I started wandering around trying to find the spot where the screenshot I saw was taken.  Managed to discover the exact location that the screenshot was taken at, but of course that didn't help me much as I'd already seen the screenshot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I tried casting both Eye of Zomm and Shadowstep at both locations, hoping that either the eye or me would pop in that corridor.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work that way, the Eye would simply pop in a random location in the zone.  I suspect the problem is that the wall seperating the alcove with the firepot and the tunnel is very thick.  You can see a gap if you look at the screenshot that seems to imply that there's a bit of empty space between the wall and where the tunnel begins.  This is probably why the camping trick doesn't work either (I'm sure you've all had this happen, camp with your face in a wall and when you log back in you can see through that wall and in some cases walk through it).  <br><br>It's an interesting development, to say the least.  I doubt it's highway-related, but still an intriguing mystery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Heh, the funny thing is I always thought that the bridge that leads to the firepot looked like a good &quot;entrance&quot; type area.  <br><br>The thing is, I'm sure that the only reason this spot was found is because of its proximity to the firepot, and the fact that people scour that area looking for clues.  Makes me wonder how many more &quot;hidden passageways&quot; might exist behind walls in other zones that nobody's ever found.  I always wondered what the passageways to Paineel, the Arena and the Warrens looked like before there were zones on the other side.  Were they open but just not connected to the zones in question?  Or were they blocked off with similar walls like this corridor?<br><br>Norrath's a mysterious place... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ulordshadowdragon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord ShadowDragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Aspiring Highwayman</span><br> <font color=#993300>(4/23/02 1:54:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *grins*</span><hr size=1> The Hole and Paineel were blocked by a caved in wall, like some of the other not yet done zones.

I've been in the game a long time, and things sort of blur together. Perhaps it was from back in the day when people were poking into the actual game files. I know a number of extra 'zones' are in the coding, even though zone files don't exist for them. I think the Hole used to be one of those.<br><br>But Think about Neriak. Neriaka is called 'Foreign Quarter' Quarter implies the city is divided into four sections. Somewhere I heard it rumored that Neriakd was the 'Royal Quarter' no doubt where the King and Queen live. I always just guessed this was a fourth zone for the city that they decided to leave our for time and development constraints. Or maybe they couldn't decide on what sort of content to put there. I mean, all the guilds and shops already had their places, plenty of quests in Neriak. And heck, three zones makes it one of the largest cities in existance (tied with Freeport)<br><br>I would love to see it opened some day... Maybe with new quests and the like.

The 2 chapels for example (I say chapel since they have a podium with a face surrounded by laurels and rows of benches)<br><br>Also, there's the building all the way in the back of NeriakC with the reading room as well as some trophies and other things.

There is no way to get to the east of the tunnel--the firepot is north and the dining room south--so that's no help.

I wager something along the lines of an expansion zone one day, or maybe it will never amount to anything.  I know the Hole very well and would be available to guide you.  Sneak/hide can take you through the entire place only if you are Brell aligned unfortunately.  As an alternative you can also you a DA potion before jumping into the Hole from Paineel. You will survive, but there are KOS MOBs at the bottom.  If you are interested in seeing it I can arrange a guild group to cut our way down to the bottom.   <p><a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/bshadowcongress4908"><img src=http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg width=150 height=150 border=0></a>Kaludram Aderlas, Master of Shadows for the <a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/bshadowcongress4908"><i> Shadow Congress </i></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub47.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="miragulshighwayfrm1">Firepot Talk<option value="miragulshighwayfrm2">Other Transports & Mysteries</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/bmiragulshighway>Miragul's Highway</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fmiragulshighwayfrm2>Other Transports & Mysteries</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://Come.To/TheHighway">Lannella's Lair</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript" TYPE="text/javascript" src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads04/ads.txt"></script><noscript><div align="center"><iframe src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads/eznoscript1.htm" frameborder="0" scrolling="No" width="756" height="117" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="border-width:1px; border-color:000000; border-style:solid;"></iframe></div></noscript><!-- END BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
