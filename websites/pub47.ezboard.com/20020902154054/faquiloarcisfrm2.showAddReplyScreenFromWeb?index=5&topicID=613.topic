And before you complain about why I would forsake our brotherly love, young Aalaandro, to help the lady hehe, well my goodness man when she blinks her eyes at you what are you supposed to do HAH!<br>
<br>
In general I will offer some opinions based on my time playing.  Take them for what they are worth, since I am quite sure much has changed since a year ago.<br>
<br>
Dueling between the classes is amusing at best in terms of parity or balance being close enough for the combatants to have an equal chance.  Some classes are better designed to go up against others, and vice versa.  The best example I can think of are melee hybrids.  For a very long time they were thought to be the jokes of all classes in the game (mainly after Kunark was released).  And yet they have always been excellent classes for dueling.  They are just set up well to match up against many other classes.<br>
<br>
There are so many factors that come into play that help determine whether or not you will be successful in a duel.  The vast majority of those factors have absasmurfly nothing to do with your skills as a PVP player hehe.  That is what I always found so amusing.  Anyone who says the quality of your gear doesn't matter is just goofy.  It matters a great deal.  If you cannot see or admit that a monk with a fungi tunic has a dramatic advantage over a monk without one, then it's not worth even having a discussion hehe.<br>
<br>
Even more important I believe is something very simple, and entirely unrelated to your skills or even gear.  Your connection speed says every bit as much and more about what your ultimate capabilities are.  If my connection speed enables me to run circles around you because your connection speed is much slower, well you should get the picture hehe.  Those players at the high end who have the best gear and have honed the best skills are often so equally matched it's ridiculous to claim one person is better than the other.  If everything else is equal, but there is a dramatic disparity in the connection speeds, the fast connection wins.  Period hehe.  Anyone who disputes that just doesn't get it.<br>
<br>
It's also absurd not to realize that random luck has a great deal to do with your success.  If I use Flying Kick and it hits for 3 points, as opposed to 95 points, what explains the difference hehe?  I press the button the same way each time I use that skill hehe.  In other words, the random number generated has nothing to do with skill.  You have no control over whether or not you're going to hit for 3 points or 95 points hehe.  It is that way every single time you cast a spell, land a strike, or use a special skill.  Your skill doesn't determine its effectiveness.  The random number generated by something totally outside of your control does.<br>
<br>
Does skill matter a great deal (especially when most other factors average out to being virtually equal)?  Yeppers it sure does.  Is PVP in EverQuest truly a battle of pure skill, and its outcome based in large part on that aspect?  In my humble opinion not even close hehe.<br>
<br>
So, dueling comes down to fun and experimentation.  Practicing in the arenas against other classes will teach you a great deal.  I was an excellent dueler mainly because I practiced against all other classes and I made it a point to do so against people who were higher level than me.  Many of you know Mikel to be an excellent dueler.  He did the same thing, and it paid off for him big time as he advanced.  Most other people who honed their dueling skills as Mikel and I did I recall being the better duelers I knew.<br>
<br>
Learn which classes you are predisposed to match up well against, and which classes you aren't.  For those you don't match up well against, learn what strategies to employ that may give you a better chance.  In the end, much of what happens will be beyond your control.  The important thing is to develop your skills and strategies, so that what is within your control is of high quality.<br>
<br>
The last thing I will mention is determining what rules you will establish with each given opponent.  I've always thought it absurd that any mana class would take the time to enhance their every ability as much as possible, do the same for their pet if relevant hehe, and then pause to med back to full.  Hmmm gee hehe, let's see here.  Yep that is so completely fair and realistic it's laughable hehe.  I refused to duel people who made that stipulation.  I didn't think it accurately reflected what would represent actual dueling conditions.<br>
<br>
Some people will only duel based on certain criteria.  They have that right hehe.  Those who disagree with my opinion on mana for example have every right to feel that way.  Bottom line is that they weren't ever going to duel me hehe.  At least not do so and then proclaim with any certainty that they are better than me hehe.  Are damage shields agreed to?  Is shadowstepping agreed to?  Are pets agreed to?  How much time is allowed for buffing and such?<br>
<br>
All of these example matter a great deal.  As a pure melee class, if you allow a necro or enchanter or mage to keep trying until they've made the best pet they can make, then allow them to self buff &amp; enhance that pet to maximum, then allow them to med until they are fully powered again, what kind of chance do you think you have hehe?!?  Is it realistic that such activity would take place if a real duel were being established?  It's up to you and your opponent to agree on those terms hehe.  If you allow your ranger foe to self buff with 10 buffs &amp; then at the very end damage shield himself or herself hehe, well the fight is pretty much over before you start.  Is it because you have less skill than the ranger?  Nah hehe.  It's because Verant designed their class one way and yours another.  A class that has limitless damage shield ability vs. a class that doesn't hehe, well do the math.<br>
<br>
I could say more hehe, but I've rambled on long enough.  I will email you with some suggestions for facing paladins GRIN.  I never lost to one, even when they were 4 levels higher than me heehee.  But, a prepared monk matched up well with paladins back in those days, so I had design &amp; luck on my side at the time.  It may be different now.  In any case, for any one class to claim they are the best is foolish.  Anyone can be beaten at any given time.<br>

I just had to say nice post; also I could also use some of those highly coveted tactics against paladins. Since Aal is the one that got me started in the EQ world, and has taught me most of what I know (thanks BTW) I have set it out as a personal quest for me to defeat the Knight Aalaandro in a duel (kind of "the student becomes the teacher" stories).<br>
I dont know just how long this will take me to achieve this goal but is it some thing to strive for. I realize that a Rogue of the White Rose is not exactly the ideal class to take one a paladin such as Aal, so any help that I could get would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
I'll get you one day Aal  /Clannfhearghuis gu brath  (that is the Ferguson Clan war cry, not a clue what it means) <p><br>
Anyone can snap there finger and yank a soul. I prefer to kill creatively.
