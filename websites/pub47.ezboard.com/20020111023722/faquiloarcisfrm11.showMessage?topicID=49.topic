<br>
Who is sponsoring your application to Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
Dolph Seljin<br>
<br>
What made you decide to apply? <br>
I have been in one guild for a while now. We almost never have Raids, when one gets planned it usually falls apart before it starts. If a player needs help with something, there is almost never a response, not even a negative one. Dolph has told me that when he has asked for help from guildmates he has many responses, even if they are negative responses. And He has said that there are numerous raids. I participated in one raid, Plane of Fear, I can't remember the date, And the raid went rather well, it would have gone better but many people kept going Link dead. Dolph has also told me about many times that he has been on raid with Aquilo Di Arcis.<br>
<br>
What guilds were you in previously? Why did you leave? <br>
Clan Darkfire<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I left because all of my friends from college had joined another Guild<br>
House of Serenity<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am currently in this guild. I wish to leave because nobody helps others and there is almost never a response to a call for help.<br>
<br>
What does a guild mean to you? <br>
A Guild is a group of people that can work well together to raid areas in the game and help each other out in getting Items that they are looking for or finishing off quests.<br>
<br>
What do you expect from being a member of Aquilo di Arcis? <br>
A nice environment, nice People and some fun raids to go on.<br>
<br>
What time zone do you live in? <br>
Eastern<br>
<br>
Aquilo di Arcis is currently siding with Dragon faction, are you prepared to join this faction? <br>
I have already started working on My dragon faction, I am currently Kos to dragons and dwarves, because i was working on getting the key from Wakening Lands, however I am going to be working on my dragon faction soon.<br>
<br>
List some Aquilo di Arcis members you have grouped with and describe some of the things the group was up to at the time. <br>
I have grouped with Dolph a number of times, we have killed the seafury cyclopses, and we camped the Ancient cyclops for a while to, Some other people from Aquilo Di Arcis joined us but i can't remember their names off the top of my head. I also went on a fear raid With Aquilo Di Arcis, There were so many people that i didn't catch them.<br>
<br>
Have you had any negative experiences with any of our members? Explain. <br>
Hmm, on the fear raid i died, however that wasn't anybodies fault and I got a rez very quickly.<br>
<br>
Do you have any trade skills? <br>
I have been working on numerous trade skills<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Baking 143<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tailoring 83 (I think)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Brewing 46<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smithing 137<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pottery 112<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alchemy 83 (I think)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fishing 143<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alcohol tolerance 200 (ok maybe not a trade skill, but I can drink well =)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Begging 145 (I was bored and begged my pet for 33 hours straight while waiting for a RARE spawn)<br>
<br>
What is the one item you want most right now? <br>
Hmm, I got my Jaundiced Bone Bracer, I haven't really set my next goal yet, but I think it would have to be a manastone(never gonna get one tho), Emerald Dragon scale tunic, or my epic.<br>
<br>
List some of the keys you have. (Ex: Howling Stones, Veshan's Peak, Cobalt Scar tooth) <br>
I had the tooth for getting ported into Wakening lands, but now that it is no longer needed i destroyed it. other then that I don't Have any of the keys<br>
<br>
How do you feel about twinking? <br>
It can be both a good thing and a bad thing, It can make your new character level really fast, but it can also ruin the experience you need to be able to play the character at higher levels. one thing i have never liked is seeing a level 5 character with the right click effect armor, they can't use it for 40 levels but they wear it any way.<br>
<br>
Where do you normaly hunt? <br>
I have been wandering a lot, Recently i have been in Crystal caverns, East wastes, Dread Lands, Ocean Of Tears, and Karnors<br>
<br>
List some of your closest EQ friends. <br>
Dolph, Kooppa, Venefica, Azzamenya, and Jhenna<br>
<br>
List some of your EQ enemies. <br>
Newbies with better armor then me.<br>
<br>
Describe yourself in one word. <br>
hmm one word? umm &quot;shammy&quot; probly wouldn't count, umm &quot;buffer&quot; would be ok, uh hmmrecently i haven't died to much, so &quot;corpius&quot; doesn't work hmm &quot;soloer&quot; would probly be the best word, tho i do group from time to time, it's just that i can't find a good group where i can get the same xp as i do solo.<br>
<br>
Give us a little history on your main character's life so far. <br>
I have soloed a lot, I have moved from the area outside of Everfrost peaks to Blackburrow, then to Crushbone, Oasis, South Karana, Unrest, Cazic Thule, Overthere,  Rathe Mountains, Iceclad ocean, East Wastes, Crystal caverns, Ocean of tears, Dreadlands, and now I am wandering looking for a good place to stay for a while.<br>
<br>
On a big hunt with a group you loot a monster and find it has a great item no one was expecting. What do you do? <br>
Tell the group wow this thing just dropped XXXX we gonna roll on it?, if it is nodrop i leave it, if it is lootable i will pick it up so nobody wanders by and grabs it.<br>
<br>
You are hunting with your group in a dangerous area. A pull goes bad and the group is suddenly swarmed by mobs. You battle it out for a little while and suddenly the healer dies. With no healer left the person you were counting on to possibly evac you out is now laying dead on the floor as well. You have a near full health bar and your tanks are taking a beating. What do you do? <br>
Since I am a shaman and can convert Hitpoints into mana, I would canabalize down and heal the tanks, if something jumps onto me i would try to root it, and step back, if root didn't hold I would run if we were by a zone, somebody said to run, or if i thought it would follow me and stay off the tanks for a bit. otherwise i would help out however I could, and stay until the last minute.<br>
<br>
You come across a game bug that benefits players greatly. What do you do?<br>
Report it with the /bug command, and sometimes petition it if it is big enough, and immediate enough. (ex: fbss drops in oasis)<br>
<br>
You log into the game and cannot find anyone your level to group with. What do you do? <br>
Try to find an area where i can solo, or go to gfay and try to sell stuff. <p>The Bible is spelled wrong.
