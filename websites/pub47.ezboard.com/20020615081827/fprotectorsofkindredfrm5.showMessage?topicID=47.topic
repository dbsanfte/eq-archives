I am very new to the guild, and I've already been involved in more guild groups then with my last two guilds combined.  By groups I mean getting together for fun and exp... not necesserialy to raid or work on epics... but just for fun.  You have all made me feel like I belong to the guild... to the group... to the family.  I feel like I'm more then a cold stone, a stack of arrows, a focus item or the mage that no one wants in their group.  In my last guild there were lots of problems, and I will admit that I had a hand in some of those problems... mainly because I whined a lot.... I whined because they never really offered me the three very important things that Protectors of Kindred Souls has... the things that I as a person really crave... you have all made me feel welcomed, needed and wanted.  <br><br>There were individuals in my last guild that made me feel that way... but the guild as an entity did not.  I still love Ssolaria very much.  We've had some troubling times recently, but, I miss her... and I love her.... Ssol, if you read this... I hope that you are well and that you'll come back soon. <br><br>Everyone in this guild that I've so far had the pleasure to be with has made me feel all three of these things... and everyone in guild chat has made me feel these things as well.<br><br>You are all wonderful people and I hope that I have a long, happy, fun and propserous future with the Protectors of Kindred Souls.  I love you guys!<br> <p><br> Love,<br>Ash<br><br><br>Kilashandra Crystalheart<br>Magician of 56 elements<br><br><img src="http://draki.net/~bladesinger/ash.jpg"><br>Air provides the force to repel those who would steal my heart.

I want to very much thank each and everyone of you!<br><br>Yes Kila's last guild Temple of Dawn was more focused on the high end raiding, we lost sight of the important things that ToD was founded on and that Harmonious (the founder of ToD) had as a vision.  ToD has collapsed and it is a sad thing.  We had many great times and a lot of fun times too.<br><br>I am currently just drifting, not sure what direction I want to go.<br><br>I love the family atmosphere that ToD used to have, when I started with then almost a year ago at the very young and inexperiences level 42 (if memory serves me right), we were a wonderful close guild.  I had groups almost everytime and whenever I wanted.  It was great!  Through the levels I climbed and then I got 50 and things were still wonderful. I got 54 and still things were good.  I got 55 and well things started changing, I changed and the guild changed too.  We were trying to move and evolve to a raiding guild.  There were a number of people that had reached level 60 at that point and for them raiding Seb, or Chardock or Howling Stones (Charsis) was getting boring.  We tried ToV and it was a great learning experience!  We rocked!  We grew and more people got level 55+ and more reached level 60 and we really started to rock!  Lots of the harder raids were getting easy for us.  Chardock Nobles was not really hard (except the queen, we never managed to get her), and we were starting to do planes raids more as loot pharming expeditions.  Hate was almost trivial for ToD.  We would break in with a single group and get things moving well from there.  we would clear the first floor in a couple of hours and move &quot;upstairs&quot; for the fun and much better loot.  Fear became a single group break in plane as well.  Most epic mobs were getting easy as well.  ToD was getting to be what many would call an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  But I think we still wanted to be known as a &quot;family oriented&quot; guild.  We were both and well neither.  ToD was tearing itself apart from the inside.  Nothing could take us down from the outside, but we had a growing rift in the guild.  We tried to fix things and make a guild that could serve both interests.  Those that wanted to raid, and those that wanted just to group and have fun.  There was also an undercurrent in the guild that seemed to insist that US (the officers, and I was one) were evil people using the guild to serve our own ends.  This was never true.  I gave so much to the guild, only now am I starting to rebuild what Ssolaria had, plat and emotionally.<br><br>At this point I am really torn, I still do love the family atmosphere, but then I also love being able to take a group or 2 and wiping out Fear or Hate or whatever.  It is an incredible experience to be able to do something like that.  I hope that you all can share this kind of experience at some point.  I think you will see what I mean.  We had a blast!<br><br>No matter what I do decide on though, I will be spending a a lot of time with Kilashandra, and I hope that you won't mind if I tag along and group with you folks too.<br><br>Please don't be shy and send me a tell if you need a wizzie for porting or whatever.<br><br>Looking forward to hearing from you folks.<br><br>If Kilashandra is happy in PoKS then I know that you are good people.<br><br>BTW you have a seriously Kick-Ass website!
