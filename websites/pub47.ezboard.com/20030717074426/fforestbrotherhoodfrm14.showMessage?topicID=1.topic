Nay for this dream has plagued me for nights and I cannot escape it… I must search for wisdom a way to interpret these visions soon or they will surely perish…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sir! Sir ! are you listening… do you hear me! I have been wakened from my sleep into meditation… one of ours has fallen and needs assistance! We must go!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -Durito nervously chatters… <br>
<br>
Not being one to wake so suddenly I unwillingly agree to depart our camp and take flight, packing our things and covering the fire Durito whisk’s me away before I’m able to even stand… we arrive to the Nexus not knowing were to go and behold the spirit of our dear friend Aerzene is there in the nakedness of her birth… she tells of a battle far off in the land of Gunthak as she and a noble Paladin friend -close to the age of myself attempt to quest her scrolls of Legacy, knowing this new land somewhat from acquiring my own scrolls I am ready to assist her. <br>
<br>
Durito recently coming of the art of circles was eager to take us and we departed to the land of Stonebrunt, knowing Durito being so young would be the target of those who haunt this new land I arm him with what spiritual gifts I am able and we take wind to the coastline and enter the caves… being camouflaged we are somewhat safe in passing the vile creatures that roam these caverns… following Aerzene with Durito on my heals we quickly run through… suddenly Durito’s magic covering fails “as often does of a young Druid just in the wrong time&quot; -a Marauder bashes him as he attempts to stay with us- joining it Pillager takes chase and we must have four of the fowl creatures on his tail… I motion Aerzene to continue on to the harbor of Dulak knowing these creatures would surely ignore my taunt and pulverize our young Druid Brother’ -being a bit faster then them he is able to keep a distance for some time but one joins from the flanks and smashes him so fiercely he is stunned! Spinning in circles he feels his spirit is soon to flee… as I turn to run back and aid the poor Druid infested by these creatures I can see nearly the entire village coming his way- but by the blessings of Tunare he squeezes from their clutches and regains his stature… with his wits with him again he flees to follow me, not even taking time to heal him I lead him toward the Harbor entrance and we safely duck into a somewhat safe area of Dulak. <br>
<br>
As I heal the unfortunate Druid of his wounds he realizes he is in a land more evil than he should venture and begins to ready his gate incase of further adversaries, as we sit to catch wind we find Aerzenes friend was able to bring her recent corpse from the clutches of the spirits in the mines and was beginning to revive her. <br>
<br>
After her complete restoration the Paladin weary of battles was unable to continue and set up camp to rest. The time of day was early and many adventurers were at hand seeking riches of this new land, some were crying out to be taken home- Durito realizing he was at risk decided to aid some and take flight to the Nexus and he departed us and went to rest in the Haven of Luclin. <br>
<br>
Aerzene still eager to acquire her scrolls realized after her restoration she had not the magic thoughts to carry out the task at hand, we decided to head back to the Gulf and call our young friend back to take us to the Nexus for some spiritual thoughts, under the cover of Aerzene’s magic invisibility we snuck back through the village and toward the caves leading to Gunthak- as she entered the cave yet again the magic departed even her as the Pillagers saw her, I could not count how many were at hand as I assisted her to taunt the evil creature but more and more joined in and her health was fading quickly, I struggled to heal her as Marauders bashed me and was able to get one heal off but too many were at hand! As I ready my Lay of hands she fell… with no time to mourn I too would soon be overcome by the flight of my spirit… knowing the closest safety was back to the Harbor I fled for my life and reached Dulaks entrance- trying to enter yet again in safety but finding new foe just inside, with my health low I knew I was not safe I turned to enter the Gulf again and entering found safety to rest… to my surprise from the battle I had been stripped of all magic and surely was in danger, as I went into meditation but keeping a watchful eye I pondered at the matters at hand… <br>
<br>
Durito waking up and entering the Nexus was startled at Aerzenes spirit and went to her to aid, as they sat to make ready a plan Aerzene suddenly drifted to sleep and was unable to be revived… <br>
<br>
I called upon the Druid to come aid me for no covering did I have to retrieve Aerzenes corpse- quickly he raced through Stonebrunt and into the Gulf fleeing through the caverns his training came quick to him as Tunare guided his thoughts and he reached me, with no waiting he covered me in the way of the forest and we were off to retrieve her resting soul… with no trouble we accomplished the task quickly and sat in safety to meditate… surely the evil of this land had many victories as you could here the cry’s of spirits fleeing their bodies and searching for aid and resurrection,  my thoughts could not rest… so many in need and calling surely the gods have left this place and seldom enter to see their vile creations lay waste to the goodness of Norrath. <br>
<br>
I revived Aerzene after she awoke and we pondered a moment at matters at hand, feeling weary myself we decided to save this adventure for another time and return with a force able to regain our revenge, we took wind together to the Nexus with two other souls to rest for a time and find refreshment, Aerzene would go on to the Grey for a more pleasant victory, Durito and I searched for a tavern in the haven to rest our minds and call upon a different spirit to find some cheerful folk to share the days adventure…. <br>
After all I a noble Paladin must aid in the consumption of these spirits to let them rest within me. <br>
<br>
As we shared the days events with others I couldn’t stop thinking of my dreams… how I wanted to revisit them and search for the wisdom to reveal their secrets… where do these visions come from for no one with in the Brotherhood was tested… no one had this burden for then surely it would be clearer to me, as I gazed again into the fire in the tavern I felt my mind taking flight to my younger days recalling my childhood in Kelethin of a easier way with no tests of these like today hold, they were joyful times so many friends I feel almost sad as I try to recall their names and ponder where they may be today…for very seldom do any visit these days, perhaps a journey to Kelethin is needed to recall a clearer vision of the nights tales and maybe there in the city of the tree’s I can rest and find the wisdom needed, after all Castle Felwithe is not far from there and I can visit my ol’ mentor and friend Tynkale -perhaps he has a rare vintage of the vineyard he would like to share and can help to interpret my dream, as I fell farther in my minds journey I could hear Durito laughing with the patrons and telling tall tales -I felt safe and warm and there I slept with out waking….             <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/queztormage/private/c_paladin.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/queztormage/private/flag.bmp" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
