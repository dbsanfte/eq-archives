<br>
Few other things from memory -<br>
<br>
(1)   Resists (especially MR) are important on this guy because he FEARS.  This guy is not a pushover like our friendly CS dragon was.  If you don't have the resists, some of us may have some to lend out.  I know I have a couple of resists folks might be able to wear.<br>
<br>
(2)  His AoE is frontal only.<br>
<br>
(3)  He will also go after anyone who sits, so NO SITTING during the fight (unless you're the MA).<br>
<br>
(4)  If I remember right, the turn in guy is a 5-hour spawn, so if he's not up, you'll have to find out when he was last killed.  Might be wise to track there before we start zoning in to get this answer.  There's not much to do nearby if we wait.<br>
<br>
Boraf and I have been involved in his fights, so we know what to expect.<br>
<br>
(5)  Two tactics I've seen or heard him done with - typical layout is casters far away from the melee (out of aggro range).  Second tactic which has worked is have casters in the tunnel, melee on the beach but the MA gets the mob turned around so the mob is facing the water not the tunnel.<br>
<br>
(6)  I'd plan for more than 3 groups if we can nab them.  You will want as many clerics as are on, and all of our pallies.  Don't hesitate to call in friends - the pallies generally do a chain LoH and shout when the last one has been used so the clerics and everyone else can start healing the MA.  Healers should be focused on the MA primarily/only.  Keeping him and SA alive is KEY to the success.  If they die, the mob tends to bounce around via aggro list and kill everyone with his AoE while he melee's the &quot;special ones&quot; hehe.<br>
<br>

That's off memory.<br>

He is a triggered spawn, and always pops in the same place. We won't need to pull him, as the MA will be sitting down, well within aggro range upon spawn. Once the fight gets underway, it's pretty wild!<br>

To add to Cry's notes I will add excerpts from &quot;RAIDING FAYDEDAR - Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<br>
WHAT YOU NEED<br>
1. You should be between levels 45 and 60. Clerics as low as 39 (with complete heal) are also useful.<br>
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Fire Resistance of 100. The higher the better.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER<br>
1. Faydedar is a level 55 Dragon Magician (no pet).<br>
2. Faydedar's most deadly weapon is his AE lava (huge radius) and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
3. Faydedar dual hits in the 300's.<br>
4. Faydedar moves at very close to SoW speed. Very hard to outrun him.<br>
5. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xEarring of Fire Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at Lavastorm gypsies), Gold Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10 MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
6. In order to cast any spell on a dragon - YOU MUST BE WITHIN ITS MELEE RANGE.<br>
7. Key to the fight is that only the 1-2 main tanks will be taunting. No one else should taunt!<br>
8. Anyone sitting during the battle is instantly moved to the top of the hate list. Casters should not sit!<br>
<br>
SETUP PHASE<br>
1. Faydedar is different from almost all other mobs in game in that his hate for casters is insane. When spawned, he will go after anyone sitting or casting within a huge radius. Key to fight is to let tanks build up enough agro that it is safe for casters.<br>
2. Under no condition will a caster sit immediately prior to Fay spawn through the end of fight. Doing so, is suicide for the caster.<br>
3. All casters and reserve tanks will be in far SE corner of the oasis area when Fay is spawned. There will be no pets at the start of the fight, Faydedar starts the fight with large AE fear and will agro pets.<br>
4. The main tank group will consist ideally of 1-2 warriors, 1 cleric, and 3-4 paladins (can also include an enchanter to chain cast rune). They will fight just SW of the pier. The 2 main tanks will be sitting on the ground when Faydedar is spawned. Paladins should have solid plan to do LoH until all are expended. Goal of main tank group is to engage Fay, and build enough hate that clerics are safe to cast heals. Cleric in main tank group should not cast CH, and should instead cast smaller heals, but should wait until several LoH have been done.<br>
5. All extra paladins not in main tank group will stage in tunnel area and have target hotkeys ready to heal the 2 main tanks. They will use their LoH during first portion on the fight.<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING FAY<br>
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions. Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
2. All casters and extra tank groups should be in SE corner. NO ONE SHOULD BE SITTING. NO ONE SHOULD CAST ANY SPELLS. Bards should not be singing any songs. <br>
3. Main tank group should be just SW of pier. The two main tanks should be sitting on the ground.<br>
4. All extra paladins should be near tunnel and should be ready to LoH the main tanks. Having an established order avoids wasting any.<br>
5. Fay will be spawned and will appear in the water just next to the pier.<br>
6. Fay will agro on the sitting tanks.<br>
7. The 1 tank group will engage Fay and will try to build as much hate as possible. Fay hits in the 300 range and lava does about 300-500 damage. Warriors should say when low and paladins should have scripted order of who will do LoH. Do early if necessary.  Goal is to build enough hate that other groups can engage without having to worry about Cleric safety. Bards in main tank group can begin singing once main tank has gotten several hits in and taunted at least once.<br>
8. Keep Fay in SW corner. This will place him farther away from caster camp and minimizes risk of AE lava damage to those in SE corner.<br>
9. 20 seconds into fight, other tank groups will be called into the fight. Bards in the other tank groups should not start songs until they have approached Fay, they should not start singing in SE corner and risk agroing Fay.<br>
10. It is now safe for clerics to heal, but not with CH. They should get close to the fight and heal whoever Fay is attacking by chain casting smaller heals. Remember that the two main tanks are taking most of the damage and it is critical they stay alive and at top of hate list.<br>
11 Casters should summon pets now.<br>
12. Bards should be playing Elemental and try to slow/snare Fay with Binding song. Twist Guardian if able to do twist three during fight.  Have dirge ready for suicide damage.<br>
13. Tanks with snare spells should chain cast to try to get them to stick.<br>
14. With LoH exhausted, Clerics can now heal, but should avoid CH. Chain cast lower level heals based on who Fay is attacking. Keep people in primary tank group alive. Multiple clerics should be healing same person at once.<br>
15. At 60%, Slower/Tasher/Debuffer should run to Fay engagement area in SW corner and try to land spells. Do not cast from SE corner because if you agro Fay, it is too far away from the tanks.<br>
16. At 50%, send in fire pets.<br>
17. At 50%, casters should approach SW corner and being nuking. Bards with occlusion of sound should do it now.<br>
18. Continue all-out assault until Fay is dead.<br>
==&gt; In the event that Fay agros on a caster in SE corner, the tanks in SW corner should not move! Instead, they should all sit down to bring Fay back! Failed Fay raids usually involve the dragon running all over at high speeds from SW to SE picking people off 1 at a time. Having tanks stay in 1 place and then sitting if necessary to bring him back will avoid this problem.<br>

<br>
Fay debuffs if you're in front of him which is why it's important to have unbuffed resists that high.<br>
<br>
Fay really does head to the person sitting down who's highest on his hate list.  It's almost comical to watch.  I was the 2nd to last one standing the one time I was in on his fight, simply because my resists were so high, his AoE didnt' kill me; he actually had to melee me to get me to die.<br>
<br>
C3 is going to make this much easier if Wifey's available, because we can't sit and med and the MA will require lots of mana worth of healing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ucrystilla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crystilla</A> at: 8/20/02 5:21:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/ueqbrilo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQBrilo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(8/20/02 7:08:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fprotectorsofkindredfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Killing Faydedar - Friday night?</span><hr size=1> We will be putting up 3 or 4 dummy buffs to help with the debuffing - melees that have the goblin earring or the coldain ring will no doubt be clicking these :^) <br>
<br>
Also, I think its likely I can supply a 60 chanter for the raid in the event Wifey is unable to attend.<br>
<br>
And in case anyone has missed a common theme running through many of these notes - NO SITTING DOWN.<br>
