Taking 5 giants at a time towards the end.<br>
<br>
The gathering, grouping, and buff cycle went pretty well. It was nice to not hear peeps complaining about the time it was taking.  We were all anxious.<br>
<br>
We gathered a couple good loots that we never got to roll on because of CR. However, BBBSco spent 2700 on corpse summoning. We would like to take the Mithril Vambraces and Rokyls Channeling Crystal and sell them to refund those who put in pp, and to re-build the guilds raid fund which was depleated in the CR effort.  I would like one representative from FOJ and LOW to each reply here saying they are ok with it. Otherwise, we will roll when we can all get together again.<br>
<br>
Another notable drop was a polished mithril torque that Rumble won in a roll, but didn't not accept the loot in time for the rotting corpse.  <br>
<br>
Naggy did not fall. Pow fell fast. I had over 200 MR (90+ non buffed) and FR(100+non buffed) for the fight and was immediately feared, but still had aggro and was not running away. LOH and heals would not stick, so before I could hit for my 9th strike, I was down. Others fell to similar fates soon after. Naggy made it to 50% health before the entire force was whiped. <br>
<br>
Most who could bound close and the initial CR went smoothly. There we just about 6 players with 8 bodies under Naggy. We found a couple nice necros late ito the night, just before the patch to get the bodies summoned. <br>
<br>
For those with comments on how the raid could have been better, please post them here. Constuctive feedback is always welcome.<br>

I am sure there were more others who would have also.<br>
<br>
One of the problems is we cannot rely on that new item link. Aruga can not use the new UI and had no clue in hell what he was rolling on till after the fact. I am sure there are others who cannot or do not use it either.<br>
<br>
I think if something is no drop and there is a minute left on the timer then maybe the raid lead takes a wild stab and picks someone who seems to come to raids a lot and could actually use the item. Playing favorites maybe, but that sucked that thing rotted, and it sucked a rogue was gonna loot it.<br>
<br>
As far as naggy: I have read more than once that Naggy is a lot harder since they made the resist changes. All we can do there is up our resists. <br>
<br>
I had a big problem last night with the fact that Impatience ruled the raid. We need to be fast moving yes, but there was too much impatience. If we are going to start leaving folks behind for the sake of the raid then I am not going to be raiding anymore, sorry.<br>
<br>
Also as far as the who map thing goes. It is wise to check the atlas's on www.eqatlas.com. But if one more person says the phrase &quot;get a map&quot; I am gonna lose it. My printer  is down, some people don't have printers and I think it is bordering on loserville to head to kinkos to print out a map everytime we raid. Whatever happened to helping your guildmates out? <p><center>

<br>
1.  LoW is discussing your request that items obtained during the raid be used to pay for the corpse summonses.  Personally, I have no problem with that; a guild ambassador should be contacting you (hopefully today) with our reply.<br>
<br>
2.  I was frustrated that I couldn't do much healing, as people were falling too fast.  I stayed in the prep room during the fight; should I have moved in closer so I could heal as needed?  When I did try to heal, people were &quot;out of range&quot;.  I ultimately camped out (when told to do so) and returned once it was safe.<br>
<br>
3.  How many level 52s were on the raid?  I've heard that level is a significant factor in determining whether Fear sticks.  Can anyone confirm this?  If this is true, then those in their 40s would have a much higher chance of being feared even with 200+ MR.<br>
<br>
4.  What happened in that earlier encounter with the boss giant?  A number of people (including myself) were killed.  Was that room trained on us by someone outside the raid?<br>
<br>
5.  I agree with Gnipgnop in that a better effort should be made to ensure that NO DROP items don't rot.  Yes, it might mean that some people won't get a shot because they can't be rezzed in soon enough.  Better that than to let it rot though.<br>
<br>
6.  I also agree that we need to be patient on these raids.  We need to be sure that everyone sticks together!  Everyone has to take responsibility for this; for instance, if you're going AFK for more than a few seconds, let your party know.  That way, no one gets left behind.<br>
<br>
7.  How did the &quot;uninvited guests&quot; perform?  If they were a hindrance, perhaps you should consider not allowing &quot;walk-ons&quot; in the future.<br>
<br>
I want to thank BBSCo for giving me the opportunity to come along on my first dragon raid.  I hope that there will be many more such opportunities.<br>

Though it did not the way we had intended, I feel we all learned a lot from this attempt.   I also want to thank everyone for being as patient as they were.  Tho at times it did seem somewhat rushed, overall, I did not see anyone complaining about the time it was taking us and I thank you all for that!!<br>
<br>
Rowlf, we totally understand. I know that patches always cause problems for you and knew that more than likely you couldn't make it back.  We know you tried everything possible to get back online.<br>
<br>
Gnipgnop, yes, there was impatience last night and I know that some people got rather abrupt in their replies.  There was also total frustration due to the fact that VI screwed up the patch and so many of us kept going LD.   Regarding maps, it is strongly urged that one be printed beforehand.  However, I understand that printers can be down, maps can get misplaced, etc.  We try to move out as one group. Some people fall behind and they need to let the raid leader(s) know IMMEDIATELY via a tell when this happens.  I was staying on top of all the people saying they were lost, fell in lava, etc.  I had tells going out to multiple the whole raid making sure we were together, that those that inadvertantly fell in the lava and died got rez'd, etc.  I stayed on top of everything, I promise you that!<br>
<br>
I was also frustrated that I couldn't heal during the Naggy fight.  My men were falling fast and it kept saying they were LD when they got feared and my heals would not hit them. I did a petition because I had not seen the LD before when I did a previous Naggy raid and the guide said that that was correct; when feared, they should say LD.  I think we should have been closer to the action too.  The LoH's did not work because of the fear/LD.<br>
<br>
We had 5 full groups and one group with 3 others.  I do not know how many 52 we had, I do not have my list of peeps with me.<br>
<br>
Sanmaren, I do not know what happened with the boss giant.  That must have been one of the times I crashed and had to reboot.  <br>
<br>
I believe there were only 2 &quot;uninvited&quot; guests and one of them performed very well.  The other needs to learn how to raid better and know his role.<br>
<br>
I also agree that nodrop loot needs to be handled as quickly as possible so that it does not rot.  If people are LD, afk, etc, I believe it us up to the Raid Lead to pick the appropriate person if the issue gets confused.  <br>
<br>
Buffing overall went well though there seemed to be some confusion on junk buffs.  I'll continue working out the buffing plan to see if we can work out all the kinks.<br>
<br>
It will be a LOT easier to keep everyone in communication when chat channels are fixed. I learned last night how much I rely on the channels now and HATE the old way of communicating.<br>
<br>
I am up for trying Naggy again tonight if anyone is interested.  I'll log in as soon as I get home to see how many are online and if we can pull the ranks together.  Please invite your friends and guildmates and we'll show Naggy the true meaning of pain.  Be sure to bring as much resist gear as you can to help get those resists higher.<br>
<br>
Please continue posting feedback here.  As Pow said, we need the information!!  Please feel free to comment on my role in the raid as well as co-raid lead if you have comments.  I'm tough and can take it. <br>

<br>
For me the frustration was due to many lockups that caused delays. This made the raid run long and that is reallty hard for our EST attendies. These lockups were really bad for me during the corpse retrival process. I would like to thank all that hung in there and got our corpses out.

Since Naggy dispells the crap buffs we loaded first, Fear will appear in the first buff slot.  Thus cancel magic will wipe fear out as it gets is the first one in the list.  While supposedly changes have not made this 100% true anymore, I suspect that it is still a valid tactic and would allow us to keep a bunch of Melees going after Naggy all at once and might limit the amount of Fearing.  Since Paladins with deepwater gauntlets can do this for 0 mana cost, they might be a good second wave, able to help keep fear at bay on the first wave and then able to whack Naggy when the other casters are ready to join the attack.  One other tactic that I have heard of being used against Vox, and this might work for Naggy is to chain stun.  Yes its true that Stuns do not affect Naggy or the giants, however with Vox, it keeps her from casting Complete heal on herself.  As such, it might well limit the number of times that naggy is able to cast fear.<br>

Some stuff I saw from Aruga's perspective:<br>
<br>
I will take the hit for not better organizing the cleric buffs while Budderz was LD, I think what we can do next time is predesignate a 'cleric' buff  leader, that leader would get all the level info from the other clerics and set them up in such a manner so that a couple junk buffs get thrown on, then the good cleric buffs.  This could be done by setting the clerics in a line, such as when the player comes tot he cleric group he goes to Aruga first, for the first cleric buff, then to Budderz for the second cleric buff, then to  San for the 3rd buff, etc.  That way we wouldn't have folks asking if they got all their buffs.  I think this would help us on the buffing part.  Perhaps if we had a good roster of what clerics are going to attend, then Aruga or the whoever is the 'cleric leader' could set up that part of the  buffing circle.<br>
<br>
REgarding healing during Naggy fight, I couldn't land a single heal either.  Aruga stayed down from the closing door, there was no agro there from naggy.  Perhaps after a player is feared, if he goes up to his cleric on that ledge, then the cleric can heal him before he runs back into the fray, then after he gets feared again, he stop back at the cleric, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Another cleric thing I learned was that 90 % of the time, when fighting the giants, it jsut wasn't worth it to sit and med.  The giants would take a liking to Aruga as soon as he tried to sit his arse down.  But it was okay in group 2, I threw some heals out, but was never hurting for mana while healing my group, even during the king fight.  So moral of the story, just stand up so as not to draw cleric agro, and have back up healers if the shite hits the fan.<br>
<br>
It is super hectic trying to get 30 folks f rom all over the country to come together into an organized group, when the only real form of communication is typing stuff on the computer that we are sitting in front of.  I salute Pow, Budderz, Gnip and the officers and leader of LoW and FoJ for organizing this raid.  You  all had a tough job to do it, and we got a lot of good raid experience from it.  I also salute my group, Mak, Breg, MJ, Wump, and ARavon for sitting patiently and not clogging up the already busy OOC and shout and guild chat channels.  Their ability to sit patiently and not clog up those channels helped out a lot.<br>
<br>
As f or the loot, I second Gnip's comments.  I am one of the ones who can't use the new UI yet, and therefore can't see that stats one what was being auctioned, but was there for the exp not the loot.  :-)<br>

We put the matter at your discretion.<br>
<br>
Personally, given all circumstances, I think we did quite well.<br>
1.  People locking up all over the place.<br>
2.  Chat channels not working.<br>
3.  There are rumors that patch also screwed up aggro.<br>
We still took down all the giants, and got the dragon to under 50%.   Dragon, who is way tougher after resist patch.<br>
<br>
Fire resist:  seemed largely unnecessary.   Mine was around 100 BUFFED, and I resisted like 6 out of 7 lava breaths at lvl 51.<br>
<br>
Magic resist:  Personally, I resisted almost all roars with 130 buffed MR at 51.   I would expect Pow's 200 MR keeping him steady.  Maybe it was a freak chance, but I have a dreadful suspicion that VI's resist patch works about as well as what they dropped on is yesterday - it is just not as visible.<br>
<br>
Cancel magic: hmm, that is an interesting idea.   There seems to be a set path that feared players take.   Putting a couple folks to CM whatever tanks are walking away from dragon might have worked.<br>
<br>
Enchanter buffs:  Even with clarity and a bard, giving everyone group MR and haste was trying.  I get group clarity at 52, that might help,  but we should bring a couple more enchanters to the fray next time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uaananla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aananla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#330000>(9/27/02 11:29:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> Naggy Raid<br>

 At the rate that everyone was coming out of the chamber Feared, I think we could have done this in stages instead of going back in one at a time. Not nearly enough damage output happpening like that. After getting feared, come back to prep room, get healed and rebuffed, wait for a few more to get ready, then head back in a group at a time. A few will resist the next wave and remain to continue the damage.<br>
<br>
I think we did quite well considering the RM issues we were having. I think it is more dependant on level than actual resists of the player.<br>
<br>
I would like to commend BBSCo for your organization and patience. It is not easy managing groups through broken channels and keeping track of what is going on. The raid was carried out very well IMHO. Great job.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uvoldric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Voldric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#330000>(9/27/02 11:32:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well, we tried.</span><hr size=1> Well, hindsight's 20/20, but considering how we kept having mass LDs, we probably would have been better off postponing the raid.

I resisted fear most of the time (MR was over 250 and FR was around 175), and when it did stick, it never stuck for longer than 5 seconds.  <br>

Oh, and I have a question about getting summoned.  I did no direct damage to Naggy, since I was concentrating on resist buffing.  I was under the impression that summoning mobs wouldn't call you unless you did actual damage.  I know bards that have kited around Gorenaire with charm/mez while their guilds prepped.  Is Naggy different?<br>
<br>
Naggy will fall to us.  Next time he sees BBSCO running at him, he'd better hightail it out of there.  I don't think we've ever failed at a raid like this twice--we learn too well from our mistakes. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328113>Voldric Tenslayer</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub47.ezboard.com/uxevpowpow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xevpowpow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#330000>(9/27/02 12:27:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub47.ezboard.com/fblackburrowstoutco13800frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well, we tried.</span><hr size=1> WOW...These are great comments and all valid.   All comments will be consolidated into 1 post and we will update the naggy plan as needed.<br>
<br>
The loot that was lost had 2 mins left when I started to shout Roll NEED NOW after posting what the loot was. I'm sorry for those who did not get to read it. Most were LD at the time.<br>
<br>
So folks who needed started rolling. Stupified and Rumbl tied at 904. I didnt have time to questions Rumbl's need with 1 min left.  I called ROLL OFF NOW. They rolled off. Rumbl won. I said LOOT NOW. He went down on it, up on it, down on it, up on it, down on it, up on it poof it was gone. I had sent a tell to Stupid telling him to loot it as soon as Rumbl stood up if it wasnt taken.  Fingers get fat when panicing on a rotting corpse. =)  On future raids, maybe it shoudl be a rule, at 2 mins of a rotting corpse, the RL assigns the loot if no rolls have been made for some reason.  No fault to Rumbl imho, he may not have seen the loot description and most loot was going to be FFA.<br>
<br>
Stopping the raid right before we went into Naggy crossed my mind.  We would have been better off, but we would not have learned how to do it better. The LD's were a major concern and I dont think anyone went LD when we went into the battle.<br>
<br>
And voldric, we shoudl have no prob retrieving your corpse because we will be killing Naggy. =)<br>

        First off I think With all the LDs and lockups that alot of people didn't get key information, I know cuz of me locking up once, I logged back on and felt kinda lost till a guildie helped me out. I also think too many ppl went forward when Powpow did and a mage pet went in early. Also with Powpow getting feared none of our Lay on Hands were sticking, Sorry Powpow we tried. <br>
     Overall I think the raid went pretty well, For my first Dragon raid it kinda sucked getting killed right after Giving Hikmer a LoH.<br>
