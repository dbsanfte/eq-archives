Sele's epic is pretty easy in relation to others. I need a few secondary items from other raids like fear and hate.  The result is a pretty nice haste casting item. 66% haste and good stats.<br>
<br>
To start the quest I must turn in my robe which im not ready to do, but there are a lot of items I can gather beforehand. I just can't go get all of the bags without turning in the robe....hmm....better check the bank for jeb's seal. Maybe its already done.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From there head to Lower Guk. The Ghoul Scribe spawns in the Ghoul Sage room (near the Executioner room).  Whilst a rare spawn, this shouldn't be too long a camp.  Charm the Scribe and hand him the Empty Ink Vial. You will get the Ink of the Dark returned to you.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then you need to get the White Paper. This part is completed in West Karana.  You will need to bring a paper and a quill and these can be obtained from almost all Enchanter guilds. You need to speak with Chrislin Baker (Loc: 1050, -1990). <br>
Hail her and then give her the paper and quill.  <br>
Chrislin Baker gives you a hug. 'Thank you so much. I did some cleaning after you left and found this behind a barrel. It may have been left behind by the person who took my materials. You can have it'. <br>
You will then get a Bandit Sash.<br>
A Human Monk named Thrackin Griffen will then spawn at Loc 880, -11570. Kill him and you and loot the White Paper.  This mob is almost totally magic immune and a tough battle.  Take a group with some tanks and a cleric.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First go and locate Modani Qu'Loni in Overthere (Loc: +540 -940). Modani is in the form of a Scorpion. Actually getting to Modani can be tricky sometimes as there are other Scorpions nearby that can make it a challenge.  Either kill them, or have someone lure them away so you can speak to Modani.<br>
'Hail Modani Qu`Loni'<br>
'The hidden self inside a myriad of magic is one that walks quite softly. Yes, that is what you must seek.'<br>
Give Modani Jeb's Seal.<br>
'Ah yes, Jeb's seal. The time to craft a Serpent must have come. I will need components collected to craft the first of the pieces. I will also provide you with a sack in which you must combine the items. Are you ready to collect them?'<br>
<br>
'I am ready to collect them.'<br>
'Scattered throughout the world are various items. To prove your worth, go collect these and return them to me. The Xolion Rod, Innoruuk's Word, Chalice of Kings, and snow blossoms.'<br>
'I need a sack.'<br>
'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me. '<br>
You will receive an Enchanter's Bag<br>
'What is the Chalice of Kings?'<br>
'The Chalice of Kings is the chalice of elven kings. Recently thought to be lost to the ages, it was recently discovered. I need its magical powers to create a magical liquid.'<br>
'What is the Xolion Rod?'<br>
'This is the rod of an ancient civilization found on this continent. Nothing is known of it other than that the scaled ones discovered it years ago.'<br>
'What are Snow Blossoms?'<br>
'These are flowers that are also used in the creation process. They were once widespread, but now I am told they only grow in select places.'<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then get a good group together and head over to Neriak.  Inside the Cleric Guild in the Third Gate region you will find Verina Tomb. Verina is on a two day spawn, and often is not up (some other Enchanter has killed her normally).  You may have to just wait, or pop back now and then to check on her.  She is a level 60 Dark Elf Cleric and you can kill her without aggroing the guards (provided you aren't Kill on Sight to the guards).  <br>
You will loot Innoruuk's Word off her once she is dead.<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Xolion Rod can be obtained by killing Vessel Drozlin in the Cabilis Shaman guild (Loc: 591, -826.)  You will need to swim through the large pool and go through the tunnels.  Becareful as this monster is also immune to most magic, and will run through a one way door as the fight progresses.  He also has some guards.  Take a good high level group (or more if worried).  <br>
Kill Drozlin and then loot the Xolion Rod.<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now its time to head over to Chardok and head deep inside the dungeon.  You have to kill Prince Selrach Di'zok (Loc: -560 +1360). The Prince is a level 61 Warrior and to fight him and clear the path to his room you will need some heavy fighting power. Kill the Prince and loot his head.  <br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Spoon is on a named sand giant called Cazel, you can find him in the Oasis of Maar.  Whilst he is only level 50 he has ridiculous regen and hits very hard.  2 groups are recommended to kill Cazel, or one very high level group.  Kill him and grab the Spoon.<br>
<br>
[b]Partner/Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To obtain the Enchanted Diamond go to Kaesora.  You need to get to Loc: 85, -415.  It is quite easy to get there. Once you enter Kaesora, cast levitate and invis, and go straight forwards and drop down the hole.  Don't go all the way down - just keep heading straight ahead onto the ledge in front of you. Enter the room with the three spiders and turn right and go through that door. Directly behind that door there is a secret wall which you go through then just before you hit the corner, cast invis vs. undead. Enter the building you see when you go round the corner.<br>
Here you will find either a Spectral Librarian or a Tortured Librarian (placeholder).  Kill the Tortured Librarian until the Spectral Librarian spawns. Then charm him and give him the Dull Diamond. He will then give you the Enchanted Diamond and turn into a Enraged Spectral Librarian. If you kill this spawn it will turn into three Freed Souls which cast some nasty area Area Effect spells.  They have almost no hitpoints though but take them out quick.  They are an optional extra you can gate out once you have the Enchanted Diamond if you like.  <br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then head to the City of Mist and look for the Wraith of Jaxion. It spawns right up the back in Neh'Ashiir's building near the Reaver.  It is a rare spawn.  If it is not there, keep killing everything near there until it does. Then charm it and hand the Dull Ruby. You will get the Enchanted Ruby.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Head to the Overthere. Look for a scorpion called Impaler Tzilug at Loc: -90, 810. Charm the Impaler (like Modani this might mean killing some other NPC's first) and give him the Dull Emerald. In return, he will give you the Enchanted Emerald.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Next head to The Hole and find Polzin Mrid (Loc: 210, -50). <br>
'Hail Polzin Mrid!'<br>
'Yes, young one? <br>
Give Polzin Mrid Jeb's Seal.<br>
'Jeb has spoken with you already, excellent. Tell me are you ready for the test of the phantasm?<br>
You receive Jeb's Seal back.<br>
'I am ready for the test of the phantasm'<br>
'It will be simple, go collect these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will provide you with one.<br>
<br>
'What is the head of a serpent?'<br>
'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is actually the remnants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was eradicated long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a ghost?'<br>
'You don't have to look for to find roaming spirits. One in particular though has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Wel....look at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle.<br>
<br>
'What is the essence of a vampire?'<br>
'The essence of a vampire is just that. Only the most powerful of these creatures will possess what you need.<br>
<br>
'What sands of the mystics?'<br>
'They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand. One will need to search the shores.<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You should get the Essence of a Ghost first since it is found in The Hole as well. You must look for the Ghost of Kindle, a spawn in between the city and Master Yael's lair (take a couple of groups). Kill her get the Essence of a Ghost.<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Head of a Serpent is found in the Plane of Fear. The Spirit of Shissar can be found in the Amygdalan Temple.  It's on a 5-7 day timer.  The Shissar itself is actually extremely easy, the hard part is breaking fear and getting to it.  Kill it and loot the Head of the Serpent.<br>
<br>
[b]Raid[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Essence of a Vampire is found in the Plane of Hate. They are a rare drop by Forsaken Revenants (mainly in the north east corner of the zone). <br>
Raid&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then head to the Field of Bone and look for The Tangrin (Loc: 3300, 2530).  A rare spawn Gorilla Warrior - this is a fun fight for a couple of high level groups.  Kill The Tangrin and loot the Sands of the Mystics.<br>
<br>
[b]Group[/b]&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now head to Skyfire and look for the a tiny Chromodac called Felia Goldenwing near the Burning Woods zone. Felia is another rare spawn and you might have to kill a bunch of other placehoder spawns to trigger her. Once she does spawn, quickly charm her and avoid taking her anywhere near other Skyfire spawns. Other mobs will kill her on sight. After you charm Felia, hand her the Dull Sapphire and she will give you an Enchanted Sapphire.<br>
