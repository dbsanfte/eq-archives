Please understand though, that my friendship to those that I consider friends has no limit cause of some silly tag on my head.

I am referring to the power gamers that decided they want a 54+ guild with all the loot for themselves. So they took all the loot they got while with AdA and now go most likely to form their own exclusive guild. And they were the ones saying that they didn't like others joining the guild, getting loot, then leaving ... ha ha ha .. so what is this ?<br>

As a person that left AdA I have to respond to this. I do respect you a great deal! But I must disagree here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I myself am NOT a powergamer, nor one with all the loot so to speak. I dont have my epic and those that do lets face it, a great many of them had before the merger of the 2 guilds. Loot doesnt play a part of what most ppl think is behind the issues.<br>
<br>
AdA already has a lvl limit of 54 so thats not a point of issue here at all.<br>
<br>
I find it hard to believe that you might cut all ties to those that left before speaking to them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you'd like to talk send me a /tell.....

More seriously: If you are hurt, angry, pissed off, feeling betrayed, say so...buy lashing out at those who hurt you will not solve anything. Letting them know how you feel (and I can imgine, as I have been thought his more than once) without an attack most likely get you a non-flamy answer. <br>

Frankly I don't know what cause the split, but I am sorry to see it happen.

<br>
Loot that I have gotten since being in ADA on any ADA raid = zero. That was NOT the reason I/we left. If I (we) were a power gamer, I wouldnt go to our new guild. We are rebuilding, and we are doing it very fast. Thats not what we are about-uberness. Believe me we are about friends. Now truth be told, we hated some of the things that were going on and well it's in the past now. As for &quot;power-gamer,&quot; no. We are a group of friends, more tight now though. Loot isnt an issue to us btw, as you might think, injustices would be. Our loot rules are like a sentence long.  I think we won't put up with a lot of the things Ada did, cause we are different in personality.<br>
<br>
So we are different. Does this make us bad? Does it make us bad we want to actually know who all the ppl are in guildsay? Or many other things that differ from Ada, no. Does Ada seem like a bad group of folks, heck no.  <br>
<br>
This is a time for healing among friends not finger pointing. As to why we all left stealthfully, its actually because we didnt want to cause a bigger disturbance then we were about to, honestly. <br>
<br>
A lot of us tried to change things in ADA with posts and attempts to do more in the guild. These attempts were met with brutal opposition IMO. But even still, I don't have any ill will towards any AdA member btw. I call them friends, not foes. As for family, for me its with my new guild. But guildtag is indicative of family, some close friendships transcend guildtags--believe me.  <p><HTML>

The rest: I just wish it wasn't all covered up and that you would have said what you guys all wanted instead of the way you did it. However, I'm still not mad at you all, I hope you find what you seek and I hope friends will still be friends despite the obvious feelings flying around.<br>

<br>
Ok... lets all remember one important thing.  Everquest is a game.  Remember this always.  If people are unhappy, then they either move on or they quit the game.  Thats the nature of the beast.  Some people enjoy chatting, some people enjoy hunting with friends, some people enjoy phat lewtz, all of these are fine.  They are all different aspects of the same game.  Live with it, respect peoples wishes, and please stop with the flaming and just useless banter that is more destructive than anything.<br>
<br>
I understand there is some anger, confusion, sadness at the recient events.  But it all boils down to the fact that people were unhappy and wished to move on.  This is a game, play it how you want to, but remember, a friend is a friend whether its over a chat screen, or over a cup of coffie.  Words can sometimes wound that, and those wounds are hard to heal.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts,<br>

She /telled me first. I did this on this board. I stand behind my beliefs, I just wish I wasnt so angry at that time. I never cursed except prolly said WTF once, twice maybe three times. <br>
<br>
Again, I apologize to Malasa for the anger I felt. Kookee is a young girl and she got what she described as hate tells from Malasa. That sent me over the edge, and I was M A D. I would defend a young person, especially a young lady presumably under 18 ferociously - that's how I am. If someone does something to a young person, I have a tendency to overreact due to RL kids issues, sorry here. I dont remember ever being that angry in this game before. Now my anger over Kookees hate tells (she described them as such) and tremendous frustration over Kays veto (which I saw as utterly ridiculous) sent me to type in caps and type furiously. Where I erred is also takin gmy frustration out on Malasa for some really stupid rules in ADA with respect to vetos over frivolous reasons. This was NOT her fault. It was the guilds rules and what I saw as flagrant abuse of them. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I will say it again. I deeply apologize to Malasa. If she can find it in her heart to forgive me for my heightended anger, as one woman to another, I would be very grateful to her. <br>
<br>
Quando. I dont even know what to say to you. I hardly know you. You attack me and all I can say to you is calm down. I have nothing against you or anyone in Ada, honestly. Stop worrying about some ppl in a game, that want to have fun. I would like nothing more that to see you guys have fun too. <br>
<br>
Let the healing begin. Let friendships be remade if they can be. Let the game be fun again. Let those of us unhappy move on and give us a chance. I wish AdA well too. I would never rule out some relationship with you guys.  <p><HTML>
