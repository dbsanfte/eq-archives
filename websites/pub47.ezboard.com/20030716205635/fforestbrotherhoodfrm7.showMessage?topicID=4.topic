<br>
Im feeling discouraged at Forest BrotherHood's Success. We have GREAT fun when we are all in chat channel, but Im feeling as if we no longer need eachother to get xp. The time I spend PLing or helping individuals to level often doesnt yeild much and those that I want to level SOOO BADLY arent on the same schedule as I am.<br>
<br>
I know Im not the center of the universe, NO ONE should have to please me but me. I was just trying to succeed where Furlina, and (the only real example that I have) Charadruer have failed. When they just UP and LEFT FB cause they said we couldnt help them do anything more because we are too low level to do anything with them, WE ALL SAID, &quot;Then Help us to Level&quot;. Thats what I am trying to do. <br>
<br>
I said that I would &quot;Go down with the ship&quot; with Forest BrotherHood. Ive been offered to join three other guilds LOL and said HELL NO lol, even got begged (by an officer, someone that ISNT Sadinie for a change LOL)to join Clan Battle Axe and promised the best armor in the game AND my epic, and I just laughed. <br>
<br>
I dont WANT to join these other guilds, I want Forest BrotherHood to succeed. And all Im saying is Im feeling discouraged and need some HAPPY chat to cheer me up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I love you all and I just wanted to let my feelings be know... Im sorry if I upset anyone (specially aerzene /kiss)<br>

I believe I'm ready to give up.  Have missed u Beta..  I played with u when you were a baby and ignored the entire guild to help u and sadinie raise when you werent even in the guild.  and now you guys are off on big bad missions that not everyone can join in (or dont need a druid).. or really cares about.  from what ive seen.. other guilds work on everyone's epics and needs as they can in acceptable time frames but we hardly have enuff people in that lvl range.  I have not even started my epic so that i can help other people along.  i have not kept up with forums so i prolly shouldnt even post here.  but dammitall.  I really actually agree with Beta.. but then i dont really care.  We are not an uber guild.  we are not able to PL everyone and from what i understand people dont really want to be PL'd.  we want to play.<br>
IF your ambitions for a guild are higher than what is possible with FB good luck and best wishes.   several good friends have taken that path.  I'm not trying to hold the guild together anymore.  And i see that Beta is getting frustrated as well.  Love you all dearly and I hope when i am able to start playing again regularly, that you wont mind fighting with me (heh.. assuming im somewhat sober)<br>
<br>
I have no idea what i just ranted about.. and prolly changed my mind several times while writing.. but .  well.  there's that.  i'll be playing rebekkahaz (my new warrior) for a bit to get outta the politics.. if anyone needs a ride or a buff scream at me..  ill relog<br>
going to slam a beer now  *kissez* to all da boyz n girlz of da hoood!!!<br>

          Anyways ..............just to let everyone know i do read all the post i just  don't always respond to them because i do prefer to talk in game rather then on the message board.<br>
          Beta and Nat i'm sorry you feel this way, I have been trying to lv aer so i can group with you   but then others are getting pissed at me because i am off leveling and not off doing other stuff.  It's very hard for me to do a bunch of stuff at once.<br>
          Now about the epics all you have to do is ask me give me a time and a place and i'll be there to help i can't help if no one ask.<br>
          I join this guild cause of key but if everyone is up and spliting ya  know there's nothing i can do about it.  Heck my best eq friend is putting back together legions of might or lords of might or something like that some pretty big guild that died off cause the leader left eq but didn't turn over his leadership so it kinda shut the whole thing down, so they all went to  a new guild but they're starting this one back up,................anywho i have been invited to this guild where there will be people i do group with all the time with anyways in. ... but i have turned them down too i told them that i like the FB too much.  Even know he has been there for me threw everything.................................but if everyone is going to get pissy and up and quite what am i suppose to do????<br>
           I'm sorry all .........and it's  not just you beta or you nat there are others too who are thinking and doing along the same lines as you.<br>
           Well you wanted a response and this is mine .......hmmmmmm.........don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing but there it is.<br>
           Hopefully i'll see every one later.........if ya all haven't quite by then.<br>
                                        Love Yaa<br>

Maybe I will ramble later but lets move ahead. Sorry I haven’t been posting much or replying but when I get time on the computer ( when the #@$%ing thing isn’t broke ) I just want to get into the game and play, hopefully when I get this computer fixed for good I will have more time to spend here on the website…but I do read everything.<br>
<br>
1.  Lets try to set a few nights aside for some “mob bashing” groups 2 or 3 nights a week just getting together and grouping as a guild for experience. Too many times I have logged in and we are all scattered through out the world of Norrath trying to find groups and experience, I think we have enough diversity in our characters to make some great groups and kick the @#%$ outa stuff and when most of us have PoP we can take advantage of the new raid experience grouping! It’s one of the best things I’ve seen Verant do in a long time and we need it!<br>
<br>
2.  Post some ideas for helping each other get that everwanted Epic piece we have been drooling over, or any item we have been wanting. So do the research on what you want…post your idea…schedule it ! and lets go get it !<br>
<br>
3.  Get involved with Ndf more, lets keep up with their  postings, events, and raids and lets get @#%$ together…we have an awesome ally and with the talent of both our Guilds we can overtake ANYTHING…<br>
<br>
Please folks lets start communicating and doing stuff before we go completely stagnate and the Hood dies… put down some ideas here….ANY ideas, you know I will follow you to death to help attain our goals, but if we don’t plan it we all end up going “Willy Nilly” all over Norrath not getting much done and getting frustrated. Also I will try to start getting on earlier I know most of you are a couple of hours ahead of me being in the Pacific time zone so I will start getting on around 7pm pst or earlier if possible. It’s going to take effort from ALL of us to get things coordinated and get back on track.<br>

“When we are young we have moments of such happiness we think we’re in some place magical, Then we grow up and our dreams fade into darkness - our hearts break into and scatter though a timeless void seeming never to mend, oh’ heart journey with me take me again to places of thy minds dreams, stand with me to face the void to summon the dreams of my youth, and we shall be made one again in our Soul Quest”.<br>
