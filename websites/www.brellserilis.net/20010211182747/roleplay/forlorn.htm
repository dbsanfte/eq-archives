                  <br>
                  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  fiery giant toppled to its knees with a groan of protest. He 
                  slipped back into a shadowy corner as the mighty band of adventurers 
                  rejoiced in their victory. The night was young, and the sojourn 
                  into the dragon's lair was going well... normally he would have 
                  partaken in the revelry, but this night he was silent. It was 
                  one of his dark times. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  wrong emotions were raging in him. Nothing had happened to spur 
                  this melancholy, but his usual facade of charm and easy humor 
                  would not slip into place. Angry at himself, he attempted to 
                  enter his meditative trance to rest and regain his energy for 
                  the trial ahead. After some time, too much time, peace found 
                  him and his mind started to clear. He started to relax, and 
                  remembered that he was here among friends. This... feeling of 
                  impending doom was just that; a feeling. Nothing could harm 
                  him, especially now - his eyes opened to slits as he glanced 
                  at the familiar faces around him. Vumil, dark in his robe of 
                  the Arch liches. Mufat and Napzard, busy keeping the younger 
                  members of the raid from pulling the entire castle down around 
                  their ears. Veranon, calmly receiving and discarding potential 
                  crises as they arose. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Miyke 
                  and Luna, comforting in their union... so many others, resplendent 
                  in the trophies they had won through long and hard fought battles. 
                  Tonight, among this company, he was invincible. Why then, was 
                  he afraid? </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fear... 
                  he only now realized that is what was troubling him. It was 
                  an unfamiliar thing; his dark heritage had somehow eliminated 
                  the relevance of that emotion to his existence. But he tasted 
                  it now, and again fought to master it. He was not afraid of 
                  the dragon; this company, under this leadership, would overcome 
                  it... it would be easier than when he, Daablo, Dracoh, and Kaiyn 
                  defeated the great red wyrm Infuranya all that time ago. For 
                  the first time this night, he smiled as he recalled the times 
                  spent with those old friends... </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                  a jolt, he came back to himself. His meditation was broken beyond 
                  recall. He had just thought back on fond memories... that he 
                  had never experienced. He was in turmoil. Those memories... 
                  could only have been Taruen's... could only have been his father's. 
                  He growled under his breath. The time had come to seek answers... 
                  Kaiyn... he must seek out the Lord Darious, and get some answers.
