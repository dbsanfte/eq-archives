                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  could taste the sea from the gates of the Free City. It was 
                  a clear night over the dusty old port town, the sky adorned 
                  with a pale-shining moon which cast over me a halo of argent 
                  light, setting my skin in silver. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Duty 
                  had summoned me to the city of men: my Mistress demanded a human 
                  life this night. But for a time I stood quietly before the silent 
                  sleeping town and tasted the glory of the night, it's soft illumination 
                  bringing beauty to an otherwise decomposing landscape. The ragged 
                  tents and dilapidated carts which littered the outskirts of 
                  the Free Port turned spectral and timeless under the hex of 
                  lunar light. And under the city I could feel the seething fury 
                  of the Dismal Rage, those mortal men and women who bow down 
                  to the Prince of Hate. While I find their beliefs distasteful, 
                  their songs' beauty belies the Hatred they serve. They were 
                  wolves howling under a savage moon, and if my heart was not 
                  bound to another, I might have joined them that night, so ferociously 
                  did the night sky call to me. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  sound of bone shards scattered in dust, like insects scuttling 
                  through broken stonework. My servant came to me under that pale 
                  light, blackened bones and eyes of vermillion flame searing 
                  the bewitching spell of midnight.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Stay close. Be not far from me." I whispered into the sweet 
                  darkness. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With 
                  my very being I hear ye and obey, master," came the hissed response. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  man I had come to meet, to greet, to strike down, was a night 
                  watchman to the gates of Freeport. A corrupt man bound and shackled 
                  to the Father of the Teir'Dal by bribes and lies, I felt no 
                  remorse in the task which lay before me. So engrossed in my 
                  work, I never felt the kindred heart beating close by, hidden 
                  in the shadowed corner of a city wall. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Cephian 
                  Topplo, I have been called by my mistress to bring ye low." 
                  My fingers wove the darkness thick and binding around his legs, 
                  his arms, his eyes. So bound by shadows his strides faltered 
                  as he rose his militia blade against me. I smiled slightly, 
                  and before him my will rose up against him, wings unfurled and 
                  eyes mad with slaughter. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"See 
                  the rising dark in which your shadowed soul shall go and fear

                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  His eyes grew wide and wild; his blade dropped from his numbed 
                  hands. He turned to flee from the terrors I had forced into 
                  his foul mind.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Spirit Guardian. Take him, and spare no assault."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Had darkness not bound his throat tightly, all of the human 
                  city would have heard his cries that night as the old bones 
                  beset his mortal frame. He fell silently before the hands of 
                  my servant. My work was finished in the city of men. I turned 
                  to go. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turning 
                  about I saw before me a teir'dal woman garbed in robes of pale 
                  blue silk, bound in golden embroidery. Her stark white hair 
                  framed a face of timeless beauty, which in turn framed eyes 
                  of endless cruelty. Her smile was a twisted serpent upon her 
                  face, coiled and vicious. She was an elite of the teir'dal and 
                  a chosen noble from the Lodge of the Dead, my former temple 
                  and initial place of learning.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  And when she spoke, it was the sound of soft-falling rain, which 
                  prophesied a thunderstorm. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Destain, 
                  your name is famous in the Lodge of the Dead. They say you are 
                  mad with the potency of the necromantic arts, and best exterminated 
                  for your sacriligious faith. But they, for all their art and 
                  cunning, could not find you." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"you 
                  did not seem to have any difficulty finding me, mistress," I 
                  responded quietly, silently calling to my mind the words of 
                  poison with which I could plague her young veins should she 
                  strike out against me. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Under 
                  such a night, and so close to a temple of the Father, how could 
                  I have any difficulty?" she smirked back at me, her youth captivating 
                  and strangely unbefitting her spirit. She felt old to me somehow.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "I have searched in the Library of Neriak for the word and means 
                  by which to call forth the greatest strengths of our art, but 
                  the Lodge of the Dead preserves its secrets out of jealousy. 
                  I searched you out initially to stike you down. Seeing you now 
                  I know I cannot. The rewards the Lodge would bestow upon me 
                  are not worth the risk, regardless." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Pray 
                  sister, what would ye ask of me then?"</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  responded in teir'dal. She smiled again. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
                  search for the ethereal words which make a living soul turn 
                  cold, make the body old, turn the flesh to bone. I wish above 
                  all the title of Lich.." her words trailed off as in my mind 
                  I called forth the incantation.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "my Walker of the Violet Twilight, show me what it is to die...," 
                  I sighed to the night, and before her my flesh dissolved away 
                  from my very bones. Under the light of that savage moon I stood 
                  before her, bones bared and glistening like polished stone, 
                  my eyes twin sparks of fire in cold sockets. Her serpent smile 
                  froze on her face, her eyes widened.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Protect me Father.." she whispered. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  reached into a pouch on my belt, and withdrew a soiled piece 
                  of paper upon which the formula for the process was enscribes. 
                  My fleshless hand held it out to her. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Take 
                  it child, and pray the Father protects you from it's knowledge."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Her thin fingers drew it from my hand, and she smiled again.
