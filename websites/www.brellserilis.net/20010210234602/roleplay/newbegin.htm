                  <br>
                  Kaiyn Darious stood quietly behind Lokus, his ever vigilant 
                  eyes scanning the upper balconies of the temple of Solusek Ro, 
                  looking for the slightest hint of something out of the ordinary. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  words of initiation being pronounced to the new members were 
                  no more than a faint buzz in his ears, as were the antics of 
                  some of the younger women within the guild, joking back and 
                  forth like so many adolescents at play. Momentarily he wondered 
                  what he was doing there, how he had ended up as a body guard 
                  to the ruling family of a prestigious guild. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                  was little profit to be gained from such things; certainly the 
                  risks by far outweighed the advantages. He was a spy, a soldier 
                  at best and a year before he would have laughed at himself for 
                  being in such a position. And yet he found himself filled with 
                  emotions alien to him. A strange feeling of affection for the 
                  unlikely gathering of people that stood before him. But such 
                  feelings would only bring him disharmony, and so he dutifully 
                  pushed them to a deep corner of his mind where they would remain 
                  until called upon. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking 
                  around at the assembled members of Evoluxa, he knew beyond any 
                  doubt that soon they would be plunged into war. He had experienced 
                  such situations before, a firm code of moral beliefs that threatened 
                  and often insulted those around it. Certainly such an organization 
                  would not remain unmolested for long. Softly he chuckled to 
                  himself, drawing a few looks from those around him. Only a short 
                  time ago he had infiltrated and eventually eliminated just such 
                  an organization, under the contract of the so called loving 
                  followers of Tunare.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  He could still hear the helpless cries of the young mother as 
                  his men allowed her the final mercy, could still see the defeated 
                  and broken looks upon her father's and husband's faces as he 
                  himself decapitated the only son, a boy of twelve. Let none 
                  live, that was what he had been told, and he had been efficient 
                  in the completion of his task. There was no love lost between 
                  the followers of Tunare and the dark elven worshippers of Innoruk. 
                  They had wanted this family's destruction to set an example 
                  to all those who would dare attempt to take their unholy faiths 
                  beyond the protection of their own forest. They had paid him 
                  well indeed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  retributive strike of the family's guild was disorganized without 
                  their leader and was easily countered. Soon every last member 
                  had been hunted down and placed securely within magical cages, 
                  to be transported back to the city of Felwithe where they would 
                  eventually be tried and convicted of crimes they had most likely 
                  not committed. None of these things mattered to Kaiyn. He was 
                  a soldier and he did his job well. His normal indifference and 
                  strict adherence to duty along with the pursuit of wealth had 
                  changed when he encountered Lokus and Evoluxa. He could relate 
                  to the man. Lokus's doctrine of hate and his excellent sense 
                  of tact and diplomacy attracted Kaiyn almost immediately. Perhaps 
                  he had found a cause worthy of defending.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  He had yet to see. For the time being however he would complete 
                  his assigned duties as high protector of the Z'Asrithe family, 
                  even to the point of giving his own life to save theirs. After 
                  all, death was not such an unwelcome concept that he would have 
                  cause to fear it. The barest traces of a smile shadowed the 
                  corners of his mouth as the meeting was called to a close. Bowing 
                  formally to the new members, he welcomed them to the order of 
                  Evoluxa, along with the cheers and hollars of some of the more 
                  enthusiastic members. He had a few things of importance to do 
                  yet that evening, amongst those meeting with the son of a former 
                  friend, Xaviel Baen'blade. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turning 
                  to Lokus he saluted him crisply, asked his permission to leave, 
                  and strode out of the dimly lit temple, emerging once more into 
                  the ash choked air of the Lavastorm Mountains.... <br>
