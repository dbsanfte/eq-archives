                  Tales of Aeani Fairblade (Chap 2)</b> <br>
                  <br>
                  The city of Qeynos, home of Paladins, Clerics, Monks, and Warriors, 
                  and it is one of the Human’s oldest cities founded by the infamous 
                  Antonius Bayle. It is here that Aeani considers a home and has 
                  been for as long as she can remember, but she cannot stop thinking 
                  of other places she can be at and see. Today, she continues 
                  her training as a Paladin, forging her loyalty to Rodcet Nife, 
                  city of Qeynos, and Antonius Bayle. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Fairblade, 
                  you’re late again,” Camlend Serbold said. “Please, try not to 
                  disappoint me. You have been this temple’s best student but 
                  recently hesitating to show up on time. Now go grab yourself 
                  a sword and report to Astaed Wemor to continue with your training.” 
                  Aeani bows to him and walks over to grab a rusty sword from 
                  the small pile of weapons near the shop. There are other people 
                  training with Astaed, and he begins to explain to them the basics 
                  of melee combat. Aeani returns to them with the blade resting 
                  on her right shoulder. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Gah-hahaha! 
                  These villans will be no match for me! Evil skeletons, fear 
                  my wrath,” one of the new Paladins said while swing his sword 
                  around. Aeani shakes her head while looking at the ground smiling. 
                  He holds out his hand towards her and says, “Hail, my name is 
                  Daelan, Daelan Darksky, but you can call me Dae.” Aeani just 
                  looks at him. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Everyone, 
                  she has finally decided to join us. Let’s continue with our 
                  training!” Astaed glares at Aeani and then starts to explain 
                  about combat. Daelan still has his hand held out towards her, 
                  but Aeani simply lowers her head and rests her eyes. He tucks 
                  his hand away and turns his attention to Astaed Wemor.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Aeani begins to remember the dream she had this morning, “A 
                  land surrounded by lava and scorched hills. It has to be the 
                  Lavastorm Mountains I’ve read about, but I don’t know why I 
                  would want be there. Am I destined to perish by the blade of 
                  a Dark El…”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “Fairblade! Is there something troubling you that’s more important 
                  than training?” Astaed said while pointing his sword at her. 
                  Aeani looks at him. He reads her answer within her eyes, nods, 
                  and continues his explanation of basic combat. “Now that we’re 
                  all familiar of how to carry a sword, everyone grab yourself 
                  a partner and practice swinging your swords at each other. If 
                  you get injured, then come get me or a Cleric immediately.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Aeani faces Daelan and holds out her hand, “Aeani Fairblade.” 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daelan 
                  looks at her hand and then at her eyes. He gladly holds her 
                  forearm while she holds his. “Well met, Aeani. Shall we get 
                  started?” Aeani nods, lets go of his arm, and holds out her 
                  sword, standing ready. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                  what seems to only have been a few hours of practice and training, 
                  the sun begins to set. Everyone tosses their swords back onto 
                  the pile of weapons and exits the temple. While Aeani starts 
                  leaving the Temple of Life, Camlend moves infront of her to 
                  make her stop.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “Aeani, Astaed told me of your actions earlier today which revealed 
                  to me that you are having a problem. You were very distracted 
                  today, and I’m guessing it’s the reason why you’ve been late 
                  these past mornings. Please, tell me what’s troubling you.” 
                  Camlend looks down at Aeani, but she turns to her side and stares 
                  ahead of her, not at him. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
                  turns her head to glance up to Camlend’s eyes and says, “Have 
                  you ever had a glimpse of a fate that clearly reveals how you 
                  will perish?” Aeani looks ahead of her again. “I have.” He blinks 
                  in disbelief, and Aeani walks out into the hallway, leaving 
                  the temple.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  At the end of the hallway stands Daelan, waiting for Aeani. 
                  Aeani pauses to look at him, but she continues to walk out the 
                  hallway. Daelan tries to grab her attention, “Hey, you were 
                  pretty good with that sword today!” Aeani keeps walking towards 
                  the north gate with Daelan following behind her. “Not too bad 
                  for a ‘fair blade.’”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Aeani stops and turns her head to look over her shoulder at 
                  Daelan, who’s still behind her, “What’s that supposed to mean?” 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Eh? 
                  Oh, I really didn’t mean anything by it. I’m just joking around! 
                  Lighten up, friend!” He chuckles to himself, but Aeani continues 
                  walking again. “Wait wait! I hope I didn’t upset you or anything. 
                  I’m just trying to cheer you up. How about I buy you a drink 
                  over at Crow’s tavern?” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aeani 
                  smiles and says, “Daelan, I’m just going to relax for the night. 
                  Thanks for the offer and kindness, though. I’ll hold you up 
                  to that next time, hey?”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “Okay! I look forward to it, Aeani! Until next time!” He runs 
                  ahead of her to turn around to wave (almost tripping himself 
                  to the ground), then he continues running ahead of her and into 
                  the tavern. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aeani 
                  visits a pool next to Crow’s Tavern that she likes to spend 
                  time next to for reading several books about other cities and 
                  continents. She hasn’t realized that Camlend has always noticed 
                  her reading here. For the rest of her night, she reads a book 
                  about Faydwer and wades her feet in the pool. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  next morning, she wakes up early and visits the Temple of Life, 
                  carrying the book she hasn’t finish reading yet. Camlend, Astaed, 
                  and the others are not here yet, so she sits next to the Pool 
                  of Jahnda and relaxes her feet in the water. She opens her book, 
                  lies down on her back, and begins to read. Aeani moves her book 
                  from her eyes and looks up to see Camlend standing next to her. 
                  She quickly stands up and puts away the book into her bag. Camlend 
                  remains standing while holding his hands behind his back. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Sir 
                  Serbold, I did not know I was causing trouble with the Koalindl. 
                  I love the feeling of them swimming between my fight while I 
                  read.” Aeani lowers her head and closes her eyes, but Camlend 
                  places his left hand on her shoulder. “Aeani,” Camlend begins 
                  to say, “a thousand travel books do not make up for one real 
                  journey.” Aeani looks up and stares at him. Camlend smiles and 
                  hands her a newly crafted Longsword and kite shield. She looks 
                  at her new sword and shield in awe and shock. “They’re from 
                  Astaed Wemor, and he gives you his wishes and hopes to see you 
                  again. We all do.” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aeani 
                  gives him a hug with tears in her eyes. Without any more words 
                  exchanged, she looks up to him, smiles, bows, and starts to 
                  walk away, but she turns around to look back at Camlend Serbold. 
                  He only smiles and nods at her. She nods back and leaves the
