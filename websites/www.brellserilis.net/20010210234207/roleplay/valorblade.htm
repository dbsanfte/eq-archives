                  The Tesch Mal Gnoll sniffed the air, peering about in the darkness. 
                  He turned to growl at a passing Lieth Val, the lesser of the 
                  species. Flexing his powerful muscles, the warrior caste Gnoll 
                  marched on his regular patrol route, padding quietly down the 
                  halls of Splitpaw, the newest addition to the Tesch Empire. 
                  He gripped his sword lightly, his head moved back and forth, 
                  scanning the halls for any sign of danger. His ears perked and 
                  twisted forward. Ahead, towards the entrance to the vast dungeon, 
                  the faint cry of a Lieth could be heard. Gesturing to another 
                  Tesch, he moved quickly down the hallway towards the sound. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“BLOOD 
                  AND GLORY FOR VALORBLADE!!!!” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  Gnolls growled at the cry. As they neared the entrance room, 
                  the sound of blades crashing and the burst of magic grew louder. 
                  There was a final cry from a Lieth and then silence. The two 
                  Tesches looked at each other, moving to stand in formation to 
                  block the door. They gripped their weapons tightly and waited. 
                  Dantes grinned at Lanneth as the two paused, backs to a wall 
                  and waited. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  ranger closed his eyes and smiled. His hands flashed before 
                  his leaders face. Two Gnolls around the corner, at the end of 
                  the hall. Dantes nodded and they both drew forth their bows. 
                  The Valorblades spun around the corner and loosed their shafts. 
                  One Tesch yelped as two arrows struck home. The warriors vanished 
                  around the corner and, with a furious bark, the two gnolls gave 
                  pursuit. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Incoming!!” 
                  Shouted Dantes as he and Lanneth sprinted into the room and 
                  formed up alongside Omenn and Samildinatch. Behind the wall 
                  of armor and weapons, Olmotos stood patiently, robes rustling. 
                  His slender hands moved quickly and his tongue began to curl 
                  around the harsh syllables of a spell. Bakin grinned as he hefted 
                  his weapon and squared his shoulders. His rough dwarven voice 
                  rang out in the caverns as the two Gnolls burst into the room. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Behold 
                  the power of Valorblade and run in fear!!!”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  In seconds, both Gnolls discovered that they should have listened 
                  to the dwarf.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  As the smoke cleared from the brief battle, Dantes looked about. 
                  “Is everyone unhurt?” Calm nods assured him that all was well. 
                  The commander grinned. “Let us move on then… Captain Shadowborn, 
                  if you would take the point please.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “A pleasure sir.” Lanneth grinned and padded quietly ahead, 
                  his bright half-elven eyes scanning the floors for tracks and 
                  Gnollsign. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Move 
                  out.” Dantes growled. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  Emerald Warrior led the way, followed by Olmotos and Bakin, 
                  flanked by Samildinatch and Omenn. All eyes were alert, senses 
                  tuned. The small party had planned this raid for weeks. Rather 
                  than alert the entire stronghold with a full frontal attack, 
                  they planned to use stealth and wit to battle their way down 
                  deep into the stronghold and make a point to the arrogant Gnolls 
                  by killing one of their council… The infamous Tesch Val Kadvem. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lanneth 
                  grinned as he crept ahead of the main force. He moved from shadow 
                  to shadow, not as skilled as a thief but… he grinned, skilled 
                  enough for the task at hand. Peering around a corner, he spotted 
                  two gnolls guarding the double doors that led to their first 
                  objective. He waited and watched. One began to cast a spell, 
                  shielding his companion. The ranger grinned and quietly prepared 
                  his own counterspell. He released the magic around the shielded 
                  gnoll. His magic tore away the shield and the ranger sprang 
                  up and loosed an arrow at the caster before spinning on his 
                  heel and sprinting towards his comrades. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Incoming!!!” 
                  he cried. Ahead he heard the crash of steel as weapons were 
                  drawn and a tight formation formed. The ranger slipped alongside 
                  his commander and quickly spoke. “Two… caster and warrior..” 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dantes 
                  nodded calmly. His eyes grew cold. “You know what to do.” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  warrior sprinted around the corner and was met with whirling 
                  blades and harsh magics. Behind him he heard the Nisch Mal caster 
                  beginning a spell. The Tesch grinned. The Nisch would make quick 
                  work of them. “Sergeant Bitz!” Dantes growled. “On it sir!!” 
                  the dwarf yelled above the hissing of magic. “By Brell, ye shall 
                  not cast yer evils in my presence!!” Bakin raised his arms and 
                  directed his holy might at the Niche. With a roaring blast, 
                  the cleric’s magic struck the gnoll and knocked it from its 
                  feet, interrupting its spell. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Now!!” 
                  Cried Dantes, and the four warriors leapt past the Tesch and 
                  surrounded the stunned caster. Blades flashed and rent flesh 
                  and bone. The Nisch Mal Gnoll gasped and collapsed to the ground. 
                  The warriors whirled to face the Tesch. Lanneth shielded his 
                  eyes as the gnoll blew apart before him. As the smoke cleared, 
                  Olmotos calmly wiped bits of flesh from his robes. “You know,” 
                  the Tier’dal quietly whispered, “You shouldn’t leave your backs 
                  exposed like that.” Laughter filled the halls of Splitpaw for 
                  the first time in ages. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Okay.” 
                  Whispered Dantes… we have to kill the guards… there will be 
                  many. This will tax our skills to the fullest. Fail me not Valorblade. 
                  This is what we have trained for.” The warrior rose and saluted. 
                  Five fists returned his salute, crashing into breastplates and 
                  chests. Dantes took one last look over his warriors and strode 
                  off to lure the guards in to the ambush.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Lanneth glanced around the room at his companions. Omenn smiled 
                  warmly, reassuring the younger ranger. Samildinatch growled, 
                  eager for the upcoming battle. His hands glowed with cold light, 
                  filled with power. Far off, Lanneth’s ears detected the sound 
                  of a twanging bowstring. He heard a faint cry… and another… 
                  and another… and another… and … </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Oh 
                  hell…” the ranger whispered. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dantes 
                  burst into the room, eyes glazed, blood coming from a gash in 
                  his head. Lanneth moved aside to allow his commander to step 
                  beside him but instead cried out in pain! Dantes struck at the 
                  ranger again and again, The powerful warrior drove his blades 
                  deep into Lanneth’s flesh as the ranger struggled to parry. 
                  “Omenn and Bakin both filled Lanneth with healing magic. Lanneth 
                  began a spell, struggling to focus amidst the flurry of blows. 
                  As he released the dispel, freeing Dantes from the controlling 
                  magics of a Rosch Val Gnoll, the room was filled with barking 
                  and the roar of magic. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Form 
                  up!!” cried Lanneth! Dantes shook his head clear and joined 
                  ranks. The four warriors stood as a wal as a tide of Gnolls, 
                  the elite of the Splitpaw guards, crashed upon it like a wave 
                  on rock. As the room rocked with magical power, Bakin calmly 
                  focused his divine power upon the warriors, healing them and 
                  lending them the strength of Brell. Olmotos watched the Valorblade 
                  fighters choose a target, he focused his mind and drew together 
                  his powers. Plaster cracked and a deafening boom shook the room 
                  as he released his power, smashing a Rosch Val from its feet 
                  to lie broken on the floor.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Samildinatch growled as another blade bounced from his shield. 
                  The room was filled with gnolls. Far in the back of the room, 
                  the shadowknight spied a wizened old gnoll healing the warriors 
                  in the front. Crashing his shoulder into one Tesch Val, the 
                  warrior forced his way forward. Blows rang off his armor and 
                  Gnolls turned to attack his back. Dantes, Omenn and Lanneth 
                  flanked him quickly, drawing off the enemies, forming a wedge, 
                  Sam at the point. The dark knight grunted in pain as blows pierced 
                  his armor but drove forward, eyes fixed on the healer. He smashed 
                  a Tesch out of his way with his shield and launched himself 
                  forward at the healer. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“DIE!!” 
                  he cried and stretched out his hand, his touch released the 
                  dreadful powers held inside a shadowknight… the result was terrible. 
                  The gnoll healer twisted in horrible pain, its back arched… 
                  and cracked. The creature’s eyes burst from their sockets. It 
                  twitched for a moment and lay still. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Omenn 
                  grasped Sam’s ankle in one powerful hand and dragged him back 
                  to safety. The four warriors reformed ranks and stared out a 
                  the sea of Gnolls still left. The battle raged!</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gnoll 
                  after gnoll fell before the Valorblade warriors. Olmotos rained 
                  death upon the creatures as they struggled to reach the calm 
                  caster behind the wall of armor and weapons. Suddenly, the wall 
                  broke.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  A massive Tesch Val gnoll forced his way between Lanneth and 
                  Dantes. A blow caught the ranger aside the head and the room 
                  spun. Olmotos cried out in pain and the warriors spun to protect 
                  him. In that moment, the Splitpaw guard howled in triumph as 
                  four burly guards closed in on their primary target… Sergeant 
                  Bakin Bitz.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  The dwarf stubbornly stood his ground, ignoring the slashing 
                  weapons and pounding fists to pour healing into the weakening 
                  Olmotos. His head spun as another blow struck him. “Farewell 
                  boys…” he growled. Lanneth shook his head clear. “NO!” he cried 
                  as he watched Bakin struggle. The ranger launched himself forward! 
                  His blades flashed and magic roared. He taunted and yelled. 
                  He kicked at one and struck at another. His magic flared, stinging 
                  and angering the gnolls. First one… then two, three and four 
                  turned upon the little ranger. Bakin’s magic flared and the 
                  dwarf sighed as his wounds closed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lanneth 
                  could see nothing but Gnolls. Surrounded, he fought to stay 
                  alive long enough for help to arrive. Blow after blow rained 
                  upon him and he felt his knees grow weak. His vision blurred.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Omenn threw aside a Tesch Gnoll and drove his massive sword 
                  through the chest of another. The paladin reached down and gently 
                  touched Lanneth on the brow. “Be healed, my brother in arms.” 
                  Omenn whispered and poured his own strength into the dying half-elf. 
                  Lanneth rose to see the last of the Tesch Val gnolls fleeing. 
                  Swiftly he snared the beast and moved to block its exit. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Braaaaaak!! 
                  You cannot defeat the might of the Tesch Empire!!” The Tesch 
                  Val Kadvem burst into the room, sword in hand, as the last guard 
                  fell. The weary party closed ranks and met the gnoll’s furious 
                  assault with grim determination. “I have not the strength to 
                  heal!” cried Bakin as he meditated, searching for the divine 
                  power he needed to preserve his companions’ lives. Lanneth glanced 
                  at Olmotos, reading the fatigue and wear on the dark elf’s mind. 
                  He had taxed his magic to the limit. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                  that dark hour Dantes De’Durre roared in the half-light, deep 
                  within Splitpaw, “Blood and Glory for Valorblade!!!!” Lanneth 
                  grinned, Omenn spun his wicked two handed blade and Samildinatch 
                  growled coldly. As one they squared off against the Kadvem. 
                  As one they whispered, cold and deadly… “die.” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blades 
                  whistled through the air and the Kadvem screamed. He spun towards 
                  Dantes only to be struck by Sam’s shield behind the head. Recovering, 
                  he whirled to face the shadowknight. Omenn struck out with his 
                  holy might, almost knocking the beast from its feet with his 
                  spell, stunning the gnoll again. As it faced the paladin, Lanneth 
                  released his own spell, thousands of insects whirled around 
                  the gnoll, biting and stinging. All the while, Dantes’ twin 
                  blades carved great gashes in the Kadvem’s flesh.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Fear struck the beast and it turned to flee. Roots burst from 
                  the ground and grasped its legs. Darkness swept over the gnoll 
                  and it was blinded. Six blades ended its life as the four warriors 
                  struck in tandem. The Kadvem was no more. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten 
                  minutes later, a roving patrol came upon the first sign of the 
                  carnage. The alarm was sounded and hundreds of gnolls poured 
                  from the barracks and flooded the hallways of Splitpaw but no 
                  intruders could be found. The council was assembled… and the 
                  absence of the Kadvem noted with anger… as one they stalked 
                  to the Tesch Val Kadvem’s chamber, pounding on the door, demanding 
                  to know why he was late. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  door splintered as guards smashed it in… they howled and turned 
                  away from the room in disgust. The council members gasped as 
                  they peered into the room. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There, 
                  deep within the stronghold of the most powerful gnoll tribe 
                  in history, fear reigned. The Kadvem had been nailed to the 
                  wall, a great ‘V’ carved in its chest. Written above the corpse, 
                  in its own blood, was a message scribed in fluent gnoll, courtesy 
                  of Olmotos.</font></p>
