                  <br>
                  The setting sun danced over my skin that warm afternoon. I had 
                  made camp by the ocean for the night, as I couldn’t stand to 
                  be away from the deep waters for too long. A small seaweed-fed 
                  fire crackled in front of my small tent – oysters were roasting 
                  in the coals. I was glad for the solitude – almost no one came 
                  by here at night and those who did had no desire to remain for 
                  long. The undead risen from the sunken tombs of the Elder High 
                  Elves saw to the removal of any who lingered too long. What 
                  little magic I knew served to keep the creatures well away from 
                  my camp. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                  that security firmly held in my mind, I was startled to look 
                  up from the fire and see the soft gleam of a skeleton – staring, 
                  empty-eyed, directly at me. With a silent curse for having been 
                  so off my guard, I reached for the sword that lay beside me. 
                  It wasn’t there. Disconcerted, I rose slowly and prepared to 
                  banish the skeleton back to its sandy tomb. I raised my hands… 
                  and froze. Just beyond the fire there was a figure, enshrouded 
                  in black – I could not make it out except for the gleam of eyes, 
                  snapping at me. When he saw I could not move, the figure drew 
                  nearer. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Greetings, 
                  my lady,” he said, bowing before me. “We saw your fire in the 
                  night and thought perhaps you might like some company. This 
                  is a most dangerous area.” He took a seat near the fire, which 
                  cast shadows and shapes across his dark features. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although 
                  I found that I was unable to speak, my limbs seemed to be functioning 
                  again – and I cautiously sat down on the opposite side of the 
                  fire from this strange man and his… servant? I still couldn’t 
                  see my sword although I looked for it as my eyes wandered over 
                  my strange visitors. I had no doubt that what was in front of 
                  me was a necromancer. I had seen them before, but always at 
                  a distance through the woods of my home – I never dared to go 
                  closer. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“What 
                  is your name, dark one?” I asked hesitantly. “I am Taerma, of 
                  the temple of Quellious.” He grimaced slightly at the name of 
                  my god, although he did smile almost pleasantly on hearing my 
                  name. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“I 
                  am Humwawa, and I serve no one but the Walker of the Violet 
                  Twilight.”</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  We noticed the knife I had by the fire for the oysters at the 
                  same time, but he had it in his hand before I could even make 
                  a try for it. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Oysters,” 
                  he smiled. “Do let me open them for you my lady – I would hate 
                  to see those hands marred by a cut from their sharp shells.” 
                  He caught the first one up out of the fire, deftly pried it 
                  open and handed it to me. As I gingerly took it from his hands, 
                  I found my voice restored as well. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“What 
                  are you here for, my lord?” I asked, almost too quietly to be 
                  heard.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “Nothing, save your company – I was watching you while you made 
                  camp and thought some conversation might pass the time better 
                  than my usual nightly activities.” He laughed, and the shadow 
                  that hung over me passed away into the sands. “Do not fear me, 
                  young paladin. I am not sent here for you. You aren’t eating.” 
                  He looked at me expectantly.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  I raised the shell to my lips slowly, never taking my eyes off 
                  him. He returned the gaze steadily, and the slightest hint of 
                  a smile played across the corners of his mouth as I set the 
                  shell back down by the fire. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Now 
                  my lady, what talk shall we pass the night with? What topic 
                  interests a paladin such as yourself?” He grinned, and I could 
                  see him laughing at the stiffness with which I responded. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“No 
                  topic interests me but that of honor, my lord.” I grew bolder. 
                  “And I would be loathe to have the advantage of you in what 
                  should be a pleasant conversation.” I stared directly back at 
                  him now, as I was regaining my strength.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  “Ah, honor. Such a noble subject for discourse. Perhaps that 
                  would be quite interesting. I think you will find I can hold 
                  my own on that theme, my lady.” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                  did – more than adequately. We talked into the night of honor, 
                  duty, and of the various and many places where life and death 
                  came together in the world. We talked for an eternity, until 
                  the sky began to slowly pale. He glanced above him. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“My 
                  lady, I fear I have kept you from your sleep with our conversation. 
                  With as many strangers as pass through here in the daylight, 
                  it is unsafe for you to sleep alone.” He smiled, gently this 
                  time. “Rest, my lady. My servant and I shall guard you while 
                  you sleep. There is still so much more to talk about, perhaps 
                  when you awake we can discuss such matters further. For now, 
                  rest.” </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">---</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  When I awoke, I found my sword lying next to my blanket, as 
                  if it had never moved at all. I glanced over and saw the fire 
                  crackling red in the twilight. And beside it… a dark shadow 
                  sat watching me, smiling quietly to see me rise to greet him.
