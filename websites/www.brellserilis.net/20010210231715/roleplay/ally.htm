                  I paused to catch my breath. I searched the night sky for signs 
                  of morning. With a heavy heart I realized the night was still 
                  young. How far had I ran? It mattered not at the moment, my 
                  persuer was tracking me still. I flung my backpack somewhere 
                  into the mud and continued, the incessant rain had made it a 
                  burden too much to bear. On and on I ran, my footprints leaving 
                  my enemy a tell tale trail to follow. I remember being tired 
                  then, and knew the end would be soon. On I ran still, my fear 
                  the only thing keeping me on my feet. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crossing 
                  a small hillock my foot caught in an exposed root and I collapsed 
                  in a heap to the ground. Lightning flashed and the moon was 
                  gone, was it that close to dawn? A sliver of hope entered my 
                  heart then. In utter darkness I prayed silently to Tunare for 
                  the end of this nightmare to be soon. I tried to pull myself 
                  to my feet, and failed. Silent I laid there, gathering my resolution 
                  to at least meet my end standing on my own two feet. A massive 
                  claw gripped me by the shoulder, and with one arm this beast 
                  set me upon my feet. Terror gripped me. This was not my tracker! 
                  I cautiosly looked upon the face of my certain death and realized 
                  his massive body must have been what blocked out the moon. His 
                  thick and scaled green hide was covered with plates of blue 
                  armor and dripped the ichor of countless beings. In his other 
                  hand he carried a cruel shaped axe, made for inflicting pain 
                  as much as it was for the slaughter. Our eyes met, mine widening 
                  in fear, his narrowing in cruel scrutiny. Those purple orbs 
                  shone with a dull light from underneath his spiked helm. Did 
                  he smile? He loosed the grip on my shoulder and smelled the 
                  air. What he possibly could have smelled or heard through the 
                  thunderstorm I cannot comprehend. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                  gave me a small nudge and released his hold on me. "Ghro" He 
                  said gruffly and pointed in the direction of the Free Port. 
                  My feet would not move, never before had I felt such fear. With 
                  small effort he embedded the cruel looking axe in a nearby tree 
                  and began fussing in one of the several packs he carried. In 
                  short order he produced two more axes of a smaller variety. 
                  He was getting ready for battle? Flinging his packs aside he 
                  began to sharpen a silvery axe that glimmered coldly in the 
                  moonlight. He smiled then, slightly, as if this was some small 
                  and warm comfort to him in the world that treated him coldly. 
                  I turned to run and found myself face to face with the skeletal 
                  servant of my tracker.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  I reached for my weapon at the same time I realized I had lost 
                  it on the trail somewhere. A skeletal hand smashed into my body, 
                  knocking me to the ground, I thought I heard the sound of cold 
                  laughter behind me, but it was cut short by an earth shattering 
                  roar. It seemed a troll had a lust for battle. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                  harsh word was spoken in Tier'Dal and the skeletal attacker 
                  halted. Hissing a response to it's master it remained to stand 
                  above me as I sat there, in utter disbelief of the situation. 
                  The necromancer strode from the cover of the swamp to stand 
                  in front of the frenzied troll. Taking a firm and confident 
                  stance in front of the troll the two regarded eachother quietly 
                  for several moments. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
                  spoke in common then.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "You must leave me to do my work. How dare you interfere with 
                  the wishes of Neriak? You may rest assured I will report your 
                  insolence to the proper authorities there. Should you ever show 
                  your face there again, you will be killed on sight. Now leave 
                  me beast, do not try to interfere or I shall slay you as well. 
                  In the Father's name it shall be done."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Huar!" The troll bellowed back. "Yu tink yer so smart. Dis 
                  da swamp. Dis not naughtie elfie town. TROLLS rule da swamp, 
                  me sez yer no welcum heer!" A light of seething, primal anger 
                  flashed across his face. "Jus cuz yus kin use da majik yus tink 
                  ya kin boss trolls round. Not no mor, yer reign ends heer n 
                  now!" Ushering forth a roar that seemed to shake the foundation 
                  of the world itself he lept foreward, knocking the dark elf 
                  off his feet. He brought the axes down upon the skeletal servant 
                  in heavy blows, I heard the snapping of bone. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  servant and troll battled back and forth, raining blow after 
                  blow upon eachother. Bone chips and blood began to cover the 
                  ground. The fenzy of melee combat was intense, the servant hissed, 
                  creaked, and laughed cruelly. The troll was strangely quiet, 
                  only now and then would he grunt as he swung as if to add more 
                  force to the bone shatering blows he was landing. I heard the 
                  incantations of magic, it was the necromancer's foul voice. 
                  I swore. I prayed silently to Tunare, focusing on the undead 
                  servant, it seemed and age passed then. A darkness seeped up 
                  from the swamp and swallowed the troll inside it's spectral 
                  mass. I finished my prayer and the skeleton was dismissed. I 
                  whirled round to seek out the necromancer but he was gone. I 
                  heard nothing but the troll bellowing in pain from the cruel 
                  spell that had been unleashed upon him. I dispelled the darkness 
                  from him and slumped to the ground. I was spent, I had no magical 
                  power from which to call from anymore. I could see my "benefactor" 
                  was in much pain, but would be damned if he'd admit it. Pieces 
                  of his armor had either fallen off or been beaten off and his 
                  left forearm was broken. Amazingly he still held his weapon 
                  in his left hand, though it could not have been much use to 
                  him anymore. He sniffed the air, and his eyes narrowed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why 
                  yus hewp Nazak? Me mite wanna kill n eets ya latur." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  tried to say something then but the words stuck in my throat. 
                  Events of the night caught up with me all at once then and the 
                  world began to spin. I do not remember hitting the ground. I 
                  did not dream, I know not how long I slept, but when I awoke 
                  the realization of what had happened came back quickly. I sat 
                  up from the bed of moss I had slept on and saw noone. All was 
                  quiet, too quiet for the swamp. Not a single sound could I hear. 
                  Not the squak of a bird, the howl of a kobold, the squeek of 
                  a rat, nothing. I smelled food, good wholesome food cooking. 
                  I turned and saw a wood elf and a dawrf of all things standing 
                  around a campfire. I rubbed my eyes and blinked, my friends 
                  Kainiff and Charlam? How could they have known where I was? 
                  I tried to stand but was still too weak, Charlam noticed and 
                  the two came over to help me up. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Where...?" 
                  I tried to speak before Charlam raised a finger to his lips 
                  and cut me short with a gentle "Shhh"</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Charlam pointed to a small hill a short distance away. Three 
                  trolls and an ogre stood there in some sort of conversation. 
                  He whispered that they wished me to join them when I was awake 
                  and that I wasn't to dilly dally. He cast a spell upon me which 
                  imbued me with the strength I would need to make it there. Charlam 
                  and Kainiff wished me well and sent me on my way. It felt very 
                  reassuring to have trusted companions nearby. I approached the 
                  hill that this motley bunch stood upon.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Nazak stood there with a splint on his broken arm, his armor 
                  had been replaced. As well as cleaned? Another troll stood there 
                  a bit away from the others dressed in armor black as pitch. 
                  A blood red helmet he wore and had a large two handed sword 
                  that glamed coldly of necromatic power. I doubted a human could 
                  even heft it. An ogre shaman and troll shaman were also there, 
                  dressed in a pacel of different colored armor. Feathers and 
                  teeth from various beasts used as jewelry. Almost they seemed 
                  bright and cheerful compared to the other two, laughing often. 
                  From time to time magic flickered brightly from their hands. 
                  Then I noticed him... the elf was strapped tightly to a tree, 
                  beaten and bloody. A gag had been stuffed inside his mouth and 
                  his hands had been... removed. I almost felt sorry for him. 
                  Dark cousin or no, he was one of Tunare's creatures. I reached 
                  the hilltop and Nazak waved me over to stand inside their little 
                  circle around their "catch".</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Nazak spoke. "Dese my brudders. Alla dem dun wanna eets ya no 
                  mor, me talk em oudda it. Da shamuns go find yer frends when 
                  yu wus sleepin. Da shaduh nite help me hunt da dark elf n jus 
                  bout kill im fur yus." He then introduced me to them, "Dis be 
                  Caya, she cleruk. Powerful majik she gots. Me say we let her 
                  kill dis dum elf." and he pointed at the helpless necromancer. 
                  "Eberbudy gud wid dat?" They all nodded their approval as if 
                  this had already been decided. I was then offered every sort 
                  of weapon imaginable with which to do the deed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "I cannot." I cautiously dared to speak. "He has learned his 
                  lesson and should be sent to Neriak in shame. They will deal 
                  with him there."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "He cannot return alive OR dead to Neriak." the one in black 
                  armor spoke in a deep cold voice. I was amazed at his fluency 
                  in the common tongue. "Friend," he spat the word, "if you lack 
                  the fortitude to complete the task then I shall take his unfortunate 
                  soul." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  stood dumbfounded and unable to speak yet again. Swinging quickly 
                  the troll in black armor put his sword through my dark cousin's 
                  skull, green magic flared to life from the blade. My dark cousin 
                  twicthed in convulsions for a brief moment, then went still. 
                  They all cheered. I waited until they had finished.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  I dared to speak once more, "Unfortunate. I surmise however 
                  that it was a necessary evil. Grobb would be at war with Neriak 
                  had he ben able to return. I must go, but before I do I thank 
                  you for your help Nazak, for whatever reason you decided to 
                  assist me I am truly grateful. Farewell my new friends." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  shamans wouldn't let us leave till they imbued us with the power 
                  of "The Mojo" which made us run incredibly fast. They ran with 
                  us from the swamp all the way to the Northern Desert of Ro. 
                  There we parted company, and promised to meet again someday.

                  memory of my first trip to Innothule. We got bound inside of
