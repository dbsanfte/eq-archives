<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> December 19th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <br>- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<br>- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<br>- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<br>- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<br>- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<br>- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<br>- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<br>- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<br>- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

At that time, when i get into a new place, i will be overhauling the website. I understand that many of you are anxious to have your guilds listed, and i apologize if it seems i have not put them up in a timely manner, but i have been very busy with trying to find a job and a place to live.<br><br>I promise to get to the updates as soon as i can.<br><br>Thanks</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Hello All. <br><br>I have recently started a Petition to<br>erect a statue of Guide Llara of Erollisi Marr, whom<br>you know has just recently passed on. I plan to<br>request to have the statue placed in a remote part of<br>Greater Faydark for all servers. This statue will<br>serve as a way to remember Guide Llara, and how she<br>has touched so many people's lives, and how she truly<br>guided them through their play at Everquest. I wish<br>to do this so that she may live on in memory forever<br>in the game that she loved so much. To help in this<br>gracious cause, please Email RememberLlara@yahoo.com<br>with your character name and other information if you<br>wish. I also ask that you spread the news to every<br>server, so that everyone can help. A small website<br>has been created, still under construction, at<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/rememberllara/main.html">http://www.geocities.com/rememberllara/main.html</a><br><br>-Also, I thank all of the Guides and GMs that have<br>shown support in this movement, and offer my<br>condolences to all those who knew Llara.<br><br>--Romak, 36 Necro of the Healers of Harmony, Erollisi<br>Marr</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> September 28th, 7:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch:<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying.  This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>- The item "Woe" has been repaired.  If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed.  The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon.  In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads.<br><br>*Fleeing NPCs*<br><br>Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed.  After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before.  NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been.<br><br>As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health.  We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players.  As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request.<br><br>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge has been completed.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted.<br><br>*New Server Active*<br><br>Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play.  Enjoy!  As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7).  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week.<br><br>***User Interface Changes***<br><br>Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch:<br><br>*Moving and Resizing Windows*<br><br>The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again.  The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking again.  Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed*<br><br>We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared.  They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed.<br><br>*Miscellaneous Additions*<br><br>Added the following /-commands:<br><br>- /camp: Causes your character to camp out.  You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>- /invite:  Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack".  You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state.<br><br>In addition:<br><br>- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell.  However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <br><br>*Pauses in Socials*<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).  <br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line.  <br><br>*Emote Codes*<br><br>The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <br><br>The new %-codes are: <br><br>%T - Returns the current target.<br>%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<br><br>For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote:<br><br>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.<br><br>...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>-- The Everquest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> According to many, the three newly released Kunark dragons have become rare spawns, despawning very shortly. Abashi had these comments on the Official Everquest board:<br><br><b>I'm afraid that I don't understand your complaint. NPC spawn rates/times etc., are never broadcast to the players. Secondly, I'm not sure what you mean by 'wasted a lot of people's time'. If you mean that people were waiting in the zone when the servers came up to get the dragons, and they weren't there, that doesn't really equate to much lost time at all. <br><br>- Gordon<br></b></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> *Today's Patch*<br><br>Today we modified the EverQuest client to implement the following changes:<br><br>- Corrected a bug that would cause players to crash if they entered the game, exited to the server selection screen, and tried to reenter the game.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused delays when switching between UI modes due to the text wrapping change implemented last week.<br>- The /book command (/book #) now accepts pages 1 through 50, and will switch to the proper page.<br>- Opening your spellbook will automatically cause you to begin meditating providing that you have the skill.<br>- Removed the /meditate command since it is no longer necessary.<br>- You can now activate a hotkey while the spellbook is open by pressing the corresponding number-key.<br>- The "/target [name]" command can be used to target other players by name.  Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the target.<br>- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating the EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a few weeks ago.<br>- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target.  For instance, if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at @", the output will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".<br>- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their over-head name prefixed with an asterisk.  Remember that you can search for people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" commands.  Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all rangers between 40 and 50 that are looking for a group.<br>- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer point you towards people's pets.<br><br>*Note on Voice Recognition*<br><br>Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest.  To use this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory.  Please note that you must already have a voice recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4.0.  The voice recognition technology was tested with Dragon NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0.  Check with the developer of your software to find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> *Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>We've decided to postpone the previously announced purging of level 1 characters that had not been played in the past 30 days.  Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give fair warning prior to implementing the purge.<br><br>*Today's Changes*<br><br>Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs in general.  <br><br>- /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and normal commands separately.<br>- /sit will cause your character to sit.  "/sit off" will cause your character to stand.<br>- "/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized in the corresponding slot.<br>- "/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14".<br>- "/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified ability.  Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.<br>- /whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted PC.<br>- "/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication.<br>- "/language help" displays a list of available languages and their corresponding number.  "/language" alone displays the current language.<br>- /meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, and begin meditation.<br>- In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the next line.<br>- Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the game immediately without penalty.  Normal operation is supposed to cause /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time to discourage this action.<br>- Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") key.  It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses.  All other changes implemented in the last patch stand.<br>- Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI.  The working documentation for this is below.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to "disappear" when the last charge was used.  The item never really disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging.  It no longer appears to disappear.<br><br><br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br><br> 1 - Say<br> 2 - Tell<br> 3 - Group<br> 4 - Guild<br> 5 - OOC<br> 6 - Auction<br> 7 - Shout<br> 8 - Emote<br> 9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Dice Roll (/random)<br>33 - Others spells<br>34 - Spell Failures (resists, fizzles, missing component, bad target, etc.)<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings:<br><br>RunMode    - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the dafault window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br>Log        - TRUE for logging on, FALSE for logging off<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well, since Vumil is slacking about posting the news I guess i will do it from 2nd hand information. Last night, a SR led raid on Severilous brought down the beast for the first time on Brell. The dragon had many drops including some bracers (hero and dragonbone), scales and some spells. Hopefully Vumil, who is special news anchor to brellserilis.net as well as an attendee on the raid will post some pics of PHaT LeWT later ;)</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Reposted from CastersRealm:<br><br>Players considering attacking the new dragons of Kunark should take heed that there is currently a bug which may cause them to be immobilised while they are slowly shredded limb from limb. Until Verant announces that it has been fixed, players take an even greater risk in attempting to slay the new beasts. <br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended. Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch. <br><br>Enjoy <br><br>-The Everquest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Greetings everyone!  <br><br>Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:<br><br>- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs.  In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased.<br>- /who all "guildname" should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on.<br>- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file.  Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once more.<br>- The "Chat Filter" tab in "Options" now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br><br><b>*Fast Drop*</b><br><br>Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground.  The new client allows players to set "Item Dropping" preferences on the "General" options tab.  The three options that can be set are:<br><br>- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.<br>- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an item.<br>- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.  <br><br>Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command.  The arguments are:<br><br>- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.<br>- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.<br>- NEVER: Same as above.<br><br>Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation.  Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.  Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your FastDrop setting.<br><br>It is highly recommended that you use option "CONFIRM", as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> A critical, game threatening bug was discovered and verified.  The bug was fixed, I called people into work, and I had the servers shut down for an emergency update.  This doesn't happen often, but when it does, we must act quickly. <br><br>If something similar were to happen again in the future I'd bring them down again. <br><br>To those of you whose evenings were disrupted, I apologize. We will endeavour to minimize these occurrences.  To the Verant employees who had to direct this operation and/or come into work, I'm also sorry. <br><br>No one likes downtime, not us, not the players. <br><br>That said, to the complainers and flamers in this thread: think for a moment, and think about the game as a whole. Some of you act like kids who are mad at their parents for not letting them play in the street. My god, do you think we bring down servers like this for giggles? <br><br>To everyone else, again, sorry for the disruption. <br><br>Guys, we don't publicly document severe bugs like this -- you never know when something might not be all the way fixed, or perhaps when something related to it still is problematic. <br>That said, you don't really have to speculate much on what sort of bug we'd consider game threatening. <br><br>-Brad</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> July 19th, 7:00am<br>-----------------<br><br><b>***Patch Day***</b><br><br><b>*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*</b><br><br>- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".<br>- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet. <br>- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.<br>- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.<br>- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets. These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history. The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.<br>- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world. <br>- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons. Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br><br><b>*Poison*</b><br><br>- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br><br><b>*General Crafts*</b><br><br>- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.<br>- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item". <br><br><b>*Items*</b><br><br>- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world. Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".<br>- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.<br>- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time. The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br><br><br><b>*/consent*</b><br><br>Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds. Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report. Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br><br><b>*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*</b><br><br>There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule. Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone. The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br><br><b>*Regen Effects*</b><br><br>This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells. As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT. However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell. This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br><br><b>*Keyed Dungeons*</b><br><br>The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago. Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point. We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br><br><b>*Barbed Scale Whip*</b><br><br>In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game. It has been changed back to its original stats.<br><br><b>*Hiding Corpses*</b><br><br>A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client. This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen. This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay. It will be particularly useful in the planes. The command supports the following arguments:<br><br>- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.<br>- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br><br>For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone. You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it. <br><br><b>*Resurrection*</b><br><br>The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES. Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team </font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Hello All,<br><br>I'd like to announce some pretty big changes for the better to our Customer Service:<br><br>We are making a serious revision to our Item Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them due to bugs.<br><br>We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we catch people lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone) we can and will ban people on their first offense. We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it. <br><br>We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accommodate our International users. <br><br>We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours. <br><br>Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate players. <br><br>We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones.<br><br>In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at gscotto@station.sony.com <br>We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future. <br><br>We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick response. <br><br>A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> A post made on the everquest gameplay forum:<br><br>Jolt is no real improvement for Rangers. <br><br>It's still a level 55 spell (Rangers see taunting problems earlier than this), it still costs just as much mana, it's still resistable, and the casting time was reduced from 3.5 secs to only 2.5 secs. Almost every other Ranger I know and have heard agrees that for this spell to be useful it needs to have about a 1.5 casting time and be unresistable or close to it. When a red con Sky mob is aggro on you hitting for 300 damage, trying to get a 2.5 sec spell off that might very well be resisted anyway is no help at all. <br><br>Verant, if you're going to make an honest change/improvement, please don't toss something out to humor players without thorough testing or feedback.<br><br><b>It was a 1 second improvement, or roughly a 30% improvement in casting time. I'd call that "real". Perhaps the misunderstanding is the typical one on this board, that an enhancement is "useless" unless it unbalances the class. Of course since we try not to make changes that do that, we're in a bit of a catch-22.<br><br>We are considering upping damage output for rangers though. <br><br>- Gordon</b><br><br>Up there damage so they taunt more, oh yah good idea!<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Verant announced today that a new expansion is planned for release around Christmas of this year. The new ice continent will most likely be designed for Level 35+, and will feature some exciting new zones. We have been unable to confirm if it will include new levels above 60 as of yet. <br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> July 5th, 4:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br>*Karana, Bertox, and Test Server Split*<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>At some time between 6pm and 8pm PDT (GMT-8), we will open /movelog registration on Karana, Bertox, and Test, to allow players on those servers to request that their account be moved to the new split-server, Terris-Thule. Players on the affected servers will be informed via server broadcast when registration is open. Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is opened.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for all characters on that server on that account. <br>- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down tomorrow morning (9am PDT). Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.<br>- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <br>- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<br>- Test Server Players with artificially buffed characters on their account *MUST* delete those characters prior to registering for move. Having artificially buffed characters moved to the live servers will result in action against the player's account.<br><br>*Item Changes Pending in Next Patch*<br><br>In the next patch, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Howling Stones will all be made NODROP if not currently set with that flag. This means that people holding more than one key will not be able to hand out their extras after the patch.<br><br>At the same time that this change is made, we are also implementing a new change that "binds" these items to your character. Should you die with one of these keys in your possession, it will not be left on your corpse, but will stay with you when you return to your bindpoint.<br><br>This change was made in light of the difficulty of the key-quests, in order to eliminate the need to do the quest multiple times prior to entering the dungeon. <br><br>-The EverQuest Team<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> There wasn't supposed to be an official announcement before-hand. The existing item wasn't changed, but rather, the vendors just sell a different item now. The original pumice stone is still in game, and in fact, drops someplace as loot now.<br><br>That said, I'm assuming you want to know why it was done. Frankly, purchased items should generally not be more efficient than casting the spell yourself or getting someone else to cast it upon you. <br><br>-Gordon<br><br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> As reported on CastersRealm:<br><br>In the last data patch it appears that Pumice Stones have been replaced with a new item that has a 4.5 second casting time. Whilst this generally restores balance by giving the same casting time to both the debuffer stone and those who actually have the spell available to them as a class, many melee (especially on PvP servers) feel slighted.<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> I thought I'd drop a line and let everyone know about some exciting changes that we are working on: <br><br>First, the next EQ client will, unless a problem is discovered in testing, include a slash-command that will allow players to turn off display of corpses. This will be a client-side option that will just repress the rendering of the corpses themselves. This will allow corpse-related actions (like sense-corpse) to be taken even while corpse display is repressed. <br><br>The command (/hidecorpses) will have three possible parameters: <br><br>None - Shows all corpses<br>All - Hides all corpses but that belonging to the player.<br>All but group - Hides all corpses but those belonging to the player and group members.<br><br>As asking people "Has anyone seen my corpse?" is an issue that we feel builds the feeling of community and encourages people to help each other out, the command will reset to showing all corpses upon zoning. Also, as a note, in its current implementation, any corpses created after the command is run will be shown. This command should help people who experience framerate problems after zoning in to areas known to cause a large number of corpses. <br><br>The second change has to do with quested keys for entrance into the keyed dungeons on Kunark: Sebilis, Charasis, and Veeshan's Peak. It's apparent that the risk of dying in these zones is too great to risk going with only one key. Furthermore, it's become standard practice for people to leave a corpse at the entrance of these dungeons with the spare key.<br><br>As we feel that the idea of dueling and getting killed just to leave a corpse for a bank isn't in the best intrest of roleplaying or our vision for the game (e.g. It's cheesy), we've decided to nerf this practice Our plan is to have keys for these three dungeons stay with the owner when they return to their bind point. This new ability that we are working on also gives us the opportunity to explore "soulbound" items in the future, but no promises just yet on that.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>This is probably the best change we will see in a very long time, I hope this is in the next patch!</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Though today's patch is primarily comprised of fixes to various bugs that have been reported by the players, we're also pleased to announce a few enhancements: <br><br>* Ranger spell "Jolt" now has a lesser casting time. <br>* Many new recipes for the "Make Poison" skill are now in game.  Features include: Several new poison books, stackable components, new suspensions, some purchasable components, and players now have the ability to purchase vials. Please check your vendors. <br>*Increased spell-drop percentages in three difficult Kunark zones where drops were less than should be expected. <br>* Corrected an error in the drop rate for a couple cleric spells making them unavailable.  <br><br>Quest Fixes <br><br>* Fixed the "Minotaur Horns" Quest <br>* Fixed a misspelling in the guild-note for Erudite clerics worshipping Cazic-Thule. <br>* Fixed a misspelled keyword in the Trueshot Longbow Quest. <br>* The guild note for gnome clerics now states the appropriate gender for the guildmaster. <br>* Fixed the "illegible cantrip" Quest. <br>* Fixed the "Hunt for Meat" Quest. <br>* Removed Jinkus Felligan's doppelganger from Halas. <br>* Fixed the "Travis Twostring" quest. <br>* Fixed the "Algthin Dasmore" quest. <br>* Fixed the "Gather Components" quest. <br>* Fixed the "Lion Meat" quest. <br>* The Fleshy Orb quest and "Fabian" should really be fixed now. These were not correct after the last patch due to a data export issue. <br><br>Item Fixes <br><br>* Fixed spelling of "Basilisk Egg" <br>* The Brass Ring is now worn on the finger, instead of the waist. <br>* Fixed the "Broken Minotaur Lord's Horn" <br>* Fixed race/class restrictions listed for the "Bullsmasher". Item listed some inappropriate classes. <br>* Fixed race/class restrictions listed for "Patchwork Armor". Items listed some inappropriate classes. <br>* Fixed the model for the "Cast Iron Rapier". <br>* Fixed Race/class restrictions for the "Crushbone Belt". Item listed some inappropriate classes. <br>* Fixed the mundane "Electrum Peridot Bracelet" so that it would equip in the proper slot. <br>* The "Bloody Mantle" may now be equipped. <br>* Fixed the effect on the "Canyoneer Pike". Current owners of this item will need to trade it out with a GM in game. <br>* Fixed the "Howling Harpoon". Item was previously casting its spell upon the wielder, rather than the target. The fix will be automatically applied to existing items. <br>* Fixed the icon for the Degenerated Guk Weed. <br>* Fixed the icon for the Enshrouded Veil. <br>* The Splitpaw Hide Tunic will now look like "Leather" when equipped. <br>* "The Crusade of 1312AG" and "The Forbidden Tome" will now remain with the character after logout. <br>* Fixed race/class restrictions listed for the "Mortificator Staff". * Item listed an inappropriate class. <br>* Fixed the icon for the Spectral Bow. In addition, removed "BRD" from the class listing since Bards do not have the Archery Skill. <br>* Removed excess classes listed on the "Silk Lined Steel Helm". <br>* Fixed the effect on the "Theurgist Mace". Current owners of this item will need to trade it out with a GM in game. <br><br>Miscellaneous <br><br>* Fixed bug that caused NPCs to say "cant open politethnks.txt" <br>* Fixed bug that caused NPCs to say "Can not open file NERDRGATT.txt" <br>* Fixed "cannot open file guards.txt" bug with Butcherblock dwarves <br>* Fixed "Cannot open item2monster.txt" problem with goblin whelps in Butcherblock. <br>* Lizardman Mystics no longer think that the Feerrott belongs to the Sabretooth Gnolls. <br>* Fixed a ghost in Field of Bone who was inappropriately labeled as living, causing "undead only" spells to fail. <br>* Improved pathing in Sebilis. <br>* Improved pathing in West Freeport. <br>* Fixed the color of several spell-gems. <br>* Fixed recipe for a "Block of Clay" in the Basic Pottery book. <br>* Stone Skeletons in Lake Rathe can now be affected by "undead only" spells. <br>* Fixed several merchants who did not have wares to sell. <br>* Fixed several dozen spelling and grammar errors in NPC text and the spell database. <br>* "Folded Sheet Metal" may now be crafted via blacksmithing. <br>* The "Unfired Urn", "Onyx Encrusted Urn", and "Small Bowl" may now be crafted via Pottery. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> *The Hole*<br><br>We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level dungeon on the continent of Odus.  The Hole is a complementary addition to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark status.  The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the "Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface.  The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until later.<br><br>As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to support characters starting at about level 40.  It should be regarded as extremely dangerous.  As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST.  The GMs will not recover corpses for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. <br><br><br>*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*<br><br>As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting rules for PvP combat on Vallon Zek.<br><br><br>*Resurrection*<br><br>Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection.  Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, we've raised this limit from two hours to three.  This should assist players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning resurrection within the time limit.<br><br><br>*Warping*<br><br>We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the larger Kunark zones.  Please let us know how this goes.<br><br><br>*Locked Doors*<br><br>We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able to pick locks.  In order to protect and increase the value of the abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to walk through locked doors without opening them. <br><br><br>*Vox and Nagafen*<br><br>Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-level (high 50s) adventurers.  As we've always felt that Dragons should be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were left with some choices.<br><br>One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging.  This would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people.  This would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others the experience of fighting a dragon.<br><br>Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical ability to pick their own fights.  Players of level 53 or above will now encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with these dragons.  This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out by much higher level players.  In addition, it also has the added effect of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.<br><br><br>-The EverQuest Team<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Just a friendly reminder, to everyone, that there is a GM event today in the Lake Rathe Arena at 2:00pm (pst) called the Test of Mystics. It was ran yesterday on one of the PvP servers and the winner of the tournament was awarded an Ornate Rune Shield (wow!). Again, there is an entrance fee for the event, at 10pp multiplied by your level. Good Luck! </font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> And it isnt bad!<br><br>June 15th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Hello everyone,<br><br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br><br>- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <br><br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br><br>- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<br><br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br><br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <br><br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br><br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br><br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <br><br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br><br>*Chat / Login Process*<br><br>The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of people in the chat server.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Friday, June 16th,  there will be an official GM run tournament in the Lake Rathe arena. The event is called the Test of  Mystics. It is for necromancers, mages, wizards and enchanters of any level. Entrance fees are 10 plat multiplied by your level. Each player will be completely debuffed before the match, but is allowed 3 pre-combat spells. If a pet is summoned it counts as 2 of the 3 spells. <br><br>Sounds like a lot of fun guys. There will be prizes for the winners, but none have been announced.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Found this excerpt on the EQnecro site. It is a question to Abashi about the toughness of Trakannon, the poison dragon who inhabits Sebilis. Interesting.<br><br><i>Well we were exploring in sebilis last night, and were a few hours in. We came to a big huge open room, then we see "Soando shivers and shakes" then right in front of me I see Trakanon! The lvl 60 with us conned him...red. Then he agroed. First aoe wave, 10dead...second aoe wave, 10more. Then his guardians came, hitting for 300+. He himself hit for dual 650's I heard from my groupmate. What I want to know, is do you think he is fair and "doable" in his current state? Yeah I agree he should be very hard, but an AoE dot that had to be at least 300dmg a tick and an AoE DD that was 800 or more damage...along with his guards bashing for 300...clerics arent gonna keep up with that.<br>Anyway abashi, would you tell me if that sounds right to you? It doesnt seem so...and if it is...I fear veeshan =)</i><br><br><b>Players have always surprised us with their ability to easily overcome situations that we first thought were undoable, so I don't think it will be too long before some, somewhere, show's Trakanon whats what. It just takes a little while to refine the strategy.<br><br>-Gordon</b><br><br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> On Saturday, June 10th, the Legion of Heroes guild attempted a raid of Karnors with a specific target in mind; Venril Sathir. Kassim Silverblade led a group of over 30 friends into his lair. When the group charged his room, they were met by Venril and some healers. The group fought hard, but unfortunately was wiped out. Venril was being healed all the while by clerics through the walls. Although this was a defeat, the Legion of Heroes took it as a learning experience and will try again, I'm sure.<br><br>Picture:<a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/LoHVenril.gif">Venril Sathir</a><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Now, i didnt know this but Gordon responding to someone's post about a documented bug where a cleric will sit down in a zone and have mobs out of range go hostile (I believe that is the summary of the bug, if i am mistaken i apologize) yielded this interesting response from Gordon into how mobs handle hate lists.<br><br><i>NPCs attack. They attack without warning and provocation. The fact that an NPC somewhere had you on the hatelist, but was too far away to consider chasing you, and was <b>propagating that hatelist</b> to new NPCs that spawned who *were* in range to chace after you, is a design issue that players just have to deal with at the moment. Everything that is happening in this case is *intended*, it just *sucks*. Sometimes things that "suck" are described as bugs, but aren't bugs in sense of something that we can fix readily, or that we would give a rez for.<br><br>-Gordon</i></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Here is the list of new things on the site today. First of all, the Roleplaying section is really coming along. Had about 4-5 new stories posted over the past few days, keep em coming! For now until i get them all online (there were some long ones i havent gotten to yet), i put up only three.<br><br>New Stories: Luna's Story, An Unexpected Ally, and the Scroll of Soulfire. Check them out by visiting the <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/roleplay/index.htm">Roleplaying Section.</a><br><br>Also, found a really nifty Item Valuation tool on CastersRealm. If your looking for a price for a specific item, you can check this out and see what the going rates are for the various servers.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> This morning I was handed a list of spell changes that didn't make it into the patch message. I'll put up an addendum later today, but here's the list for review:<br><br>- Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.<br>- Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.<br>- Shaman can now cast Charm Animal<br>- Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.<br>- Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.<br>- Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> I could be off with this, but the patch message said today. Having been out of the world of Norrath for about a week, time seems to fly sometimes. Anyway here is the patch message. I would say, atleast on first read, it is a sad day for soloers.<br><br>June 6th, 8:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br><br>*General*<br><br>- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.<br>- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<br>- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<br>- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<br>- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now. <br>- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<br>- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<br>- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br><br>*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*<br><br>Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable.  <br><br>Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.  <br><br>*Risk and Reward*<br><br>The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <br><br>In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest.  <br><br>However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <br><br>Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br><br>*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*<br><br>As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br><br>Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br><br>Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br><br>Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Awhile back Vumil Darksoul sent in to me quite a few screenshots of Old Sebilis. I had wanted to simply add them to the gallery section, which i still want to upgrade and redesign. However, upon reading one of the posts on the board today I decided to make a new section on the site devoted to Dungeon and Zone features. Since much of my guild is currently holding camp in Sebilis, and many friends are there, i decided to start with Sebilis. Later on today i will adjust the navigation of the site to include a link to this on each page but for now, to check out my first attempt at a dungeon guide follow the link below. As adventurers move into this new dungeon, please make sure to send me any screenshots you have, and I will post them. Also, any additions or updates to the content online would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Dungeon Focus > <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/focus/sebilis.htm">Old Sebilis</a><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Lerdar sends this:<br><br>To the Good Guilds of Brell Serelis<br><br>Hail and well met, leaders and members of the fine guilds that defend<br>justice, kindness, and truth on Brell Serelis!  We have many, many such guilds on our server.   Each are great in their own way.   A thought has crossed my mind to make us greater still.<br><br>Brell has always been a relatively peaceful and quiet server.  There aren't a whole lot of non-guild raids, wars, or events.  Because of this, our guilds have generally found it easiest to go through life on their own, with little need for active alliances and the like.   This is not a bad system. However, there are times when we need to be stronger, times when we need to band together and strike down evil, times where we just need support, times when one guild, no matter how great, can accomplish something.   No one guild can continuously fight to retake the lands that evil has taken from us.  No one guild can be there across the world to help that person getting killed feet from safety, or to respond to evil uprisings and attacks. Overall, no one guild can accomplish all the goals of good.<br><br>That is why no one guild must stand alone to do so any longer.  I am issuing an invitation to all the good guilds of Brell to come to a conference.  At this conference, we will lay the groundwork for a world-wide alliance of all the guilds that are interested.  The exact functions that this alliance would perform , and how it would carry these out ,will be up to us as we carry this on in further meetings, until things are finalized and implemented.  It is my goal to have all the good guilds of Brell united through a council of representatives to keep communications open, organize ongoing operations in the name and intent of good, and make Norrath better for the good people that inhabit it.<br><br>We would like to see 2-5  representatives from all the good guilds here. The number of people from each guild in no way affects the decision making process at this stage. We will set a more formal and concrete representative system once we have the basic workings of the alliance laid out.  We will, within the council, eventually elect people to key positions such as military operations, economics, public relations, and more as we determine needs.  With cooperation from all ,we will make this a grand alliance that is never resting in it's battle against evil.  Come, help achieve that dream.<br><br>Lerdar</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> When a character reaches his or her 20th season, one of the great points of pride is the selection of a surname. In my opinion, the surname filter is a little TOO picky (rejected almost every surname I have ever chosen including the one i use now, Blackthorne, until a GM could do it manually). Well, this player, frustrated with being told their surname was illegal decided to protest this. It is amazing what the surname rejects and what it accepts, isnt it?<br><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/adanesurname.gif">Tell us how you really feel Adane ;)</a><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well, i was moving right along in game till I was booted. When it came back up i got a message that there was a new Kunark patch that needed to be downloaded. I am about half-way through it, looks to be about 5-6 megs. Quite dissapointing since i probably lost my group. Wish Verant would get on the stick about patching, booting people off so they have to patch and not announcing anything.<br><br>So far the following zones seem to be patched, again I am only about half-way through this mammoth download (i am on 56k modem).<br><br>Lake of Ill Omen, Trakannon, Timorous Deep<br><br>These are new zone files which are being downloaded.<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Patch day today.. Here is what to expect. (expect to laugh)<br><br>*Spells/Songs*<br><br>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br><br>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br><br>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br><br>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<br><br>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis.  They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br><br>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.  <br><br>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br><br>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).  The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Just some words about the JBoots quest. I was fortunate enough while hunting with my longtime partner Trompe in SRO to stumble upon the Ancient Cyclops. After killing the beast and obtaining the ring (sorry to the mage who was also searching for the clops!) i set out to finish the rest of the quest for the Journeyman boots. Well, appears Hasten hasn't spawned in like, a week. Brother Z is running around and nowhere to be found is Hasten. After talking with a Guide, they said the problem was being worked on but in true Verant style, No ETA. Hopefully after the server reset tomorrow, Hasten will be back. Several players have devised cute ways to alleviate the boredeom of waiting for this spawn, which i have included a shot of for your enjoyment.<br><br>I have also found a picture of what a complete suit of Flayed Skin armor looks like and made a link.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well a couple of items for today. The first is i am pleased to announce Vumil and Goat are now Administrators (donated by the Avatar of Brell) of the Brell Message Boards. What this means is they will be doing a lot of the day-to-day checking up on the boards, moderating tasks and planning for new forums or removing dead forums as needed. Pretty much what they have done before thrown in with a couple of things I primarily handled in the past. The boards have grown so much in the past year and it wouldn't be possible to have if they weren't lending their assistance, so thanks guys.<br><br>The second thing to report is that there will be some slight changes over the next couple weeks to this site. As anyone who has experience with web site development knows, as your site grows you begin to see areas that need to be improved. I have seen lots of places i can improve the site and taken lots and lots of feedback from everyone (thanks). <br></font><br><br><br>

Isle 4 consists of 3 Essence Carriors and 3 Essence Harvesters which are all level 52.  Kill one of them and it splits into 2 level 54 offspring, kill one of the level 54 offspring and it spawns 1 level 56 offspring.  They are all quite long fights resulting in a few deaths from each(usually rangers *grin*).  Once 3 of these Essence Carriors or Essence Harvesters are killed the Keeper of Souls spawns(level 60+ boss of the island).

At 60 everyone else gets bonuses to defense, and rangers don't, therefore they aren't balanced.<br><br>The problem with this logic is that we don't balance classes on a skill-by-skill basis. We balance them as a complete offering. Everything that a class has is part of the equation. The fact that skill-point allocations, ratios, and percentage change as you go level to level is not in and of itself indicative of an imbalance. <br><br>-Gordon<br><br>Item weight for monks and SK<br>----------------------------<br>I'm having some of the weights on Monk stuff looked at today. In other news, Darkforge armor (SK) is having its weight lowered, and should go live the next time we patch items.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>Spawn times (specifically Treant Fists quest)<br>----------------------------------------------<br>A 72 minute spawn seems ok. Quests for items aren't supposed to give instant gratification. I think that one of the problems we are running into is that when people want an item, they want the item NOW, and any time that it takes to get the item is considered a camp. <br><br>Things need to take time, or the prestige that comes with having is gone.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> *General Changes*<br><ul><br><li>Sounds have been updated for NPCs in Kunark. Your Iksar should no longer sound like humans.<br><li>Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere. Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br><li>Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear. Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. <br><li>Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed. Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed. In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible. The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br><li>Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br></ul><br>*Item Updates*<br><ul><br><li>Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br><li>Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back. It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br><li>The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact. This has been corrected.<br><li>Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor. It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br><li>The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br><li>Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. <br><li>The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br><li>The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br><li>The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br><li>Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon. The "Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect.<br><li>The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect on the targeted character.<br><li>Mosquito Wings are available in game once again.<br><li>Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have been repaired.<br></u><br><br>As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes to items that already exist in game. However, there are cases where a particularly unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail Whip mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest of maintaining game balance. <br><br>We will continue to repair problems, add content, and enhance gameplay in both Kunark and EQ proper. We appreciate everyone's support.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

Here is a excerpt:<br><br><i>I could feel my heart's decay there in the blackness. I could feel it dying, what little part of it which had been revived from its umbral repose flaring as a shooting star and failing, failing into the ether, rotten and cold. <br><br>My fist tightened over the hilt of my blood red blade. My teeth ground together, my jaw tightened. My muscles tensed under the iron shell of my armour, prepared to strike the false creature down there in the solace of her secret lair. <br><br>Yet I could not bring my spirit to comply to my body's will. <br></i><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The level 50+ spells so many casters are trying to get their hands on are not dropping as planned. Gordon confirmed the bug officially on the Gameplay board:<br><br>          Well I got some time late Wednesday and went into an area that is supposed to be pretty-well saturated with the new  spells, whacked about 250 critters, and didn't find any spells. So I'm not completely convinced that they are dropping correctly any longer. I'll get back with you.<br><br>                     -Gordon<br><br>As for an ETA on the fix, Gordon had the following to say:<br><br>          Monday is probably the soonest we'll see some action on this. Everyone who can fix it is up at E3 looking after our booth. I'm trying to find out now if the correct data is on the servers but just not activated. If that's the case, we could probably fix it before then. <br><br>                     -Gordon</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Thalanar wrote<br><br>I would just like to thank all those who attended the bakers brownie raid tonight. Overall, it was a complete success. In three hours we managed to get 17 brownie parts, which worked out to approx 2 per baker, and no deaths (that I'm aware of)! There were far too many people there to list here, but you know who you are, and I thank you.<br><br>This was a great success for the baking community for bringing us closer together and getting us those coveted brownie parts, a success for the Brell community because it involved a very wide range of people (I think 17 to 54) to work together towards a common goal at one event, and a success for me because I have never tried organizing something of this scale. While things didn't go perfect, they never do, it went quite well and I have everyone who participated to thank.<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The Yard trash of the Gods. That is what they claim wanders around the gates of Karnor's castle. Well, this gnome could use some trash! (cackle) Through the mountain hills I found a curious cave with others resting. They pointed within and told me that this cavern led to the Dreadlands. I had heard of these new lands, it is where many of the first landed as they teleported by way of druidic or wizardly magic. <br><br>As the cavern emptied out into a great expanse of desolate rock and scattered patches of grass, I saw some ruins in the distance. I could hear the shouts of adventurers and the roar of spellfire coming from them so I headed in under the shadows of darkness to investigate.<br><br>It was here I was met by a most curious sight. A lizard man in armor of pure blue, with strange sounds eminating from his person. I didn't recognize this figure at first but as he hailed me i knew it was my friend Quemn Wyndrunner. He removed his mask and then replaced it, his image shifting and bending before my very eyes. <br><br>It was here I met with my hunting companion from the other night, the shaman Ancere and many other new faces. I was invited to join a party of very seasoned adventurers and was reuinted with some old friends. The Champion of the Scale was among them, Sindarre. We had many good laughs and conversation until a large animal came bearing down on us. It resembled a chicken, but was much more fierce (and large!). <br><br>A curious place indeed. I picked up a nice weapon from one of the spider persons when I reached for it and its leg broke off in my hand. Perhaps i can use this as a weapon, it seemed to be embrued with magical properties. I think i will visit this place again, when i am more prepared in mind and body.<br><br>/ooc  The weapon I got was neat, although not very powerful. A Drachnid's Hind Leg, Dam 6, Del 27 Magic Weight 0. Looks like a minotaur horn. Dropped by a Drachnid. Also got a few pieces of ruined scale, which looks like green chainmail armor when worn.<br><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/dread-bard.gif">An Iksar Bard</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/dread-sindarre.gif">Sindarre the Scaled Claw</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/dread-drov.gif">A Menancing Drolvarg</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/dread-chicken.gif">Scary chickens</a><br></font><br><br><br>

From there we willproceed to the village of the brownies.<br><br>Who: Any and all are invited, but what I would love to see is as many bakersthere as possible! The purpose is to gather as many brownie parts as we canand distribute them out to the bakers. Brownies are not easy foes though, andwe will need a lot of power in order succeed.<br><br>If you are interested, please send an email to thalanar@yahoo.com or else feel free tosend me a tell in-game. If there is not enough interest or manpower to raidthe brownies, it would still be nice to have a gathering of the bakers onBrell.<br><br>Hope to see you bakers there!<br><br>Thalanar Solal<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Silver Shadows<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we've decided to make a change.<br>Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, tomorrow morning we will be buffing up these newbie-protecting guards, making them immune to magic, and giving them some pretty good healing properties in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them.<br><br>In addition, though we will leave the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Currently they are typically on six-minute timers, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We will be normalizing the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> This has been answered, but I'll answer again.<br><br>Scrolls are dropping.<br><br>Many dungeons have not been explored and/or are barely touched.<br><br>People tend to move together and to focus on certain areas, especially when areas are new. Currently, most players are in a minority of the mid and high level dungeons in Kunark.<br><br>We did NOT make each dungeon in Kunark 'one stop shopping'.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> It was morning when I first heard the shouts echoing through the valley. Brave adventurers were assembling boldly outside the entrance to an enourmous fort constructed of wood and stone. It was there I met my new friends, the wise shaman Ancere and the veteran monk, Senn. There was to be a giant hunt, and with my recent run-in with the mountain people the day before still fresh in my mind, I was all too happy to join them. Grabbing some chips of bone from my spell components, I recited the ancient words and brought forth a servant of the dead.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> There's been a lot of hubbub about the giants inhabiting the frontier mountain range on Kunark. Tales of gigantic weapons, magical earrings and all sorts of other nonsense which would be temptation for treasure hunters to head there and risk losing their heads. I decided to put on my best walking slippers and summon me a skeletal companion (to hold my wardrobe and bags of course) and head on out. I had been previously holding camp at the beautiful (but slightly eerie) Lake of Ill Omen, and was just a hop skip and a lob to these new lands.<br><br>After passing some goblin infested holes and a beautifully constructed Sarnack fort (they didnt seem to like gnomes hrmph!) I entered the majestic mountain range. Oh my, were the rocks big! In fact, i was a mere spec while i sat on one of the stones. <br><br>Shortly after getting my bearings I saw one of the mountain natives tredging along in the valley below. I decided to introduce myself when suddenly, i was attacked! The giant's strength was enormous, but in the end I prevailed. He had a mysetious LARGE sword which was on his person. Since he was no longer living, i decided to try to stuff it in my pack, unfortunately it was too large (about the size of 6 gnomes!). <br><br>Quite rattled, i decided to move on. To the south, a mytserious rock formation was carved into the side of the mountain. I dare not get closer, it was guarded by many angry looking goblins. Some with the names of Dirtcallers, Plaguebringers, Rockchanters and Bonecharmers. Ghastly as it was, they failed to notice me as I kept my distance and moved around them with the deft agility all gnomes possess. <br><br>I think i like this place. It has character, danger and excitement. I will share more with you as it is uncovered.<br><br>Be Well!<br>-- Delsonora Blackthorne<br><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/gnometale/bigrocks.gif">Big Rocks</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/gnometale/gianttump.gif">A Giant Tump!</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/gnometale/ironback.gif">Sword the size of 6 gnomes!</a><br>Image: <a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/gnometale/gobcave.gif">Strange Caves</a></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> As posted from EQNecro:<br><br>I gathered Gordon's posts from the EverQuest Gameplay Forum for your viewing. As you will see, Convergence (the ressurection spell) has been confirmed by Gordon. Sounds like we won't be using it too much though...<br><br>In any case, it seems that someone has already used Convergence and is willing to talk about it. In Gordon's post about the spell (see below), someone says that in order to use the spell, you need an Essence Emerald. To get this component, you need to cast Sacrifice on someone. You cannot cast Sacrifice on yourself. The sacrificed person cannot ressurected and will lose XP. Also, this person has to be level 45+ and can't be level 50 or 60 to avoid maxed out level 50 non-Kunark players and level 60 Kunark players from willingly taking the XP loss.<br><br>So, after casting Sacrifice you get an Essence Emerald. These are supposedly unstackable, no drop, but not lore.<br><br>Thus, if this information is correct, you also need the Sacrifice spell. And unlike what we thought so far, all that Sacrifice does it kill someone so you can get the Essence Emerald required for Convergence. And the same component required to cast Convergence is used for both Infusion and Trucidation.<br><br>Well, that is it. To tell you the truth, I don't think this is too bad. I bet we will see some uses for Convergence.<br></font><br><br><br>

I feel this strips the class of most of it's power after lvl 51. <br><br>One of the limiting factors on what spells could do before was based upon what it would do if used as a twinking mechanism. The level 49 spells put us right up against this ceiling. When we created the new buffs, we decided to put the cut-off.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> I posted this on the EQ Board. Didnt think anyone would even see it but Gordon responded =) Anyway, i think his response is valid. Check it out hehe.<br><br>>>>Would it be possible, or difficult, to implement a way for members of a class to talk to each other over a channel (like guildtalk). I think this could be useful for players communicating with others in their class regarding quests, strategy, exchange of research components, etc. e.g. /class Anyone have any information on the spell call of bones?<br><br>Blanket communication channels tend to reduce the sense of community in game, rather than enhance it. Instead of dealing with a specific person, and forming a relationship with them, it ends up pretty cold. This is somewhat apparent with zone-wide communications such as /shout and /ooc, however it's not as bad as a server-wide mechanism would be. In addition to this, there are some technical issues surrounding this idea (e.g. the number of additional packets to broadcast) which make the idea unattractive.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font><br><br><br>

(don't think that)<br><br>I just wanted to let you all know I am having a contest to give away an ELSA Gladiac on EQrealms, that's www.eqrealms.com . The Gladiac is one of the first accelerator (er it IS the first) cards to use the GeForce2 chip! GeForce really blew everyone away, and the GeForce2 is making it look like patchwork! So if you want a jump on the contest, visit EQrealms.com! I've already notified most sites. It doesn't require you doing much more than just viewing the site, and taking active part in our discussions and check us out daily will give you an even better chance to win!<br><br>- Dantes<br><br>Thanks!<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> April 28th, 6:00am<br>-------------------<br><br>*Patch Today*<br><br>Several changes were implemented as part of today's patch:<br><br>*Spells*<br><br>- "Scale of Wolf" is now group-only.  You must be grouped with the target in order to cast this spell upon them.  This change was made due to the fact that Scale of Wolf overwrites Spirit of Wolf, which may be more desirable in some situations.<br>- The "Cannibalize II" spell has been enhanced.  <br>- Corrected a bug with "Song of the Sirens" that caused an unintended level-cap to affect the spell. Bards should now be able to charm everything that they once could with this spell.<br><br>*Binding in Timorous Deep*<br><br>Due to a feature within the zone, players can no longer bind within Timorous Deep.  This functionality was intended in the zone prior to launch, as binding presents a possible balance issue.  Players who are already bound in this zone will retain their binding location until they bind someplace else.<br><br>*Iksar Quests*<br><br>A few items associated with the Iksar newbie warrior quests have been repaired. The EverQuest team would like to extend thanks to those who reported the problems.<br><br>*Iksar Factions*<br><br>As announced in the patch server message yesterday, this morning we corrected a bug in Iksar faction that allowed them to travel outside Kunark without fear of being attacked by most things.  In the event that any young Iksar find themselves in a bind/death loop, please /quit, log in another character, and /petition for assistance.<br><br>*Server Splits*<br><br>The recently announced server splits will be completed roughly two hours after the other servers come up from this patch.  Movelog registered accounts from Veeshan and Bristlebane will be moved to Saryrn, and Xegony and Bertox to The Seventh Hammer.  As requests to move were very strong, we were not able to move everyone who requested.  We appreciate everyone's understanding.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> *Patch Today*<br><br>Today's patch (eqmain.dll) was to correct some Kunark registration problems for overseas customers using the new retail box. In addition, text was updated on the "Kunark Registration" page for those who upgrade using an account key from the retail box. <br><br><br>*Iksar Factions Changing Tomorrow*<br><br>The faction information on the live servers in reference to Iksar and how they interact with other factions outside Kunark is incorrect. Corrections will be going in tomorrow, making the Iksar KOS (Kill on Sight) to pretty much everything on the other continents. We normally wouldn't announce something like this, however we want to give Iksar who may have bound next to or near something that is liable to become KOS to them tomorrow a chance to get away. <br><br>This announcement is not meant to be a free license to go exploring the mainland with your Iksar tonight, and our plans to pre-announce issues such as this in the future hinge on players not taking advantage of the information. We appreciate everyone's cooperation.<br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Just for a bit of clarification, back when the planes were brought online, John Smedley commented that people just don't die in planes, they die hard. Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There exists a non-negligible chance that not only will you die there, but you might not be able to raise the necessary forces to allow recovery of your corpse. It is *very* dangerous. <br>In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety in the zone, as sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk that for Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous, and in order to guarantee that everyone is operating under the same set of conditions, we've elected to make the zone "enter at your own risk". <br><br>That said, there are no known bugs in the zone that would cause the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate any bugs that are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items or experience, nor will we be moving corpses or people within the zone.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> A new expansion spell was discussed on the EQ boards and Abashi stopped by to answer. Our druids/shammie may find it interesting.<br><br>>>>First off, why does it drop when you are hit EVEN IF you don't hit back ? <br>It works just like invisibility. We wanted to give people the means to travel faster without that travel method turning into another offensive tactic. <br><br>>>>Secondly, why does it overwrite SoW ? Verant doesn't need to stack actual spell effects to make them stack as being 'on' or 'off' - surely one spell can supercede in effect without overwriting<br><br>It overwrites SoW because it has the same effect and it does more to that effect. It's the way the spell hierarchy works. This really can't be changed.<br><br>>>>Um, this has exploit written all over it. <br><br>We'll probably have to make the spell group-only in the near future.

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well, i got Kunark cd today finally and installed it. The first thing you will notice is you will need to repatch. You also should do K Patch, which will download a zone or two for you. <br><br>I created an Iksay shammie. Well, unless you have a lot of patience i do not recommend the Iksar right now. First, the city is immense. There are not surprinsgly tons of iksar. There was actually waiting lists for groups in the main city, killing some of the yellow spawns (froglok slaves).<br><br>The newbie zone out of East Cabilis is horrid. It is called the Field of Bone. I cant tell you how many red cons i saw here, trains of 20-30 emerrald spiders killing everything in sight. The lag, was completely unreal. Be prepared to walk around blind also, Iksar have terrible night vision (see: paineel on launch)<br><br>Then, i deleted my iksar. I logged in my 22 druid, and went the traditional way to Kunark, on the boat. Boats depart from Butcherblock and Oasis. If you leave from BB you land in a somewhat friendly high elven outpost. From oasis, you land in the evil lands, i dont know which zone actually didnt go that way.<br><br>You board shuttles, and join up with an unbelievably immense ship, <br>The Maiden Voyage. After about a 5 min boat ride, you are in Fironia Vie, a high elf outpost. Here, i lasted about 15 mins before i was slain. But, i brought back some shots of what to expect.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark1.gif">http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark1.gif</a><br><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark2.gif">http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark2.gif</a><br><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark4.gif">http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark4.gif</a><br><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark5.gif">http://www.brellserilis.net/images/kunark/kunark5.gif</a><br><br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> We would like to announce the impending launch of the two new split-servers Saryrn and The Seventh Hammer! From 6:00pm to 10:00pm PST on Saturday April 22nd, players on Bristlebane, Veeshan, Bertoxxulous, and Xegony who execute the /movelog yes command will be moved to the new servers. We will accept the first 2000 players from Bristlebane and Veeshan who will be moved to Saryrn, and the first 2000 players from Bertoxxulous and Xegony who will be moved to The Seventh Hammer. Both new servers will be available shortly!!! Please be aware that your characters will not be moved off of your current server until the new servers are ready.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>April 21st, 7:00am<br>----------------------<br><br>Greetings everyone! <br><br>This morning's update is one of the final updates necessary for the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark launch scheduled to take place on Monday.  <br><br>As part of this update, a new EverQuest Patch Program was sent to your system.  For those who have installed the Ruins of Kunark, this update has added a button labeled "K-Patch" to the patch program control panel.  Within these patch messages, Ruins of Kunark players may be asked from time to time to press the "K-Patch" button following the download of the regular patch.  This will allow them to download Kunark-related updates when they are required.  <br><br>If you have not installed EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, you will not see a "K-Patch" button.  <br><br>In addition to the Kunark-related changes made today, a bug that lowered the maximum damage of two-handed weapons that was introduced earlier this week in the Emergency Update was also corrected.  Finally, the art update yesterday implemented a solution that we've been promising: Male barbarians can now see their shields.<br><br>We continue to appreciate everyone's patience while we get the servers ready for Kunark.  <br><br>Thank you.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Found this on EQ Official board. It contains an interesting theory about all of these unbelievable RoK delays, and Abashi's rebuttal.<br><br>>>>"The GM informed him that Verant would be staggering shipments of Kunark. He told him that they were worried about the initial burst of players to Kunark and that as a result they would be limiting the amount of copies of the game initially."<br><br>This is completely false and I'll go so far as to say that this didn't happen. It is so far removed from the truth that I'm not willing to accept that anyone employed by Verant could have made a statement to this effect. I would caution everyone reading this to take note when someone speaks of information obtained by "a friend" and provided by an unnamed GM. Let's face it, nearly everyone logs anything told to them by a GM in game, and has no problem naming names in public when they feel that a real injustice has been committed. <br><br>The articles assertion that we somehow purposely engineered the admittedly unacceptable problems with shipping is unfathomable. We have measures in place on our side (including some impressive new code that has been in for over a month now) that should reduce or eliminate any concerns over zone-crashes due to over-population.<br><br>Now that that is out of the way, there are several posts here on the board by John Smedley that give the most up-to-date information that we have in regards to the shipping issues. We are committed to doing right by our cusotmers in this matter, and hope that you'll hang in there while we get everything sorted out. Running EverQuest has been an unending stream of "firsts" in the gaming world, and we'll learn from these issues as well.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> From EQCasters<br><br>It appears that if you now have both Kunark installed and activated the servers will allow you to exceed the Level 50 Cap.  One bonus for going above the former limit is that you now receive new titles in the /who command.<br><br>The first Level 51 on Fennin Ro was a cleric named Liza.  Her title was [51 Vicar] Liza (High Elf).<br><br>Update: I have had mixed reports of people on servers who still have level 51, and others who have had their level reset by GM's. It appears that either you cannot get exp after you ding, or the hell levels are much scarier than we could possibly imagine. <br><br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Just a few noteworthy changes to the board today. Many of you have brought up the point that certain camps dont need to be reserved, due to the fact they can be accomplished impromptu with very few people. Some of these include Mistmoore, Efreeti, Guk etc. Also, not everyone on the server checks the boards or knows about them.<br><br>So, in response to your concerns, i have removed Raids Schedule: all others, from the message board. I would also like to announce the addition of a new discussion board, Kunark Discussion. Its purpose is pretty obvious, to talk about the new expansion pack, expansion zones, etc. I am sure as Kunark is explored, the need for new forums will become relevant. Until then, post Kunark related topics here.<br><br>Thanks!<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Hello all,<br>I've noticed that quite a few people are upset about the quality of some of the Plane of Sky items that have been found so far. <br><br>Part of the problem is due to the fact that the most powerful items still have yet to be acquired. Once you start seeing these items come out of the plane, you will understand what I meant when I said "There are items in the Plane of Sky that make other planar items look like rusty weapons". <br><br>The other part of the problem is that some of the items that have been found so far are indeed underpowered. Since we were entering uncharted territory with many of our ideas for these items, we erred on the side of making them underpowered, thus avoiding the problems that occur should we have to downgrade them later. That said, while some of the items that have been found so far are appropriately powered, many are not. <br><br>Though I will not comment on any particular item at this time, we will be reevaluating the Plane of Sky items in the near future, probably after the initial excitement from the Kunark release. <br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Okay guys. Several guilds have contacted me asking if they could have a MyGuild.BrellSerilis.net domain name. The answer is yes, the ISP i use does support this, however there is a 1 time fee associated with it. Now, the fee isnt a huge deal -- but i definetly do not want to be paying out of pocket for a domain name alias for every guild who wants one. Which is why I have decided to do the following.<br><br>Whereas originally i was planning on accepting guilds sending in a payment (one-time) for having the alias established, i have decided to issue them as rewards for outstanding guild/server spirit. Helping to publicize the server, this site, the message boards are all examples of things i will consider when giving these aliases away. Taking the time to be a featured guild, and answering some question is another.<br><br>If having a cool website url isnt enough (no need to publicize geocities when you can publicize brellserilis!) this will guarantee your guild a link from the top level page of BrellSerilis.net (this page) and a spot as part of the BrellSerilis.net network! <br><br>If your interested in either of these things then get in contact with me.<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Inte's Super Duper Sword of Death<br><br>Yeah that 150dmg 15 delay sword was our fault. We wanted Inte to be carrying a flaming sword, and one of the game designers figured that no one would ever be able to kill him and made the sword a little unruly. We did have the forethought to make it NORENT though, and changed the stats in the item database to something a little less nasty, but we went so long without patching items that someone actually managed to kill Inte two days before the patch. <br>That'll teach us to go around calling NPCs unkillable :)<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> A couple of new guilds being added to the list today. I also have posted 2 new Roleplaying Stories to the site, one from Aeani and one from Dakkar. Good work guys, these were GREAT reads, keep the stories coming!<br><br>I received email from a player who asked whether or not I would be willing to host personal player pages. Anyone else interested in this? Basically, what would need to happen is the page would have to be developed, kept to a certain size, and the html and pics would need to be sent in to me. In order to give persons access to upload and update pages themselves, i would have to start adding FTP access accounts to my site which would get pricey. I am willing to post/host content for players, just not certain of the demand for it. If you have a personal page, i will be happy to link it from the soon to come Player Listing.<br><br>Anyway just a quick request for feedback. Please add comments to this news post letting me know whatcha think.<br><br>Del.<br></font><br><br><br>

They work much better now.<br><br>The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br><br>The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from "Outdoor only" to "Night only". It may now be cast in dungeons.<br><br>Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to inscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians under level 50.<br><br>*General Changes/Fixes*<br><br>Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity. If a deity restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you right-click-and-hold on the item.<br><br>The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<br><br>The Terror Mask will now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as previously announced. The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this item by mistake.<br><br>The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br><br>The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br><br>Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br><br>Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro (Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much easier time of obtaining their armor.<br><br>Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br><br>Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate action of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell line-up.<br><br>Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument in use.<br><br>*Kerra Ridge*<br>Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The target level-range for the zone has been slightly increased. In addition, many new quests have been added to the zone. The faction for Kerrans has been changed so that those who killed them indiscriminately before today's update can take part. Be warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<br><br>*Paw*<br><br>Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment. In addition, item drop percentages have been increased.<br><br>*The Plane of Hate*<br><br>The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp. Take care in your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br><br></font><br><br><br>

Not quite sure, i dont get an error or returned message. Right now, my inbox has had ALL emails replied to. So if you havent received a reply to your message, there is some error somewhere.

As for your specific questions, we prefer to leave them up to the players to figure out. I will say that we didn't overlook anything in regards to the Paw of Opalla, but I can't say whether or not it will still be obtainable after the zone goes live. <br><br>- Gordon<br></font><br><br><br>

<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well, time to move on to the next poll. The current issue was, how do you rate the performance of the boards in helping to resolve issues about raids scheduling. The results, while a little boggling to me, were:<br><br>Excellent (36 votes)       25%<br>Fair      (33 votes)       23%<br>Poor      (76 votes)       52%<br><br>I guess i find this boggling because we really havent even HAD any raid conflicts, and generally, the most trafficed part of our board is the Raid signup and scheduling.
