                  Death of Dodder Part 1</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
                  Our beloved Dodder has been brutally slain. Killed by Dark Elf 
                  Guards, on an unknown mission. His belongings were brought to 
                  his fellow guild members in the fields of the East Commons.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  The cries of horror from his fellow brothers and sisters could 
                  be heard throughout the land. And later the questions and the 
                  need for vengeance pushed some of Dodder's friends to the edges 
                  of the known world, and beyond; to lands unexplored. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
                  time after the death of Dodder, a lone traveler was heard to 
                  tell a tale in a tavern in HighKeep. He spoke of a wraith wandering 
                  the Common lands, crying out for vengeance. Crying out that 
                  the body that had once housed this poor soul had been slain 
                  before his mission could be finished. Thus the spirit had been 
                  doomed to wander his path until his death was avenged and his 
                  mission completed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Many different people, from the lands of the Elves, to the coastal 
                  city of Qeynos, told this story with sorrow in their eyes and 
                  hearts. Many claimed to have seen or heard the phantom, and 
                  it seemed as if the spirit roamed the area between the Tunnel 
                  to Northern Ro and Nektolos Forrest, but occasionally it had 
                  been reported to be seen in Erudin, or even as far as Unrest. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
                  versions of the story had the spirit tracking something, highly 
                  concerned about the direction from which it came, as if the 
                  spirit were afraid of being followed. Some told the tale of 
                  the wraith pursuing something as if bent on vengeance.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Soon after the wraith first appeared, the tale was told in the 
                  presence of one of Dodder's fellow brothers-in-arms.</font></p>

                  Mentor was sitting in the tavern that he and Dodder used to 
                  meet in. It was this very tavern that Mentor first met Dodder, 
                  when the fool ranger thought to heckle him during one of his 
                  storytellings. Thinking of Dodder brought to mind the tale of 
                  the wraith that has been rumored to be haunting the Commons 
                  of Freeport. He had only heard the tale last night, when he 
                  stopped at a camp of two young druids. How these two events 
                  would be related Mentor could not say. Until he happened to 
                  talk to his fellow guild sister, Ainasa, that very night. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fully 
                  intent on finding out more about this wraith he had heard of 
                  last night, he quietly sat in a dim corner. Tonight, was one 
                  of the few nights he didn't want to be called upon to sing a 
                  tale, for he was more interested in the hearing of one. The 
                  bard drew some attention at first with his Wood Elven features, 
                  dark hair, and vibrant blue eyes, but soon when the citizens 
                  saw he only meant to sit at his corner table, they lost interest 
                  in him. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                  a few more ales, Mentor was ready to retire to the room he had 
                  rented for the night, when suddenly the door to the tavern opened 
                  and a figure stood in the doorway. Firelight gleamed off the 
                  surface of the warrior's crafted armor, and the noise in the 
                  tavern died down as the citizens of Highkeep wondered who had 
                  come into their midst. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mentor 
                  felt eyes upon him and drew further back into the shadows; he 
                  wanted no trouble with the newcomer. He only wanted to sit, 
                  drink his ale, and hopefully hear about the spirit. The door 
                  closed and Mentor heard footsteps approach his table. He sighed 
                  and prepared to start singing Tuyen's Chant of Flame. Although 
                  he wanted no trouble, he did not think that this day would be 
                  a good day to die. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ha, 
                  can't hide from me bard." Came a melodious voice, close to Mentor's 
                  ear. Soft and sweet, the voice brought to mind the trees and 
                  fields of Kelethin, visions of home.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Ainasa, every time I hear your voice I think you should be 
                  a bard. Then I remember your singing." With that Mentor looked 
                  up and smiled at the lovely Wood Elven Warrior. And promptly 
                  forgot all about singing a song of battle. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                  hair the color of spun honey, and eyes as blue as the Ocean 
                  of Tears, Ainasa was truly a vision to behold. Mentor wondered 
                  how many men lost their hearts to her right before she took 
                  their lives. If he hadn't been such good friends with Banidain, 
                  and a loyal Protector of Norrath, he would be jealous of his 
                  guild leader. For two years ago the two warriors had pledged 
                  their lives to each other.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Ment, I've heard stories…" Ainasa sat down and ordered herself 
                  ale. The two friends talked long into the night, telling each 
                  other the bits of information they had gleaned from stories 
                  and rumors told around campfires. "I believe Dodder's death 
                  may have something to do with the appearance of this spirit, 
                  in fact, I think it may even BE Dodder. And if it is we owe 
                  it to him to find out." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  two sat back, quietly thinking about all they had just learned, 
                  all that was happening in their world. Mentor thought of the 
                  story the druid told him, of the Spirit in a red tunic tracking 
                  something, running very quickly. So quickly they had been unable 
                  to keep up with it even with Spirit of the Wolf. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
                  agree Ain, I find that I am curious as to what, or who this 
                  is haunting the Commons. If it is Dodder, then we as Protectors 
                  and his friends owe it to him to put his spirit to rest. Lets 
                  get a good night's sleep, and set out for the Commons in the 
                  morning, by time we get to the Forest border it will be dusk, 
                  and hopefully we will see the wraith.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  The next morning, they set off in the in which direction they 
                  had last seen Dodder, the East Commons border to the Nektolus 
                  Forrest. During their trip they both have dreams of Dodder, 
                  and even see the wraith late one night traveling from the Tunnel 
                  of the Northern Ro desert to the Forest border. Before they 
                  get close enough it disappears, but they do agree that it was 
                  in truth the spirit of their guild brother "Dodder." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ainasa, 
                  that was Dodder. He was wearing that red tunic he was so proud 
                  of." Mentor said sadly. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ment, 
                  he was crying out in sorrow. Did you hear the longing in his 
                  voice?" Ainasa asked.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "He is morning his unfulfilled mission." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No, 
                  it was anger Ain, Dodder didn't want to die, but something convinced 
                  him it was preordained. I never understood why he didn't just 
                  come back to the gathering. All of the Protectors could have 
                  handled a couple of Dark Elf guards." Mentor stated.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Anger? No, you are projecting your feelings onto the spirit. 
                  We are all angry he died, but Dodder was morning his fate. That 
                  must be why he is here!" Ainasa exclaimed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ainasa, 
                  it is vengeance Dodder wants. I hear it clearly." Mentor said, 
                  exasperated. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Ment, 
                  what are we doing? I'm getting angry with you! And I don't understand 
                  why. You are as concerned about this as I; it has to be this 
                  place. We are too close to the Prince of Hate and his children; 
                  I can feel the hatred for us. Lets go home to the Protectors 
                  and tell Banidain about this." Ainasa said.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's 
                  too late to do anything now, lets move a ways away, up on the 
                  hill a bit and camp. Tomorrow we'll go to Ban and call the rest 
                  of the Protectors together, and maybe some of our allies. We'll 
                  try and find out a way to release Dodder's soul." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                  that the two friends began to set up camp and they talked of 
                  other things, until finally Mentor said they should get some 
                  sleep. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You 
                  go Ment, I'll take first watch. I don't like being this close 
                  to that Forest. And Ment, I think if we could find out what 
                  Dodder's mission was we could find a way to help him." Ainasa 
                  said sadly.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Agreed, but we will find a way Ain, trust me." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                  nearly broke Mentor's heart to see Ainasa so sad. He hoped for 
                  her sake, as well as for Dodder they would find something, anything 
                  out. Little did they both know that Dodder's mission would soon 
                  become the mission of the Protectors and their friends. </font></p>
