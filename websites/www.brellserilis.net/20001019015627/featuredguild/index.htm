              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Q: 
                BS.Net </b><br>
                Tell me a little about yourself, how long you have been involved 
                in Everquest and what kind of character do you play? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                I have played Everquest since the release of the product. I play 
                both a Rogue and a Cleric. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                What was your motivation to create a guild? What types of things 
                do you look for in guilds in general (as a player) and now as 
                a guildmaster? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                The concept of a group of players who help each other and be able 
                to communicate with each other freely in the game excited me. 
                I had been in two other guilds on the server that I originally 
                started playing, and found that I really enjoyed that aspect of 
                guilds. The inspiration came from the pitfalls I saw in those 
                two guilds, I felt if done differently things could have been 
                better. The things I did not like are the things I tried to change. 
                I do not feel that a guild can consist of people with either just 
                common interest or goals, I think this is only part of what is 
                needed. The other aspect that is needed is friendship and respect, 
                for without these two items I think that you cannot achieve harmony 
                in a guild. I also felt that a HUGE guild could never have these 
                qualities. I look for people I can trust and that I am friends 
                with or feel I can become friends with, after having lead a guild 
                for the past few months I still think that is what I look for. 
                Friendship gets you through the times when you do not see eye 
                to eye on issues and gets you over the hump so to say. Another 
                important thing for me is beliefs, not in a broad aspect, but 
                a common belief in what is right and what is wrong. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                Where did the name "The Burning Shield" originate? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                A very good friend of mine suggested it. We were trying to come 
                up with a name and it sounded good. I know to some that is not 
                a very good way to come up with a guild name but it did not matter 
                to me what the name was, rather what the guild stood for and what 
                the guild does.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                How many members are there in The Burning Shield. How many might 
                you be looking to add to grow the guild to your ideal size? What 
                are the approximent level ranges to your guild? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                There are about 15 to 20 members at the present time. I have never 
                taken an actual count. We range in levels from 5 to 50.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                What is the political and organizational structure of your guild? 
                Who are its officers and what do they do?<br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                I did not form this guild based on structure, it is a loose group 
                of friends and always will be. We have 5 officers but to be quite 
                honest most the members do not know who they are. We only have 
                2 rules and we all follow them so no real need has arisen to require 
                an officer to do anything in particular. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                How often do you plan guild events? What kind of events are planned? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                We plan them less frequently than even I would like in part to 
                a lack of a means to announce them. Recently we have started a 
                message board and are currently working on a web site to allow 
                us to plan things. Word of mouth is not a good means of communication 
                so once a month is how often we have planned events. Currently 
                we are planning a joint event with another guild to have some 
                general fun in Everfrost. <br>
                <b><br>
                Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                What is the theme of The Burning Shield? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                The theme of The Burning Shield is that good should be promoted 
                in the lands of Norrath and that all players should help one another. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                What are the joining requirements of your guild (if any) and who 
                would a potential member get in touch with if they wanted to join? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                Requirements for joining the guild are that you be of a "Good" 
                race and a "Good" class, for example no necros or Dark Elves. 
                A potential member would contact Taeolin, Mcbash, Etherial, or 
                Nedra. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                If you were to sum up your guild in one catchy, concise "motto" 
                what would it be? <br>
                <br>
                <b>A: Nedra</b><br>
                I cannot for the life of me come up with a motto to something 
                that is as much a part of how I feel as if it were an object. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q: BS.Net</b><br>
                How do you, as a guildmaster, promote unity within your guild? 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A: 
                Nedra</b><br>
                I try to promote helping one another by example. I try to help 
                when people disagree by bringing the two sides of an issue out 
                to the open and encouraging discussion on it. I propose a solution 
                in guildsay to any problem or subject that needs addressed and 
                encourage debate on it. Most of all I promote unity by being a 
                leader who respects other members as having good ideas and valid 
                statements, I am not a ruler or a dictator. I know that I am respected 
                as the leader but never would I take advantage of that and always 
                try earn that respect.</font></p>
