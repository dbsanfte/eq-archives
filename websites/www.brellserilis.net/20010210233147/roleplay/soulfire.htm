                  <br>
                  The cold wound its way into my weary bones as I trekked through 
                  the blinding snow blizzard, common to the frozen valleys of 
                  Everfrost.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  In the distance I could hear the yelping growl of a young Gnoll 
                  as it found another a victim to pounce... a young barbarian 
                  maiden sent out into this cruel unforgiving valley to prove 
                  her worth to her clan. I could not pass by and leave her to 
                  her fate... </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  closed my eyes for a moment, calling the power from within. 
                  Droplets of energy oozed from the pores of my skin, dripping 
                  from my fingers and striking the snow covered ground, causing 
                  steam to rise where they fell. I sent forth the pneuma of soulfire 
                  toward the gnashing abomination resembling man and beast. For 
                  a moment it's body outline was clear in the green-orange fire 
                  that enveloped it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  All too sudden, the natural quiet noises of the night returned. 
                  All that remained of the Gnoll pup was some charred flesh, still 
                  smoking in the aftermath. I did not linger. I made a cursory 
                  check of the girl - she was shaken badly, but otherwise not 
                  harmed beyond a few scratches. I wended my way on through the 
                  almost invisible, snow laden trail. My destination: the ice 
                  Orc camp bordering the Permafrost Tundra... </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                  I would find my Friend and brother in the arcane arts, Odaan 
                  Windweaver. An Enchanter of great talent and trusted ally, we 
                  made a pact to hunt together whenever possible...the aim, to 
                  obtain the strength to wield the ever growing powers we each 
                  command.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Arriving at the destination, I found myself among strangers 
                  - other hunters and adventurers of differing abilities. I waited... 
                  After some time I decided to leave, knowing I would find my 
                  friend in other, more temperate regions of Norrath. I summoned 
                  the energies and wove the dimensional bell that would transport 
                  me to the grand city of Qeynos. For as long as I can remember, 
                  the displacing, dizzy effect induced by the shift always surprises 
                  me; I will never get quite used to that.I opened my eyes and 
                  saw before me the massive stone structure of the entrance to 
                  the city - its portcullis had been removed as a sign of faith 
                  in all who entered by a long dead king. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  guards standing outside the entrance registered my appearance 
                  with hardly a nod of recognition. I greeted them as I passed 
                  the threshold of the archway leading into the city. I soon found 
                  the shop I sought:</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
                  Jewelry Box". Here I would buy the gems that I sorely needed 
                  for my workings of magic. It was then I received the thought, 
                  sent to me by Odaan, carried on the wings of magic, "I stand 
                  in the lands of the Karanas...come, quickly, to the south of 
                  the karana river...an evil unknown has turned the bird people. 
                  We have no choice but t to destroy them, for the evil is too 
                  deep in their beings. Come and join me in this battle..." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  thought faded from my mind, but it's meaning and portent remained 
                  etched clearly in my mind's eye. With grim determination I set 
                  out with utmost haste to the Karanas, lands of many dangers...some 
                  known...others only dreamed, but equally deadly. "How could 
                  the evil taint reach so far so soon?" I asked myself as I ran, 
                  using the magical enhancements of my trade to avoid suffering 
                  any weariness from the trek. Like bubbles in a cloudy pool of 
                  water, these nodules of evil continue to accost the vast lands 
                  of Norrath, never so much as a warning of their coming. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  source would be discovered. Then it would be a question of whether 
                  all who rallied to the fight would be strong enough to turn 
                  it back...this much I hoped. The day wore on, and as night drew 
                  closer, I started looking for a suitable place to rest for the 
                  night. I found an abandoned farmhouse. With the encroaching 
                  sound of thunder I found the door and entered. Inside I found 
                  other travelers, merrily talking to each other sharing news 
                  of their travels. Nodding to some of them, I found an empty 
                  corner of the room and sat down. I drew from the flask I carried 
                  some water and apiece of bread. Summoning a small tendril of 
                  energy, I converted the bread into meat and the water into a 
                  diluted honey mead. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking 
                  still another piece of bread, I ate my meal in silence as I 
                  listened to the banter of the others. The evil that had fallen 
                  on the birdmen of South Karana troubled me. Further south of 
                  the birdmen lay another land, the "Land of Unrest". </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                  place long ago cursed by dreaded forces. A place where magic 
                  wielding Gnolls are proliferate. It was there I would begin 
                  my investigations...perhaps I would be lucky and find key clues 
                  of this newfound bane of evil. Finishing my meal, I gathered 
                  myself and, closing my eyes, meditated. Moments later, my mind 
                  tranquil, I sent Odaan a Thought, "...I come, Brother. I am 
                  still in the west Karanas, and will be with you come the late 
                  day of tomorrow..." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  finished my meditation. Though my mind was refreshed, I still 
                  needed to allow my body time to recover from this leg of the 
                  journey. Gathering some of the strewn hay from the floor I fashioned 
                  a cushion for head and, lying upon it, I quickly fell asleep 
                  to the far off howls of a pack of wolves on the hunt, and the 
                  growl of a bear stating his territory. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 
                  last waking thoughts returned to the birdmen, once a proud peaceful 
                  race, turned and twisted by evil with no hope of salvation...a 
                  sad business indeed. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
