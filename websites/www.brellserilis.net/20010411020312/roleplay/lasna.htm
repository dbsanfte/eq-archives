                  The Walker of the Violet Twilight came to me in the night many 
                  years ago. I felt her. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shimmering, 
                  blackness upon blackness, a frosted shade manifested and quivering 
                  in the darkness. I could feel her arms of arctic ivory, soft 
                  and numbing wrapped around me, her breath a wave of ice sliding 
                  along the nape of my neck. Glacial. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"My 
                  son. My one true believer. My task I set before you, and you 
                  obey. Such is my will, and such is your faith." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her 
                  wintery words blew gales of her will though my heart. I heard 
                  her command: I obeyed. Calling forth the shadows about me, I 
                  set forth immediately to Castle Mistmoore.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Castle Mistmoore in the autumn. I stood before the gates of 
                  Mayong's Bastion, the fallen leaves spinning in the unquiet 
                  air. He was not home, and I was glad of this: I had no business 
                  with him. Through the gates my shadow passed, silent and unnoticed 
                  by his guard. I passed his servants, his courtiers, all the 
                  while drawn to the palpable aura of the one I was sent to find. 
                  I could taste him in the damp air of the granite castle, his 
                  spirit pulsating an angry red in the darkness: a light only 
                  I can see, and I saw it through the stone walls and tapestries 
                  of castle. I was drawn to him. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
                  empty corridor with no outlets, no doors. "How subtle," I smirked 
                  to myself underneath my shroud of shadows. I felt the one marked 
                  by the Walker behind the wall before me, and I prepared myself 
                  to meet him. The dead rose for me silently, scattered chips 
                  of bone upon hard stone. I stepped through the wall, and he 
                  was there. He was trollish in his features, giant plates of 
                  steel strapped to his grotesque form were his armour. He was 
                  a Knight of Mayong Mistmoore. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Xicotl," 
                  I whispered quietly. "You have been called home: you must return 
                  forthwith, as is your duty. And I am the road you must take." 
                  He raised his blade above his head, brought it down upon me 
                  viciously. A skeletal hand stopped the blade with its palm inches 
                  away from my shoulder, and my crimson hand reached out to touch 
                  Xicotl's chest. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Go 
                  home."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  A flash of light: he flew backwards to strike the wall with 
                  a clatter of metal. He did not rise again. My work was done. 
                  My work was not as stealthy as I was hoping it to be, and I 
                  turned to leave. "You kill my private guard, and do not choose 
                  to acknowledge my presence? I should be insulted." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                  voice in the darkness, soft and feminine, spoke to me amid soft 
                  splashes of water. I turned around to see her there before me, 
                  alone and nude in her bathing pool. Her pallid back was to me, 
                  her head half-turned to face me, a mane of snowy hair dripping 
                  beads of water in the dim lighting. She was beautiful far beyond 
                  any mortal comprehension. She exuded beauty in palpable waves: 
                  wave after wave of attraction. Tidal.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Why are you here." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
                  came to perform the wishes of my master, and my work is finished. 
                  I mean Lord Mistmoore no ill-will." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It 
                  is not Lord Mistmoore you have insulted." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No?" 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"No. 
                  I am Lasna Cheroon." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
                  rose up from the waters of her bath, firelight from the candles 
                  behind her causing the water to fall from her like a cloak of 
                  diamonds. The soft music of water in the silence as she rose 
                  up before me. I held my breath as she turned to face me, and 
                  averted my gaze from her as she reached to pick up a soft linen 
                  robe, which she lightly draped over her body. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You 
                  have insulted me. Xicotl was my servant, posted under my will 
                  to guard me." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
                  looked down upon his wasted body, the skin once brown now white 
                  and drained of life completely. She looked into my eyes, and 
                  I gazed back. I was consumed by the cold fire burning there 
                  behind her lidded eyes, and she beckoned me to her with one 
                  hand upraised. She smiled. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You 
                  will do, D`Estain. Now help me from my bath, please." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  did as I was told. She pressed her body against mine in the 
                  tranquil darkness of her bath, and her lips were incandescent 
                  upon my neck, an inferno setting my cloaked body alive in a 
                  holocaust of my own mortality. My arms encompassed her, my crimson 
                  hand flaring hotly against the small of her back.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "Yes, young one..," she whispered, her pale lips quivering lightly 
                  against my neck. "You will do." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--------------------------------------------- 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                  stayed with Lasna for centuries, it seemed. In fact it was only 
                  days. Her love was cruel in its fierocity. I was burned by her. 
                  Upon the last night I stared into her furnace eyes, my heart 
                  set reeling by the light I felt there. She bent her head to 
                  kiss my neck again, as was her wont, and as her lips found me 
                  I felt a surge of darkness cascade throughout the whole of of 
                  the castle, like mist over dark water: complete and blinding 
                  in its intensity. Her head reared back, and she had changed. 
                  Her eyes glared hot white light in the darkness of her room, 
                  sending the shadows fleeing from under her gaze. Her white hair 
                  fluttered back with a wind I could not feel, a wind I knew was 
                  not there physically. Her entire body blazed with light above 
                  me, and as she opened her lips to speak these words I saw glistening 
                  under her full lips the bone-white of two long fangs.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  "My lord Mayong has come home. And I am his." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She
