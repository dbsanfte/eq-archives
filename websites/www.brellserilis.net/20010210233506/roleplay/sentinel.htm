              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                small pool of crisp water could only be considered a blessing 
                from Tunare. Zephire drank deeply, tipping his head back and letting 
                the almost frigid water dribble down his face and neck, and doing 
                so revealed the deep red war berries hanging from the dark Ironwood 
                tree. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Perfect! 
                Tunare is indeed with me on this hunt." Smiling now he gathered 
                some togeather and slowly sang the song taught to him by his father, 
                a rythmic chant that called upon the land for power and protection, 
                and crushed the berries to form the deep blood colored face paint 
                of a Ranger about kill. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still 
                sensing the Orcs through the foliage, and knowing it would be 
                many hours yet before the sun set and they would travel, Zephire 
                felt he had time to honor his ancestors and call to the forest 
                for protection. While doing this he thought on his prey. A duo 
                of Orcs traveling swiftly from the borders of Kelethin. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                their spore Zephire traced accents from Felwith, a days travel 
                along a well used highway from the main lift. Zephire wondered 
                indeed what these two would be doing so deep into Elven territory. 
                A sharp snap of breaking branch brought him instantly into focus, 
                spinning round and drawing the long blood knife from it's worn 
                sheath.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                But the action was never completed, and the knife fell to the 
                ground as Zephire's world went black with the impact of something 
                cruel and heavy against the side of his head. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consiousness 
                returned with sharp, painfull clarity. Biting down pain, Zephire 
                composed himself and took measure of his situation. Only a week 
                before his entry to adulthood, he was remarkably adept at woodcraft 
                and overcoming physical hardship to endure under harsh environs 
                and situations. Though this was definately the most ardurous he 
                had faced to date, he was able to gain a semblence of composure.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                He could smell the Orcs near him, and something else. A sickly 
                sweet ordor intermingled with the harsh stink of the Orcs and 
                their victules, hardly worth being called carrion by Elven standards. 
                The new smell was musky and faint, which had a facet of something 
                familiar yet twisted.</font></p>
              <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Kroongth! 
                Ung kra da!"</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                And with that Zephire was yanked savagly to a sitting position 
                by rough and horny Orc talons, thick and jagged nails biting into 
                his flesh. Almost passing out from the pain of sudden movement, 
                a hard swing caught him in the chin dazzing him and bringing blackness 
                to bear again. But total blackness didn't come to him. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                was again hauled to a sitting position as an Orc grabbed his face 
                and sqeezed on Zephires jaw muscles forcing his mouth open. Foul 
                and burning liquid was sloshed down his throat, immediately causing 
                his eyes to water and face to flush.</font></p>
              <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There." 
                Zephire whipped his head to the left in surprise at hearing civil 
                Elven tounge spoken, to be rewarded by yet another flash of pain 
                in his head. "Dargth en choten wig." said the cultured voice, 
                and more liquid was forced down Zephire's gullut. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recoving 
                from his latest attempted drowning, Zephire heard light, firm 
                footfalls circle him from left to right. "You're quite lucky I 
                showed when I did little forest mouse. These fellows here were 
                quite interested in consuming you to break the day fast."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                Zephire surveyed the "fellows" Not two Orcs anymore, but 5. Two 
                huge in comparison to the others, and not of a cut that Zephire 
                had seen before on the previous Orcs he hunted on the borders 
                to Kelethin. Huge did them a disservice (if such a thing could 
                be done to an Orc), with black mail upon their breasts and well 
                honed swords at their sides. Each wore a bright steel helm with 
                the image of a snarling Orc face painted on its crest. Rivaling 
                Zephire in height and build these two were clearly some higher 
                form of Orc he had never come across or heard of. They eyed him 
                with a cool easiness of a wolf who knows without a doubt the rabbits 
                leg is broken. Zephire tried not to look like a rabbit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                cultured voice spoke again. "But what I need from you won't take 
                many breaths, and they will still have time to prepare you for 
                their midnight rations." A small laughter, almost childlike, broke 
                from the voice. Zephire was overwhelmed as the voice dipped near 
                him and stiffled him with the sickly sweet smell Zephire could 
                not discren earlier. Turning slightly he caught sight of who the 
                voice belonged to, and would have leapt clean to the Butcher Block 
                pass had he not been bound. He only succeeded in launching a couple 
                of feet into the air with fright and crashing to the ground, hitting 
                his head on the exact spot as his previous injury. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quickly 
                the darkness enveloped him, but not so fast that one word registered 
                and was spat from his lips in a shill cry, "Drow!" </font></p>
