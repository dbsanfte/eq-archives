                  Sitting in his study in the heart of Neriak, surrounded by ancient 
                  books and tomes of power. The queen mother has tasked all the 
                  heretics of Innoruuk to search, discover, and study; to unearth 
                  arcane magic from the forgotten continent of Kunark. Engrossed 
                  in deciphering a verse, the air in front of him shimmers then 
                  the beautiful vision of his love comes into focus. A message 
                  from her? How wonderful, though risky if found out. Before he 
                  can say a word she speaks quickly. “I am to marry another in 
                  the morrow, it is best for all. I am so sorry my sweet” and 
                  before he could formulate even a gasp as a response, the scrying 
                  pool disappears.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Jumping to his feet knocking chair and table aside the scribes 
                  gathered in the room stare at him in shock. With disbelief in 
                  his eyes he ponders the background of the vision he just saw. 
                  The water the flame tower, yes he knew this place, the abode 
                  of the foul Aviak. As soon as his minds eye had formed the location 
                  his feet where already at a dead run. Sprinting past the tunnels 
                  and gates of the city forcing others to clear the way. And from 
                  one glance at the determination in his face, none offered resistance. 
                  Even a few house matrons had to stop to make way, there would 
                  be a price or punishment to be extracted for that, but of no 
                  concern he had to…What, stop the wedding? No nothing made sense. 
                  How could this be? I have to see her, this is impossible.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Finally clearing the gates of the city, he felt the night chill 
                  ebbing and knew the sun would soon be up. He must hurry, as 
                  he summoned the enchantment of his boots and his feet started 
                  to move faster and faster. The countryside past through his 
                  mind as a blur. His mind running through the reasons that could 
                  have possibly led to this unbelievable course of events. He 
                  ran head long with reckless abandon, though few would dare to 
                  challenge his power.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  He arrived in time to see a host gathered around a ceremony. 
                  His love at the alter passing vows of devotion with a woodland 
                  elf. A user of earthly magic by his garb. How could this be, 
                  though the racial hatred of their land forced them apart he 
                  always knew there would be a time he could win her back, even 
                  if he had to raise an army of undead to dismantle the walls 
                  of Felwaithe one brick at a time to make it so. Feeling a knot 
                  in his stomach sending him to his knees in agony. As a tear 
                  runs down the side of his cheek, in an instant all the goodness, 
                  all the love and the influence being married to a Cleric had 
                  given him, has washed away. He feels his heart devour itself 
                  and leave a void. And in that moment Innoruuk plants a seed 
                  of hate. He stands confused, was this a vengeful trick of the 
                  Mother of All played on a dark necromancer who dared to soil 
                  one of her High Priestess or just Innoruuk having his fun. It 
                  did not matter, hatred and evil drew from his every fiber to 
                  feed the seed planted where his heart once was. Well if his 
                  life was to be rocked on its side because he is one to be feared 
                  and hated then that is what it shall be. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                  all the fair elf children wake in the middle of the night screaming 
                  from a nightmare in dread and fright, he wants to ensure his 
                  visage is the one thing holding them trembling. He will lay 
                  in wait at night and turn the land red with blood. And in his 
                  malice evoke his power to control his victim in death. To use 
                  the dead to reign ultimate terror in the land and to keep them 
                  damned and in eternal torment. </font></p>
