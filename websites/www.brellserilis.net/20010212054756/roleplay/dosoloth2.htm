                <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                Story of Dosoloth (Part 2)</font></b><br>
                <br>
                <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                could feel my heart's decay there in the blackness. I could feel 
                it dying, what little part of it which had been revived from its 
                umbral repose flaring as a shooting star and failing, failing 
                into the ether, rotten and cold. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
                fist tightened over the hilt of my blood red blade. My teeth ground 
                together, my jaw tightened. My muscles tensed under the iron shell 
                of my armour, prepared to strike the false creature down there 
                in the solace of her secret lair. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet 
                I could not bring my spirit to comply to my body's will. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                walked away. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                the deep woodlands of the Faydark I shivered under the wrath of 
                the Father. His divine will assaulted my body in wave after wave 
                of rile which sent my spirit screaming and tearing at the shackles 
                that was my body. My soul begged for release from his rage. I 
                could feel his shadowed visage floating before me, his cold breath 
                tearing at me with hissing words describing how I would join the 
                other heretics of his faith in a secret place upon his home plane. 
                And I heard them there, as I quaked before the wrath of my god: 
                their lamentations spoke of an eternity of desolation which no 
                mortal could ever know. The scorn banshees sang abominable songs 
                for me that night. I could bear it no longer. I took up my sword.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                I could feel her heart beating. I followed its sweet ringing to 
                the Koada`dal City, where I called forth my Father's will. I covered 
                myself in inky darkness and entered the stronghold unseen, unknown, 
                past shining steel-clad fairskin men who protected Tunare's City. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                aura of Tunare was smothering - I could hardly breathe through 
                the scent of her, but still I tracked my lover's heart. I could 
                feel it's rhythm slowing in slumber. Into the Temple of Tunare 
                I followed her. Behind a door of purest oak I could hear her breathing 
                softly, I could taste the smell of her jasmine-scented hair. I 
                drew my blade slowly, savoring the hushed venomous hiss of its 
                expanse leaving the scabbard. My gauntleted hands fell quietly 
                to the latch. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                stopped once more. My heart rebelled against the shadow of the 
                Father which followed me closely at my shoulder. His will and 
                my love for this Koada'dal temptress clashed there at the threshhold 
                to her chamber. And then he came. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                was another presence in her private chambers behind the oaken 
                door. It tasted like the Father Himself somehow -- silent, covered 
                in darkness. I felt countless deaths tied to this one being, but 
                unlike my Lord its touch was not a hateful one. It was duty for 
                this one - he was doing his duty even now. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                shook myself from the thrall of Innoruuk. This being was here 
                to take her life! Soft whispers emanated from the room. I attempted 
                to open the door. A flash of energy tore through me. I felt my 
                Sularyn's heart burst with light, and fade away softly into the 
                night. I had no need to perform the Prince of Hate's will that 
                night: another had already. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                opened the door to see her young body bone white and cold in the 
                scented spaces of her private room. Her window was open, the curtains 
                lashing the night air. It had already left here, but his essence 
                still pervaded my Sularyn's ashen body. Even as Koada'Dal, Sularyn 
                sent my heart reeling in my chest. I could have loved her. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                voice spoke to me then. And I will not forget it. "See now how 
                your failure to act has cost you your mate's life. You are my 
                Knight, Dosoloth: your choice of servant holds no interest for 
                me and had you complied to my wishes, she would serve you now 
                in death. But your disobedience has lost you a prize most fair, 
                and to the touch of a Heretic from the Lodge of the Dead. I will 
                not forgive you this, child, not til the stars burn cold. Bring 
                me the head of this Heretic and soothe your loss, and my displeasure. 
                Go." </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                now hunt him, I have tracked him here to these woods of Kithicor, 
                half a world away. For the loss of my lover, and for the pleasure 
                of my lord I will obey. I shall draw my sword across his throat, 
                and cloud his eyes with death. Such is the Father's will.<br>
