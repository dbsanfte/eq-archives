                Story of Dosoloth (Part 1)</font></b><br>

                <br>

                <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                am in hiding. I am coiled, a serpent with umbral steel scales, 

                and I am waiting for him to rise again. I know he will. And I 

                will cut him down once more, under the black rage of the Father. 

                Innoruuk's will be done.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

                Of the history of my young life I know little: I have lived but 

                twenty years upon barren soil. What I can recall from the cloudy 

                remnants of a child's memory I shall tell you, should you care 

                to listen. These words are the first and last I shall ever chronicle. 

                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                have no knowledge of my mother or my father, save that they were 

                Teir`dal, and exiled from Neriak to the granite walls of Castle 

                Mistmoore to serve the Great One, Mayong. I was taken from Lord 

                Mistmoore's abode as an infant, and left to die in the wastes 

                of Dagnor's Cauldron. Apparently I was an unexpected arrival. 

                My savior, who I would grow up to know as my father, swept me 

                up from under the pallid moon and to his benighted Estate, known 

                to the sparse local peasantry as Unrest.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

                My father was a man composed of faint luminescence and hushed 

                whispers, spectral and cold. His chill touch tried to comfort 

                me as I cried for living warmth, but he was much too far from 

                life to grant succour from my infant terrors. I matured in the 

                cold. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 

                was a man of honour in life, and so in death. When I grew old 

                enough to speak, I learned the Codes of Chivalry. When my arms 

                grew strong, he mercilessly taught me the art of war in the courtyard 

                of the Estate, using his frozen fists to scourge me should I tire 

                or drop my blade. When he was angry, his eyes could tear holes 

                through my pain, through fatigue and frustration, though above 

                all I raised my weapon after countless hours of practice out of 

                my devotion to my lord. Lastly he taught me faith to the Father, 

                Innoruuk. In the darkness of the Estate's cellars, amoungst the 

                cobwebs and living shadows, cloistered within a crypt which festered 

                with those mortals who hated enough to continue hating even after 

                death, I spoke to my god. And his voice was terrible with the 

                howling of the mad and undying, crippling in its intensity yet 

                innervating in its ire. I buckled before the rising rage of the 

                father while my very will flared as a feather ignites before a 

                holocaust. I was branded by the Father, a furious welt upon my 

                heart my sign of allegiance, and I knew upon the hissing strike 

                of the brand which scarred me that I was his vessel for all time. 

                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

                Upon reaching the age of sixteen I bade my father farewell, and 

                the gates of Unrest closed behind me for all time. I took with 

                me my lord's red-bladed sword and a suit of plate he himself had 

                forged for my use in the bowels of Unrest's furnace. I lusted 

                for living blood then, in my youth. I headed to the Faydark to 

                quench that thirst. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                had not seen a living being my entire life -- only the dead. The 

                first living being I had ever set my eyes upon was not a Koada`Dal: 

                she was dark elven. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her 

                name was Sularyn, of the Spurned, she said. Her skin shone in 

                the pasty light of the Faydark moon, the only beauty in a place 

                of oppression and misplaced arrogance, the homeland of the Koada`Dal. 

                Her verdant eyes struck a spark in my heart I had never felt before 

                in my father's house. I took her in my arms and held her. She 

                was warm! I was shocked to feel her soft body in my arms, her 

                heart beating strongly under her breast. In all the world I swore 

                no living being was as beautiful as Sularyn, my lady. I swore 

                that I would take her back to our rightful home in the proud city 

                of Neriak, although at the time I had no idea where the fabled 

                bastion of the Teir`Dal was. It did not matter really: we would 

                find our way home.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

                She whispered in my ear that she must prepare to depart, that 

                in the morning we both would flee from Faydark hand-in-hand, but 

                first she must prepare herself away from me in a secret place. 

                My chest ached to see her leave even though we had only met hours 

                ago, and she would return after daylight passed in favor of the 

                protection nightfall grants the dark elven race. My pain was so 

                great I could not bear her to escape my sight. I followed her. 

                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through 

                the woods, past glens of wildflowers I followed her. She left 

                a trail of glimmering sliver, like argent pollen, blowing behind 

                her gracefully and sweetly upon the midnight breeze. She found 

                a road and followed it; I did the same, from a distance. She finally 

                reached a darkwood tree which grew alone in a glen of fragrant 

                cedars, and pressed her hand to its rough bark. The bark shimmered 

                into nothingness -- a door nestled in the trunk. She opened it. 

                And in the strange light of the tree's inner room I saw her indigo 

                skin slide away as a serpent's skin to reveal soft white limbs 

                and a mane of pale yellow hair. Sularyn was certainly not of my 

                kind. She was one of those few who could whisper words of artifice 

                to the skies and mask their true identity. Sularyn's beauty still 

                scorched me, but the flame was different: this was my sworn enemy 

                standing lightly in her place of enchantment. This was Koada`Dal. 

                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

                died there in the darkness, my heart riven by betrayal. Behind 

                a cedar tree I wept fierce tears, blazing and molten tracks of 

                my anguish down my cheeks. I grasped for the one safeguard I had 

                been equipped with as a Knight of the Father: my faith. I half 

                whispered, half moaned quiet prayers to Innoruuk, for council. 

                </font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 

                he responded, his pronged and silvered tongue a hair's breath 

                from my ear it seemed.</font></p>
