                  <br>
                  A cool morning breeze blew over the grass in the western plains 
                  throwing the fresh morning dew glecining through the air. As 
                  the morning dew floated in the air a great warmth was in it's 
                  path. The speck of dew slamed into a raging wall of fire only 
                  to cause a glowing red log to let up a poof of steam from where 
                  the dew drop had been. The steam floated up, evaperating quickly 
                  causing a burning branch to move slightly to the left breaking 
                  in half sending up a berage of glowing sparks to be caught and 
                  dispearsed by the breeze. A bright white spark floated away 
                  in the breeze, floating from it's infernoie home towards the 
                  vast unknown past a bear in pain and agine and a soul trying 
                  to mend and calm the bear. As the figure reaches over to the 
                  fire he reaches for a hot iron singieing his own hand as the 
                  smell of burning flesh permiates the air. The glowing hot rod 
                  touches the paw of the bear sealing the wound with the echoing 
                  cry of pain from the bear being heard all over the plains. A 
                  few minutes later a bandage covered the paw and the bear was 
                  asleep on the ground resting. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  soul sitting next to the fire held a long object in his hand. 
                  It seemed to bend and flex as if made of very poor craftmanship. 
                  Obviously this arrow was not produced by a ranger or any other 
                  skilled fletcher as it was to frail to be used by anything less 
                  then a hunting bow as it would snap under the pressure of the 
                  twin used in good bows. With a quick twist of his wrists the 
                  arrow was snapped in two and tossed into the white crackling 
                  fire. The wooden shaft burst into flames almost exploding from 
                  the intense heat produced by the fire as the tip glowed an earie 
                  red then to white and slowly melted away. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  morning sun glowed red on the horizen with the figures of wolfs 
                  running in the distance. A short whistle let out by the man 
                  had the wolfs running towards him. He knelt down and pet each 
                  wolf as if they where mere pets. Licking him and searching for 
                  food they layed next to him. As he dished out rabbits to the 
                  hungry wolfs, he cleaned up his camp and puts out the fire returning 
                  the habbitate to it's original state. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                  walked over with his packs attached to him and wakes the bear 
                  up so that it won't be left behind as prey for any poachers 
                  around. The bear trys to stand up but bellows out in pain of 
                  his wound. As the wolfs came over and licked the bear on the 
                  face trying to encourage him to stand up the figure reaches 
                  down and helps lift the bear upwards. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                  he lifted the bear upwards a crash of thunder boomed over head. 
                  As the lightning flashed everything slowed down to a halt. The 
                  world faded away leaving just an empty dark void in his head. 
                  Familer faces flash ramdonly before his eyes. People he hadn't 
                  thought about in ages after his self isolation. Laughter filled 
                  the air as he remembered helping a young female woodelf bard 
                  in ButcherBlock. The sounds of joy she brought to whom ever 
                  was around her was so great. Then there was the palidens and 
                  clerics of various races that celebrated the joy of life with 
                  anyone and everyone. The happyiness abounded everywhere as faces 
                  came into view he could no longer remember names to as they 
                  where distant relics of his past. Romping through the sands 
                  of oasis as teenagers out to prove how big and bad they where 
                  but yet always staying together never leaving each others side 
                  as in a binding of a blood oath. The joys and adventures they 
                  shared where enlightning and soulbinding. The love they poured 
                  out to everyone around them was so powerful that even Erollisi 
                  Marr could be seen around these individuals. Then faces flashed 
                  of friends of evil whom would do anything for anyone who hadn't 
                  stepped on them or done wrong to their friends. Joy, Happiness, 
                  and love of all permiated through these beings as well. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                  awoke on the ground with the bear and the wolfs looking and 
                  whimpering wondering what had happened to him. He tried to stand 
                  up but found he was extremely soar. What was he seeing. Who 
                  and/or what was causing these visions... Why must he see them 
                  and go through the pain of remember all he tried to forget in 
                  his past. He held onto the bear and slowly moved to his feet 
                  but as he did he heard another bang of thunder and his memory 
                  flashed again. This time he remained concious but felt rain 
                  starting to come down around him. The sky broke out into thunder 
                  and lightning worse then he had ever seen before. Everything 
                  around him was cowering from the approaching storm or was not 
                  to be seein at all. The plains where empty as far as the eye 
                  could see but yet a storm raged overhead. The bear and the man 
                  slowly moved towards a hill side with the wolfs in tow to find 
                  some sheltar. Why in all of the god's name was the beautiful 
                  morning changing to a massive lightning storm. He took cover 
                  under a small groove of tree's and built a tiny fire. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                  the fire burned it changed colors from the yellow/red fire he 
                  was used to, to a weird blue and white. Shruging this off the 
                  man layed down next to the bear and the wolfs who had fallen 
                  asleep next to the warmth of the fire under the dry trees. As 
                  he fell asleep the last things he heard where the crackling 
                  of his fire and the rain and lightning around them. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
                  felt like minutes must of been hours as the fire had burned 
                  out and the storm had passed. Voices could be heard close by 
                  and the wolfs where missing from the camp. Foot steps came closer 
                  and shouts men claiming they had killed the biggest wolf could 
                  be heard. He staggered to his feet and felt a blow to his head 
                  as he staggered forward and fell to the ground. He reached back 
                  and felt fresh warm blood ooze onto the back of his head and 
                  stood up slowly as his head throbbed. He turned around to see 
                  a bunch of men in armor weilding axes, swords, and a few men 
                  in robes and cloth with hands flowing and pulsating with magic. 
                  A man in shiny metallic armor stepped forward demanding the 
                  man move out of his way, sword in hand as if he was ready to 
                  attack something and then one of his companions called out in 
                  a language long familer but somewhat forgotten telling him, 
                  Jebidia, that he should shot the bear with his bow instead of 
                  getting in a fight right off so that his group could all help 
                  instead of watching him get beat on tell the beast was back 
                  at the group with their comrade possible hurt. With blood still 
                  coming out of his head he turned around seeing the bear growling 
                  and holding up his hurt paw. The bear was screaming in pain 
                  and agony and you could tell he was asking for help in his own 
                  way. He turned around and looked at the man with the bow and 
                  with slurred speach he said, "You shall ... *cough* ... not 
                  hurt my friend back there" The group laughed and the one called 
                  Jebidia said, "Move you lunitic, this is our prey and if you 
                  have anything to say, you can just run off to another animal 
                  and pretend it was your friend 'cause we don't care to listen 
                  to you!" With that he pulled the bow taunt and aimed for the 
                  bear. All the sudden a boom was heard and the sky broke out 
                  into another storm. The men all looked up and commented on how 
                  this was truely a bezar day with so many storms. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  lightning flashed and he feel to his knees screaming in agony. 
                  Jebidia looked down and laughed with his group. A robed wizard 
                  in the background pushed forward in front of the group after 
                  an intensly bright flash. Rain started to pour down and the 
                  thunder became louder then ever. The lightning filled the air 
                  constantly causing it to be brighter then day. As the man screemed 
                  in agony and terror the wizard looked on in shock. Visions filled 
                  his head of a great evil to come. He saw his old friends and 
                  companions struck down bleeding. He saw flashes of an evil race 
                  stepping onto Antonica and Faydwer killing all, even the woman 
                  and childern. He saw his old bard friend trying to escape for 
                  her life with tens of these evil beings chasing her. Her armor 
                  was dented and ripped up and blood flowed from her face from 
                  deep cuts from a dagger. She was falling limp to the ground 
                  and trying to pull herself away from them. They stabbed her 
                  repeatedly and stripped her of her armor laughing in glee as 
                  the bard bleed to death. Then more images of his friends flashed 
                  as their bodies washed up on shore broken and bleeding. They 
                  where completely lifeless, void of a life he once charrished 
                  with them, as if their gods had forsaken them.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  Lightning continued to flash as the booms from the thunder over 
                  head grew louder to the point of almost being deafining. The 
                  wizard started to move forward motioning for another in the 
                  back to come forward. As a woodelf in the back stepped forward 
                  toward the wizard, the wizard was leaning over about to touch 
                  the man on his knees in a ball crying in pain. Jebidia looked 
                  down and inquired as to why the wizard was bending down and 
                  what he was looking for. The wizard turned his head and looked 
                  at Jebidia and said, "I thought I saw something of importance. 
                  Give me a second m'lord." With that Jebidia knelt down in his 
                  armor sliding the tip of his sword into the muddy ground before 
                  him, motioning his fellow men to watch the bear. One of them 
                  pulled back on his bow aiming at the bear as the bear roared 
                  aloud and started to move towards his friend as the strangers 
                  where moving upon him. The thunder boomed louder and he screemed 
                  out louder then ever. The visions where intensifying as he saw 
                  Kelethin in flames and his once proud people being driven as 
                  slaves to this evil. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visions 
                  of the mighty High Elf casters being slayin and their Paladins 
                  being killed by this new evil. Visions of Qeynos burning as 
                  the undead sabers and the paladins united to defend the city. 
                  Commander Bayle dead on the ground and Antonius Bayle being 
                  whipped like a slave as while as being beatten. Visions of the 
                  Qeynos Hills being ran by the gnolls whom had allied with this 
                  evil. Cros and Holly lay dead as Surefal Glades is being assulted. 
                  The evil outnumbering and overpowering the druids and rangers 
                  as while as any others who where about. Druids, Necromancers, 
                  Shadow knights, Paladins, Magi of all kinds, Clerics, Warriors, 
                  Shaman, Rogues, and Rangers of all races united together against 
                  the might of this new evil. The wizard reached down and whiped 
                  some of the blood of the mans neck. At the next long flash of 
                  lightning the wizard feel backwards in shock, as the woodelf 
                  took a staggering step backwords. The wizard turned towards 
                  the woodelf with a look of pure shock. The wizard turned to 
                  Jebidia and almost in a whisper said, "M'lord, Leave the bear 
                  be! I will be back in an instant and have the cleric heal and 
                  help him. I have a debt to repay to a old friend whom has helped 
                  me. I feel I can now repay his debt partly, if not in full." 
                  With that the wizard begin to chant a spell and the woodelf 
                  stepped closer to him as a flash of light surrounded the wizard 
                  creating a portal that he and the woodelf walked through. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  storm grew louder and a female human cleric stepped forth and 
                  looked at Jebidia with confusion. She asked him what she was 
                  to do and Jebidia shrugged knowing not what was going on but 
                  instructed her to heal and mend the wounds they had caused. 
                  As she got closer to the man he stood up quickly with an intense 
                  fire raging in his eyes and yelled up into the air "WHY ARE 
                  YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER ANY OF THEM 
                  OR SEE THESE IMAGIES!" With that the sky broke out into a deafining 
                  roar that caused everyone to cover their ears in pain, except 
                  the man who just stood their with a fire blazing in his eyes 
                  glaring up at the sky. A member of the party looked around and 
                  commented to Jebidia that Karana or Tunare was here teaching 
                  this person a lesson. Just then another long thunder roared 
                  and the man yelled up into the sky again, "Tunare, Please no 
                  more visions... I beg of you Karana to spare my soul this suffering!" 
                  Again the sky roared out and he begin to weep as boiling blood 
                  came out of his eyes instead of tears. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  cleric pulled her mace out and stepped backwards and Jebidia 
                  pulled his swordtip out of the ground and beign to swing his 
                  sword around. The man looked down and saw the bear in front 
                  of him roaring at the strangers infront of him. He looked about 
                  and saw they all had weapons drawn and remembered back to being 
                  hit on the head. He glared at them said in a deafly tone, "For 
                  your sins against the animals you must pay!" With the last word 
                  falling out of his mouth his skin turned a bright red as fire 
                  errupted in his hands and eventually envelped his whole body. 
                  The small groove around them lighted up as if it was day but 
                  was changing color from a dark red to a bright red to a orange 
                  then a yellow. The heat from this man was so great that the 
                  wet ground dried up and cracked under the intensity of it. Just 
                  then another roar was let out in the sky and he yelled looking 
                  up into the lightning, "YES TUNARE AND KARANA, I WILL DO YOUR 
                  BIDDING ONCE MORE!"</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  He looked back down and closed his eyes as the others stepped 
                  back confused. Just then a portal opened up next to him and 
                  he opened his firey eyes to turn and look. Out stepped the wizard 
                  and his woodelf friend was shortly behind him. The wizard reached 
                  out his hands and yelled, "No my friend stop!" as a few other 
                  figures started to emrge from the portal. One pushed out of 
                  the portal yelling "DAKKAR???" as another stepped out seeing 
                  the blood on his face and begin to weave the healing magic he 
                  had long since mastered. More poured out of the portal seeing 
                  their old friend in the process of casting a spell they drew 
                  their weapons and ran towards him looking for his assialent. 
                  A few voices he recognized after his years of suclussion. He 
                  lowered his hands to his sides and let the fire die down as 
                  he turned around towards two dwarfs. His eyes still on fire 
                  he looked at them and said in a quite voice, "Mcbash?? Megrunt?? 
                  Leylia?? Fumarie?? Dakthek?? Jimwise?? Etherial?? Moz?? Seph?? 
                  Is it really you?" And Mcbash holstered his twohand mitheral 
                  swords on his back and looked up with as much of a smile a dwarf 
                  could muster saying, "Aye lad, Tis us and we damn glad to be 
                  seein' ya be ok! Where 'ave ya been? Why did you disappear all 
                  the sudden? And what be wrong with your eyes my brother?" Dakkar 
                  then looks up towards the heavens noticing the storm had passed 
                  and that the people in his visions where standing next to him. 
                  Dakkar looked down with the fire in his eyes barely sparking 
                  and patted his short friend on the head and said, "All will 
                  be told soon my friend, very soon..." <br>
