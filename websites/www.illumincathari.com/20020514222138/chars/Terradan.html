<a href="http://users.tm.net/mysticcrusaders/terradanxxavia.jpg"><img src="terradanxxavia.jpg" width="242" height="300" alt="" border="0" align="right"></a> Norrath, a land ruled by greed, betrayal, death, and violence.  It is here the Gods control the beings of the world with thoughts of treasure.  No person safe from the will of the Gods.  Many look to the Gods of light to protect over the lands, but this is an impossible task because much of the greed that gives the Gods of evil their power comes from the hearts of those the Gods seek to protect.  It is here that a select few are given their chance to make a difference.  Many are just common people sworn to protect the land by becoming a Paladin or a Cleric who tries to save the souls of those who stray from the path.  Through all of time one chosen person has lead these people instructed by the Gods of light to sacrifice everything to try and make Norrath a better place.   One hundred years ago the last chosen protector of Marr fell in a battle with Cazic Thule.  Since then the land has not been the same.

 <br><br>

            On an island shrouded by mist sits a temple constructed by exiled peoples of Antonica.  For centuries they have pushed forward to learn all that is magic.  Many of the best magic using people of Norrath have come to the island to train and serve as court officers to the king.  It is here the story of Thamasa continues and the story of a druid begins.  

 <br><br>

            On the eve of King Arrownys induction to the thrown a baby arrived on the door step of the palace. The maidens brought it to Arrowny and asked what he would like done with it.  He instructed them to take it to his priest Celestian to see if he could find out of what origin the baby may have come. Many weeks past and the baby was cared for by Celestian as if the baby was his own.  But at the same time Celestian studied the baby elf as if something was wrong with the child.  The baby was not normal Celestian could see that for sure.  Celestian finally gave the baby the name Terradan.  Celestian believed the child was of the land and therefore his name.    By the end of the first year of Arrowny’s court the baby was speaking three different languages and performing healings with Celestian.  The Child was remarkable when it came to the power of healing, but Celestian insisted healing was not what the child was brought to Norrath to do.  Celestian knew the child was that of the Gods but no one believed him, except Arrowny.  By Terradan’s twelfth birthday Celestian had grown old and was sure to pass within days. Terradan sat by his side night and day using his magic to give Celestian more time to pass his knowledge on.  Finally Celestian asked Terradan to stop for they were both feeling the pain of death and he did not want to kill Terradan along with the pact they shared.  

<br> <br>

            After Celestian’s death Terradan disappeared into the wild of the island for five years.  On occasions Arrowny would see Terradan watching over the people of the castle from the shadows.  In all those years Arrowny never elected a person to take Celestians spot as High Priest of Thamasa and for was for good reason, the spot was meant for no other person then Terradan.  Finally Terradan came from the wild and spoke to Arrowny of what he has learned from the trees.  There was a war coming for the island and they had to make ready.  It was at this time Terradan was given the honor of High Priest. 
<br><br>
            

            Terradan was still young, very young for an elf; he was only eighteen when the war came.  He proved himself in battle along side the King’s Paladins.  But nothing could stop the Orcs, Goblins, and Necromancers from stealing the island.  The battles lasted for what seemed like years, but the island fell and the people were enslaved.  By some chance miracle the king was safely taken from the island as his inept father-in-law ported them away.  Terradan stayed trying to rescue the rest of the king’s court.  Many more fell but Terradan managed to save most everyone.  Evil had now taken the most powerful island in all of Narrath, yet no one even knew it existed.   
<br><br>
Soon after the battle many of the surviving people of Thamasa reunited to make plans.  The king was devastated, but Terradan made the king believe there was hope.  The king gave Terradan the last name of Estel, which in Elvish translates to “Last Hope.”  He instructed Terradan to travel the land and learn all he needed and find people who would help save the island.  Terradan complied and the King and his High Priest split up taking advisors in each party.  There was hope, but it did not look good.
<br><br>
Terradan traveled the lands of Norrath for the first time; he saw many things he did not like.  Things were peaceful on the island, the trees were alive, and the animals were safe.  But here nothing was sacred.  It saddened Terradan but through his anguish his power grew.  Soon he found himself doing things that no other Druid could do his hand was guided as if it was a tool of Tunare many of Terradan’s friends would say.  Terradan’s path never strayed he always had his mind on his goals. Tunare watched with happiness, she had chosen the right one.  
<br><br>
Finally one day Terradan’s path strayed from a priest of Tunare, he had fallen in love.  But it was this love that made him a better protector of his friends and his king.  His love filled that empty void.  It was here that Tunare appeared before Terradan and asked why he loved one of the Dark God.  “I love that which is pure in this world and I was sent here to stop evil.  I will protect everything that is good or evil in these lands from the light and the darkness that shrouds these people.  I see it fitting that I love one which is both evil and good.  For the women I love will never be one which you will understand Tunare, she will give me my edge over you.”  Tunare became very dissatisfied with Terradan and it is here she struck him down.  Terradan’s mind burned, he knew his powers of healing were going from his body, but even as Tunare sucked the magic from him he stood. “My will is strong; you made me that way Tunare.  You cannot undo that now.” Tunare then stopped and smiled.  “You may just be the right one for this world yet,” she replied.  “I will not give you your full power until you can prove that the only way for me to rule this land is by controlling even the subjects of the Dark Gods.  Their subjects have no place in my view, but I give you your chance to prove me wrong.”  Terradan smiled and said “Well then get ready to be wrong Goddess, I will always love you but you cannot control everything that is mortal, I love her, I love Xxavia and she will be my wife.”  Tunare disappeared and Terradan waved his hand and ported to his loves side. 
<br><br>
Xxavia made Terradan happier then he had been since his teacher had died.  She was the most beautiful elf he had ever seen with her slender body and beautiful eyes.  He could not understand how one so innocent could be one of the people he once considered his enemy.  As they fought side by side he learned the dark elf he had fallen in love with was even stronger then when she first saved his life.  She harvested her power of necromancy, but she was not one of magic her power was in her sword and her beauty.  Two months after they met they were married in Lake Rathetear.  Friends and Family joined the two and made it the happiest day of their lives.  Terradan now protects his king with the magic of the land, and his wife with his love.  One day Thamasa will be reclaimed and they will all be by each others side.  Until then they make preparations and live the lives of mortals.
