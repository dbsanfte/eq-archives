<img src="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/profile/205.jpg" alt="" border="0" align="right">Long ago, when the 

world of Solusek Ro was still young and every caster thrived to attain a Runed 

Totem Staff, a young Enchanter stepped out from Neriak to see the light of day- 

well- as best as the light could shine in the forest of Nektulos. He was, 

admittedly, a bit concerned with the teachings he had received compared to his 

other spell casting brethren. He liked to observe the other schools, to learn 

what they were teaching and doing... he watched the Wizard instructors in awe as 

they burned targets from great distance, he watched the Necromancers raise great 

warriors from the earth and poison their victims, even stealing their very 

life-force. He watched the Mages conjure forth elementals and other powerful 

magics. So as he walked out from the long tunnel, he stared intently into his 

spell book and wondered how his limited and makeshift collection of random 

spells could possibly help him against the creatures that inhabit 

Norrath?<br><br>Adventuring, he learned to harness every spell available, 

realizing that his true power lay in the balance of all of his spells working 

together to confuse or stun the enemy, to slow them down, while also casting 

magics to summon his own pet to him up. In his teens, he spent much time 

alone just outside of Nektulos, at a tree near the Orc camps just outside the 

glow of their campfire. While much time was spent studying, in the realm 

Lasombra already began to make a few friends who would later come into play.. 

Jochim, another young Necromancer from Neriak, Cerebros and Sinlain, young 

wizards from the same school... and even Calidore, his first experience with a 

non Tier'dal, a Human Shadow Knight who had embraced the darker side..<br>

<p>Time again passed, and the woodland creatures of the commons no longer held 

challenge; it was time for Lasombra to pick on people his own size...he began 

hearing tales of a camp of cutthroats, brigand humans who set up camp in the 

west. As he ventured out to find this camp, he came into his first contacts with 

a guild. He grouped with a young Rogue from the Shaol family, her name was 

Shaolviale. As Lasombra learned more of the guild structure, he thought it to be 

wondrous to have such backing with others in the realm, up until that point his 

only bonds were loosely fitted to personal friends. As they hunted the 

Dervishes, Lasombra learned the ways of controlling the pace of combat.. the 

Dervs were a family as well, and any attack on one of their kin would bring 

forth a swarm; he learned to use his Mesmerization skills to stop them in their 

tracks and let the party kill each off one by one.</p>

<p>By the time Lasombra neared his 20s, he learned of a human outpost deep in 

the mountains.&nbsp; "High Hold" was home to people of all races, although most 

of them good. He heard tales of the town being constantly attacked, both by the 

mountain Shralok Orcs who invaded from Kithicor, and the Gnolls on the other 

side who pressed their way up from the Karanas.&nbsp; Up until then, Neriak was 

the only home he had ever known, he was weary of aiding the humans in their 

cause for fear that they would treat him the same way they treated the Orcs... 

by the blade.&nbsp; At High Hold, Lasombra made many new friends, he met the 

first elves of other kinds, a high elf paladin named Bonita and a wood elf 

ranger named Talianna.&nbsp; Lasombra often grouped with the same people each 

day and helped slay hundreds of Orcs, until one day, a few of the Orcs had 

slipped away into the town, and Lasombra followed too closely.&nbsp; He nearly 

fell back as he tried to stop in his tracks, as a man dressed in the armor of a 

Captain came running towards him, blade drawn...&nbsp; as he clenched his teeth 

to accept his death, the blade flew swiftly past Lasombra, and found its mark, 

cutting down an Orc that had managed to sneak up on him.&nbsp; The Captain 

looked down at Lasombra... and smiled, saying that he heard tales of a dark elf 

who had lent his time and blood to their cause. He assured Lasombra that High 

Hold welcomed him with open arms, and that no harm would come to him. It was a 

feeling that would take him long to get over, walking around amidst humans who 

didn't sneer at him.</p>

<p>It was then that Lasombra began to wonder... can it be like this? Must all 

that is perceived good and evil in race and in deity constantly battle? Or can a 

balance be found, where common ground is established to team up against the 

bestiary that plagues the world..?&nbsp; Soon thereafter, Lasombra summoned 

together 9 of the closest friends he'd met along the way, a mix of light and 

dark.&nbsp; Represented were everything from wood elves to trolls; and with the 

idea of banding together to take on the challenges as a team.... the Illumin 

Cathari was born.&nbsp; It is rumored that in High Keep, there is still a note 

scribbled on the wall telling of the coming of the guild... and to this day, 

many decades later, the Illumin still stand as one of the oldest original guilds 

in Solusek Ro history.</p>

<p>As for Lasombra, a great while later, after all the frustrations passed, 

after challenges were overcome, he returned to the school where he once thought 

he was only learning tricks that would do him no good.&nbsp; He walked in to 

meet with his old mentor, who was sitting and feasting with the mentors of the 

other schools. They had been speaking of tactics and spells, ever arguing over 

the same philosophies of the most effective school.&nbsp; His own mentor, as 

always, sat silently and did nothing more than listen. As Lasombra stood there, 

inside he wanted to jump into the discussion, explaining deeply all the tactics 

that make the class so powerful. His mentor, sensing his eagerness, looked over 

to Lasombra, and said: "Enchanters....we are simply useless, aren't we..."&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>Lasombra catching the lesson, replied: "Aye, that we are..." and smiled to 

himself as the other mentors chuckled and continued with their 

discussion.
