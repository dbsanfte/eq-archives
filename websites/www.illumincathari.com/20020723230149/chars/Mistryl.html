<img src="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/profile/196.jpg" alt="" border="0" align="right">Mistryl Caelia began her life in Surefall Glade, not knowing what had called her there, but felt inside that her destiny would be fulfilled in this realm. She learned the balance of nature in the hills outside of her home, and grew into her powers and skills. One day, a voice from far away spoke to her, and she began to understand the fate that awaited her.<br>
<br>
That day, she met Lasombra Corazon and Talianna Bloodstone, her first friends in a hostile world. They showed her kindness and generosity she never expected, inspiring a new hope in the life ahead of her. She also noted shyly the enchanter's encouraging words and already felt the affection she had for him inside of her. They invited her to join their guild, the Illumin Cathari, and Mistryl found her family.<br>
<br>
She spent the next period of her life with strangers, trying to clean the scourge of gnolls in Blackburrow, but the voice of her guild made her feel like she was never alone. She met many people but none close to her as her friends Lasombra and Talianna. As time went on, she continued to grow and felt it was time to see the rest of Norrath. Her friends Talianna Bloodstone and Calidore Al'Madra took her away from the hills of Qeynos to the bustling lands of Freeport and Commons, and her life was never the same.<br>
<br>
In a strange land, Mistryl saw many new and exciting things, but was even happier to see her friend Lasombra more often. They spent more and more time together, and she felt that affection inside her grow. One day, in the sands of Oasis, Lasombra declared his feelings for her as well, and the two were engaged to be married. In time, Mistryl Caelia became Mistryl Corazon, and with her husband and her family, she found her destiny and looks forward to each day.
