      The Post Office: An untapped reality TV resource.
<br><br>
Today's ordeal involved obtaining a copy of my birth certificate that would be legit enough to be used in lieu of having a passport for the trip this week. My mom couldn't find it, and the copy I ordered long ago was only for identification purposes only, they need an official, raised-seal version for international travel. So I had to sign up online for a copy, pay the extra money to get the 2-3 business day flavor (that puts me at Friday or Saturday, cutting it close).  The problem was, I don't have a printer or a fax machine, so getting the application form ready, with photocopies of my driver's liscence front and back, signed, dated and faxed in was an adventure.   
<br><br>
I saved the application as a JPG, with the intent to head to Kinkos and borrow their hardware to make it all happen. The problem was, I sorta forgot to change the file type in Photoshop, so it got saved as a .jpg.psd file, which I then uploaded thinking it was just a .jpg file, to which I then drove out to Kinkos to sit down at the machine only to find out the URL I thought it would be was wrong.  So I had to drive back home, find out it got saved wrong, fix it, re-upload it, and drive back out to Kinkos to make it happen.  Luckily Mandy, the nice Kinkos fax and photocopy specialist, helped me get it all taken care of for about... $1.57.
<br><br>
The Post Office was just another stop on today's fun that kept me pretty much out of work since about 2.  I came home to find the mail man was just getting there. Good timing. I don't like to crowd the mail man while he does his work, so I opted to let him do his do and eat lunch in the place before going back out to check the mail.  When I did, I received a slip indicating that I had an express overnight envelop waiting for me, and that it was now on it's way to the Post Office becasue I "wasn't there" to sign for it.  What horseshit... the bastard didn't even try.
<br><br>
So I roll out to the post office, it's about 2:30-2:45.  Luckily, if you are there just pick items up, they have a side door that cuts the wait out of having to take a number.  Now you would think that with that in-and-out plan, I would not be subject to the more.. colorful characters that seem to frequent post offices.. but no.  I'm convinced they have weekly drawings to invite crazy people to come to the post office just to liven it up. 
<br><br>
Today's contestant was an older man. We'll call him The Opinionated Assertive Talker, or "Gus" for short.  I'm standing in line, with a woman behind me, and good 'ol Gus behind her.  He strikes up a conversation with her out of nowhere:
<blockquote>Gus: "You from Boston?" (I'll have to remember that sure-win ice-breaker)<br>
Woman: "Uh...no.."<br>
Gus: "Cause I mean what's the deal with you people putting Ted Kennedy in there, I mean really"<br>
Woman: "Oh.. I'm...I'm not from Boston."<br>
Gus: "Oh they love him out there, I mean sheesh, they think he hung the moon!"<br>
Woman: *Nervously* "Hehe..hehe.."<br>
</blockquote>
Right about then, thankfully, two tellers were freed up and asked me and her for our cards. She ran into the misfortune of not noticing her parcel had an $8 pick up charge associated with it, so after she left good 'ol Gus was next to hand over his ticket while my teller was back searching for the envelope.  I was then blessed with this lovely exchange which drug ME into it:
<blockquote>
Gus: "1-1-4-7-2!"<br>
Teller: "Huh? Oh your mail stop..ok.. I need to see some I.D."<br>
Gus: "What? 1-1-4-7-2!"<br>
Teller: "I gotcha, I need to see some I.D."<br>
Gus: "What the? What's 'gaigee'?"<br>
Teller: "<i>I.D.</i> sir, I need to see some <i>I.D.</i>, you don't want me to give your mail to someone else right?"<br>
Gus: "Oh uh.. here you go... "<br>
*Teller leaves*<br>
Gus, turning to me: "What's that 'gaigee' thing?"<br>
Me: "I uh.. I believe he was saying 'I.D.', as in identification, I think you just mishear-"<br>
Gus: "-Oh no... he said 'gaigee', I've never heard that before!"<br>
Me, with the look of "Wow" on my face: "Ah...right..."<br>
</blockquote>
And then, almost on queue, I turn away right into another interaction going on between one of the helper people on the floor and a small asian man, who has like 10 of the video-sized FedEx boxes in his clutches.
<blockquote>
Helper: "You need 2 more?! What in the world are you shipping?"<br>
Asian Man: "I need a for perfume, my girlfrien have a perfume she sell, use boxes"<br>
Helper: "These are video boxes!" (Getting flustered at the misuse, as if this is the first time she's ever encoutered a person using a box size for something out of the ordinary)<br>
Asian Man: "Oh it fit fine, jus need padding"<br>
Helper: "Well I.. I..!"<br>
*Asian Man scuttles off out the door*
</blockquote>
Ah, it's almost like watching TV. Not much of a day left after that, it pretty much ruined my chance to make it back to work to accomplish anything productive, so I stayed home and nursed my sore arms from the previous day's workout. Later that night I got a buzz to watch the Finals at Baby Blues, so I got to step out and watch Detroit stomp the Lakers into the ground. Lots of people were upset that the series ended in a sweep, but I was somewhat happy to see Phil and his cast of showboats get knocked down a few pegs by a well rounded team.<br />

      Operation: Lean-G Begins
<br><br>
I recently signed up for the gym at my work. It costs $7.88 a paycheck (so like $15 a month) and I can quit whenever I want.  Classes are all free and included.  Can't beat that, and now that I've shed about 30lbs on Atkins (Yes I've maintained it since that post) it's time to start building back lean muscle and getting back to roots.
<br><br>
So tonight was my first workout after work, I roll in with my best friends Brandon and Jacob.  Jacob is teaching me the program, to which I'm a bit of a newb. You have to understand: My entire life all the working out I did was with purpose... be it sports...martial arts... etc. This is my first time ever working out for no direct purpose other than to look and feel better.  So, naturally, I gravitated towards the person I felt had to know what the hell he was doing, cause it shows (Jacob).
<br><br>
So he ran me through the operations, today was the first day, Chest day, so I did various upper body exercises targeting those muscles. As an added bonus I did some arm work (tris, forearms, curls) and what I discovered is that I still have a lot of the actual "strength" I built up in my younger years, but what wasn't there anymore was the muscle endurance to really back it up. So while I was immediately able to do the same exercies with the same weight the others were, I found myself struggling to finish on my 3rd sets.  Pulled through though, and damn, it felt good.
<br><br>
The funny/interesting part of this story is that towards the end, Brandon and I decided to do some cardio.  The original plan (I think) was to just to snag some of the bikes from the classrom and use those. We instead ended up walking in JUST in time for an Ab/Spinning class that was starting up. After getting convinced to join, I soon found myself lying on the floor mat with a large rubber ball between my legs.  That instructor kicked our asses, it really does focus the working to the abs much more than machines because since it's a ball, your body has to flex many more muscle groups in various ways to maintain balance. 
<br><br>
Immediately after that 15 min workout, we were told to grab a bike for the Spin class. The 45 minute Spin class that was NOT for beginners.  She was nice enough to give us tips and let us know that on the more difficult parts we could slack a bit if we got tired.  The funny thing is, it wasn't my legs that this bothered, it was the arms that were now spent that didn't particularly enjoy being asked to support my entire upper body weight while I rode a bike and pedaled while standing up to exaggerate parts of the workout.  My arms were giving out, so I spent much of class riding "no handlebars" syle.  I'll tell you what though, that class kicked my ass and now I'm feeling it, which is a good thing :)
<br><br>
After that it was a somewhat basic night, we went out to shoot (free) pool at Rack Daddys.  One of the kinder waitresseseseeses was nice enough to keep bringing me water to help me out (needed hydration bad).  All in all a good afternoon with the boys, I'll definately report progress and pictures as the program continues. I'm highly motivated ;)<br />

      Curious George Visits Jamaica
<br><br>
A couple days ago Erik came to me with the proposition to head out to Jamaica for a 4 day vacation. He's been before, and had a good experience with a particular agency (www.worryfreevacations.com) who occasionally ran specails. The special? $99 round trip for 4 nights in a place where the American dollar is worth nearly twice its weight.  You stay in lodging on the beach that, while not your average Mariott, runs @ just $22 a day.  A stone's throw from your sleeping quarters you have a club/bar, the ocean with clear water, and a strip of beach connecting several other hotels in the area.
<br><br>
I'd been toying with the idea, making all sorts of excuses for myself about not going, and it wasn't until today that I realized that (other than money) all the excuses I was making weren't really valid, and beneath it all, I was really just afraid of a "last minute" trip outside of the country (having never been).  Another friend of mine (Wyatt) signed up for the same trip, so today they pushed hard to refute all of my excuses and convince me into signing up. Wyatt even offered to buy my ticket.  I finally crumbled under the rationalities being presented, and decided to go in on the deal.
<br><br>
From what I understand it's actually a very americanized place. I don't even need a passport to go, a birth certificate is good enough coupled with my drivers liscence.  No vaccinations are necessary, and many of the spots there accept american currency.  It's..probably the most extreme spurr-of-the moment thing I've ever done but... you only live once and I've never been on a vacation that wasn't under the umbrella of parents or family, so I'm pretty excited to go through with it :)<br />

      Where will you be...the day after tomorrow?
<br><br>
Not back at the movie theatre watching this movie again, that's for damn sure.  Last night the crew (minus Jacob) and I went out for a night on the town that started at the Alamo watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/" target=_new>The Day After Tomorrow</a>.  The best part of the movie where the two pitchers of beer we drank at our seats.  I guess I'm bitter, or perhaps the L2 in me just over-analyzes everything when I watch a movie, but I am thoroughly convinced Hollywood needs to hire me as a Continuity/Believabily Coordinator before they dump hundreds of thousands of dollars into bad movie decisions.  If you have not seen the movie yet and hate spoilers, stop reading now or revisit my comments later; you have been warned.
<br><br>
The movie premise is basic enough... sudden climate shifts due to mankind ruining the ocean currents and ozone layer threaten to spin the world into another ice age.  But (of course) this is not something that will happen over dacades, but days as everyone scrambles from the sudden disasters that befall them. But that's only a backdrop to the movie, as 3 other local sub-plots vie for camera time.  The protagonist is your basic "kooky but right" scientist played by Harrison Ford...er... I mean.. Dennis Quaid, who has a hard time maintaining a work/life balance very reminicant of Goldblum in Jurassic Park II: Lost World, his astranged son, played by Tobey Maguire...er... I mean...Jake Gyllenhaal is a teenage prodigy, no thanks to his dad who spends all of his time in other countries doing research.  At work (of course) his research is unappreciated by those in power who view his predictions and warnings as outlandish, but (of course) his outlandish predictions come true.
<br><br>
Yadda yadda, he tries to warn everyone about global warming, gets shot down, and then Nature takes a sudden leap to that grim future and forces even the President himself to take heed, but only after the storm has claimed millions of lives (at least it wipes out Canada, that'll learn'em)
<br><br>
Sub-plot to the father/son relationship we have a son/girl from school relationship... where the kid really really likes a girl but (of course) doesn't have the courage to do anything about it.. at least not until there's a wall of water charging through the city to give him the courage.  He eventually comes out of taking the back seat and becomes a dominant, saving voice for his girl, their friends, and the few people who weren't dumb enough to try and head south through the blizzard.
<br><br>
And finally, we have "the struggle of mankind" which (of course) has to show that while a lot of stupid people do a lot of stupid things (news reporters covering the story standing between 3 tornados) we always have the ability to adapt and overcome.  I mean shit, we nuked incoming comets and sent an Alien nation home with their tenticles between their legs on multiple occasions. 
<br><br>
This message was, admittedly, the best part of the movie, particularly pointed out at the very end when the southern states are evacuated to Mexico. There is a very subtle news report going on in the background about America clearing all latin-american debt in exchange for the assistance.  It was honestly a good message to say that mankind should stop working against each other, and begin working together as one nation of people.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this gem only comes at the end of the movie, and the other devices used to convey this message were somewhat unoriginal.  You have your obligatory "leave no one behind" scenes, your "take one for the team" moments (when Frank cuts himself free to avoid pulling the other two down with him), all the way on down to the random acts of un-necessary valor (his father and 2 men make the long walk to the library where his son is at, brining no extra food, clothing, or fuel sources to help).
<br><br>
And finally we have our... "attention getter" blockbuster scenes which need not follow any sort of sensibility or logic.  For instance...they're heading to New York by way of Philly...right? And the GPS system they have is going to give them the shortest distance between two points, right? So uh...how did they end up on the bay-side of Liberty Island walking inland to New York?  Exactly :)
<br><br>
I guess I'm a snob when it comes to movies.. I suppose I feel that in this day and age the average movie goer has pretty much "seen it all" and, coupled with the age of e-knowledge that we live in, your average movie goer is much more in tune with topics like science, technology, etc...putting the pressure on the directors to deliver believability.  But enough ranting :) I really don't mean to sound judgemental. In the end I took the movie as cool special effects (they really were breathtaking) with a good message to mankind at the end.
<br><br>
After the movie we rolled downtown and tried out a new spot called the Sky Lounge. It gets an A for cool layout, they have two bars, a dance floor, mood lighting that changes, and all sorts of nooks and crannys with couches and seating areas that are partially covered with beads or woodwork to give a hint of privacy.  We met a few of the bartenders and waitressessessses there, all good people. The only downside is it's not quite located "on" 6th street, so even after midnight it wasn't exactly packed with people.  We decided it would at least be a cool place to bring everyone we know to hang out and have some drinks.
<br><br>
The rest of the night was somewhat of a blur, we all got pretty trashed (except the driver) and ended up at an after-hours house party with some of the waitresseseeses from the pool hall we frequent.  Had some more drinks, had some good conversations, and capped off the night at like... 5am?  It's been ages since I've partied like that, I think I'm getting too old for it, but it was somewhat nice to get out and have some fun :)<br />

      <p>A good friend of mine named Erik threw a party this Saturday as a half-house warming half-labor day shindig. He invited a few people from work to make the trekk out to his new place in Leander (quite the drive!).  Mark and Darren cooked up a storm on the BBQ as we indulged in carnivorous activities mixed with a bit of beer and PS2.</p>

<p>The area where he lives is absolutely beautiful hill country, I couldn't help but take a calander shot of my ride parked out front.  Erik shares the pad with his critters Sassy (bird) and Kenobi (dog).  Towards the end of the evening I shared a good conversation with Erik and his brother who are both extremely knowledgable in the realm of martial arts... I believe I'm going to search for a good <a href=http://www.wingchun.com/history.html target=_new>Wing Chun</a> school here in Austin if possible :)</p>

      Hooray for Nerd Jokes!
<br><br>
A man is flying in a hot air balloon, when all of a sudden he notices he is lost. He maneuvers, descends and slowly comes to a street and sees someone:
<br><br>
"Excuse me! Could you help me? I had an appointment with a friend at 2p.m. , I'm 30 minutes late and I don't know where I am."
<br>“Sure! He answered. You are in a hot air balloon floating at about 30 meters from the ground, between 40 and 43 degrees latitude north and 58 and 60 degrees longitude west." 
<br>"You're an L2 aren't you?" Asked the man in the balloon.
<br>"Yes sir, I am, how did you guess?" 
<br>"It's simple; everything you've said is technically correct, but practically useless. I'm still lost and I'm late for my appointment because I don't know what do with your information."
<br>"And you're a manager?” Asked the man on the ground.
<br>“Yes, how did you know?" 
<br>"Well you see it's very simple. You don't know where you're standing or where you're going, you've made a promise you can't keep and you expect someone else to solve your problem.
