Deep in the heart of Neriak the wizard guild master Gath N'Mare was performing an intense ritual around The Eternal Flame of Magic. As sweat glistened from his brow he muttered to himself, "This will be the greatest wizard of all!"  With a wave of his hands a ball of crimson fire illuminated the room.  The ball rose from his fingertips to the ceiling of the underground chamber.  It pulsated as if alive glowing bright, then fading dark, and bright again.  The ball floated towards the center of room and into the heart of The Eternal Flame of Magic.  A sudden flash filled the room, and Gath N'Mare stood blinded momentarily.  After his eyes adjusted and he could again see, there stood a magnificent Tier'dal wizard amidst the magic flame.  He stepped forward and down from the flames alter to stand in front of the elder Wizard.  A look of intense thought came over Gath's face as he peered into the young wizard's eyes.  "Yes, yes I have succeeded," he said.  "From this day forward you will be known as CEREBOS!!"<br>
<br>
From that day forward the young wizard grew to learn to wield his potent magic.  His skill in evocation seemed to excel at every kill, at every victim who fell burning to the hard ground of Norrath.  Nektulos forest soon became his playground as even the mighty skeletons were no longer a match for his skill.  In fact he found no other to match his skill until the day he ventured into the East Commons. <br>
<br>
Upon entering this vast landscape he saw a shadow of a figure flash behind a tree.  He stood silent and still, awaiting further movement.  When there was none, the young wizard decided to investigate.  As he approached the tree he heard a faint clattering noise from behind it.  "What could this be?" he thought to himself.  His curiosity got the best of him and when he explored the other side of the tree there stood before him a fierce skeleton like none other he had ever seen.  It had glowering eyes of green and a menacing grin.  Startled the wizard took a step backwards and slipping upon the moist ground he fell to his back.  As the wizard lay there he heard the most beautiful laughter he had ever heard.  He sat up and saw a Dark Elf face even more beautiful than he had imagined.  "Did my pet startle you?" she said as she helped him off the ground.  "My name is Vilae, I'm a Necromancer."<br>
<br>
Cerebos and Vilae ventured together from that day forward putting their lives on the line for each other.  Their great friendship soon blossomed into love.  The wizard and his necromancer companion met many friends upon their adventures from Jochim the mighty Necromacer, to Calidore the brave Shadow Knight,  from Sinlain the arch wizard to the master of all enchanters, Lasombra.  In Lasombra, Cerebos found a friend of like spirit and like mind and knew that he had a lot to learn from him.  And so, the paths of Cerebos and Vilae merged with that of their friends in the union of the Illumin Cathari. <br><br>	
Cerebos lived a happy life with his beautiful bride and generous friends until one dark and dreary night.  A storm arose on the horizon and a cloud of greed covered the land of Norrath.  With the greed came a darker force... one even more powerful than the wizard himself.  As he lay in his bed the cold fingers of death arose from the ground and stole the wizard's life force from him.  Powerless to death's touch the wizard perished.  Upon awaking from her slumber, Vilae found her husband dead at her side.  A great sadness bellowed from her as she did not understand why his life was ended so short.  She grasped her husband's lifeless frame in her arms and held him to her chest.  "Noooooooo..." she moaned as she looked up to the heavens.  "Why Lord Innoruuk?  Whhyyy?"
<br><br>
The Necromancer grew powerful rather quickly now and focused her attention on her mastery of the ways with the dead.  Deep down she knew that only she had the power to free her husband from his slumber of darkness.  As the days passed, Vilae grew stronger and stronger until her skill rivaled that of the true god Innoruuk.  Vilae looked to the sky and yelled at the top of her lungs, "You will not keep him for LONG!!!"<br><br>

<br><br>
The scorned Necromancer awaited nightfall and performed the ceremony to raise the dead.  Very similar to the conjurations of her pet, she proceeded to try to conjure up her long lost husband.  As she chanted and waved her hands through the air the dark forest of Nektulos grew light, and flashed to black.  A fog rolled in around the chanting necromancer and amongst the thick clouds of fog arose the spirit of her husband.  With great concentration she kept the spirit from returning to the land of the dead with her left hand and with her right hand she conjured up a pet.  Cerebos' spirit drew slowly towards the skeleton and fused with the pets bones.  Flesh sprouted upon the bones and before the fog could roll out her husband stood before her in flesh and blood... born once more!  Cerebos fell towards Vilae and grasped her within his arms.  "Not even death can part us my love!" he managed to sputter out in a faint voice.  "Come my dear, let's tend to your wounds," she said and led him off to Neriak to recover and begin their adventures once more.
