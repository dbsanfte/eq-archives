      You.. try to take the best of me..go away!
<br><br>
Damn. Talk about cool. Tonight Kel and I went to the Linkin Park concert in San Antonio. Touring with them were Hoobastank, P.O.D. and some other band we missed completely.  Missed why? Get there too late? Nah, we actually got there hella early (5:30ish) to stand out in the freezing frickin wind for hours.  We missed the first act (and most of Hoobastank) because we both were (luckily) selected to attend the Meet & Greet, an event where a handfull of <a href="http://www.lpunderground.com/">Linkin Park Underground</a> fans are selected to go backstage and meet the band.
<br><br>
First off this entire week in TX it's been cold. Damn cold.  And let me qualify that. I'm originally from Colorado, I know what cold air feels like, and this was pretty damn cold. We arrive at the venue an hour or so earlier than the meet & greet, and hit the box office for our M&G passes and for the "secret info" on where to gather. Ya know how the print out says "Box office will have meeting location and details" ? Myyeah. They didn't. They were completely clueless and surprised that they were supposed to know where to go. 
<br><br>
Welcome to M&G "Fight Club"... the first rule of LPU Meet & Greet is that we do not talk about the LPU Meet & Greet.
<br><br>
So we stood in the general admission line, in the buttass cold, for an hour or so until they opened the doors to start letting people in. Got my cool little mini-multi-tool keychain deal confiscated cause they thought it was a weapon of mass destruction. Finally made my way in, asked a director-looking guy with a walkie talkie. He tells me "Oh yeah, they're meeting in the lobby here until 6:45". Cool! So we stand in the main entry lobby, stand in line to get our floor area wrist bands, and hang out on the wall.
<br><br>
Security guard walks up "Sir, are you here for the wristbands?"
"Nah we already got ours, we're waiting for the meet and greet".
"Sir I'm going to have to ask you to move into the main facility if you're not in line for the wristbands"
"Uh... ok...?"
<br><br>
So I find yet another important looking fellow and ask him where the M&G people are supposed to be gathering. He tells me they're all meeting in section 126 (off to the side near the stage). So we trod off towards section 126 and... of course... get sent right back by a section usher who had absolutely no idea what we were talking about but assured me that there were no plans on her security briefing about a gathering of any people.
<br><br>
Super! Now mind you... there were other people wearing LPU shirts, with their patches, and none of them had any clue where to go either. We seemed to be one step ahead of the crowd simply for having the nerve to ask questions.
<br><br>
So we make our way back to the lobby, and I encounter personel dude #1 I talked to earlier and ask him what's up with the wild goose chase. He laughs, apologizes and tells me they just broadcast that they were meeting OUTside.. BACK at the box office where we got our passes cause they didn't have anywhere else to stick us. So then, of course, when we walk back through the lobby, we encounter the other person who gave us mis-information, who proceeded to prod me about why I wanted to go back outside after having been let in. I explained, they let us roll out.
<br><br>
Back out in the freezing wind. But damnit, we will discover the secrets of LPU Fight Club and we will prevail. So we make our way back out to the box office (about 100 yards from the venue entrance) and encounter 2 other people who have gone on their personal quest for the info and ended up there. Hey, now we're getting somewhere.
<br><br>
So we sat, in the cold. We sat, and we sat, and we sat some more. We oogled at the monstrous line that was still formed outside, and slowly but surely, hesitant M&G people walked up and figured out that this would be the place to meet.
<br><br>
Bout 6:45 a security guy comes runnin up, confirms we are in fact in the right place, but tells us that they're having to operate on "Rock-n-Roll Time" which means the 7:00 schedule was out the window. So we stood there, excited, freeziing and die-hard until about 7:30 when they finally ran us around the back alleys of the colloseum. We were, litterally, running, and it felt like I was a LP video with this mass of fans all running past trucks and warehouses and shit, that was pretty cool. They finally brought us into the colloseum where we stood penned off from the "normal fans" for about 10 min. I felt special! Like ed...
<br><br>
Then there was some more commotion between the organizers and security, and then weee we're all hauled back OUTside and around a corner to the entrance of what appeared to be a club/restaraunt thing that was built into a...well.. big tin warehouse. And there we stood, and stood some more, die-hard and cold. Then it happened, the warehouse garage door deal pulled up and open, and we made our way in through another door where, just like in all the pictures you see here on the site.. there they say, plain as day, surreal as ever.
<br><br>
It may sound like I was ranting, and I severely doubt the venue meant for all the shuffling and mis-information to take place, but to me it was almost cool to really feel like this was so underground not even the people that ran the show knew what was up. Definately a cool twist, and hell, if I were LP I'd work shit like that into the M&G on a regular basis. Let the hard-core fans figure out where to go, give em a sense of adventure, and let rest of the non-die-hard fans stand in the basic line oblivious and confused ;)
<br><br>
Meeting them was cool. They seemed rested, yet tired. Not bored tired, mind you, but like... you can tell they put so much of their own real energy into each and every show that outside of that it's taxing (understandably) and they through being exhausted I noted that they still made it a point to make eye contact with every single person who went through that line, ask them how they were doing, etc. As a funny side note, my girl's actually very pretty (imho) and she was ahead of me in the signing line, I kinda chuckled a few times as a few (I won't name names!) would kinda look up, then doubletake back up like "How YOU doin" hehe. Good stuff. I chose to have the black and white photo that went out with the LPU underground packet signed, and my girl had the jacket insert of the Live in Texas DVD signed.
<br><br>
After that, it was back to the floor, where we got right down in it, catching the last portion of Hoobastank, then on into POD, and finally LP for yet another great show. Had a decent mosh pit going during LP's stage time too.. decent enough to where even when people WEREN'T moshing, the space was left emptied out in respect lol
<br><br>
The show was, again, amazing, and just as much fun as the Sanitarium performance. Everyone in the crowd was hyped, participating, etc. One of the most shocking points hit when Mike called out to the crowed for anyone who thought they could play the lead in "Faint", and one lucky contestant, "Allejandro", actually got to come on stage, take the guitar, and give it a go in front of the full audience. 
<br><br>
Now you gotta figure, some shmoe from the crowd... comedy gold about to happen, right? Wrong. This kid surprised the entire venue and tore it up, almost perfectly in sync, and the crowed jammed and moshed to Linkin Park Featuing: Allejandro(sp). It was truly magical, cause now you're talkin about improv playing with a guitarist you don't know from Adam, and the song sounded just fine throughout. Mad props to Alle and mad mad props to LP for taking a chance on a crowd member. It goes back to what I said earlier about a band that really knows what it's like to be a fan, and to have something special like that thrown your way, a chance to chill with your idols.
<br><br>
Amazing, amazing stuff. I know I'm speakin for Kel too when I say that I'll attend any LP show anywhere in TX and hell, even in CO, good excuse to visit my family back home : )

      Body tells you, 'WTF are you doing?'
<br><br>
Over last week and into this weekend I got psyched up to hit the Atkins diet with full force. Went to the store and dropped 120 bones on relatively yummy stuff: steaks, tuna, shrimp, string cheese, etc.  So last night we finished up the last of the pasta, today marks day 1 of no carbs, no caffine, etc.
<br><br>
Myeah.
<br><br>
Fell asleep like twice durring work already, brain is seriously jonsing for a Dew. For lunch our team ordered Chinese, I ordered beef w/broccoli, ate just the beef, and the egg-drop soup (no corn bits!). No egg roll, no rice, washed it down with some nice cool drinking fountain water.  Ain't no way I'm gonna live like this forever.  So my grand plan is to use the induction phase to drop about 20-30lbs and get back down to a non-fat mass, then slowly reintroduce the rest of the normal foods in moderation back into my life, hell mebbie even do some exercise :P
<br><br>
I accept the fact that no extreme diet is the solution, and of course today everyone pitched in their 2 cents about how atkins peeps are heart disease timebombs and have failing kidneys, etc.  But then I figure... ya know.. somehow man was able to survive "back in the day" eating primarily meats and leaves and shit.. back before they had rice... potatoes... pasta... sugar..  so for me to live a little like they did probably couldn't hurt me. 
<br><br>
But damn if they don't say pops are addictive.. the food part of the diet is a hundred times easier than trying to kick Mt. Dew... not being hungry is easy. Not being tired and trying to syphon energy from tap water is a bitch.<br />

Just had to post this for prosperity... when I get a cell phone I absolutely have to get the ring tone at the begining of this song.  Friend of mine at work has this "call" he does when I'm walking up where he goes "Gangsta...gangsta.." and I bust out with the tone heheh good stuff, nothing much else to post for the day, I won some other award at work so now my badge has two nifty little stars. I guess it's supposed to be impressive since people have worked here for 5+ years and not gotten a single one and I've gotten two within the same year... I hope it helps me come review time!!<br />

      Mystic Fortune Cookie... of Death!
<br><br>
I have this strange superstition that when you get a fortune cookie at a restaurant, in order to "bind" the fortune to you, the cookie must be eaten before reading it. If you don't intend to take the fortune seriously, then you read the fortune as soon as you crack it open and either eat the cookie afterwards (or not at all).
<br><br>
Well, last week I was out with the work gang at the buffet place we go to every now and again, and I decided to take the fortune cookie challenge and see how my luck was doing.  The fortune read <strong>Something strange will happen to you at work next week</strong>. An odd fortune by any standard.
<br><br>
Fast forward to yesterday, Wednesday, the middle of said week in fortune. Nothing strange had happened all week and I wasn't going to let the fortune gods get away with an easy event like... getting an award or getting a bunch of emails randomly... that bad boy said Strange and I was going to hold it accountable as something that would not normally happen to a person at work by any stretch of the imagination.
<br><br>
It has been raining heavily this week, day in day out causing a lot of excess water to be moving through the city. I was sitting at my desk, broke as a joke, and thinking about drinking some nice, healthy water instead of scrounging change together to get a Mountain Dew like I normally do.  So I decided to change my habits, and proceeded to get a Dixie cup, head to the break room, snag some ice out of the ice machine, and fill it to the brim from the drinking fountain. Came back to my desk, sucked down the water, and started in on crunching the leftover ice.
<br><br>
And then it happened.
<br><br>
Our buildings are rigged with a universal com system so that, in case of emergency, a broadcast could be put out to instruct the 2000+ employees on where to go and what to do. Suddenly, out of no where, a sobering buzz is emitted by the com system, and a voice booms over the small, drive-thru-like box: Attention employees, the city of Round Rock has just issued a Boil Water Notice. Please <strong>do not drink the water from the fountains, bathrooms or kitchens. An email will go out shortly with details on this. I repeat...</strong>
<br><br>
My first thought: <em>Lovely! That's what I get for not drinking Mt. Dew.</em>
My second thought: <em>That dude on Survivor is like 77 years old and he drank water with dead people in it in Nam, you'll be fine.</em>
<br><br>
And email went out shortly thereafter noting that there was a Water main break in the area so the threat of contamination was there. This morning they put out an email that the lab tests came back negative, so all is well.  It wasn't until just before I decided to write this that I realized...wow... something strange really did happen to me here at work.  The "at work" specification is also valid because I live about 30 min away in a different city that was NOT affected by the break... so likewise had I been at home at the time, nothing would have come of it.
<br><br>
Trippy stuff!<br />

Which I guess means I'm a hard to follow, self centered, obsessive paranoid person. Aren't we all? :)  Been playing through StarWars: Jedi Academy as of late with Kelly.. she's taking the path of the light side, I'm taking the path of the darkside.  I think I would rank myself as "Lawful Evil" in D&D ranking... I generally understand the difference between right and wrong and work towards overall good, but sadly I believe in having fun and being a bit mischievous on the way.  So through Jedi games like this I spend most of the time trucking through, pushing Storm Troopers off cliffs and force choking the especially bad guys.  <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/lhep.jpg" target=_new>This unfortunate fool</a> didn't quite fall over the edge when I pushed him... think I helped him up?  Nahh... cloning is bad!

      FPS, the future of Special Ops Training?
<br><br>
A long while ago when people first started hosting full blown Quake II tournaments, I was thinking about just how precise and hard core people could be in first person shooter (FPS) games.  Some time later they started releasing more "realistic" combat games, particularly the Tom Clancy-sanctioned ones that started teaching military tactics, survivability, and war techniques.
<br><br>
I then realized just how important something like this could become... All the people who play these games and constantly refine their skills to become "the best" at PvP (Player vs. Player)... are we in effect training our own minds with combat knowledge?  Having 0 combat training other than martial arts and paint ball games, I can at least say it's true for me.  If I found myself in a situation where I needed to check a hall out, or slowly creep and check a room, I'm fairly certain that I could effectively "creep" to cover the area maintaining minimal visibility, slicing the pie around corners at a low angle (most people aim for the upper torso).  Where'd I learn it all? Gaming of all places...
<br><br>
There is an obvious flipside to the coin. Playing games teaches you nothing of *actual* weapons handling, including kickback, reloading, etc which affects time and accuracy.  You also have little fatigue constrictions... holding a rifle up in an aiming posture tends to wear you down after a while.   There is a whole physical level to war and combat that can seriously affect the implementation of strategies and theoretic war tactics... however.. as many experts say.. the physical portion of it all is relatively easy to overcome through training... the hard part is maintaining your head, focus, and strategy while you're out there. 
<br><br>
So my thought is.. if you start off with a bunch of green individuals that have seen no war time but have the mental strategies of Sun Tzu, could the potentially turn out to be more potent than those who start out simply in good physical condition but little knowledge on how to apply their strengths?  What's more... with the modern advent of remote-control technologies... machines and tactics developed to limit the need for actual human footsoldiers... could these FPS champs simply be sitting in a room somewhere, guiding missiles and operating targeting systems on ships and helicopters?
<br><br>
One recent "game" into the mix that has me wondering if they're on the same wavelength is <a href="http://www.americasarmy.com/" target=_new>America's Army</a>.  This is the first officially sanctioned "game" put out by the US Army, and contains a lot of detail and realistic situations.  They've even implemented things like breathing and recoil, and the online site holds statistics of teams and individuals.  Nifty eh? Imagine ranking in the top 1% of all people who play in, say, marksman accuracy, and getting a knock on your door from Uncle Sam who's very interested in putting your skills to good use for the U. S. of A.

definitely an interesting thing to think about... the days when computer nerds and gamers become wartime heroes.  I personally wouldn't mind seeing, somewhere in the far off future, an "official" war system... developed independently, and cooperatively by all countries, as a way to duke things out without the cost of lives, land, or resources.  It wouldn't be all *that* hard to implement and regulate...
<br><br>
<li>Make the game run on a proprietary, hardwired consoles, to help prevent "hacked" systems or rogue systems entering the mix. 
<li>Make each person hardwired based on their consoles' MAC address (or whatever hardware-level uniqueness they decide to use). If that person "dies", their console is effectively blocked from interacting for the duration of the war.
<li>Have one single multi-national "army" of real individuals to enforce the virtual war outcome, so losers can't simply say "piss off" if they lose. 
<li>All wartime data would be recorded, down to every last bullet trajectory.  This way, in the event of a "hack" or cheat, all of the game data and physics could be reviewed and isolated to prove or disprove the accusation.  Fabricating such comprehensive data would be nearly impossible to pre-create given so much data, limiting the fear for conspiracy.
<br><br>
The only flaw I personally see with the whole idea is connectivity. Ensuring all people participating are able to initiate commands.  Denial of service tactics like ping floods could be abuses as a way to "lag" combatants out, making them easier targets.  Perhaps upon death individual recordings and logs could be uploaded to the server, where each client application constantly records ping times or something, which can again be reviewed for foul play.

Would definately be a cool project to work on.. definately a Nobel at the very least :)<br />

      Busy Weekend
<br><br>
Been slackin on the posts since last week. Last Thursday was the pre-registration for <a href="http://www.ushicon.com/" target=_new>Ushicon</a>, Friday night after work I was at the <a href="http://www.avexnet.or.jp/koda/" target=_new>Koda Kumi</a> concert at the convention; that was pretty cool. It was poorly planned though.. not only did they have a hard time moving people in and out of the ballroom, earlier in the day when they were handing out the numbered tickets.. they started at #500 and were handing them out backwards, realized what they were doing, and started handing them out from #1 up. So at the show when they called for people with tickets 1-50 for seating first... yeah...
<br><br>
A lot of excelent costumes, Kel dressed up in her A.D. outfit, was really cute and unique, the most people had were Daddy hats but no full blown outfits.  There was an excellent <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/ushicon/cloudvincent.jpg" target=_new>Cloud</a> (from Kingdom Hearts), <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/ushicon/rikkulenne.jpg" target=_new>Yuna,  Rikku</a>, <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/ushicon/chobits.jpg" target=_new>Chobits</a>, <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/ushicon/sanoske.jpg" target=_new>Sanoske</a>, <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/ushicon/battleroyale.jpg" target=_new>Battle Royale</a>, etc.  All in all a fun weekend, bought a wooden Tanto, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest_(Manga)" target=_new>Priest</a> #1.<br />
