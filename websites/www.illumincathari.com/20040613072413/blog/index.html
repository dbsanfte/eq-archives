      Curious George Visits Jamaica
<br><br>
A couple days ago Erik came to me with the proposition to head out to Jamaica for a 4 day vacation. He's been before, and had a good experience with a particular agency (www.worryfreevacations.com) who occasionally ran specails. The special? $99 round trip for 4 nights in a place where the American dollar is worth nearly twice its weight.  You stay in lodging on the beach that, while not your average Mariott, runs @ just $22 a day.  A stone's throw from your sleeping quarters you have a club/bar, the ocean with clear water, and a strip of beach connecting several other hotels in the area.
<br><br>
I'd been toying with the idea, making all sorts of excuses for myself about not going, and it wasn't until today that I realized that (other than money) all the excuses I was making weren't really valid, and beneath it all, I was really just afraid of a "last minute" trip outside of the country (having never been).  Another friend of mine (Wyatt) signed up for the same trip, so today they pushed hard to refute all of my excuses and convince me into signing up. Wyatt even offered to buy my ticket.  I finally crumbled under the rationalities being presented, and decided to go in on the deal.
<br><br>
From what I understand it's actually a very americanized place. I don't even need a passport to go, a birth certificate is good enough coupled with my drivers liscence.  No vaccinations are necessary, and many of the spots there accept american currency.  It's..probably the most extreme spurr-of-the moment thing I've ever done but... you only live once and I've never been on a vacation that wasn't under the umbrella of parents or family, so I'm pretty excited to go through with it :)<br />

      Where will you be...the day after tomorrow?
<br><br>
Not back at the movie theatre watching this movie again, that's for damn sure.  Last night the crew (minus Jacob) and I went out for a night on the town that started at the Alamo watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/" target=_new>The Day After Tomorrow</a>.  The best part of the movie where the two pitchers of beer we drank at our seats.  I guess I'm bitter, or perhaps the L2 in me just over-analyzes everything when I watch a movie, but I am thoroughly convinced Hollywood needs to hire me as a Continuity/Believabily Coordinator before they dump hundreds of thousands of dollars into bad movie decisions.  If you have not seen the movie yet and hate spoilers, stop reading now or revisit my comments later; you have been warned.
<br><br>
The movie premise is basic enough... sudden climate shifts due to mankind ruining the ocean currents and ozone layer threaten to spin the world into another ice age.  But (of course) this is not something that will happen over dacades, but days as everyone scrambles from the sudden disasters that befall them. But that's only a backdrop to the movie, as 3 other local sub-plots vie for camera time.  The protagonist is your basic "kooky but right" scientist played by Harrison Ford...er... I mean.. Dennis Quaid, who has a hard time maintaining a work/life balance very reminicant of Goldblum in Jurassic Park II: Lost World, his astranged son, played by Tobey Maguire...er... I mean...Jake Gyllenhaal is a teenage prodigy, no thanks to his dad who spends all of his time in other countries doing research.  At work (of course) his research is unappreciated by those in power who view his predictions and warnings as outlandish, but (of course) his outlandish predictions come true.
<br><br>
Yadda yadda, he tries to warn everyone about global warming, gets shot down, and then Nature takes a sudden leap to that grim future and forces even the President himself to take heed, but only after the storm has claimed millions of lives (at least it wipes out Canada, that'll learn'em)
<br><br>
Sub-plot to the father/son relationship we have a son/girl from school relationship... where the kid really really likes a girl but (of course) doesn't have the courage to do anything about it.. at least not until there's a wall of water charging through the city to give him the courage.  He eventually comes out of taking the back seat and becomes a dominant, saving voice for his girl, their friends, and the few people who weren't dumb enough to try and head south through the blizzard.
<br><br>
And finally, we have "the struggle of mankind" which (of course) has to show that while a lot of stupid people do a lot of stupid things (news reporters covering the story standing between 3 tornados) we always have the ability to adapt and overcome.  I mean shit, we nuked incoming comets and sent an Alien nation home with their tenticles between their legs on multiple occasions. 
<br><br>
This message was, admittedly, the best part of the movie, particularly pointed out at the very end when the southern states are evacuated to Mexico. There is a very subtle news report going on in the background about America clearing all latin-american debt in exchange for the assistance.  It was honestly a good message to say that mankind should stop working against each other, and begin working together as one nation of people.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this gem only comes at the end of the movie, and the other devices used to convey this message were somewhat unoriginal.  You have your obligatory "leave no one behind" scenes, your "take one for the team" moments (when Frank cuts himself free to avoid pulling the other two down with him), all the way on down to the random acts of un-necessary valor (his father and 2 men make the long walk to the library where his son is at, brining no extra food, clothing, or fuel sources to help).
<br><br>
And finally we have our... "attention getter" blockbuster scenes which need not follow any sort of sensibility or logic.  For instance...they're heading to New York by way of Philly...right? And the GPS system they have is going to give them the shortest distance between two points, right? So uh...how did they end up on the bay-side of Liberty Island walking inland to New York?  Exactly :)
<br><br>
I guess I'm a snob when it comes to movies.. I suppose I feel that in this day and age the average movie goer has pretty much "seen it all" and, coupled with the age of e-knowledge that we live in, your average movie goer is much more in tune with topics like science, technology, etc...putting the pressure on the directors to deliver believability.  But enough ranting :) I really don't mean to sound judgemental. In the end I took the movie as cool special effects (they really were breathtaking) with a good message to mankind at the end.
<br><br>
After the movie we rolled downtown and tried out a new spot called the Sky Lounge. It gets an A for cool layout, they have two bars, a dance floor, mood lighting that changes, and all sorts of nooks and crannys with couches and seating areas that are partially covered with beads or woodwork to give a hint of privacy.  We met a few of the bartenders and waitressessessses there, all good people. The only downside is it's not quite located "on" 6th street, so even after midnight it wasn't exactly packed with people.  We decided it would at least be a cool place to bring everyone we know to hang out and have some drinks.
<br><br>
The rest of the night was somewhat of a blur, we all got pretty trashed (except the driver) and ended up at an after-hours house party with some of the waitresseseeses from the pool hall we frequent.  Had some more drinks, had some good conversations, and capped off the night at like... 5am?  It's been ages since I've partied like that, I think I'm getting too old for it, but it was somewhat nice to get out and have some fun :)<br />

      <p>A good friend of mine named Erik threw a party this Saturday as a half-house warming half-labor day shindig. He invited a few people from work to make the trekk out to his new place in Leander (quite the drive!).  Mark and Darren cooked up a storm on the BBQ as we indulged in carnivorous activities mixed with a bit of beer and PS2.</p>

<p>The area where he lives is absolutely beautiful hill country, I couldn't help but take a calander shot of my ride parked out front.  Erik shares the pad with his critters Sassy (bird) and Kenobi (dog).  Towards the end of the evening I shared a good conversation with Erik and his brother who are both extremely knowledgable in the realm of martial arts... I believe I'm going to search for a good <a href=http://www.wingchun.com/history.html target=_new>Wing Chun</a> school here in Austin if possible :)</p>

      Hooray for Nerd Jokes!
<br><br>
A man is flying in a hot air balloon, when all of a sudden he notices he is lost. He maneuvers, descends and slowly comes to a street and sees someone:
<br><br>
"Excuse me! Could you help me? I had an appointment with a friend at 2p.m. , I'm 30 minutes late and I don't know where I am."
<br>“Sure! He answered. You are in a hot air balloon floating at about 30 meters from the ground, between 40 and 43 degrees latitude north and 58 and 60 degrees longitude west." 
<br>"You're an L2 aren't you?" Asked the man in the balloon.
<br>"Yes sir, I am, how did you guess?" 
<br>"It's simple; everything you've said is technically correct, but practically useless. I'm still lost and I'm late for my appointment because I don't know what do with your information."
<br>"And you're a manager?” Asked the man on the ground.
<br>“Yes, how did you know?" 
<br>"Well you see it's very simple. You don't know where you're standing or where you're going, you've made a promise you can't keep and you expect someone else to solve your problem. In fact, you're in the exact same situation you were before you found me... now the only difference is that for some reason.. it's now <em>my</em> fault..."<br />
