I am the creature you think you see in the dark of the night.  I am the bane of Firiona Vie. I am Iksar. I am of the Greenmist, descendants of Rile. I am Zulis.<P>

Hatched one of many in my brood I was predestined to be a follower of Greenmist and learn the ways of Rile, the great Shadowknight Emperor. My first years were spent in the shadow of Kurn's, honing my skills and growing stronger.  As I grew I developed my mind as well as my strength. After nine long seasons I was finally able to tap into the power perfected by Sathir, power over the dead. I was also promoted to the rank of Squire and earned my new Khukri.  I soon ventured into the tower where Kurn and Talon eternally rest; there amongst the hordes of undead I perfected my dark skills.  I also began to unravel the mystery of the great Khukri of Rile, Greenmist.  The search for the lost weapon still drives me to this day, and will until I unearth the ancient sword.

Years later...
<P>
I had grown too powerful to continue in the Field and moved on to the Great Lake.  There I encountered many new beasts as well as my first glimpse at the races of the outside world.  Though apprehensive of these new inhabitants of our continent they proved to be a useful ally in dispatching the hideous Sarnak and Goblins that plague the Lake.  Most of the foreigners were quite pleasant but difficult to understand at times, they speak in odd tongues that I have yet to master.  One foreigner in particular caught my attention she was also adept in the use of magic but to a degree that rivals that of our Iksar priests. She had a power to control living beings, plants and animals, and to call upon her god to instantly transport herself and others to far off lands.  Though week in physical strength the power of her mind fascinated me and I wished to learn more. We have been fighting together for many ages now and both of us have increased our skills immeasurably.

Now, we have ventured to a new land, far from the warmth of my home. This land, Velious is the territory of the great dragons, my sworn enemy. The creatures that scorched the great cities of Sebilis and killed so many of my ancestry, they reside here as arrogant as ever. Also residing here are what appears to be descendents of the Combine race, giants that along with the Frogloks mounted a ground attack during the great war with the Ring of Scale. Luckily Deayne and I are not alone in this land, a close knit group of adventurers are with us.  They refer to themselves as the Illumin Cathari, and like myself, prefer to rule in the darkness where we hold a distinct advantage.

I have returned to my homeland often, to train under Xog and protect New Sebilis from any threat that might arise. On each trip I see that our numbers grow and the new Iksar Empire continues to flourish. Unfortunately there are traitors in our midst.  This is nothing new, and like the accursed Dag of the Danak era these traitors will be dealt with.
