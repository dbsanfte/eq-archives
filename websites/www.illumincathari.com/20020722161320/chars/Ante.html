  The morning spring breeze still held the chill of winter as Ante sat high above Faydark in the Kelethin ash woods. She loved the trees. From her perch she watched the wolves dance and listened to the willow wisp songs. She was safe in the trees. Her small and fragile physique was no match for the menacing Orcs who roamed the woods. It was these same Orcs that not two weeks before had slaughtered her uncle’s hunting party killing her father and mother. Alone and afraid she sat, harboring feelings of revenge.  <br>
   <br>
  The news of her parent’s deaths ripped thru her heart. Feeling lost and abandoned,  Ante turned to her Uncle Kithicor for guidance. He took her to Master Trueshot to study to become a ranger. She spent many hours learning the ways of the forest and the delicate balance between her druid and warrior cousins. She was, however, most interested in her bow. She longed to become the finest archer all of Norrath.<br>
<br>
    As time past, Ante became stronger and able to hold her own against the perils of the Orcs. One day sitting on a hill amidst an Orc encampment, she noticed two young rangers struggling to overpower a Centurion. Pulling full on her bowstring the arrow flew true and pierced the Centurions heart. The two young rangers, though bruised and bleeding, turned quickly to see from what bow the arrow flew. Smiling broadly, Ante approached Talianna and Caylena. The three became instant friends and fought side by side for many, many seasons.<br>
                                        <br>
   Ante and Caylena spend most of that summer invading Crushbone castle. They were determined to see the royal court destroyed, but Ambassador Dvinn proved too strong an enemy. It was on one of these evenings, as the fighting raged on, that Ante received word from Talianna. “Come, I have found a land rich of treasure and adventure.”  Ante and Caylena ventured forth into the unknown in search of their friend. <br>
<br>
   With a tattered map the two made their way toward the docks on the far side of the Butcher Block Mountains. The mountains were dangerous. They encountered creatures they had never seen before. It was here that Ante discovered that she had best not disturb the skunks. Battered, and reeking of black and white mountain critters, the two reach the docks. In total awe Ante and Caylena boarded a ship bound for the shores of Antonica.<br>
<br>
   The nighttime rain made it difficult to see the shoreline as the ship neared harbor. Through the fog Ante watched as the shapes took form. Straining to make out the faces of the people waiting on the docks, she saw Talianna. “The docks must be slippery from the rain”, Ante thought, for it seemed Talianna was having a hard time keeping her balance. Apparently Talianna had discovered a new pastime.<br>
<br>
   As the weeks and months past Ante explored the main land. She saw large cities, inhabited with races of all types. All the legends she had heard a child were true.  Ogres and trolls, humans and dwarves, all existed. She also learned that the stories of hatred and cruelty were also true. Too many times she watched friends die. Too many times had she heard the screams of death. Evil became a reality.<br>
<br>
   Ante watched closely as the young dark elf grinned up at her as he knelt to search the pockets of a dead halfling. His eyes told her he didn’t care, but behind his eyes lay a heart heavy with greed and lust. She turned aside to subdue the sudden uneasiness. “Hey, leave my kill alone fool,” hollered the troll warrior as he drew his two hander. “So quickly,” she thought, as the troll froze and in a spray dancing color fell dead. “Fool my ass” is all he said as he laughed and ran out of sight. Yes, evil is a reality.<br>
<br>
   In the months that followed Ante became familiar with most of the known world. She traveled with friends as well as alone. She soon learned, however, that being with friends was much safer and much more fun. Ante’s talents as a ranger grew, as did the relationships with the friends she had made. Long hours with friends had formed strong and trusting bonds. Amidst a world permeated with evil, Ante had found that much good was also in her life.<br>
<br>
    One early evening, while tracking down a reaver in East Karana, Ante received a message from Talianna. “I have joined a guild with friends. Come join us.”  Ante sat on bridge and thought. The idea of being part of a guild held little appeal to her. She liked the way her life was at the time. Word came again; “Calidore and Caylena are also in the guild.” Ante was persuaded by her friends' interest and trusted their judgment. That night Ante sent word back to Talianna. "I will join."<br>
<br>
    The guild life that Ante found waiting for her was beyond her expectations. It was here Ante found a place of satisfaction and happiness. The members of Illumin Cathari soon filled the loneliness in her heart left by her parents’ deaths. The friends she made within the guild gave Ante as sense of purpose and belonging. Ante had found a home.
