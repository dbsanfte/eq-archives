      Bullet Time...IRL
<br><br>
Today's random afternoon thought is- could we as humans achieve the ability to see "faster" (for lack of a better term) to where we could approach that idea of being able to dodge bullets or quickly react like they do in the movies?
<br><br>
Now to qualify what I'm talking about, I don't mean altering the speed of time to where everyone moves slower than you, or you move faster than anyone else.  I'm talking about accelerating visual perception to be able to "process" more movement, and in turn translate that into quicker or more precise reactions.
<br><br>
Think of playing games like 1st person shooters where frame-rates are important.   Trying to shoot a moving target on low frame rates almost always translates to missing... the higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion, the more accurate you are when lining up your shot.  Frame Rates don't really apply to the way our eyes work, but the concept is the same.. if you are missing part of the detail of motion, your mind has to come up with ways to infer the movement (like guessing the relative path of motion, or taking key mental snapshots).
<br><br>
In sports we use some of these tricks to get around our limitations. In baseball, a pitch coming in at 70mph is pretty much a blur to a bystander, but as a player you learn to look for key properties of the motion that help us determine what kind of a pitch it is.  When the pitchers hand is at the apex, just before the ball is released, you learn to take a quick mental snapshot of how they're holding the ball just as they release. From there you can tell if they intend that pitch to be a slider... curve.. knuckleball, etc since those pitches have notable holding configurations.  The batter then understands the general motion / trajectory that the pitch will create, and attempts to swing and intercept that motion with the bat.  But does the batter really "see" all of the individual frames as the ball is coming in? No way.. it's way too fast... you see the overall movement of the ball but not the individual frames of the ball in motion like you would if it were simply rolling across a desk slowly at you.  Same goes for a slow tennis serve vs. the 140mph ones the pros launch.
<br><br>
For the non sports types.. if you hold your hand out in front of you, fingers spread, and slowly move your hand side to side, your vision can pretty easily track well enough reliably reach over and grab a desired finger with your other hand.  But if you move your hand faster, the fingers start to blur together.. and an attempt to grab an individual digit reliably becomes a difficult task because your eyes can't track fast enough to keep up with the motion.
<br><br>
Unfortunately I can only use term "frames" loosely.. it does well to help quantify vision but human eyes don't really work based on refresh rates fps like most shutter / redraw things do. Our eyes work off of stimulation and chemical reactions that then get translated into electrical impulses to the brain for processing.  Seems bleak for my superhuman goals.
<br><br>
So then I started thinking outside of human eye realm. Birds to be exact, birds of prey.  Not only are they themselves moving quickly as the swoop in to snag a field mouse, but that little mouse is also hauling balls and would be difficult to track as a human.  And yet these guys can swoop in, retract their talons, and make any last-second motions necessary to capture the mouse as it frantically tries to dodge and scurry along the ground... and to boot... it's not like the mouse is running in a straight, observable arc or path that can be cheated like in baseball or tennis.  This tells me that it is at least possible at a biological level to see "faster" than what we already can. 
<br><br>
But while possible, how practical would it be to try to transplant or bio-engineer hawk eyes for humans ? Eh.. I think I'd pass.  Given that fundamental possibility though, I then decided to go and edjumacate myself on how the eye works at a more in-depth level to see if there were any room for hope.  Between AskJeeves and HowStuffWorks.com I finally came across <a href="http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm" target=_new>this great write-up</a> that confirmed and clarified a lot of the things I was thinking about.
<br><br>
The quote that gave me hope: "Even though single eye cells (rods and cones) may have their limitations due to their <strong>chemical reaction times </strong>and due to the <strong>distance to the brain</strong>, you cannot be sure how they interact or complement or synchronize. If 1 cell is able to perceive 10fps, 2 cells may be able to perceive 20fps by complementing one another. So don't confuse "The human eye" with "The cell"."
<br><br>
Time and distance... variable? Yes.. realistically adjustable? Who knows. What if we developed some form of conduit that can transmit impulses between two points faster than a natural nerve can?  What if you could stimulate the chemicals in the eye to react quicker than normal?
<br><br>
That then made me think about adrenaline.  How many countless situations or stories have you heard/experienced where in the heat of the moment it was almost as if everything was going in slow motion.  Where in your super-heightened reaction you could recall every little detail, every single frame of motion.  Time didn't slow down just to be dramatic.. you certainly weren't artificially engineered at the time... something internally.. chemically.. must have been tapped to create the behavior.  This tells me that not only is it possible, but it is possible within <em>ourselves</em> to achieve this ability to see faster than we normally can.  The million dollar question, of course, is what mental triggers can we learn to control so we can call Bullet Time on demand..<br />

      Foreword...
<br><br>
I've spent the rest of the day passively thinking about how I want to treat this blog.  Many people use theirs to record events of the day, and while I'm sure I'll do the same on occasion I believe my goal first and foremost will be to preserve thoughts and feelings.   In thinking about the past sometimes it's hard to remember just how you were at the time.. what was going through your head... what kinds of things you imagined at the time.. so  I think it will be personally amusing to read back through these some many years later (god willing) and "compare notes".. as it were.. to how I am at the time.
<br><br>
So with that in mind... I offer you, my general audience (who at any given moment might be.. only me.. or only a few choice people in my "inner circle") the fair warning that the rest of my entries may contain write ups, rants, or simply tangents that may have little to do with the day in question, but merely what I happen to be "noodling about", as <a href="http://www.whatisthematrix.com" target=_new>Wachowski</a> put it :) <br />

      First post..
<br><br>
Have actually wanted to get a blog started up for some...time now.. Mr. Anderson.. but the lazy coder inside me didn't want to write the necessary junk to automatically manage the blog (and I didn't want to deal with saving / uploading a static HTML page every time). 
<br><br>
Good news is I found this blogger deal (link at the bottom) that manages it all for me even though it's hosted off my very own webspace on illumincathari.com.  Cool stuff... now it's feasable for me to be able to log in from anywhere and just fill out a post.  So let the random thoughts begin...<br />
