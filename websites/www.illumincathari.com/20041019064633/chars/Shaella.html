Did he really think I didn't know? That I couldn't see?  Innoruuk had abandoned him, and despite what he thought, I knew.  The task was not so hard; a few coins can buy poison as readily as bread in Neriak, if you know where to look.<br><br>
"Will you show me the forest? Show me where you hunt and patrol for the raiders?"
<br><br>
It was as simple as that. Fool.  The raiders were at the height of a new invasion then, even so, it was a small patrol, he could have easily overpowered them...had Hate been with him.  When the battle was over and the battle rage subsided, he could barely lift his sword.  Perhaps I needn't have spent those few platinum...but he needed to know, to know that I KNEW.  The dagger slid smoothly between his ribs, even as he struggled to wrap a gash in his leg.  I heard the surprised gasp, followed by frothy wet gurgling as blood filled his lungs.  The shock in his eyes faded to grim understanding as he saw my face, felt the poison seizing control, refusing him control of his own body.
<br><br>
"Oh yes father, I know. And so does He."
<br><br>
The poison was fast; he could not open his mouth to scream as the wolves moved in.  I brought four pairs of raider's feet to Ulraz.  On that same day I was inducted into the Lodge.
<br><br>
The streets of Neriak are harsh, but they seem safe compared to the political positioning for power in the houses and especially once you align yourself with a guild.  Had I known that my father's death would serve to make me a pawn, I might have waited...might.  Our house's power as not great, but it does not take much to inspire jealousy in Neriak.  With my father's death, my mother was seen as a prize; a quick marriage could strengthen another, stronger house with her marriage to a lesser son.  Ah, my mother, it took her less than a week to…discourage any further suitors.  Some of the bodies still have not been found.
<br><br>
With my mother unavailable for marriage, and with no other children, that left only me as an access to our house's power.  In other houses my mother might have killed me as well, securing her own power, but we were not so petty, she knew my desires did not lay with gaining our house within the hour.  I was inducted into the Lodge of the Dead.  I had other plans.
<br><br>
Even before my father's most unfortunate death by the vicious beasts of Nektulos, I had resigned myself to doing whatever was necessary to join the Lodge.  So on that first night, when a man came to explain some of the finer points of the Lodge, and wanted more than my attention, I never hesitated… a most clever plot indeed.  A woman with child, especially when that child is the direct heir to a house, cannot train in the Lodge.  I should have been happy about an heir, willing to end my studies and marry quickly now that the house's future was secure.  But 'they' couldn't understand my devotion to something other than Neriak politics.  I discussed the matter with one of the few I could call a friend.  A young Teir'Dal, also newly joined to the Lodge, Mdayinya.  She helped me hide the pregnancy, and on that day, she took the child away.  Of course it was dead, one can't just dispose of a child with lineage.  Those blue eyes stared at me quietly from behind the rag Mdayinya used to quiet it until she took it quickly from the room.  The mysterious man never turned up again, though I heard rumors of spies from the Ebon Hands sneaking through the Lodge.
<br><br>
After completing my training at the Lodge, gaining enough strength to wield the power of Innoruuk, I went into the Nektulos, on patrols to eradicate the halfling vermin from out forest.  On one of these patrols I met a Shadowknight from another guild, and was introduced to a rather mysterious man, Lasombra.  I was invited to join a guild, the Illumin Cathari, with them.  Not a guild like I was used to, but one that did not play on the politics of Neriak.  Others, even those trained in Neriak that knew that teamwork and friendship was necessary for survival outside.  I was intrigued and joined that night.  I was rewarded with a few pieces of armor and a night of drinking in the Blind Fish with Lasombra.  
Through Illumin Cathari I traveled away from Neriak and explored Norrath.  I left the politics of Neriak and the recent incidents behind.  Slowly I became strong in the dark one's power, returning home once a year to assure my mother I was alive, the house was secure, and to help to crush the Leatherfoot raids.  Eventually however, I was forced to return to the politics of my home.  With the appearance of a certain child, Mdayinya fled the prying eyes of Neriak.  To keep suspicions down, I married her fiancé, a necromancer, and only heir of house Khal'Sarkazian.  His sudden disappearance several months later strengthened my house's power by absorbing his.  A most convenient occurrence.
<br><br>Once again I left Neriak, and traveled about Norrath with my 
family, the Illumin Cathari. Together we explored lands, defeated many vicious 
creatures, and became a family. Perhaps one day I will return to Neriak for good 
to make my claim on the house, but until then I shall remain with Illumin 
Cathari, exploring the land and spreading the hate of the Father throughout it.
