  Once upon a time, a Dark Elf Shadowknight emerged to Neriak to discover how to survive and to practice his swordsmanship.  His name, was Pestelence.  He was accompanied by a higher level Dark Elf enchanter named Lasombra, who invited me with all the other people into the shadow of light, The Illumin Cathari.  Lasombra helped Pestelence to fight the many enemies that lurked in Neriak. 
<br><br>
By the time Pestelence was able to journey beyond Nektulos, he found many new ideas along the way.  He found out that he was an evil to the human race when he entered the East Commonlands.  He was to be very careful when he finds a human along a distance, for he will be killed in sight.  
<br><br>
Then, Pestelence journeyed to the deserts of Ro, where he found even more of his allies, which was Lasombra's wife, Mistryl, a woofelf named Talianna, and the friend of Lasombra, Cerebros.  He found, also, his enemies, which where the nomad gypsies, the very different Dervish Cutthroats, and the Desert Orcs.  Pestelence then became confident about Norrath's goods and evils, and went to Kunark to discover that it was a very challenging area.  
<br><br>
When he became even more confident, he journeyed to Velious when a pirate discovered the land.  He found out it was a snowy land, and a very vast place to be in.  There, he found a formidable guild mate, named Rydun.  
<br><br>
To this point, Pestelence Corazon remains unknown to this day.  Very few people besides the Illumin know Pestelence, some say he was, due to his full name, the Heart of Pestilence.  Some say he was one of the 3 evil gods, with the 2 others War and Famine.  But then, Pestelence is a very silent Tier'Dal, and his future remains to be undiscovered for eternity.
