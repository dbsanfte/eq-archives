The image pretty much sums up one of the few, but longest held dreams I've had since I was a kid.  In 1992, barely 15 years of age, I watched a commercial on TV that would stick with me forever. The image of a car, far off in the distance on a salt flat, travelling at a high rate of speed, kicking up powdery white dust in its wake.  Scene changes to a super close-up of a clean, blank sheet of typewriter paper.  Back to the car, far off in the distance, the low rumble of the blurring speed it's traveling at.  Back to the paper.  Back to the car.  Back to the paper.  And then, boom, the deafening sound of the typewriter as it makes a single, solid, deliberate stroke on the paper:
<center><img src=http://www.illumincathari.com/images/350/zad.jpg></center>
<br><br>
That was all it took. 
<br><br>
Call it marketing genius, call it love at first site, call it fate, but in that moment I had the overwhelming urge to understand and ask what the car was all about. The promotion was for the Twin Turbo model of the 300zx, a car that had undergone a body re-design just two years earlier.  At 15 I don't really recall being all that aware of car make and models... unless it was something outlandish like a Lamborghini or mundane like my parents vehicle.  But from that day forward I became hyper-aware of the 300zx, and made note to point one out wherever I saw it.
<br><br>
Years go by, age and realism set in, and you quickly come to understand that a car like that, already selling for as much as $38,000 in the early ninties, is a dream and little more. Still, amidst the Hyndai Excel, Mazda MX-6, and even though the Eagle Talon days I still retained that little voice in the back of my head with the mantra.. Someday.
<br><br>
After 1996, I started to fear my dream was only in passing when they announced they were no longer producing the 300zx, which ultimately fell victim to so much love and respect that the cost of the car became rediculous.  The 1994, only 6000 units were sold.. and the numbers were worse for 1995.  The world wasn't into the idea of a $50,000 car, and likewise, neither was I. 
<br><br>
A few years later, after having been slightly blessed by the dot-com boom, and thanks to my father's support, I was able to live part of the dream as we found a private owner selling his 1991 300zx Twin Turbo.   The car was well cared for, at least as far as the engine was concerned.  It had custom 3.5" exhaust, no mufflers, pushing a pretty 340hp when we found it.  The owner was (understandably) quite sad in giving it up, but needed to because of life changes. We bought the car for the tidy sum of about $14,000, outright.   It was smoke grey, leather interior, and absolutely beautiful in my eyes, even though it was 10 years old and had 100,000 miles on it. 
<br><br>
I ran that car like it was an extension of myself. I can proudly say that I raced the hell out of it. Often. I upgraded the air intake system to the Stillin mushroom model, and that car simply breathed when it ran. I believe the fastest quarter-mile time I posted was a 12.9, which, given the fact that this was a racing track in the foothills of Colorado (5280+ feet above sea level), and given that even though Perelli P7000 summer tires are Z rated, they aren't exactly racing slicks, was pretty damn good.  Given proper drag tires and a modest altitude, it was no question that car was almost a 10 second car.  
<br><br>
The Z was the only friend that came down with me when I moved to Texas, and while the engine was still sound, as it started getting into its 13th year of life, the body started showing its signs of aging. The front air dam and hood needed repainting, due to years of colorado life (gravel on snowy roads), and oddly enough, towards the end the clear-coat on the hatch began to flake off for no reason, causing a chain reaction of clear coat peeling all along the back hatch.  Pressing 120k miles, I began to realize the car would take a whole lot of money, money in which I didn't have, to take care of and really do it up like it deserves.
<br><br>
But there was hope. 
<br><br>
In 2003 Nissan unleashed what had only been in concept a few years before. They announced the rebirth of the Z car, in the flavor of the 350z.  No turbos, 287 base HP.  What intrigued me the most was how familiar the new body style looked to the 1990-96 line, it still had the flugh headlights, the snub back, and that mid-engine feel of a well balanced vehicle.  I was elated to see that the price had calmed down considerably to the 28-34k range (the title on my 1991 300zx showed a final sale price of over $38,000).
<br><br>
I began reading up on the machine, learning everything I could about it, pricing them, battling agains the hoopla that surrounded its return which allowed dealerships to get away with murder on the pricing as people were ready willing and able to pay 38-40,000 for the car and sell them hand over fist.  4-5 people at my company had one within a few months of release, so I was able to at least check them out from a distance.
<br><br>
And then it happened. March 22nd, 2004. I'm at work, nearing the end of my day, doing my daily ritual of seaching http://www.nissandriven.com for their inventory of all Black, standard transmission, Enthusiast package 350z in my area when I found what would later be "The One".  There it was, sitting in a dealership just 20 min away down I-35... a black 350z Enthusiast, standard trasmission, with he "extra" bonuses of side curtain airbags and the "aero" kit, which included the spoiler, front air grille, and side skirts, for an MSRP of just $30,000 on the nose.
<br><br>
I contacted the dealership via the web about the car, they wrote back saying they had just gotten it in and it happened to be "the one" they were wheeling into the showroom floor.  So I wrote the VIN number down, and took a little trip down south to the Nissan dealership.  Sure enough, there it was... center showroom, in all its glory.  It was time to put the skills I learned from the man himself (my father) and negotiate my ass off.
<br><br>
After 3 hours of deliberation with an eager upstarting dealer and his sales manager, I got the car down to low 20's and negotiated that they throw in free window tinting, and at approx 9:00 pm, I was congratulated on my new purchace.  The sale included the trade in of my old 300x, a somewhat sad moment, but what better retirement for the first Z than a Nissan dealership and a rebirth of the soul into a new shell.  She had a wonderful going out that I'll always remember...
<br><br>
When you trade in a car, one of the management usually takes it out for a spin around the block to apprase the vehicle. The appraiser in this case was a tall, skinny "good 'ol boy". Definately Texan, the type to welcome you into the store with a "yee haw!".  And yee-haw he did.  I'm sitting there talking to the sales rep when he walks in, and amidst the crowd of probably 6-7 dealers and 3-4 customers exclaims "YEEEE HAW! That girl can sure still move, can't she!!!", and proceded to tell me how much pep and kick it had for a 13 year old car.  Passion or not, 13 years is a lot of depreciation time for a vehicle, so while he shared in my passion for the vehicle, it wasn't exactly enough to convince him to give me 10 grand for it ;) 
<br><br>

<br><br>
The rest of the night was surreal, I got a decent interest rate, covered by Nissan themselves which is good for my credt, and most of all, from negotiation to test drive.. I did it all myself, finally realizing Dream #2 (of 3) in my list of things to accomplish in Life. 
<br><br>
So, how is the 350z?  Words cannot describe it. Images will have to suffice when I have a chance to take some :) <br />

Finally found this old article, definately a keeper. It's a great abstract on the personality types of multiplayer gaming that is remarkably spot on.<br />
