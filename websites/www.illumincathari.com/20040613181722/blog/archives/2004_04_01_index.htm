      Happy Birthday!<br><br>

So I turned 27 this year. It's...not all that exciting of an age to hit, getting closer to 30 doesn't even really bother me so much.  I guess the only notable thing that hit me about the number is that I have 1 year left before my highschool's 10 year reunion, which of course kickstarted a 10 year mental evaluation of what I've been able to accomplish. But that's a topic for another day :)
<br><br>
The day started out well, it was a nice overcast, cool day. Kelly woke me up with a kiss and a happy birthday song :) Woke up, wore one of my favorite outfits (pictured later). Kel had put up a cute "Happy Birthday" banner stretching across the entryway of the apartment.. and a cute card on my windshield when I got out to the car.  Rolled into work, which was a bit barren as most of my friends were either in Vegas or Panama, which is really the only thing that bummed me out a bit as I was planning on hanging out with most of them as well during the night.  
<br><br>
A good friend of mine (Erik) took me to eat at Star of India, a buffet style joint which served a buch of interesting food I never thought I'd like, but really did.  Notable thing there is that they didn't serve any diet drinks, so I had a regular coke, and thus started my complete day-off-atkins that I haven't had in a long while.  The rest of work went by relatively fast, got a few good things accomplished, shot the shit with coworkers and at about 5:00 I decided to leave early (normally work til 7).  Went home, went back out to Target and bought myself a chamis glove and this cool squeegie thing that's supposed to have 15% less friction than a terry cloth.  Excited to use them after my next carwash.
<br><br>
But again I digress.  So I went out, took a few snapshots of my car to show the fam, and let the artsy side of my brain run rampant to the point where I sort of...didn't take a picture of the...whole car.  But check these out!

<br><br>
Cool huh? Tomorrow I'll try to take an actual picture of the whole car... I also made a cool desktop wallpaper using the headlight image, it's 1280x1024 which is too big to show here, but if you you click <a href="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/350/z-1280x1024.jpg" target=_new>HERE</a> you can check it out, or download it by right-clicking and picking "Save Target As".
<br><br>
Moving on. We established that since Kelly couldn't get off work until 9pm that we'd meet at the pool hall at 8:00 and hang out until she met us there, then go get something to eat.  So at about 7:40 I roll to the local corner store, pick myself up some celbratory smokes (Cohiba cigar and "cannon fodder" swisher sweets), and roll to the venue. First one there, order up a table in the section with the only staff person I know that didn't go to Vegas.  Pool, Guinness, Cigars, good music playing... ahhh.  About 30 min later Kel's sister and her fiance show up, I guess they thought we'd be leaving together so they were over at the apartment waiting for a while thiking I'd be there (doh!).  Did some fun cutthroat with them until Kel got off work and came out, then we rolled to Fudruckers to eat.  Good burger. Even ate... *gasp*... fries with my meal.  They tasted great, I hogged them all. 
<br><br>
Went back home, watched a hillarious DVD: SNL: Best of Will Ferrell.  Sung some happy birthday over a yummy cheesecake, and opened presents.  This year I scored BatteField: Vietnam, Spinter Cell, a cool desk clock refurbed from PC computer parts, and a (much appreciated) gift card to Old Navy since ALL of my current pants, shorts, etc require the use of a belt or else they're falling off.  On the family front I some wonderful cards and some (much appreciated) financial assistance to help me through the recoils of initial new-car cost I'm still battling through :)  I really can't wait until later on this summer to visit em back in Denver :)
<br><br>
All in all, a wonderful, peaceful, birthday with good people and good fun.   Time to start making this next year really count :) Onwards and upwards...<br><br />

      15 Min of Fame<br><br>

Last summer New Line Cinema put out a little horror movie called <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0329101" target=_new>Freddy vs. Jason</a>, a movie which creates a lot of horror controversy and answers the "who would win if" question pepole have been asking for years.  Here in Austin, we are very fortunate in having a badass movie theater company called <a href="http://www.alamodrafthouse.com" target=_new>Alamo Drafthouse</a> who does a LOT of special events.

Well, for Freddy vs. Jason, they put on the event to end all events.  They rented an entire camp/park area for a weekend and invited hundreds of movie goers out to spend the day doing "summer camp" type activities.  They even passed out cheesy, powder blue colored summer camp shirts reading "Camp Hack'n'Slash", named after the event, and long, white, colored tube socks for everyone to wear.  It was great... they had events like dodgeball, arts and crafts, and even a Snape hunt where at the end of the trail, we actually did find a Snape.  

Snapes, incidentally, look and taste a lot like a keg of beer.

At dusk, they inflated a huge screen and projected a few horror movies, including the premier of Freddy vs. Jason, onscreen as everyone got to watch it under the starts. Cool enough as it is, but the bonus was, my family was in town so I got to experience it with my brothers, which made it absolutely memorable.  To top it all off, before the movie, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000387/" target=_new>Robert Englund</a> (Freddy) and <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0457090/" target=_new>Ken Kirzinger</a> (Jason) were both onhand to meet the crowd and answer questions.  Talk about kick ass.

So why am I writing all of this now, almost a year later?

Well, the event was a really big deal, and Newline / Alamo Drafthouse was taking a big chance on the event..  you see.. all along before the normal show opening they wanted to keep the ending of the movie a secret.  They made us promise that we wouldn't leak the ending to the media until the real premier, and from what I can tell everyone stayed true to that.  So as an added bonus, they included footage filmed at Camp Hack'n'Slash on the DVD release extra features.  Someone at work brought it and I started looking through the footage for evidence of our attendance.. and sure enough.. about 3 minutes into the documentary, there we were:

<center><img src="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/misc/camp_dvd.jpg"></center>

From left to right, indicated by the red lines, that's Aaron, Chris, and me :)  The picture illustrates a very funny story which involves the trail you see in front of us with people walking. See we're sitting about dead center, one section back from the huge 30' screen which is to the left off camera.  This would be the eqiv of the "sweet spot" seats you find in a normal theatre, sitting about dead center deep and laterally.  Well the problem was, every time something interesting was going on up at the stage (in front of the screen) the people walking by would just... stop... and loiter there watching what's going on.. effectively blocking the view of some 50+ behind them. 

Enter Mr. Heckler, a guy sitting a few rows back off camera to the right.  He, in all of his drunken courage, became the hero of the people.  He had that perfet heckler voice... loud & obnoxious, like the kind of guy who seasoned his "public speaking" skills razzing outfielders at countless baseball games.  Every time someone would stop and block the view, he'd pop off with one of many choice phrases, like:

<li>"Standing in front of people is cool!" 
<li>"Get out of the waaaaay, you moron!"
<li>"Sit the fuck down!"
<li>"What is wrong with you people?! Keep walking!"

It was great. Although I do give props to one brave young lady who had the balls (?) to turn right back around and shout "Fuck you!" right back to him, which then prompted the other 49 people she was blocking to reaffirm his initial request to get the fuck out of the way.

All in all a great night, the movie was a lot of fun, and they continued to play other horror movies into the wee hours in the morning. We were supposed to have awoken to a nice morning breakfast provided by the venue. Instead, at about 6:30 am, it started raining like a sonofabitch, to which people decided to retreat to their vehicles and just head home. 

Good times, good times.<br />
