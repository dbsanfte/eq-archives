(Just hoping someone from Verant reads this board occasionally)<p>I've been playing with a shaman recently and it's a lot of fun being able to wack a monster over the head while being able to heal your fellow players during a tough battle. But I have some issues with this particular character/class.<p>Why do shamans get the piercing skill when they can not use any piercing weapons? And why are shamans allowed to use an axe but not have the 1H Slashing skill? Seems like an oversight by the development team but this is only my opinion. There might be certain issues with balancing and all but why not a battle axe either? Same skill as an axe to wield. Yes, it does more damage than a druid can with a scimitar but the delay speed on most battle axes should even it out. Plus the fact that shamans are allowed only on the hardier races such as barbarians (which I'm playing), ogres and trolls which can easily wield a battle axe as well as a regular axe considering their height and strength. Can someone from Verant answer this? (E-mail would be appreciated also since I don't check this board too often - similar thread in EQVault)
