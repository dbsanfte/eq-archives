Hi..<p>I have been racking my brains on a particular quest.<br>Haven't we all?<br>I have really made a good faith effort but I am stuck and it's driving me crazy.<br>I know folks discourage just giving answer away, I agree with that. But what I propose wouldn't give anything away without demonstrating some effort on my part. If someone has solved this particular quest, and doesn't mind me e-mailing them, I'll ask for the hint that way. Along with that, I would be more than happy to demonstrate, by what I know and what I've done and tried, that I've really made the effort. By the variety of NPCs and steps and dialouge and names I can throw out I am pretty confident I can demonstrate that I didn't cop out without a good try.<p>The particular quest is for the Enchanters.  You talk to the Guildmaster (Lenkan Rjarn) who has a problem he won't talk about concerning Nolusia Finharn's brother.. Later when you talk to her at the Vasty Deep Inn she gives you a quest...  I know much more, but I'll stop there...<p>Anyone solved this one that could possibly give me what is probably the last thing I am stuck on?
