I am a level 11 wizard, and a few days ago, I was wandering in the other guilds looking for quests.  The guildmaster in the Enchanters guild responded to my hail and asked my to deliver an enchanted flask to the shopkeeper in the Emerald Warriors Armoury.  However, I did not get anything added to my inventory, and there were no bracketed keywords in the enchanter's second message.  I tried going over to talk to the intended recipient of the flask, but she did not respond to anything I tried to tell her.  Is this quest broken?  Is it not happening because I am a Wizard? (Elf).  What am I missing here?
