Thx everyone for the help on my earlier post.<p>I am now a lvl 2.5 wizard and have come across some money.  I don't know what to buy.  I want to get more spells of course, cause I figure I could use them.  BUT, it looks like I can't use a lot of them before I reach a certain level.  I don't want to buy something I can't use.  Is there a website where I can find out what a spell does, and what level I need to be to get it?  <p>Also, I already am stuck with a staff that I can't freaking USE.  I was told that I need 1 pt. in 2 hand bash skill.  Well, I wish I knew I needed this stat.  Where do I find what level in stat I am on each of these skills?  All I see is "Awful"?  for some things I know I have some skills in... ie. swimming.  If there is no way to find out, well, let me just say that it SUCKS not knowing you need these stats when u don't even know what level you are in that skill.  (AS if any creature with 2 hands and opposable thumbs can't hold a freaking STAFF .  WTF!)  <p>All in all, I've got about 7 gold, and want to buy something.  I am just trying to see what a lvl 2.5 wiz should buy at this point.<p>Thank you.<p><br>
