You will never have enough magic.  Best thing to do is make sure your channeling and meditaion skills are as high as they can go for that level(5+5 per level) This will help a little.  Medition is nice for the first few levels you have it and then you will again be waiting forever(with medition) for your mana.  Meditation is a MUST skill at higher levels.  I read somewhere that it takes almost a half hour for a level 30+ magic user to recharge just sitting and about 5 min with meditate.  You can see what meditate gives you but also you can see that it still takes 5 min.  The problem seems to steam from the fact that your channeling goes up just as fast as your meditation.  So while you can now get more mana faster you also have more mana to use and your spells cost more mana to simmilar things to the new monsters that you are now fighting(Kinda a catch 22)<p>I have heard that bards get a song at higher levels that help recharge mana.  I know that when bards start getting that on my server I will be grouping with them when ever I can.
