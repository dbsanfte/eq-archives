Personally, I would like to see multiple outfits too, but I have the opposite problem.  I think its rediculous that a (wood elf) ranger would be running around in the woods in a backless bathing suit.  I'm tired of the never-ending "Hey baby!  Wanna pet my ears!  Whoo! etc..."  Even chainmail seems to be worn low cut with push-up bras.  This is not exactly great cover for vulnerable areas such as the throat and the heart.  What's the point of wearing armor that doesn't cover anything?<br>Its great that you CAN play a character that way, but I think role playing would really benefit from a little bit of variety.  May be you could pick a starting outfit when you pick your face?  Dunno.  Anyway, I think clothing could definitely use a bit of variety.
