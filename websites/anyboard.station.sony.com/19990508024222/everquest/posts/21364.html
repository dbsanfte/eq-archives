 I checked the scheduled downtime page and it said that on the 13th of April they'll be coming down to fix a corpse dissapearing bug. They said they were coming down immediately because of this. Problem is this message was posted AFTER the 15th one. So apparently someone messed up and put the wrong date cuz the same message is posted on eqstratics as for today, the 20th. So that's why we can't connect. They wanted to get it done quickly so no more people would lose their bodies. Hope this answers your questions. <p>  Wow, I sounded like a Sony employee right there:))
