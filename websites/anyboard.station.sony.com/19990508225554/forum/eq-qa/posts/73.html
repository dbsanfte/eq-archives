I am so utterly confused about stats. right now.  I have asked a ton of people and tried to find out myself.  Here are my questions.<p>1.  Does your Strength Stat. affect your damage????  *I have tried to see a difference in a wizard with 70 strength and my ogre with 160 strenght after enchantment and I saw no difference*.  I am so confused on that and just want a answer on how it really works.<p>2.  I play an ogre, with an obvious low intelligence.  Will trade skills be harder for me?  In other words does intelligence play a large role in blacksmithing?  I have heard that blacksmithing requires a high strength, is that true?<p>All in all I think that everyone is confused as to how the stats. work.  We just can't tell a difference in having on stat high or low.  Save Charisma when you buy things, Intelligence for more mana and High Stanima for your air when under water.  Thank you in advance for any help you can provide<p>Bagbok<br>The Confused and misguided Ogre
