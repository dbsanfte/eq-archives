the belief that the universe, taken as a whole, is God. There is, to a pantheist, no God but the combined forces and laws which are manifested in the existing environment.<br><br>A secondary meaning is a belief in many gods, as in Hinduism, or the worship of differing creeds, cults and peoples indifferently; also the toleration of worship of all gods, as at certain periods in the Roman Empire &amp;#8212; and in the United States today.<br><br>Environmentalists fit into the several categories of pantheism, and are proud of it. They worship what they call Nature and, sometimes, Mother Earth. They have a &quot;marked tendency,&quot; wrote Paul Johnson, &quot;to anthropomorphize and turn wild animals into heroic pets, [to be] anti-business, anti-profit ... [to] delight in vivid portrayals of the dangers of nuclear power, the poisoning of rivers, the destruction of whales and rain forests.&quot;<br><br>The media long ago swallowed, without a gulp, any and all claims made by environmentalists. Some years back this included the discovery that there is mercury in fish. The resulting hubbub dealt a heavy blow to the fish industry. Later, scientists discovered that mercury in fish has existed for eons, and did not come from industrial wastes. That ended the great fish scare, but not till after millions had changed their eating habits.<br><br>Since then numerous scares have arisen. One recent scare led to demands to halt ships carrying PCB containers headed toward British ports. The authorities responded with their usual craven submission, but that noise barely ended before the charge arose that McDonaldÅfs hamburger chain in Britain was destroying Brazilian rain forests in order to raise beef for hamburgers. That charge, as in the case of many predecessors, was treated seriously until McDonaldÅfs proved its beef was locally grown.<br><br>In the U.S., we have been treated to the spectacle of two grapes, mysteriously located and exhibited, that were inoculated with traces of poison. That led to a boycott of Chilean grapes which cost that struggling nation hundreds of millions of dollars; a scare regarding apples that was proven to be scientifically false but which led our authorities nevertheless to halt the manufacture and use of a harmless and beneficial chemical. And, of course, there has been a stream of scares about nuclear wastes.<br><br>Dr. Petr Beckmann, the brilliant editor-publisher of Access to Energy, publicized, in language clear to intelligent laymen, how the secure disposal of nuclear wastes has long ago been solved. Dr. Beckmann has authored a book proving that the costs of not going nuclear are high; he constantly discusses the safety of nuclear development.<br><br>His newsletter (available from Box 2298, Boulder, CO 80306, $25 a year) for September 1989 highlighted some of the impact of environmentalism upon space exploration. He said in part:<br><br>&quot;For a trip to Mars, only nuclear energy can provide sufficient energy for anything, including fuel. Chemical fuels would make the spacecraft impossibly heavy, solar energy would make the collectors impossibly large (hundreds of square miles) and outer space suffers from an acute shortage of wind, chicken manure and other Lovinsian energy sources. So the rocket to be fired from Cape Kennedy to Mars uses a nuclear source of energy power . . . and the safest, most suited substance for the job is plutonium. That has the charlatans shrieking everywhere. To unmask them as quacks (in reply to their letters to the editor), feel free to use the following facts: plutonium is an alpha emitter, whose radiation is absorbed within a few inches of air; 3,500 tons of it have been committed to the atmosphere in the bomb tests of the 1950s, but no known casualty has resulted; it is dangerous only if inhaled as dust in significant quantities (but even then many times less dangerous than the naturally found element radium); of the 25 Manhattan Project workers, each of whom inhaled 25 times (todayÅfs) permissible lung burden in an accident, 23 are still alive, the remaining two died of unrelated causes (one in a car accident); Prof. B.L. Cohen of the University of Pittsburgh has challenged any nuclear critic to go on television with him and consume as much caffeine as he will consume plutonium, and I have repeated the challenge for my own person without any pre-specified limit (just keep eating till death do us part).&quot;<br><br>Needless to say, neither Dr. Beckmann nor Dr. Cohen will soon appear on the McNeil-Lehrer Report or Nightline; Beckmann in particular is ignored because his analyses conspicuously lack the discreet murk favored in the discussion of environmental issues in contemporary circles. For instance, in the same September issue of Access to Energy, he carried an analysis of the effects of power lines and magnetic fields, proving conclusively that scare stories about their dangers are utterly, ridiculously false.<br><br>Dr. Beckmann then explained that exercise by saying that it was provoked by &quot;a three-part series ÅeAnnals of RadiationÅf by our old acquaintance Paul Brodeur in The New Yorker. As in . . . his amateurish smears of asbestos he mostly uses Åeanecdotal evidence.Åf (A child with a clubfoot was born to a pilot; What did it? Microwaves! Why microwaves? Because His Serene Highness Baron Brodeur has so decreed). All these scare stories are permeated with the idea that to maximize their profits, the big bad corporations spread cancer, war and pestilence &amp;#8212; as if they were anything but a spineless bunch of wimps trying to buy off their detractors with lavish contributions.&quot;<br><br>That last comment may appear to be gratuitous sarcasm, were it not for the fact that among the more-than-$50,000-a-year contributors to environmental groups are the American Petroleum Institute, Pennzoil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron USA, Edison Electric Institute, IBM, Phillips Petroleum, Tenneco, Unocal Corporation, Dow Chemical, Exxon, Ford Motor Co., Duke Power, DuPont, Mobil Oil, Monsanto and other giant firms that are ongoing environmental targets for demonstrations, lawsuits and even sabotage. That partial list of corporate and intellectual masochists, compiled by Jo Kwong Echard in Who Funds the Left? serves to substantiate Dr. BeckmannÅfs biting remarks.<br><br>But the fact that the commercial/industrial sector cowers before the environmentalists is not simply a psychological reaction, so much as a reflection of the political power of a great movement that has succeeded in politicizing science in the name of the environment.<br><br>This has not been a simple process; and environmentalism alone does not cover it. An anti-business, anti-industrial climate was fostered in this nation in the Åf30s, was suspended for practical reasons during World War II and reappeared in the 1960s. President John Kennedy termed businessmen &quot;SOBs,&quot; and used the FBI to pull steelmen out of bed (when they had violated no law), and created, virtually single-handed, a stock market crash in the early Åf60s.<br><br>In the Åf60s, Rachel Carson launched an anti-chemical drive with her book Silent Spring and in 1965 NaderÅfs Unsafe At Any Speed speared the heart of U.S. industry in Detroit. A health and safety lobby appeared, and a series of Clean Air Acts were enacted that cost U.S. business an estimated $63 billion a year, plus another $3 billion to maintain monitoring agencies. By 1979, these costs totaled $100 billion directly, incalculably more indirectly in terms of an entrepreneurial marketplace.<br><br>Since then these issues &amp;#8212; and their costs &amp;#8212; have multiplied. Today the results on national productivity have appeared, but neither the courts nor the bureaucracy nor the White House appears at all concerned. American taxpayers, it is believed, can be eternally productive, can pay any price, toil for anyone in the world to any extent &amp;#8212; so long as the cause sounds good.<br><br>Yet the price, at the halfway mark, seems almost more than can be grasped. The peak year for U.S. productivity was 1968, when we produced over one-third (34 percent) of all the worldÅfs manufactured goods. Today, a little over 20 years later, our national output has fallen by over half. Although environmentalism has not been solely responsible, it has served as a prime catalyst of this catastrophe. (Another has been the fluctuating dollar. To use a unit of exchange that broadens or narrows daily is like building with an unstable standard of measurement; it renders an entire system chaotic.)<br><br>If, says one clean-air scientist, the present Clean Air Act proposed by President Bush is enacted and enforced, the Los Angeles Basin will have to be shut down. That means the largest industrial complex in the nation will go the way of the Midwest steel industry, the WestÅfs mining industry and the nationÅfs asbestos industry.<br><br>Yet, despite this calamitous outlook, the most serious, deepest and most wide-ranging significance of the environmental industry and the monitoring agencies and firms it has spawned will not only be economic, but also political and religious.<br><br>The political significance of environmentalism is that it is enabling Congress, through agencies of its own creation, to micromanage everything that moves in these United States. That is the final stage of a fascist economy. It means that the facade of capitalism will remain, but all serious managerial and commodity decisions will be assumed by the government.<br><br>Unlike HitlerÅfs Germany or MussoliniÅfs Italy or LeninÅfs USSR, the American government will not announce its centralization of authority &amp;#8212; will not personalize it. The American style is, despite myths to the contrary, more subtle. Faceless and nameless bureaucrats will apply rules softly or rigidly, as pressed by our permanent Congress; future presidents will either reflect the liberal consensus or go along with it, as does President Bush.<br><br>Like the Roman State, Congress will rule for a time; perhaps a very long time, with the complicity of the media, which have replaced the voice of the people. What occurs in the long run is, of course, unknowable; history indicates that that will depend upon when a leader arises who will attain the popularity and the power &amp;#8212; of a Franklin Roosevelt.<br><br>In the interim, it is obvious that the Los Angeles Basin will not be closed. The terms of the first Clean Air Act, after all, were not fully applied &amp;#8212; because even in the Åf60s it was realized that a literal application would destroy the nation. No government can afford that. What will happen under the latest wave of environmentalism, is that firms with good political friends will prosper while others will not. The government arsenal will be stocked with irresistible weapons, which will be used to permit or prevent, by indirect means, all serious movement in the land.<br><br>In effect, environmentalism is the slogan under which the largest seizures of political power in the history of the nation are being launched. Corporations have a right to be afraid, because they know that open protests will be long remembered. Individuals should be equally frightened, for what happens to the institutions of our society affect us all.<br><br>That is the political meaning of current environmental policies. The religious meaning is, as always, transcendent. The environmentalists are pantheists and animists; they are living in a FoolÅfs Paradise, as did their predecessors and counterparts in various periods and places throughout history.<br><br>What they, deliberately or accidentally, are ushering into power, are men who want to become living gods, supreme over both the earth and its people.<br><br>History and the Bible have shown us this heresy again and again, and equally often have shown the awesome punishments it evokes. Half our national substance has already melted away in the fires of this movement (why else do you see foreign goods everywhere?); the rest will follow, unless the misuse of a noble cause is returned to rationality, and the people to God and freedom.<br> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Nuclear power is the next logical step for serious space travel.
