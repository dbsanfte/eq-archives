Possony, Ph.D.; <br>Jerry E. Pournelle, Ph.D. and<br>Col. Francis X. Kane, Ph.D. (USAF Ret.)<br>© 1997 Jerry E. Pournelle<br>NOTES TO CHAPTER SEVEN<br>by DR. FRANCIS X. KANE<br><br><br>NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY<br>FXK-6188<br>TEXT FROM DR. KANE<br>1 June, 1988<br><br>Jerry, after struggling with the chapter, I finally identified its flaw. Steve assumed that a nuclear strategy meant exploiting all the potential applications, and that the Soviets constrained us by their deployment/propaganda efforts.<br><br>The fact is that we have and have had a strategy for nuclear technology. It has been very narrow; but very, very successful. The objective has been to continuously improve our weapons in spite of all constraints. The weapon technology goes hand in hand with the inertial guidance technology. As accuracy has gotten better and better, yield has gone down, and weapon effects have gone up. Furthermore, our weapons are longer-lived, have become more reliable, and have been very economical in the use of critical nuclear material.<br><br>Furthermore, as we have decreased yield without giving up military (and even improving) military effectiveness [sic] we have reduced the amount of critical material in each weapon. Thus, we are able to &quot;mine&quot; obsolete weapons for their nuclear material and re-use it for newer, more efficient designs.<br><br>That strategy can only be called an unqualified success.<br><br>NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY<br>In the fifty years since Nils Bohr announced the splitting of the atom nuclear technology has grown and matured -- and become the most controversial technology in history. As we approach the end of the century, the issue is whether or not nuclear technology will continue to exist. In the immediate post-war period several landmark studies identified applications to an array of military and civil applications (See Chart 17). Most of them were explored. But at the same time there was a raging discussion of ways to limit those applications or to &quot;put the nuclear genie&quot; back in the bottle. That situation still prevails at the start of the last decade of this century -- new applications are being invented; new attempts are being made to prevent them.<br><br>The list of military applications explored covers nearly the entire range of propulsion and weapon systems.<br><br>Nuclear bombs grew from the 20 kiloton weapon of 1945 to the 60 megaton bomb exploded by the Soviets in 1961 and a962, when they abrogated the &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; not to test nuclear weapons in the Earth's atmosphere. As nuclear file NUKES Page <br><br>technology matured the explosive power in bombs declined from the multi-megaton range to that of the low kiloton. Such bombs are carried by fighter and bomber aircraft, ballistic missiles (both ICBM and SLBM), and cruise missiles.<br><br>Nuclear artillery rounds were developed, deployed and modernized for battlefield operation, particularly as part of the U.S. deterrent to Soviet attack on NATO.<br><br>Nuclear air defense weapons were deployed in Europe and the U.S. Nuclear weapons for ballistic missile defense and ASATs were deployed. Nuclear depth charges were designed (Casaba Hawlyn[?]) and deployed.<br><br>In propulsion technology, nuclear powered engines were developed for long-range bombers (the Camel[? Comet?])' nuclear powered cruise missile; nuclear reactors for ships, both surface and submarine; nuclear propulsion for spacecraft (SNAP) was used; and nuclear power for space stations and lunar bases were designed. A design to propel large satellites by a chain of nuclear explosions (Orion) was developed but never implemented. The Soviets for their part have developed and orbited many nuclear reactors.<br><br>On the commercial side, nuclear power for the generation of electricity became the mainstay of France and other countries. Nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes such as building canals were actively considered for a decade and dropped.<br><br>All these applications were constrained by fear; fear of accident, pollution and unknown effects, and the overriding dread that the use of even one nuclear weapon would lead to the end of mankind. To allay fears, emphasis was placed on safeguards and constraints. Nuclear weapons on aircraft, for example, were controlled by Permissive Action Links (PAL) so that they could be used only on authority by[?] responsibility civilians. Most of the applications for propulsion were dropped because of the impossibility of safe military operations. The nuclear-powered aircraft was to have been flown in remote areas of Utah and a special hangar was built for it even though the program never survived the design stage. Of those propulsion applications only the nuclear reactor to power submarines survived and matured.<br><br>In like manner, nuclear plowshares never became a real program. Nuclear power for generation of electricity survived, albeit controversy surrounded individual plants and caused delays in construction, cancellation of programs[?], and even abandonment of plants.<br><br>Very much related was the issue of disposing of nuclear waste materials. The search for suitable sites dragged on for years, hindered by concerns for pollution of the water supply and other health hazards.<br><br>Nevertheless, invention continues. New ways to focus energy produced by nuclear explosions were developed. One application was postulated for the X-Ray as a source of power to destroy enemy ballistic missiles. Tailored weapon effects for discriminant[?] employment were developed for the &quot;Safeguard&quot; bird[?] program[?] and battlefield weapons, and the most controversial of the[?] inventions was the &quot;neutron bomb&quot; which could kill enemy forces by enhanced radiation and not produce damage to material.<br><br>In order to try to curtail the application of nuclear technology to weapons, extensive, long-term efforts were devoted to international negotiations, treaties, and agreements. Very much related were efforts to prevent the use of nuclear materials developed for and by commercial reactors for weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency was established by treaty and located in Vienna, Austria. Technology for inspections and safeguards were developed for the IAEA. Non-proliferation programs were instituted by the U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. but with limited effects. France pursued its own path for commercial power and military weapons, developing bombs for aircraft, strategic ballistic missiles and SLBMs. China followed much the same path but developed also its own ICBMs. India exploded its own nuclear bomb to signal its arrival as a major power. In order to prevent Iraq from developing the &quot;Islamic Bomb&quot; financed by Libya, Israel conducted an air strike on Iraq's nuclear reactor and destroyed it. However, Israel was reported to have its own nuclear bombs. And Argentina, Brazil, and Pakistan were assessed to be &quot;on the verge&quot; of developing nuclear weapons. In sum, non-proliferation efforts were never successful when nations decided that it was in their interests to have nuclear weapons, and they acquired the necessary technology to develop them.<br><br>The consequence for the U.S. military planner in the 1990's[?] was that Third World countries could use nuclear weapons in wars in their region. For example, the U.S. in the 1980's pressured Pakistan not [to?] develop its own weapon because of the fear of nuclear war between nuclear armed India and Pakistan. (We should note that the Pakistani have another motivation, namely, to defend themselves from a Soviet invasion through Afghanistan.)<br><br>But the major focus on nuclear technology has been on strategic relations between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The arms control theory is that if tests are banned, weapon development will stop; the arsenals were[?] atrophy; the user will be uncertain as to the health of his nuclear weapons; and consequently they will not be used. There is a somewhat related motivation, namely, when a country believes it has a lead in nuclear weapon technology it wants a treaty to preserve that lead and prevent its adversary from closing the gap.<br><br>The history of test ban negotiations covers the entire post-war period. The harmful effects of testing in the atmosphere led to the &quot;gentlemen's agreement[&quot;?] of the 1950's which the Soviets violated in 1961. It was followed by the Nassau Treaty which did end atmospheric testing by the U.S., U.K., and U.S.S.R. (But not by France and China which[?] were not signatories.) Lengthy efforts followed in the 1970's to limit underground nuclear testing which resulted in a partial ban, limiting such tests to 100 KT[?]. Negotiations continued in the 1980's for a complete test ban which was not achieved.<br><br>A very curious situation arose as a result of the meeting of President Reagan and Communist leader Gorbachev at Reykjavik in December 1986. President Reagan proposed that[?] objective of stopping nuclear weapons testing be achieved another way -- to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely. Then many believers in test ban theory found themselves to be &quot;children of the nuclear age&quot; and opposed total elimination of nuclear weapons.<br><br>The continuous drive on the part of the Soviets impacted on[?] nuclear technology in two domains[?]. One lay in designing and testing weapons within the partially negotiated constraints, such as limits of 100 KT's of yield. The other lay in the closely related domain of verification. Any limit on testing has the attendant requirement to determine if violations are occurring. That in turn requires verification of compliance with the treaty limits. Obviously, as the limits were decreased, the difficulty of assessing yield at lower limits increased. Thus, technology, principally the application of seismistic[?] measurement, had to [be?] adapted to measuring yield. By the end of the 1980's, that application had been very successful, giving confidence in the ability of the U.S. to verify treaty compliance.<br><br>Thus of the two major lines of nuclear technology: Weapons and other applications, only weapons and commercial production production of electrical power survived. The strategy of nuclear weapons technology had a history of its own.<br><br>In the initial period the focus was on nuclear weapons design and production. Two major designs were pursued: Implosion and insertion. The objectives in weapon design were efficiency and safety. As for efficiency, there were two drivers[?] -- improving the yield to weight ratio and decreasing the amount of critical material used. Safety aspects concentrated on the bombs themselves, including extension of life of the weapons, and maintenance of reliability. During this period also, an entirely new weapon design -- the hydrogen or &quot;H&quot; bomb.<br><br>Principally under the influence of the ICBM program, design shifted from weapon development and production to that of weapon systems. The marriage of a small weapon with a rocket booster lead[?] the way to an integrated approach. The first major product was the MIRV'ed ICBM, but others were found in the SLBM, field artillery, and tactical fighter delivered weapons.<br><br>Beginning at about the same time, other technologies, principally electronics, began to play a major role in nuclear weapons. The internal guidance system of the Post-Boost Vehicle which carries the MIRV's greatly improved the accuracy of weapon delivery. That technological innovation meant that the yield of the individual weapon could be reduced while still maintaining weapon effectiveness as measured by SSPK (Single-Shot Probability of Kill).<br><br>Another important application of electronics came from the political requirement for absolute control of each weapon. The concern was that aircraft-carried weapons could be employed by the aircraft crew on their command. Thus, inadvertent, accidental, or deliberate but unauthorized release could occur and nuclear war could result. Consequently, Permissive Action Link[s?] (PAL's) were designed and installed on nuclear weapons. For ICBM's in their silo's, a &quot;turn-key&quot; system was installed so that no one crew member could launch a missile, because two members would have to &quot;turn their keys&quot; in a prescribed sequence and on receipt of a coded message in order for ICBM launch to occur.<br><br>Implementation of the INF will remove the newest, most effective nuclear weapons from the U.S. stockpile. This is a reversal of prior treaties which resulted [in?] or permitted removal of older, less efficient weapons while retaining the most modern ones. One of the effects of the INF is thus to increase the average age of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.<br><br>In the decade of the 1990's, nuclear weapon technology will see a new phase -- transformation to &quot;wizard&quot; weapons. During the war in Viet Nam advanced guidance technology, notably lasers, was adapted to World War II conventional bombs to make them more effective. Heroic feats of air delivery against selected elements of the power plants in Hanoi with a CEP of 14 feet. Similarly, such guidance systems will be adapted to nuclear weapons to produce in effect zero CEP weapons.<br><br>Optical guidance, map matching, radar guidance including laser radar are available. The weight of such guidance systems will be measured in ounces, not pounds; their mass will be practically zero also. These application to nuclear weapon design with still greater improvements in yield to weight ratios, will result in new weapon capabilities. Such advances will cascade into small, more effective weapon systems.<br><br>Given the advances made in the 1960's in discriminate nuclear weapons, the ultimate will be highly effective performance with controlled energy release from small weapon systems.<br><br>On the other hand, nuclear weapon technology can be applied to ballistic missile defense by X-Ray lasers which can have destructive effects at very long distances in space. Whether based in space or on the ground with relay mirrors they can achieve such effects instantaneously. Such lasers and other &quot;speed of light&quot; weapons will be possible in the next century.<br><br>But as has been the history of nuclear technology, the development of &quot;wizard&quot; nuclear weapons and &quot;speed of light&quot; weapons will be constrained and perhaps prevented by policy decisions. And those decisions will flow from the continuing fear of the atom, fear which has retarded many potential applications.<br><br>A key factor in the evaluation of policy will continue to be the Soviet drive for a total ban on testing. A comprehensive test ban would mean the end of nuclear technology.<br> <p><br><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nuclearspace/website/images/title/title_03.jpg"> </a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=105.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=105.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/addreply3.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.threadControl?topicID=105.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=105.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub97.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nuclearspacefrm1">Open Forum<option value="nuclearspacefrm12">Space Exploration<option value="nuclearspacefrm10">Environment<option value="nuclearspacefrm16">War<option value="nuclearspacefrm3">Asteroid Watch<option value="nuclearspacefrm4">Nuclear Spacecraft (past & future)<option value="nuclearspacefrm7">Applications of Nuclear Power<option value="nuclearspacefrm8">Media and Politics<option value="nuclearspacefrm2">Engineering<option value="nuclearspacefrm5">Opposition Movements and Myths<option value="nuclearspacefrm6">Nuclear and Space fiction<option value="nuclearspacefrm15">Nuclear Waste<option value="nuclearspacefrm13">The Nuclear Preserve<option value="nuclearspacefrm11">Suggestions Box<option value="nuclearspacefrm19">Employment Classifieds<option value="nuclearspacefrm20">Mad Scientists<option value="nuclearspacefrm21">Students Lounge<option value="nuclearspacefrm22">Snake Oil?<option value="nuclearspacefrm23">Astronomy<option value="nuclearspacefrm24">The Almighty Buck</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace>NuclearSpace Message Board</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm8>Media and Politics</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.nuclearspace.com">NuclearSpace Home Page</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
