Indeed, for a while, GNAWANPIS seemed to have forgotten their anti-nuke agenda altogether. I recently ran across this extraordinary essay, by New Zealander David White, over on the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://warnow.blogspot.com">War Now!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> blog. It does not really address nuclear issues, but it does have an interesting take on just how and where the cultural battle lines are being drawn. I think it has real relevance to our efforts, though the footwear analogy is pretty strained. (I wouldn't be caught dead in wingtips but I do have some sandals.)<br>
<br>
BTW, the terrorist loving wackos over at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.indymedia.org">Indymedia.batshit</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> have declared White a &quot;war criminal&quot; for this and similar writings. (so much for their bleatings about free speech and their denials of authoritarian intent).<br>

A Clash of... Something?<br>
<br>
<br>
I have noticed, along with other bloggers, that over these last few months, a seismic movement in world politics - a grand realignment, a &quot;shifting of tectonic plates&quot;, as one of them put it- seems to be occurring. Surfing the Internet, reading books and magazines, and just generally trying to keep up with what's going on, gives me the feeling that there are vast and significant changes occurring in the world, to which the mainstream news media seem oblivious. When President Bush said &quot;you are either with us or against us&quot; in the war against terrorism, he was actually outlining where the main fracture line really is, and the realignment of politics that will define the great conflict of the 21st Century.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shape of Wars to Come<br>
<br>
<br>
What, you may ask, am I talking about? Well, there's the assassination of a &quot;right-wing&quot; Dutch politician by an animal-rights activist, the al-Aqsa war against Israel and the September 11 attack on the United States, along with the explosion of anti-Semitism in Europe, and the ongoing US campaign against international terrorism. All these straws in the wind seem to be connected, to be bringing about a fundamental change in the world political scene that will match the Cold War in scope and duration. It's not just me, either- a number of bloggers and also writers such as Victor Davis Hanson have sensed it too.<br>
<br>
<br>
The one who has perceived this most clearly was Professor Samuel Huntingdon. In his article of a few years ago, &quot;A Clash of Civilizations&quot;, he saw that the great conflict of the 21st century would be along civilizational lines- &quot;the West vs. the Rest&quot;, as one commentator put it, or at least the West vs. Islam. I agree, but only up to a point. <br>
<br>
<br>
I do agree that the 21st Century will indeed be dominated by a vast conflict that will manifest itself in many ways on many different battlefields. It will be like the cold war in some ways, with guerillas, terrorists, great clashes of ideologies and large-scale conventional wars against terrorist sponsoring states. It will be completely different in others, for although there will be no one state or leader aiding and controlling the terrorists and guerillas, there will be lots of non-state organizations operating independently, with assassinations and bombings. (One recent article in the National Review urged us to think of what we will be facing as being more like James Bond vs. SPECTRE than NATO vs. USSR). <br>
<br>
<br>
But it won't just be a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;, although there will be some elements of this. The fault lines are not just between civilizations, but within them as well. It will be a war between the creative force of civilization and the destroying force of barbarism. <br>
<br>
<br>
The West has its own home-made barbarians (such as peace and anti-globalization activists), who are joining forces with non-Western barbarians such as Islamic fundamentalists, against the civilized of the West and other civilized non-Westerners. It will be a war for civilization and the consequences will be - to say the least - interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
How Did We Get From There?<br>
<br>
<br>
It began during the the Cold War. This, please remember, wasn't just a struggle between two areas on a map- the Soviet bloc vs. the Free World. It was also an internal split as well, with people taking sides within their own countries, with the various Communist parties in the West, and underground dissident groups in the Soviet Union. It was never more clearly demonstrated than in America during the Vietnam War. <br>
<br>
<br>
The U.S. conduct of that war brought into the mainstream of American life a group, or should I say a loose coalition, of people who were deeply, fundamentally and totally opposed not just to their country's policies but to its' very existence as a state. The &quot;peace movement&quot; included within its' ranks those who sought to destroy their country and everything it stood for, and were prepared to support anyone who was an enemy of the United States. <br>
<br>
<br>
These people have been around for a long time, but only in the 1960s did they begin to aquire major influence over American life. They were the kind of people who created the French and Russian Revolutions, and they are now moving towards allying with the kind of people who created the Iranian Revolution, National Socialism and Fascism. Many are still alive, still full of hate, and just as sympathetic to their country's enemies as ever. (Noam Chomsky is just the best known example).<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that Islamic fundamentalism (also called Islamofascism- another blogger term) has emerged as the new main enemy of the West, the West's Left-wingers are siding with them (to become a &quot;Fifth Column&quot; so to speak, just as they were during the Cold War), and they are co-operating on the age-old principle that &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;. One has only to look at the increasing support being given to the Palestinians by the Left in numerous countries in Europe to see how this is happening.<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe that this is the second stage of a war against Western Civilization itself. The first stage, the initial skirmishing if you like, started in the 1930's with the rise of Communism, National Socialism and the growing anti-Semitism of the Middle East. The first major war between barbarism and civilization occurred when Hitler's National Socialists attempted to cast down the West and replace it with a new form of scientificially-backed barbarism that, fortunately, was defeated. <br>
<br>
<br>
The war against Western Civilization was continued by the Communists and carried on through to the end of the Cold War. During this period, the Soviets and the Americans attempted to mobilize the Muslim world in support of their respective ideologies, with varying levels of success. The end of the Cold War saw the end of Socialism in most areas of the world in which it had previously reigned supreme, but the anti-Western coalition that the Soviets had created via their supporters in the universities, news media and trade unions of the West still remained. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, within the confines of the Cold War, another anti-Western alliance had begun to emerge. The Arab world ceased to be a Soviet proxy and became an independent force in world politics, fighting both America and Russia, and continuing to do so in places like Afghanistan and Chechnya. The terrorist attacks aimed at Israel were part of this, as Israel was seen as a &quot;lesser Satan&quot; to the U.S. The Gulf War between Iraq and Iran was a struggle over predominance in the Persian Gulf region, but the Second Gulf War- the US-Iraq one- has mutated into another chapter in the civilizational war.<br>
<br>
<br>
War Against the West Number III<br>
<br>
With the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon on the 11th of September 2001, the first round of skirmishing came to an end. Since then, we have entered the second stage of the war, with the formation of a new grand anti-Western, anti-American, and, of course, anti-Jewish alliance. However disparate the elements of this may seem, they are part and parcel of the same thing- someone who burns an American flag is just as happy to burn an Israeli one as well. They can cause a great deal of damage, if we do not act swiftly against them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Jackboots and Sandals Marching Side by Side.<br>
<br>
<br>
This alliance is a coming together of two distinct groups which, for convenience sake (and with my tongue firmly in my cheek), I will call the &quot;Jackboots&quot; and the &quot;Sandals&quot;. The &quot;Jackboots&quot; are the extreme right wing National (as opposed to International) socialists, with anti immigrant, anti-Semitic, anti-American racists like Le Pen in France, shading over to Jorg Haider in Austria.<br>
<br>
<br>
The &quot;Sandals&quot; (or, if you like, &quot;Sandalistas&quot;, as conservative writer P. J. O'Rourke called them) include feminists, gay activists (not to be confused with ordinary gays), Greens, animal righters, Palestinian worshippers, Cold War Left-overs like Fidel Castro, and academics like Edward Said and Noam Chomsky. I include here the Islamo-fascist anti-Semites of the Middle East, as well as those Muslims elsewhere who have joined the anti-West alliance.<br>
<br>
<br>
While it might seem at first glance that they have nothing in common, I think that recent events in France have demonstrated just the opposite, as I will explain. <br>
<br>
<br>
When America's war against terrorism was joined by Israel's anti-terrorist war in the West Bank and Gaza, it gave the anti-Semites and anti-Americans a new flag to rally around. The extreme nationalist, anti-semitic Right have always had Jews and Americans as enemies. The Left's enemies has always been the same as the extreme Right's, but for different reasons. It is the American and Israeli war against anti-Semitic, anti-American Islamic fundamentalists that has at last brought the Jackboots and the Sandals together, yet, still opposed on other issues.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Left now see the Palestinians as the Vietcong of the 2000's, and Yasser Arafat is their new Ho Chi Minh. In France, Palestinians, gay activists, skinheads and feminists marched to oppose Israel's actions in the West Bank. The &quot;Sandalistas&quot; in America automatically opposed their country's retaliation for the September attacks. <br>
<br>
<br>
The recent elections in France saw a left-wing anti-American Socialist facing unexpected competition from a right-wing anti-American neo-nazi (the crook vs. the fascist, as some argued). thereby also displaying a fundamental internal incoherence. The extreme right in France now supports the Palestinians and Islamic fundamentalists against Israel and the U.S. (while at the same time calling for an end to Muslim immigration!). Similar events are occurring elsewhere in Europe and the U.S.A, a recent and most notable example being the anti-Semitic disturbances at San Francisco State University. These are the West's own barbarians, marching under the &quot;anti-zionist&quot; banner against their own civilization.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Clash with Civilization<br>
<br>
<br>
To reemphasise, the real conflict is not just between civilizations, or even between religions- it is a clash between civilization and barbarism. How did I reach that conclusion? Well, think for a moment about the West's internal opposition. The &quot;Sandalista&quot; wing of the line-up against Western values includes animal rights activists, such as that fine Australian export Peter Singer (who wants votes for apes), and the Greens, who want votes for plants. Both believe that plants and animals are more important than people. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then there are the &quot;Leftovers&quot;, those old Marxists who still believe that the proletariat is superior to the bourgeois. There are gay activists who believe that homosexuals are superior to heterosexuals, and demonstrate this by being as offensive to 'straights' as possible, so that if anyone complains, they can then be dammed as &quot;homophobes&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
There are the multiculturalists, who believe in the superiority of all other cultures over that of the West. We can include the pacifists, such as Helen Caldicott, (another Australian, so I'm told) and human rights activists such as Mary Robinson (Irish, for a change), who believe in the superiority of their own moral virtue. <br>
<br>
<br>
(Pause button- Lest anyone think that I, as a Kiwi, am slinging off maliciously at our Aussie cousins, it ain't so - our equivalents here in N.Z. are people like Nicky Hager, well known pacifist, Jeanette Fitzsimmons, head person of the Green Party, and Nando Taczos, head fruitcake. It's just that Aussie loons are better known, i.e. more notorious, than ours).<br>
<br>
<br>
Let us also include the death-on-demand (the so-called &quot;right to die&quot; euthanasia lobby), and abortion activists. Here we have the National Socialist-type racial supremacists, organizations such as the Palestinian Authority and the obscene anti-Semitism that is the substitute for democratic politics in the rest of the Middle East, Finally, there are newly-emergent Islamic fundamentalists that seeth with loathing and dreams of glory, who hate the West for being everything they are not-rich, powerful, free and non-Muslim.<br>
<br>
<br>
What do these seemingly disparate elements all have in common? Simple- they are anti-human. <br>
<br>
<br>
They are against two things. They are against human accomplishments. Feminists, for example, are against science (too many white males), Islamofascist are opposed to human rights, democracy, and the liberation of women, gay activists are against what they sneeringly call &quot;Judaeo-Christian morality&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
They are also opposed to humanity itself in general. The Greens/animal righters and euthanasia supporters hate humanity as a whole. (Pause button- I've heard of something called the Human Extinction Movement, which name speaks for itself- in other words, Greenery taken to a logical conclusion). All these groups are also opposed to the existence of specific human groups such as Jews, Americans, rich people, white heterosexual males or anyone with an I.Q. larger than their shoe size. As Western Civilization is humanity's supreme creation, the barbarians - by their very nature - are therefore automatically opposed to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Antihuman. That's what these barbarians are. They have nothing but contempt and loathing for everything humanity has achieved, and all that humanity has aspired to. That's what the fight is all about.<br>
<br>
Against The Jackboots and Sandals- The &quot;Wingtip-istas&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just as I am grateful for Mr. O'Rourke for the term &quot;Sandalistas&quot;, I must thank him as well for &quot;Wingtip-istas&quot;- a term he used to describe the sober, serious, straight-laced and most revolutionary force in history - the middle class. These are the people who are manning the defences and enlisting in the armies of Civilization. They are to be found all over the world, they represent all that Civilization stands for, they are made up of members of all the world's religions, and they represent a force that cannot be stopped.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Pause button- a question to any American readers-what exactly are &quot;wing-tips&quot;? Obviously they're a type of formal footwear, as opposed to &quot;loafers&quot; and &quot;dockers&quot;, I suppose, but if I'm going to use this term, a description would be helpful so I have a clear mental image of what I'm talking about- thanks). <br>
<br>
<br>
The war that is unfolding is truly a war for Civilization. The alliance of the Jackboots and Sandals represent the forces of barbarism, and can be found in such places as the madrassas of Saudi Arabia, the offices of the Palestinian Authority, Baghdad, and the University of Berkeley. It includes Muslims as well as atheists, feminists as well as fascists, gays as well as skinheads. They are the people who hate what the West has accomplished and wish to see it and its people destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is, as I have said, not a question of the &quot;West vs. the Rest&quot;. There will be moderate Muslims standing with Christians, Hindus, Jews, Buddhists, Shintoists, Confucianists and so forth, atheists, gays and straights, rich and poor, men and women- all those who believe in being free and civilized values stand in the ranks of the Civilized, they are the Army of Freedom.<br>
<br>
<br>
What the &quot;Wingtip-istas&quot; Stand For <br>
<br>
<br>
The middle class created Western Civilization, and was created by it. This dynamic produced the three great freedoms on which our Civilization rests. These are: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Thought and Freedom of Property. <br>
<br>
<br>
Freedom of Speech gave us Democracy, Freedom of Thought gave us both freedom of conscience, via the separation of the spheres of church and state, and also Science- the freedom to question and to think. Freedom of Property gave us Capitalism-the right to make our own individual economic choices. All of these things gave us civilization, and, in spite of the crimes and tragedies that have occurred, also gave us the best possible hope of human advancement. It is thanks to these values that Western Civilization has become the most powerful (and bourgeois) of them all. <br>
<br>
<br>
Those who have, or those who aspire to Western values and the Western way of life- they are the &quot;Wingtip-istas&quot;. The West has supporters everywhere. Consider this example- a Maasai tribe in Kenya who, having recently been told about the 11th of September attacks, offered to donate 14 cows- by their standards, a considerable amount of wealth- to the United States as a gesture of support. The Maasai understood what tens of thousands of expensively educated westerners did not- that people have a right to defend themselves against those who wish to destroy them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let Battle Commence! <br>
<br>
<br>
Civilization's Armies of Freedom are on the march, and the civilized are standing up to fight. All the barbarians within the West are emerging from the shadows and lining up in such a way as to clearly demonstrate, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that they are indeed the enemies of Western civilization and not merely a dissident part of it. They are joining forces with those enemies outside of the West and the great battle is underway.<br>
<br>
<br>
These people are not just barbarians, they are idiotarians. They live not on another planet, they do not even live in this solar system. This barbarian alliance, as one blogger put it, is the coalescing of all the world's idiocies into a &quot;vast, useless force&quot;. A global Islamic Caliphate, or a world without men, technology or people- these are not realistic possibilities, they are the wildest of delusions. This is what makes them a &quot;vast and useless force&quot;- that in trying to realise their lunatic fantasies, they are placing themselves right where everyone can see them for what they really are, and to treat them accordingly. <br>
<br>
<br>
The barbarians of the West have freely and stupidly chosen to unmask themselves, to cast off all pretence that they care for the environment, &quot;the poor&quot; and the &quot;oppressed&quot;, and the beloved Palestinians. They want to eliminate all the things Western Civilization has built, to cast back into poverty all those whom Civilization has uplifted and to cast into despair those to whom Civilization has given hope. But the armies of Civilization and Freedom are mobilizing and the outcome is not in doubt.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Osama bin Laden's men crashed those airliners into the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, they committed the greatest act of folly in the history of Islam. It was an act comparable to the attack on Pearl Harbour, described by it's architect, Admiral Yamamoto, as bringing about the &quot;awakening of a dragon&quot;, that scorched Japan from one end to the other. The Islamofascists hoped to bring about an alliance of all Muslims against the West, but although many Muslims have expressed support, no Muslim armies have yet marched on Jerusalem, much less Washington. On the other hand, Osama bin Laden has roused the terrible fury of the United States against Islamic terrorism.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even if a war between the whole of Islam and the West were to come about, the West would still win decisively, for as one commentator noted, the U.S. by itself could take on and defeat the entire Muslim world. Furthermore, the West would not be fighting alone, as I do not think that Hindus, Confucianists, Shintoists and Buddhists, not to mention Jews, would care to live in a Muslim dominated world.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He has Loosed the Fateful Lightning of His Terrible Swift Sword&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Islamic fundamentalists and their allies have awakened &quot;Yamamoto's Dragon&quot;, and every act of terrorism they carry out in the future will only strengthen the resolve of the West and bring about even greater destruction to Civilization's enemies. President Bush drew the battle lines clearly- you are either for Western Civilization or against it. <br>
<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that in the battles to come there will be many more &quot;Taliban Johns&quot; i.e. Westerners who will fight alongside the barbarians. Western universities will, as they did with National Socialism and Communism, provide comfort and safe havens for terrorists. Artists and intellectuals will act as propaganda mouthpieces for the barbarians, the news media will pretend to play at being objective while giving the benefit of the doubt to Civilization's enemies. There will be treasons and betrayals, defeats and setbacks but also defections from the enemy's cause, the rallying of allies, advances and victories.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
They cannot win, these barbarians. In choosing to wage war on Western Civilization they are committing suicide, for they will in the end be totally and crushingly defeated. Civilization will win out over barbarism. The Jackboots and the Sandals will be trampled by the Wing-Tips.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat, His truth is marching on&quot;.<br>

I agree it was deplorible that Nixon abandoned our allies the ROC just so he could play the commies off each other.

If the government subsidizes an industry, it soon develops a strong lobby to keep it on subsidies. Once it does that, it becomes a deadbeat industry, feeding off the tax payers. Just look what happened in Britain. The gov. subsidized the coal mine. This included very high tariffs on imported coal, at least, so it was more economical to buy from the overpriced domestic coal mines. To compound problems, the Coal Miners Union(Lobby) was very touchy, and strikes could plunge Britain into blackouts. This would have happened during Thatcher's campaign of privatization, if she didn't order the STATE controlled power plants to stockpile coal. How ironic. <br>
<br>
An even better example was the airline industry in the US. In the 1930s FDR decided to put an end to the boom and bust cycles in the airline industry. An airline regulatory commission is put in place to keep the airlines balanced by regulating fairs. The over objective was to keep prices high. However, they also had to regulate competition every where. At one point they were regulating the size of sandwiches. The new director, I forget his name, concluded that this was enough. After he was done the commission had nothing to do except to shut itself down. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=discovery1>Discovery 1</A> at: 10/16/02 5:48:02 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=55.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=55.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/addreply3.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.threadControl?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub97.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nuclearspacefrm4">Nuclear Power in Space<option value="nuclearspacefrm3">Asteroid Watch & General Astronomy<option value="nuclearspacefrm1">Open Forum<option value="nuclearspacefrm20">Science and Engineering<option value="nuclearspacefrm26">Model Rocketry<option value="nuclearspacefrm25">Energy and the Environment<option value="nuclearspacefrm8">Media, Politics & War<option value="nuclearspacefrm5">Opposition Movements, Myths & Snake Oil<option value="nuclearspacefrm6">Science Fiction and Nuclear Power<option value="nuclearspacefrm19">Employment Classifieds<option value="nuclearspacefrm28">NuclearSpace Media<option value="nuclearspacefrm15">Nuclear Waste<option value="nuclearspacefrm13">The Nuclear Preserve<option value="nuclearspacefrm11">Suggestions Box<option value="nuclearspacefrm27">The Rules<option value="nuclearspacefrm29">What if?</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace>NuclearSpace Message Board</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm5>Opposition Movements, Myths & Snake Oil</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.nuclearspace.com">NuclearSpace Home Page</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
