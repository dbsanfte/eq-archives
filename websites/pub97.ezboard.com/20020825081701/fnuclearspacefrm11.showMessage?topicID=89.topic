Subtitled: NASA’s Need for a Heavy Lift Vehicle<br>
<br>
By Clement Walsh   <br>
<br>
<br>
In the early 1950’s prior to the dawn of the space age, space artists, theorists and engineers had visualized and planed to put into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) a large permanently manned space station. The dream of a large circular space station majestically rotating to provide its own artificial gravity and being utilized as a port of call for Earth and Moon-bound spacecraft was dramatically and unforgettably depicted in the 1968 Stanley Kubrick classic film 2001: A Space Odyssey. While the film may have been overly optimistic in its portrayal of a space station’s size and functions, it has been generally agreed among everyone from governmental NASA officials to civilian space enthusiasts that a space station is a vital first step of many that must follow in possessing the ability to achieving other goals and milestones in interplanetary space. <br>
<br>
Chief advocates of a space station have included such well-known figures as Wernher von Braun. During the Apollo program he had seen his earlier 1950’s inclusive plan for space exploration, which included provisions for an orbiting station, sidestepped by the Kennedy administration’s political goal of putting a man on the Moon. While the Moon race had given us impressive results, the need for a manned orbital station was still an indispensable project to securing an important link between Earth and the greater reaches of interplanetary space. Additionally, because the Saturn V rockets kept coming back as nothing but small scorched capsules, the Apollo missions had left us with little hardware in the national inventory. It seemed that the achievement of a practical space station and the invention of a reliable and reusable heavy–lift booster technology, were inextricably tied together.<br>
<br>
On August 6th 1969 just two weeks from the first lunar landing, von Braun, ever-conservative and always looking towards the future, presented to the presidential Space Task Force his plans for a new Integrated Space Program. The new space program was to begin with a prudently sized space station that was to be called Skylab 1. This was to be followed by a second Skylab station, which unfortunately was cancelled due to the tumultuous political and social times of the early 1970’s. Unlike most of the current aimlessness of NASA’s programs, these manned orbiting stations were to be used as critical waypoints for future goals; namely a permanently manned Moon base and a comprehensive manned mission to Mars. Indeed von Braun had planned for a Skylab to be put into lunar orbit, with a six-man crew by 1975. Another example demonstrating the range of uses von Braun had for Skylab was his idea of employing a crew compartment comparable in size to a Skylab module for a Mars mission.<br>
  <br>
Making the most of the investment in Saturn V technology, the first (and as it as turned out, only) Skylab was lofted into LEO on May 14th 1973 aboard a slightly modified Saturn V, with which engineers had refitted and installed a Saturn S-1VB third stage into what would become the United States first operational space station. Even by today’s standards, Skylab was quite sizeable, at almost 13,000 cubic feet of habitable volume; it was well suited to the needs of its residents. Despite some early mechanical problems, Skylab was a very successful endeavor and was the site of nearly 300 scientific experiments, both technical and medical, on humans’ adaptability to zero gravity.  Unfortunately for Skylab a decayed orbit brought about its destruction in 1979. However, viewed in light of the recent attempts at constructing the International Space Station (ISS), one fact remains clear- that Skylab was put into orbit with a single, solitary launch. There was no need for dozens of shuttle launches, the lapses of time associated with this method and cost overruns that undoubtedly are a direct result. As can be readily observed, the above problems have been very apparent with the construction of the ISS. <br>
<br>
Skylab’s ride into LEO came courtesy of the mighty Saturn V, which was capable of putting 125.5 tons into LEO, whereas the Space Shuttle can only manage a meager 32.5 tons. Indeed, the Saturn V was able to loft a total of 47.5 tons to the Moon, which exceeds the Space Shuttle’s LEO capacity by a full 12 tons. One can only image what could have been accomplished with 5 or 10 Saturn V Skylab-like components launched and assembled together in LEO, as opposed to the Shuttle, which would need several times that many flights and dollars to achieve the same results. It can be said with confidence that NASA’s ability to successfully put large payloads into LEO was significantly greater in the early 1970’s then today.<br>
<br>
Ironically, during this same time period, work was well underway on a space shuttle program. Among the many proposals considered, was the so-called “Shuttle-C” variant, which would have had triple the lift capability of the current shuttle, thus allowing the building of a space station much more efficiently using larger, pre-assembled components. Boeing actually constructed a Shuttle-C test prototype but despite its low cost and high capacity, the Shuttle-C concept was rejected. Today, all that remains of this great “what if” of space history are some dismantled pieces in a Huntsville, Alabama scrap yard. However, after the loss of the Saturn V rocket from NASA’s inventory in the early 1970’s, it has been argued by many that the Shuttle-C still presents the most valid and cost effective route towards recovering America’s heavy-lift capability. <br>
<br>
The Space Shuttle first flew in April 1981, and with its maiden flight, bolder steps into the cosmos flew out the cabin window. The shuttle turned out to be extremely expensive and complex to operate. Together with a smaller payload capacity and an absolute maximum altitude of just 400 miles, it seemed to be a step backwards in the quest of conquering the final frontier. In stark contrast, even the manned Gemini missions of 1965 had gone farther into space, at over 850 miles. Sadly, today, after 20 years and counting since its first flight, the Shuttle remains NASA’s only means of manned space flight. <br>
 <br>
In late 1998, after many years of delays, construction of the ISS finally began with an excruciatingly slow and expensive process we have yet to finish. We now have a station that is grossly over budget, in danger of not being completed and in all likelihood will not have a sufficient crew to carry out valuable scientific experiments it supposedly was designed for. Our lack of a heavy-lift vehicle has come back to haunt us, not only in light of past achievements but also in our attempts at trying to duplicate them.  Originally slated for completion by 2006 that deadline will not be met. Over 30 shuttle flights will have to be flown, each carrying small loads and will cost over 10 times that which was already spent on Skylab. The exact purpose of the ISS is not known and its objectives not clear. In spite of the colossal American investment, we will not even control access because of international partners. Additionally, to the casual observer, the ISS, which will take NASA and its international partners over 8 years to construct, seems to be a direct contradiction of how a space station should be manufactured and assembled. Instead of a smooth operation of large machinery taking shape quickly and in a timely manner, the ISS process has had to deal with many different components form several countries and the issues that arise from this technique. Added to this is the inability of NASA to launch substantial loads to LEO and the problem becomes exhaustive.  <br>
<br>
NASA and America’s need for a heavy-lift booster capability have never been stronger. While appreciably advanced chemical rocket technology does exit today that would meet the bill, it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what the doctor has ordered. Our true salvation lies in developing reliable Solid Core Nuclear Rockets (SCNR). These rocket engines, when applied to the stated goal of a heavy-lift booster, will be indispensable in the development and re-opening of space exploration once more. Everything from a much higher specific impulse, lighter weight of fuel carried, increased thrust to weight ratios and a hereunto-unimagined higher payload capacity would be beneficial. Our primitive steps taken in this direction of nuclear engine research and deployment will push back the restrictions and boundaries of interplanetary space and eventually open up to us the realm of interstellar space travel.<br>
<br>
Before politics began to meddle seriously with American’s space program, we had already successfully demonstrated and ground tested Nuclear Thermal Rockets (NTR’s) under the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications (NERVA) program in the 1960’s and early 70’s. The program produced some surprising and exciting results. To anyone that had or has observed the accomplishments of the NERVA program, the obsoleteness and archaic nature of chemical rocket propulsion has never before been so pointedly demonstrated. During the program engines were tested that delivered impulses of over 800 seconds; this was far beyond the wildest dreams of any chemical rocket engineer. Other engines delivering thrusts between 10,000 and 250,000 lbs were shown to be workable. Indeed, the following types of nuclear engines have been envisioned: Gas Core, Ion Thruster, Hall Thruster and MPD Thruster, the latter having a theorized astonishing specific impulse of 8,000 seconds. Exactly what today’s space-faring world would be like if we were already 30 years into practical NTR’s is anyone’s guess, but the technology is still there, patiently waiting for us to employ it.<br>
<br>
<br>
NASA and America’s requirement for powerful booster technology is crying out like a baby in its cradle. Humanity should not be denied the opportunity to enter the portal of interplanetary space because of shortsighted politicians and misinformed individuals. However, the past is in the past and the time is neigh to mend past errors with the potential the future holds. The human race harnessed the power of the Atom some 60 years ago. It is fully within our reach to utilize this technology, all that is lacking is a visionary plan and solid stated goals. Regardless of what the final outcome may be, if humanity wishes to have a visible presence in space, we had better act soon. Time is too precious a commodity to waste.  <br>

I could have made it 10 or 15 pages but this isn't going to work for a web article.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uzaphod4468.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zaphod4468</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 656<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/22/02 8:19:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/gallery/images/100/zaphod2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;The Article&quot;</span><hr size=1> Shuttle C should be re-evaluated.

I'd like to know, not nessicarily in the article, but somehow, why shuttle C wasn't choosen. I know how hard it is to cut down, my article to begin with was a 20+ page report, and I needed to cut it down to 4 for use here. It took a while, but I think it's now 5, one too big, but I couldn't bear to cut it down anymore. Maybe I'll send the large one into a journal or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uzaphod4468.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zaphod4468</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 657<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/23/02 7:36:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/gallery/images/100/zaphod2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;The Article&quot;</span><hr size=1> From what little I've read on the Shuttle C, NASA said they didn't have a use for it, and the industry was told that if they took the monetary initiative and built it, then the business would show up...<br>

If you build it, they will come attitude.  They decided that was too risky and cancelled the program. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/ubrp17.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brp17</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NEP Freighter Crewman</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/23/02 8:13:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &quot;The Article&quot;</span><hr size=1> Your saying they build a more expensive shuttle so that private business would think it too expensive and stay away?

Yes, good article will use some of the info. in <br>
regards to Orbital lifetimes vs. lift capacity.   <br>
