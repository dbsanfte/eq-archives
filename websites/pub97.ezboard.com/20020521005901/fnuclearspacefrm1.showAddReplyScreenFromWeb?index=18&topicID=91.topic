offense…</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Libertarians tend to have a basic philosophy, and unlike so many others we actually try and abide by it.  Yes, we tend to believe in a minimalist government; not a lack of government, but one that does only what is necessary. We understand the need for a government to tax its population in order to fund itself. We fully support the government enforcing laws to prevent actual crimes (those that deprive people of life, liberty, or property by use of force or fraud).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It is somewhat basic.  Even more basic prehaps then Marxism.  As for trying to abide by it there are some who use deceptive practices like run under a different party to get in like creationalists who hide the fact that they actually believe in Genesis as the literal truth.  There are also those that use services provided for by government while evading taxes and basically defrauded everyone else.<br>
<br>
I do however suspect that the majority of libertarians aren't going to break laws for ideology or be dishonest.  Just that some major figures do so or advercate doing so.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We do not support the destruction of the environment. That is a blanket statement that is based on a false assumption. We view the environment, and any destruction of the environment, as a property rights issue.

The most effective method of protecting the environment is regulation.  Being against regulation is being anti-environmentalist unless you have a better method.  Private property rights whilst they can be useful in protecting the environment don't have anywhere near as good a track record as regulation does.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the mass deforestation in third world countries, again we do not support it – but how are we to stop it?

We come across as hypocrites. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Provide alternatives so that they don't have to remove their forests.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do we support the free market – Yes. No better system exists.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Only to some extent.  Markets are great but they do need to be regulated.  Usually a lot more then most libertarians claim.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I feel many of our arcane laws that create Corporations as entities (leaving the board members and stockholders with little or no liability for corporate misdeeds) are wrong and should be changed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Limited liability should really be removed.  If a company goes bankrupt but the board aren't at fault then I don't really see the point of punishing them but if the board mismanged it then they should be the ones that suffer the consquences of it.  Right now it's the workers and shareholders that suffer when a company is mismanged (usually the workers suffer more).<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It would be a vastly different world if the Ford could be held accountable for the diseases caused by auto pollution (i.e. – the massive increase in asthma).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Or regulations requireing cars to reduce pollution could be passed.  Give them 5 years to comply and if they don't then fine them a billion dollars a year until they comply.  That would also do.  The problem with holding a company liable for pollution is that determine the value of the damages is very hard and often it isn't economic damage but loss of lifespan.  Preventing the pollution in the first place is better then letting people die so taht someone could be sued later.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think the best argument against Libertarianism is it is somewhat utopian.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's a good argument against it.  But the argument about it not being workable is even better.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Libertarians tend to believe that people will play fair, and we all know they wont.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If people don't play fair then it probably will never work.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But as far a utopian ideals go, Libertarianism is a pretty benign one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now it is.  But I would not be suprised if Libertarianism becomes the next communism.

It's just the best one we know of. Sure it may have problems but it works better then all the alternatives we know of.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well, in 1383, oppressive monarchy was the 'best alternative we knew of', so does that mean that it is the way to go?  You still haven't dealt with the argument that an appeal to authority is a logical fallacy and proof of nothing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The point is about how well it works. Not about whether it satisifies some extremist ideology.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Failed completely to address what I said.  Just because we can produce a net benefit does not mean it is OK.  How about another example?  Instead of killing 20,000, we'll just steal the healthy organs of 80,000.  Those 80,000 can 'afford' to give up those organs, right?  That is A-OK to take, in that case!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> OK. So now that we've gotten to the point at which it has been stated that it won't hurt the economy (although that really doesn't matter all that much) we can get to the effects on people. The rich can afford to lose a bit of extra money while the poor can not. Besides you're in a democracy so whether you like it or not you'll have to cater to the majority. Don't do that you get your head chopped off.<br>
<br>
Democracy doesn't produce truth, but it does produce peace.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
OK, here you have just defended the two points that I have only claimed are irrelevent.  First, the end result of it economically and on people.  I don't care.  What I do care about is my 'extremist ideology' of equal treatment under the law and individual property rights.  Second, the idea that the majority must be right.  You hit the nail on the head when you said that 'democracy doesn't produce truth.'  It doesn't, but in this case you are trying to argue that it does.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's very easy to look at the situtation in such a way that shows the rich to be robbers who steal from their workers by not paying them the full value of their labour.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
No.  Simple economics says otherwise.  The system you would thus promote is necessarily a communist one, and a free market it out of the question.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Afterall what does a poor person need with an organisation to overthrow foreign democracies?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What does a rich person need a public hospital for?  Or public education?  But that isn't really the point.  Desert Storm wasn't only protecting the rich, it was protecting everyone's oil supply.  Letting Iraq's actions go unchecked would have a serious effect on everyone, poor included.  In fact, based on your argument about what they can afford, it protected the poor MORE than the rich.  A 50 cent increase in case would be proportionally more for a poor person than a rich person.  The military should be soley financed out of the little man's pocket, eh?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> LOL. Taking money from those who can't afford it is a bad idea. The follow the money argument basically says take the money from those that can afford to lose it. It's quite a good way to do things.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The point here is that if the government services shoudl be paid for by those who use them, than welfare recipients should be the highest taxed people.  Proof that the 'follow the money' idea is a bad one.  Proof that you are wrong.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I have two suggestions.  First, stick with the argument you are dealing with, and don't jump onto a new topic.  When I propose protecting property rights, don't tell me that economic analysis doesn't support it, because that statement <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DOES NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> deal with my argument.  Your post was littered with that.  Second, stop telling me what is and isn't viable.  The closest we have ever come to a libertarian society is in the early days of America, through most of the 1800s.  So did America fall apart during that period?  No.   <p>Scoobaru

<br>
As for the philosophy of Libertarians being very basic, you are correct. Libertarians tend to be highly individualistic, and organization is not our strong suit – Collectivists are much better at that. So, any unifying principals we have tend to be very basic; even then we vary. Another Libertarian would probably have a completely different definition.<br>
<br>
Any philosophy, doctrine, or idea taken to extreme is dangerous. Libertarianism could be dangerous if it were to suppress all other options and allow now dissention – a highly unlikely thing. <br>
<br>
Regulation is a form of law, and I have no philosophical opposition to reasonable regulation. However, you have to think things through. Lets take your idea about requiring auto manufacturers to reduce pollution. Taking a chance that I might slip on a logical fallacy here, what if they comply but the cars now double in price because of the new required pollution controls. Sales might drop, forcing them to lay off employees. The poor would not be able to afford the new cars, so they would have to continue to use the more polluting, older vehicles – unfairly subjecting them to higher exposure to pollution. I guess you could mandate people into having to replace their older cars, but again this would unfairly affect the poor. We could cap the price the companies could sell them for, but if we do that and they cannot make a reasonable profit then they may very well get out of the business; at the very least people would not be as likely to invest in said company. <br>
<br>
As for the deforestation issue, well duhh! Of course if we should provide alternatives. Gee, problem solved! It was so simple, just provide alternatives! <br>
Like what? Ah, there is the problem. Damnit, and I thought we had this one licked. <br>
<br>
Have you read Ayn Rand? Do you know anything about her, other than she is the evil progenitor of Objectivism and that damn book (which I think should be required reading)? I can see disagreeing with her conclusions. There is even a valid argument that she wasn’t that original, just taking ideas that were already out there (like that is a crime). I can see disliking her personally (which, based on what I know of her, I would. I do not like “Guru’s”). But not intelligent, no – you are wrong. Calling someone stupid because you do not agree with them is a sign of a weak argument on your part.  <br>

Actually.  The present state of economics is that progressive taxes are the best we know of.  If you want to dispute that you better provide proof.  I don't have to prove anything until you've done some proof.<br>
<br>
Those that thought that oppressive monarchy wasn't the best system tried out their own ones.  Some of them ended up failing but democracy worked better then monarchy.  If there were proof that a 'flat' tax rate were the best system then I'd support it.  But until I get shown that proof I won't support it.<br>

There's a big difference between life and property.  They are treated differently by all good governments.  Life is something that usually can not be taken away unless absolutely neccessary (usually only to prevent you killing someone when there is no other way) whereas property is something that a person has which can be taken away if it's neccessary.<br>

Equal treatment under the law is a good idea and individual property rights are also useful but one must realise that property rights can not be absolute.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Second, the idea that the majority must be right.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  It doesn't, but in this case you are trying to argue that it does.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Majorites don't produce truth very well but they produce peace.  Basically what that means is that under a democracy there is a lot less chance of a civil war.  If you bring in a system without majority consent then you'll need a dictatorship with a strong military to keep it in place.  Even then you'll have trouble.<br>
<br>
That's why libertarianism won't work in any country that now exists.  The majority won't let you implement it.  Even if they did the results (which is what matters to most people) will cause the system to be disposed of.<br>
<br>
You might be more interested in the principles then the results, but those that live under the system will be more interested in results.<br>

I'm not promoting a communist system because they have been shown to be unworkable on a large scale (on a small scale they can do pretty well).<br>
<br>
Although many of the arguments Marx came up with against capitalism are actually quite sound although usualy only against the more extreme forms.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  What does a rich person need a public hospital for?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Or public education?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Maybe they've realised that public education is better then private because of the lack of spoon feeding.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  But that isn't really the point.  Desert Storm wasn't only protecting the rich, it was protecting everyone's oil supply. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Right.  So that's why the US goes to war.  To protect it's precious oil?  Haven't they heard of electricity?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  In fact, based on your argument about what they can afford, it protected the poor MORE than the rich.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
An increase in the cost of oil would have reduce profit margains of many companies quite a bit.  Thus affecting the rich more.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The point here is that if the government services shoudl be paid for by those who use them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Government often fills the role of providing services to those who couldn't otherwise afford them.  With some government services (e.g. welfare) if a person is on it couldn't afford to pay for it if they had to.  Proof that privatising everything won't help with poverty.  The poor can't afford to pay so we have the middle class and rich pay instead.  In theory the poor person will also be helped by the government and possibly the private sector to get a job and get off welfare.  In practice a lot of the people who go on welfare are there as transient welfare recipients who might just lose their job for a bit of time then manage to find another one but who couldn't support themselves for the time between jobs.<br>
<br>
Finding a way to pay for government services means find where the money is.  Notice how most businesses allow use of concession cards to get discounts.  Those over a certain age, those who are unemployed and those who are full time students can often get discounts at the expense of those who aren't paying full price.  That's basically how progressive taxes work although they have more divisions.<br>

During the 1800s in the US all the things libertarians hate except income tax were in the US.  although it should be noted that most states had a head tax or property tax that was the equivalent of income tax.<br>
<br>
Sure the federal government back then didn't have anywhere near as much power as today but the states more then made up for the lack of federal tyrany.  You also had slavery back then.<br>

If the reason it's popular is that it's the best avilable then it is valid.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Another Libertarian would probably have a completely different definition.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's one of the ways in which libertarianism is equal to communism.  There were many different varieties of communism which mostly seemed to hate each other just as much as they hated the capitalist pigs.  There are a lot of arguments between the different variants of libertarianism which echo the communist arguments.  A lot of them accuse other libertarians who only slightly disagree of being statists (which is a complement).<br>

The market is very good at making things cheaply if needed.  Regulation in the past has this tendency of not costing anywhere near as much to implement then what industry says it will.  In fact most of the time it costs a lot less then even the EPA say it will.<br>
<br>
This is because companies will often try new technologies and methodologies to allow them to implement the change cheaper once it has become clear to them that their lobbists couldn't provide big enough bribes to stop the legislation.  When CFCs were banned it cost Nortel one million dollars to purchase new equipment that didn't require CFCs.  They end saving four million dollars because the new chemicals were a lot cheaper to buy and dispose of.<br>
<br>
If the car company says it'll double the cost.  The EPA will probably say the cost will go up 20%.  In reality it'll probably only go up 3 to 10% and end up saving money in the long term.<br>

How about managing the forests so they don't get cut down too quickly?<br>
<br>
Where ever wood can be replaced do so.  Instead of burning wood for heat use electricity from a nuclaer plant (we may as well provide it to them).<br>
<br>
It'll take a lot of time and money to do but if the first world wants to lift the third out of poverty we could do it.  Forget about loans to third world governments.  They'll probably just go to some military there used to oppress the population.  Instead you want to make sure the money goes to the people of the country.  If it's a democracy then it shouldn't be too much of a problem provided it really is a democracy.  No structural adjustments like what the World Bank requires.  They're not really doing any good for the people of the country (those that matter) instead they're just providing companies with a place to do whatever they like.<br>

I find it a bit disconcerting that you dismiss “Atlas Shrugged” without having reviewed it yourself. As I stated earlier, I think it should be required reading. As for its reviews, it gets quite a few positive ones – people either love it or they hate it, there is very little middle ground. Honestly, I don’t expect you will like it. We all have our biases, and I expect you will think the book drivel. Still, know thy enemy!<br>
<br>
Self-interest was repudiated? By who, and when? <br>
<br>
Here are the four basic principles of Objectivism, as defined by Rand:<br>
<br>
1. Reality exists as an objective absolute - facts are facts, independent of man's feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.<br>
<br>
2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.<br>
<br>
3. Man - every man - is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.<br>
<br>
4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church<br>
<br>
As for her not being as intelligent as the Objectivists like to make her out to be – of course. People always try and elevate their leaders. A lot of people who supported Clinton still pretend he is a moral and honest man when, as we know, he is a sleazebag. Just because someone is a nasty individual does not make the wrong. Oh, if only the world were that easy.  <br>
 <br>
I agree about providing nuclear power to the third world, unfortunately our government’s fear the technology would be used to produce weapons. If we elevate everyone’s standard of living, the desire for conflict will diminish and we would all benefit. Fear stand in our way.<br>
<br>
Most deforestation in the third world is not for fuel, but for land. They need grazing and farm land to support their exploding populations. They have access to the benefits of the first world (medicines, etc.) that greatly reduce mortality without actually changing their basic culture – they breed like bunnies. This is a good survival trait if you have a limited lifespan, but it is becoming a problem now. The deforestation is just a symptom of our population explosion.  <p>Dr. Carstairs</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uprojectorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>projectorion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nuclear Renaissance Man</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(3/16/02 5:18:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Usa/Tests/Rwmohawk2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~projectorion/ezboard/posticons/16.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rand</span><hr size=1> So many benefits to the third world and our own are being blocked by this fear of weapons development. In truth our fear is making the problem worse. Aswell as deforestation we face an escalating greenhouse effect from fossil fuels. Turning our backs on atomic power has given the rest of the world several decades to catch up with us. Other countries don't always share our nuclearphobia and are prepared to begin their own reactor programs. With or without our help. The likelihood of an accident would be lessened if we lent our experience.<br>
Instead we threaten trade sanctions and worse. Trying to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle is so comically futile. Even the US doesn't have that kind of muscle internationally and the more they try, the more determined many nations will become to share in this advanced technology. Why should only a select group of nations be entitled to the benefits of cheap electricity and weapons of mass destruction? <br>
India never signed the treaty America waved at them yet they were still punished for daring to resist US demands. A European country was recently given a similar ultimatum for daring to want their own reactor. All these countries have chosen not to be bullied. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your real problem is that you have no original thought.

The ideal solution would be an idiot tax. A jury of logicians, scientists, and other rational thinkers, presided over by a Secretary of Common Sense, would decide what is and what is not a rational idea. The notions that flunked would not be banned, but a tax would be assessed on anyone who publicly advocated them. The tax would be graduated on the basis of just how far from evidence and logic the idea was, and how much harm it would do if taken seriously. Thus, belief in leprechauns would be in the range of thousandths of a percent, while moon hoax claimants would face 100% confiscation.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/ubestonnet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bestonnet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fusion Starship Captain</span><br>  Posts: 349<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(3/18/02 1:55:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~projectorion/ezboard/posticons/16.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rand</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    &quot;Progressive tax is the best because it works.&quot; How do we know it works? &quot;Well, everyone uses it because it is the best.&quot; You are not making an argument, you are making an idiotic assertion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

George Washington didn't spend his life sinking cargo ships.  Instead he actually took on a military.  Attacking cargo ships sending things that are needed to live (quite a lot of the cargo's would have probably been food) is something which should never be done (military supplies maybe sink it, but if it's known to be only peaceful cargo then it shouldn't be shot at).  Piracy is something that is banned under international law (uprisings of coruse aren't really banned under international law, if you can get beligerant status then you actually get some protection).<br>

<br>
Okay, on to the critiques you provided.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://victoria.tc.ca/int-grps/books/techrev/bkatshrg.rvw">Mr. Slade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> was certainly very critical, and obviously has an ideological opposition to the book. He attempts to link Objectivism to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/index.html?http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/fascism.html">Fascism</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, a patently ridiculous claim. Fascism is not a right wing or conservative philosophy. Most often, statements attempting to link something to fascism (or <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/index.html?http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/communism.html">Communism</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->) to something or someone are shallow attempts at demonization. On that same line, he constantly uses the term ‘Geek’ for some reason.<br>
<br>
He makes statements that I can find no supporting evidence of. He states “…nature. She hates it”, based on her appreciation of the work on humans. Also, he contends that if a passenger train was on the main line it would be hit by a freighter carrying needed medicine – where the hell did that come from? <br>
<br>
Raliroads - why didn’t Rand discuss other obvious transportations? Could it have been because the main character ran a railroad, and from her perspective it was the most important thing? No, it must be she was ignorant and lazy! <br>
<br>
As for Galt’s motor, well the book was Fiction (borderline SF), and his engine was supposed to get it power from (as I understood it) ambient electricity in the air. Hell, the way it was described it might have pulled power from the earth’s magnetic fields – how dare fiction not be perfect in its depiction of new technologies! The sonic weapon (I believe it was called ‘Harmony’ used the newly developed Rearden Metal) didn’t damage the transmitter because it was made of the new metal (previous attempts had all destroyed the transmitter), and it was finally destroyed when it was aimed at itself and destroyed the facility.<br>
<br>
But enough of this review, how about <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.skeptic.com/02.2.shermer-unlikely-cult.html">Mr. Shermer’s</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> – I found nothing to disagree with here. He is correct; Rand did become something of a cult leader (‘Guru’), and was probably a nasty witch.<br>
<br>
Here are a few quotes I consider key here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Criticism of the founder of a philosophy does not, by itself, constitute a negation of any part of the philosophy.<br>
<br>
Ayn Rand has probably influenced my thinking more than any other author. I have read all of her works, … even read the Brobdingnagian Atlas Shrugged no less than three times, plus once on audio tape for good measure. Thus I am not a blind critic. (Some of Rand's critics have attacked Atlas without ever reading it, and Objectivism, without ever knowing anything about it. I have encountered many of these myself. Even the pompously intellectual William Buckley spoke of the &quot;desiccated philosophy&quot; of Atlas, &quot;the essential aridity of Miss Rand's philosophy,&quot; and the tone of Atlas as &quot;over-riding arrogance,&quot; yet later confessed: &quot;I never read the book. When I read the review of it and saw the length of the book, I never picked it up.&quot; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Nothing could be more irrational</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.) I accept most of Rand's philosophy, but not all of it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And, with that, I close my argument on Atlas Shrugged, unless someone else wishes to continue it. You will either read it or not, love it or hate it. <br>

The way she responded to critisim probably did cause her to be disregarded by the academic community.  Which would explain why they woulnd't take what she wrote seriously.  It wasn't up to academic standards which whilst it doesn't automatically make it wrong it does make one wonder why she didn't write something of academic standard.  Afterall if she were as intelligent as she claimed it should have been no problem to do.<br>
<br>
Probably the worst thing about debates on libertarianism is that most of the detailed literature on it was written by its proponents so there isn't all that much on it that was written by those who don't follow it.  Other political systems have had a lot written about them by all sides.  Although most people in academia who know something about politics or economics tend to disregard most libertarian thought.<br>

Hitler's party was called national socialist but that doesn't make fascism a variant of socialism.  Just like calling East German the &quot;German Democractic Republic&quot; didn't make it a democracy or a Republic.<br>
<br>
To determine whether a belief is socialism one has to actually examine the tenants.<br>
<br>
Now under the nazi party in Germany trade unions, collective bargaining and right to strike were taken away.  Employers were given a lot more power over their employees.  Government control of the economy was your average war economy, the same one used by pretty much everyone in war.<br>
<br>
As for most of Hitler's other beliefs, they're a lot closer to those of your average right wing wacko then your average left wing wacko.<br>

Republics – one of my pet peeves, I cannot stand it when people say, “We live in a Democracy.”<br>
<br>
We do not, damnit! <br>
<br>
Republics are a form of Democracy, but which would you rather live in – a true Democracy or a Republic? <br>
<br>
Saying we live in Republics is more accurate. Saying we live in a Democracy may be technically true, but it is sloppy – like simply saying plutonium instead of plutonium-238, or calling a human a primate.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Great Germany on the basis of the principle of self-determination of all peoples. <br>
<br>
2. We demand that the German people have rights equal to those of other nations; and that the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain shall be abrogated. <br>
<br>
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the maintenance of our people and the settlement of our surplus population. <br>
<br>
4. Only those who are our fellow countrymen can become citizens. Only those who have German blood, regardless of creed, can be our countrymen. Hence no Jew can be a countryman. <br>
<br>
5. Those who are not citizens must live in Germany as foreigners and must be subject to the law of aliens. <br>
<br>
6. The right to choose the government and determine the laws of the State shall belong only to citizens. We therefore demand that no public office, of whatever nature, whether in the central government, the province, or the municipality, shall be held by anyone who is not a citizen. <br>
We wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness. <br>
<br>
7. We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the Reich. <br>
<br>
8. Any further immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who have entered Germany since August 2, 1914, shall be compelled to leave the Reich immediately. <br>
<br>
9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties. <br>
<br>
10. The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all. <br>
Therefore we demand: <br>
<br>
11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished. <br>
<br>
12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits. <br>
<br>
13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts. <br>
<br>
14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries. <br>
<br>
15. We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions. <br>
<br>
16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities. <br>
<br>
17. We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land. <br>
<br>
18. We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race. <br>
<br>
19. We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law. <br>
<br>
20. In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State. <br>
<br>
21. The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young. <br>
<br>
22. We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army. <br>
<br>
23. We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. In order to make possible the creation of a German press, we demand: <br>
(a) All editors and their assistants on newspapers published in the German language shall be German citizens. <br>
(b) Non-German newspapers shall only be published with the express permission of the State. They must not be published in the German language. <br>
(c) All financial interests in or in any way affecting German newspapers shall be forbidden to non-Germans by law, and we demand that the punishment for transgressing this law be the immediate suppression of the newspaper and the expulsion of the non-Germans from the Reich. <br>
Newspapers transgressing against the common welfare shall be suppressed. We demand legal action against those tendencies in art and literature that have a disruptive influence upon the life of our folk, and that any organizations that offend against the foregoing demands shall be dissolved. <br>
<br>
24. We demand freedom for all religious faiths in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or offend the moral and ethical sense of the Germanic race. <br>
The party as such represents the point of view of a positive Christianity without binding itself to any one particular confession. It fights against the Jewish materialist spirit within and without, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our folk can only come about from within on the pinciple: <br>
<br>
COMMON GOOD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL GOOD <br>
<br>
25. In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations. <br>
The formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states. <br>
The leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives. <br>

<br>
I assume these constitute the basic beliefs of Fascism. <br>
<br>
If you replace all references to German peoples with “the People” then points 1,2,5,6,9,10,18, fit with Conservative views.<br>
<br>
Points 3,4,7,8,19,22,23,24 are no longer relevant points, or they are insane.<br>
<br>
Socialism agrees with points 7,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,21,24,25<br>
<br>
Points 7 &amp; 24 are both in irrelevant and Socialist (because part of the point is irrelevant, part fits Socialism) – thus I remove them from the tally.<br>
<br>
Conservative/Fascist agree: 7 Points<br>
Socialist/Fascist agree: 11 Points<br>
