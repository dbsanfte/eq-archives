They convey a belief in their own superiority that often leaves us imperfect earthlings feeling humiliated, immobilised, and helplessly angry. Know-It-Alls come in two main varieties, Bulldozers and Balloons. Both communicate with others as if they know everything there is to know. The difference is that Bulldozers do, indeed, know a great deal, while Balloons don't. In this thread we'll consider how to cope with Bulldozers.<br>
<br>
Bulldozers.<br>
<br>
Let's listen in on Sid, a personnel technician, complaining about his boss, Virginia Dorne:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   There is just one way to do things around here:her way. You do it on her time schedule, you do it only in the manner she would do it, and you'd better know what it is. She doesn't want suggestions or to hear what you have to say. Just don't upset her with facts or with questions about whether the plan will work. It doesn't matter how much experience you've had with that kind of payroll system or that you know some of her ideas won't fly. All she seems to want you to do is shut up and pay attention. But if anything does go wrong, you can bet that it's you who weren't listening properly. Or else she goes slamming into her office and won't speak to anyone until she's worked out some elaborate explanation of what happened. Actually, 80 percent of her ideas are good ones, and I've learned a lot. But when she is wrong, it's a lulu. Setting things straight afterward sometimes takes months.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The Behaviour.<br>
<br>
Virginia Dorne typifies the essential qualities of those very tough customers, the bulldozing, Know-It-All Experts. Bulldozers, as that name implies, are highly productive people, thorough and accurate thinkers who make competent, careful plans and then carry them through, even when the obstacles are great. They exude a feeling of power and personal authority and a self-sustaining quality that bespeaks the fact that they need others very little, if at all.<br>
<br>
If these individuals are such gems of productivity, why are they such difficult people to cope with? If you have ever found yourself teamed up with a Bulldozer as co-worker, supervisor, or subordinate, you know the answer. Here are the reasons I've come across most frequently.<br>
<br>
(1) There is a tone of absolute certainty, of sureness beyond mortal doubt, that, often without conscious intent, leaves others feeling like objects of condescension.<br>
<br>
(2) Most frustrating of all is that these insufferable paragons of logic usually turn out to be absolutely right. Thus, they often leave others feeling inept, confused or stupid.<br>
<br>
(3) Bulldozers not only make their associates feel resentful, they also often elicit resistant, self-defeating behavior from them. For example, a group of engineers, as an act of protest, took to sending their reports to their bulldozing supervisor written carelessly in longhand on yellow-ruled note pads. &quot;Why should we try to do good work,&quot; they explained. &quot;Every report that goes up, no matter how carefully prepared, comes back covered with notes that tell us how lousy it is. So we rewrite it and it comes back again, sometimes four times. We got so tired of the secretaries yelling at us because they had to retype the reports so many times.&quot;<br>
<br>
(4) Bulldozers leave little room for anyone else's judgements, creativity, or resourcefulness.<br>
<br>
(5) Once they set out to implement a plan of action, they are devilishly hard to dissuade, even when their plan appears to others to be headed for failure. Therefore, while Bulldozers are indeed usually correct, when they're wrong, it's often a disaster for everyone concerned.<br>
<br>
(6) Finally, when things go wrong, they often see the fault as lying with those incompetents (like you and me) who were responsible for carrying it out.<br>
<br>
Not all experts are Know-It-Alls. Experts are people who know a great deal about a particular topic and can use that knowledge to solve practical problems. They are often people of impressive humility. I have known a few whose competence was almost overlooked because they refused credit for successful group projects that were mostly theirs in conception and realization. The difference between plain, nondifficult experts and Bulldozers lies in the way they communicate their knowledge.<br>
<br>
Since Bulldozers feel oracular, they see little need to listen to anyone else's facts or knowledge. They, you see, already know the best way to proceed. Thus, they respond with irritation, outright anger, or withdrawal to differing opinions, seeing them as personal contradictions rather than simply other interpretations of fact. When questioned about their ideas or plans, Bulldozers dump a profusion of detailed facts and elementary logical arguments on their questioners, leaving them feeling completely deluged or impatient. Worse, the data are often only marginally pertinent to the questions that were raised. In order to cope effectively with this avalanche, and the Bulldozer's superior attitude in general, we need to look more closely at what makes members of this species behave as they do.<br>
<br>
Understanding Bulldozers.<br>
<br>
Can you recall the way your parents sounded when they were telling you what you didn't know? &quot;Put that knife down! Do you want to cut yourself?&quot; &quot;If you'll hold the bat off your shoulder a little more, Sonny, you'll get a better swing--thatta boy!&quot; &quot;You'd better wear your raincoat, it looks like rain.&quot; Nothing differentiates children from their parents more than their unequal knowledge about the practical aspects of getting along in life. Parent's don't simply think they have superior knowledge, they do, in fact, know more about what is safe, about what is likely to pay off and what is not, about almost anything their four-year-old kid is likely to encounter. Even the child's feelings are often more understandable to parents than to the child who has them.<br>
<br>
For some children that parental aura of certainty about what is, and what's to come, represents security in a world that often feels unfathomable and inconsistent. For these children, the motivation to acquire facts and to develop orderly frameworks in which to fit those facts is particularly strong. The lesson for them is: Know for sure what the facts are; know for sure how they will fit together-then, and only then, can you feel secure.<br>
<br>
It is in this way that people are inclined, sometimes driven, to become experts, and what a constructive response to a wish for security it is. The problem for all would-be experts is that much of the world is very hard to nail down. &quot;Facts&quot; are percieved differently by different people. Opinions about what those facts mean vary even more. In the face of this pervasive ambiguity, some of us abandon any efforts to systematize our perceptions and simply respond to whatever turns up next. Others haven't abandoned these efforts, but have learned to live with or even enjoy ambiguity and the seeming tentativeness of all knowledge. Still others, those Difficult People we are trying to understand here, just can't stand such uncertainty and strive even harder to impose their own order on everything they can. Their certainty that their theories, facts and procedures are correct makes sane a world otherwise too unpredictable to contemplate.<br>
<br>
The basis of a Bulldozer's stability is that tightly held knowledge which, given a changing world, constitutes the only bedrock available. It is therefore not surprising that an attack on the accuracy of that knowledge bites deep. It strikes not only at the substantive matter under discussion, but also at deepest levels of personal motivation. Thus, when the plan goes awry, the first line of defense is the ineptitude of others. When that line does not hold, and the cracks in that wall of logic must be faced, the emotional impact can be catastrophic.<br>
<br>
Complainers and Negativists feel that the forces that affect our lives are largely out of their control. Bulldozers are the opposite. Their early life experiences led to their construction of a world in which they always got what they deserved. Unequivocal praise or blame from parents plus a sense of their own ability to affect things by careful planning and follow-through led easily to the belief that if good or bad things happen, they, not fate or luck, are the cause.<br>
<br>
Given such strong needs to feel sure of their own notions of reality and to depend upon their own efforts, small wonder that Bulldozers spurn the ideas and conclusions of others. And each time the Bulldozer chugs firmly and methodically to a planned objective, the security that comes from being self-directing, self-sustaining and unneedful of others is reinforced.<br>
<br>
Coping.<br>
<br>
The central strategy in coping with Bulldozers is to get them to consider alternative views while carefully avoiding direct challenges to their expertise, lest they take your recommendations as personal attacks on 'them'. Four basic steps are involved: make adequate preparations; listen and acknowledge; question and suggest, dont challenge; and monitor your own tendencies towards bulldozing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uprojectorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>projectorion</A> at: 8/31/02 9:38:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=discovery1>Discovery 1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Space Tourist</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/31/02 2:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/7.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re:Coping with 'Know-It-All' Experts.</span><hr size=1> How do you deal with &quot;Balloons,&quot; since they are probably more numerous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uprojectorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>projectorion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nuclear Renaissance Man</span><br>  Posts: 1990<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/31/02 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/7.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re:Coping with 'Know-It-All' Experts.</span><hr size=1> Balloons: Those Phony Know-It-All Experts.<br>
<br>
Balloons, in comparison to other types of difficult people, are usually minor league headaches. Once you are on to them, phony experts can even be likable. You can, with deliciously patronizing fondness, let them pontificate about subjects they clearly know little about. Just pay them the attention they seek and feel benevolent about having done such a good deed.<br>
<br>
When Balloons are not in positions of influence, most people feel only mild irritation, impatience or embarassment when forced to deal with them, not the anger of frustration attributed to other difficult people. &quot;Should I stop this guy from misleading everyone?&quot; is the usual internal question that arises.<br>
<br>
When Balloons are influential people, however, their interweavings of reality with speculation and wish can lead to real trouble. They will propose a course of action based upon plausible but false assumptions which, given their authority or charisma, may just be acted on. The result: a confused waste of energy and the dilution of everybody's sense of purpose. A near disaster brought on by a Balloon in power was described to me by a new personnel director.<br>

Willis Schaefer, our former boss--a very competent technical personnel man, by the way--decided after hearing a lecture on the subject that we needed an employee counseling program. He proceeded, all by himself, to work up a presentation for top management. It was a silly, superficial plan that would have cost a fortune and gotten us into trouble with the union to boot. But he talked so knowingly to the big boys about it that even before the plan was formally presented, they were ready to buy it. Thank God he was hired away by another company and the whole scheme evaporated.<br>
Why didn't one of us blow the whistle? Two reasons, I'd say. First, when he came back from that lecture and talked about employee counseling we were all for it. The plant needed something along that line. Then, before we could do anything, he was telling very important people just how it ought to be done. It was so wrong that anything we could have said at that point would have made him out to be a fool.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There, elegantly laid out, is the basic Balloon coping problem. How do you make sure that the Balloons unworkable idea will be quashed without making him or her out to be either a charlaton or a fool? After all, nothing is easier than devastating phony experts. A loud and &quot;Baloney!&quot; backed by accurate and documented facts, will penetrate the cover and expose them as imposters. Tempting as it is in fantasy, this is rather tough medicine, especially if you need to work or live with these folks. Here's an equally effective and much kinder approach. It has the added advantage that, if you happen to be mistaken and your Balloon turns out to be a Bulldozer, you will not get mashed.<br>
<br>
State the Facts as an Alternative Version.<br>
<br>
As in the direct kill approach, the first step in coping with Balloons is to give a descriptive statement of the facts, as you believe them to be. But instead of shouting &quot;Baloney&quot; (or it's earthy equivalent), present your data as an alternative set of facts rather than the only set.<br>
<br>
Give the Balloon a Way Out.<br>
<br>
Provide your Balloon a face-saving vehicle, because at the moment of truth (here meant literally) he or she will be immobilized. The presence of a real expert suddenly brings to full awareness the shakiness of the ground on which the phony has been walking. The probability of a disastrous loss of face, on the other hand, will reduce the Balloon to the most elemental kind of defensive behavior.<br>
<br>
Let's see how this works with an example.<br>
<br>
CARL:<br>
 There's no question about it, Steve, that rattle in your Cyclone's rear end is a bearing. It couldn't be anything else. Don't let those guys try to sell you an axle replacement job. Cyclone axles last forever. I've never heard of one having to be replaced.<br>
<br>
STEVE:<br>
Well, the guy at the garage said he thought something might have gone wrong with the axle housing and it was maybe eating into the...<br>
<br>
YOU (an Expert on Cyclones):<br>
You know, Carl, that fits with some things that I've been reading about Cyclone axle problems. It's possible that too great a strain on the frame, from pulling a trailer, say, can throw the axle housing out of line. I wonder if you could be thinking about those Cyclone axles prior to ‚P972. I think the situation may have been different then.<br>

<br>
CARL:<br>
Oh, yeah...maybe that's what I was thinking about.<br>
<br>
YOU:<br>
I don't think that repair job will cost you more than $250, Steve.<br>

Alone is Better.<br>
<br>
My experience with Balloons is that facing them with the facts is more easily done without company. Helping anyone save face is far simpler when it's only your opinion that is at stake. You may wish, however, to come prepared with a handy suggestion about the Balloon's public announcement of the state of the treasury (which you've just shown to be grossly incorrect) might be handled with a minimum of embarassment. I know it's tempting to let them suffer, but...<br>

NOSHIP was an example of a Balloon who visited this board while I was away a few days. When I arrived back, it was too late to try and salvage anything, although I did try. NOSHIP now sees everyone at NS as his enemy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=371.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=371.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/addreply3.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.threadControl?topicID=371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub97.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nuclearspacefrm4">Nuclear Power in Space<option value="nuclearspacefrm3">Asteroid Watch & General Astronomy<option value="nuclearspacefrm1">Open Forum<option value="nuclearspacefrm20">Science and Engineering<option value="nuclearspacefrm26">Model Rocketry<option value="nuclearspacefrm25">Energy and the Environment<option value="nuclearspacefrm8">Media, Politics & War<option value="nuclearspacefrm5">Opposition Movements, Myths & Snake Oil<option value="nuclearspacefrm6">Science Fiction and Nuclear Power<option value="nuclearspacefrm19">Employment Classifieds<option value="nuclearspacefrm28">NuclearSpace Media<option value="nuclearspacefrm15">Nuclear Waste<option value="nuclearspacefrm13">The Nuclear Preserve<option value="nuclearspacefrm11">Suggestions Box<option value="nuclearspacefrm27">The Rules<option value="nuclearspacefrm29">What if?</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace>NuclearSpace Message Board</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1>Open Forum</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.nuclearspace.com">NuclearSpace Home Page</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3p<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
