&quot;Los Alamos National Laboratory is one of the few institutions that can address the multi-disciplinary problems of advanced propulsion for human exploration of space. We understand the physics associated with these systems. It would be great if history recorded that Los Alamos not only developed nuclear weapons but also developed the technologies that finally enabled human beings to explore space.&quot;<br>

History of Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines.<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.vectorsite.net/taadvsp.html">www.vectorsite.net/taadvsp.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
The idea of using atomic power as the basis for a rocket engine predates the First World War, but at that time neither liquid rocket engines nor atomic power were realities, and these concepts were essentially speculations about speculations. <br>
<br>
However, by the end of World War II, both large liquid-fuel rocket engines and atomic reactors were working technology. In 1946, Douglas Aircraft performed the first formal study of the use of nuclear power for rocket propulsion, followed by a study performed in 1947 by Dr. Hsue-shen Tien, then at MIT. With enthusiasm for space exploration and nuclear power rising in the 1950s and into the 1960s, interest in using &quot;nuclear thermal rockets (NTR)&quot; reached a high pitch. <br>
<br>
Conceptually, an NTR is very simple. A light propellant, usually hydrogen, is pumped through a reactor core, which heats it to high temperatures, on the order of 2,500 degrees Celsius, and spews it out as a high-velocity exhaust. <br>
<br>
<br>
NTR offers twice the exhaust velocity of a chemical rocket, as well as a substantial improvement in propellant mass ratio. However, the improved mass ratio is partially cancelled by the mass of the reactor, and particularly the mass of the reactor shielding. <br>
For this reason, many NTR spacecraft design concepts featured a crew compartment and propulsion system separated by a long truss to allow reduction in shielding mass, while still protecting the crew. A well-known design of such an NTR-based vehicle was the Jupiter spacecraft used in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 movie 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which was meticulously based on 1960s space engineering concepts. <br>
<br>
* In reality, 2001 came and nothing of the sort ever happened. The US Los Alamos National Laboratory performed basic studies on NTR under the ROVER program, beginning in 1955, with the US National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration (NASA) beginning studies of its own in the late 1950s. The first ground test of an NTR, designated &quot;KIWI-A&quot;, was conducted in 1959 by Los Alamos, leading to a formal NTR development program, designated &quot;Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application&quot; (NERVA). NERVA was under the direction of NASA and the US Atomic Energy Commission. <br>
<br>
In 1961, US President John F. Kennedy called for high-priority development of NTR engines as an item in the famous Moon-landing speech, accelerating work on the project. More than 20 prototype NERVA engines were built and successfully ground-tested, with power levels between 40 and 4,000 megawatts, thrust levels up to 100,000 kilograms, and the desired high exhaust velocities. <br>
<br>
NASA was working towards a Saturn V booster upper stage with an NTR engine, and a flight test model of such an engine was under development when the program was cancelled in 1972, after the Nixon Administration cut NASA's plans for manned Mars exploration. <br>
<br>
NTR was revived in the late 1980s as part of the US military &quot;Timberwind&quot; program, which envisioned a high-thrust &quot;particle bed reactor&quot; (PBR), where the reactor core consisted of a bed of spherical, jacketed fuel particles through which hydrogen could be injected, in contrast to the more traditional atomic pile considered in earlier NTR concepts. <br>
<br>
Although Timberwind was a secret program, information leaked about it in the early 1990s led to public controversy. In reality, Timberwind does not appear to have ever been much more than a paper project that did not progress very far towards implementation. <br>
<br>
* NTR still seems very attractive for a manned Mars mission, though worries about the environmental hazards of atomic power impose a heavy political and financial burden on any attempt to actually fly such an engine. While NTR advocates believe that the safety concerns can be reasonably addressed, at the present time there is no active effort to develop an operational NTR engine. <br>
<br>
One NTR advocate, the well-known space engineer Robert Zubrin, has come up with some very original concepts for using NTR engines for a manned Mars mission. In principle, an NTR engine can use any convenient gas as a propellant. The only thing the gas provides is reaction mass, while the nuclear core provides the energy. Propellant gases could include those occurring naturally on other planets. If an NTR-powered spacecraft could refuel itself on Mars for its trip back to Earth, it would not have to be launched from Earth carrying propellant for the return journey. <br>
<br>
The Martian atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide (CO2). Theoretically, CO2 makes a poor NTR propellant. An NTR using CO2 as a propellant would have an exhaust velocity of 2.75 KPS, even less than the 4.5 KPS exhaust velocity of a cryogenic chemical rocket engine, and much less than the 9 KPS exhaust velocity of a NTR using hydrogen propellant, though the heavier mass of CO2 molecules would compensate. <br>
<br>
However, Martian CO2 is free, and at ambient temperatures on Mars it can be liquefied by compressing it to six or seven Earth atmospheres. If there is subsurface water on Mars, it could be used as a propellant as well. A Mars lander with an NTR engine and a simple compressor system would be able to obtain its own propellant for hops over the planet, or a boost back into Mars orbit. Since CO2 or water would break down in the core and release reactive oxygen, the NTR fuel elements would have to be coated with a protective layer of non-corrosive material. <br>
<br>
This scheme, using &quot;indigenous propellants&quot; in Zubrin's term, would eliminate the need for a separate orbiting mother ship and lander, reducing overall mission cost. On return to Earth orbit, the spacecraft could be parked in Earth orbit, and be refueled and resupplied for further Mars missions. <br>
<br>
Zubrin has also envisioned a space probe using a similar propulsion scheme that would explore Saturn's large moon Titan. Such a probe would be sent into orbit on a heavy-lift booster such as a Titan IV, and cruise to Saturn using its NTR engine and hydrogen propellant. <br>
<br>
The probe would be aerodynamic and would have pop-out wings. It would be able to periodically drop into Titan's atmosphere to explore and tank up its NTR engine with methane to allow it to explore the rest of the Saturn system, and even return to Earth with samples. The same approach could be used to explore Jupiter's moon Ganymede, or Neptune's moon Triton. <br>
<br>
* Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have also considered another interesting NTR propulsion scheme, known as a &quot;gas core nuclear rocket (GCNR)&quot;. In a GCNR, hydrogen is pumped into one end of a cylindrical reaction chamber, with an exhaust at the other end. The hydrogen expands as it passes through the chamber, and not all of it goes out the exhaust, instead flowing back up the chamber. <br>
<br>
This creates a toroidal vortex of hydrogen gas that can be used for fission reaction containment. Dust-sized particles of uranium are injected into the toroid and accumulate at its center. A number of long cylinders are mounted on the interior of the reaction chamber outside the toroid. These cylinders normally absorb radiation emitted by the uranium, but they can be rotated to reflect it, initiating a fission reaction. The cylinders are the equivalent of control rods in an Earth-based reactor and were apparently featured in earlier NTR designs. <br>
<br>
Once fission begins in the center of the hydrogen gas toroid, the high temperatures heat the gas into a plasma, which flies out the exhaust at high velocity to provide thrust. A small magnetic nozzle could be used to ensure that the uranium remains in the reaction chamber, while allowing the hydrogen plasma to escape. <br>
<br>
GCNR was considered during the NERVA program, but the approach was clearly beyond the technology of the time. In 1991, Los Alamos sponsored a government-industry workshop on GCNR, and the participants concluded that the computer horsepower and software skills were finally available to perform useful studies and simulations on the approach. <br>
<br>
The Los Alamos studies on GCNR have been theoretical and speculative, and no program to actually develop one is planned. However, the studies have suggested that GCNR could be used to power a manned Mars mission that could reach Mars from Earth in 90 days, half the time required by a more conventional &quot;solid core&quot; NTR-powered vehicle. This would reduce mission cost and exposure of the crew to radiation. <br>
<br>
<br>
We think the space shuttle is fast. Its specific impluse of 462 seconds gives it an exhaust velocity of 4,600 meters per second (m/s). The Kiwi rocket engine had 850 seconds, or 8,500 m/s.  <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>Nuclear power is the next logical step for serious space travel. The technology required to colonise the solar system exists now!
