Looking Forward to the Future After Columbia<br>
<br>
By J------- W-----<br>
<br>
February 16, 2003<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One month ago today, the nation took a few moments to watch the glorious lift-off of the Space Shuttle Columbia.  Although most people were unfortunately oblivious to the event.  The mission - STS-107 - was unusual for two reasons.  First, it was a dedicated science mission.  During the current International Space Station (ISS) construction phase, such missions have become rare, with most science experiments taking place on board the station.  The second reason why STS-107 was unusual (at launch, that is) was because the first Israeli astronaut would be on board.  Six Jews had been in space before, but this would be the first Israeli national.  And it would take place during the ongoing intifada in Palestine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lift-off was surrounded by arguably the tightest security at any Shuttle launch in history.  With the Jews and Arabs killing each other half a world away, the U.S. military building up in the region for an invasion of Iraq, and with the United States still recovering from the attacks in 2001, terrorism was an obvious concern.  But no threats were made against Columbia, and terrorism proved to be of minimal concern.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed less than eighty seconds after lift-off.  STS-51L was a dedicated science mission, too.  Three days prior, my family had bought a 1986 Oldsmobile.  Our vehicle purchasing has closely paralleled Space Shuttle disasters and possibly the future of the manned space program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The ‘86 Olds was built like a bomber.  It was fairly massive and heavy (like the space shuttle), received poor gas mileage, was basically unstable in inclement weather, and it really had no safety features other than seatbelts (again, all like the space shuttle).  It was fairly dependable, though it had seen its days of multiple overhauls.  It was going good.  But it the last year, multiple components had to be replaced.  It seemed to be wearing down, and about to die for good.  98,000 miles had just been past on the odometer.  Would it make it to the goal - 100,000 miles?  I hoped that I could nurse it and keep it together until it passes that critical milestone.  (Sound familiar?)<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seventeen years after Challenger - January 28, 2003  - the STS-107 mission was beginning to come to an end.  Columbia continued to circle the Earth better than fifteen times daily.  Great science data was being recorded, and some of it was being transmitted to the ground.  The mission was proceeding almost flawlessly.  All eighty experiments were completed.  In four days, the Orbiter was slated to make a brilliant re-entry over the southern United States, and then would cap it off with a glide onto Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Life doesn’t get any better than this,” I thought to myself.  One weekend - January 25, 2003, after 3PM Eastern Time, I watched SORCE - the Solar Radiation Climate Experiment - hauled into space by a Pegasus rocket from 39,000 feet, after being dropped by a L-1011 aircraft at that altitude.  It was my first such launch (naturally, I watched it on NASA TV - the media ignored it, as usual).  It was a fascinating concept - to launch from the air.  You save costs by carrying the payload to a specific height in Earth’s atmosphere by airplane, being that the airplane is reusable and has a fast turnaround time, compared with reusable rockets and the Space Shuttle.  A fantastic sight.  I then went out to do some jury-rigging on the ‘86, then came in to watch some live views from Columbia on NASA TV, then some recorded interviews with the crew before launch.  I had watched a lot of coverage of the mission on NASA TV, more than usual.  Still, I regretted not having the opportunity to sight the spacecraft in orbit from my backyard, having a busier life now.  In a NASA TV (NTV) Video File, I watched with awe as I saw clips from the ride to orbit and through the orbit circulation burn, and the beginning of on-orbit operations.  One such clip was astronaut Dave Brown taking a video survey of the recently-released External Tank (ET).  The ET could be seen passing in front of the clouds.  It was a view I had never seen before, of an event that had happened 111 times before.  In only a few minutes, the tank would disintegrate over the Indian Ocean.  Two weekends later, that clip of the ET silhouetted in front of Earth’s clouds would be a very meaningful memory.  That video would take on added significance, and it wouldn’t be the last mention of that specific External Tank.  Not by a long shot.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was personally fascinated by this mission partly because of the participation of Ilan Ramon, the Israeli astronaut, because of my religious beliefs, and because of my attention on current events (terrorism, etc.).  And I was fascinated because I had familiarized myself with the science that was going to be performed on this mission.  I watched with attachment the ants in the SpaceHab module constructing tunnels, much like the Ant Farms I had possessed in my younger days.  I was excited and intrigued to hear that the ants performed better in microgravity, than under the 1g load of Earth’s surface.  Other experiments would have furthered our understanding of science, and improved our life here on Earth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On Friday night, January 31, 2003, I elected not see any of the STS-107 coverage on NASA TV, thinking that it would be too uneventful.  That’s probably true, but I still regret that decision.  I woke up at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the next morning, specifically so that I could watch the landing.  It was supposed to be crystal-clear blue sky - what more can you ask for a shuttle landing?  The re-entry burn has already taken place at 8:15.  They would be home in 59 minutes.  Unfortunately, they would die even sooner.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I finished breakfast at around 8:53.  The Orbiter was just starting to cross over the California coast.  As far as I knew, all was going well.  I then went to get dressed.  I daydreamed a little bit, knowing that nothing critical was going to happen for a few minutes (or so I thought).  I started paying attention to the broadcast again at 9:11 a.m.  I was hearing that the Merritt Island Tracking Antennas were unable to establish a radar lock on Columbia, and that communications had been lost.  That continued to 9:13.  “They’d better reestablish communications soon.  They’re landing in three minutes!” I said to myself, knowing that Shuttle operations are extremely dependant on the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I turned the TV on, pushed the tape in, and hit the RECORD button.  After a few seconds, I realized that there was a major problem.  “NASA loses contact with Space Shuttle Columbia,” the bottom of the screen said.  I was instantly confused.  “Well, where could they be?” I reasoned.  The scheduled landing time had come and gone.  That horrible, eternal fear came into my mind.  I prayed earnestly to God that it would not be so.  I logged onto the Mission Status Center for STS-107 on Spaceflightnow.com.  At 9:19 a.m., I read the report of debris sightings over Texas.  “Maybe something broke off, and they’ll still make it to Kennedy,” I hoped.  I was struggling, trying to process all the information, still unwilling to believe that Columbia had been destroyed.  The horror of it all.  9:22.  9:23.  9:25.  The minutes were ticking away.  That fear was becoming more and more undeniable.  Finally, at 9:27, I read, “NASA says the shuttle was about 200,000 feet up and traveling at 12,500 miles per hour when contact was lost.  From all the reports we’re receiving, it is becoming clear that the shuttle broke apart over Texas.”  The only thing that I could do was mumble “Oh no...  Oh no...”  repeatedly to myself.  It wasn’t just the loss of a very expensive, advanced vehicle, and its crew of seven, that were lost - but was the space program lost, too?  And what of the ISS?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This wasn’t supposed to happen,” is what I said repeatedly to myself that gloomy, rainy Saturday.  Re-entry was about a sure thing as there is in this business.  Now launch is obviously a high-risk endeavor.  You have all that power beneath you.  You are using a controlled explosion to catapult you into space.  You hope that nothing loses structural integrity and that it doesn’t become an uncontrolled release of energy.  But re-entry - you’re just gliding into the Earth’s atmosphere.  Granted, your outer hull is going to be heated up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, but it’s been done so often that it’s a given.  I had no doubt in mind that all of the tiles were on the spacecraft on the launchpad.  Unless you come in at the wrong angle, it should be as automatic as walking down a corridor.  Obviously, re-entry is not as easy and automatic as it seems.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At almost the same time, my car was having trouble.  It would not start, but eventually it was coaxed into starting.  Four days later it died for good.  Three days after that, I purchased another car - a 2003 Saturn.  It is mighty interesting that when we lose a Space Shuttle, we are buying a car within a week of the event.  And to me, the ‘86 symbolizes the Space Shuttle, and the ‘03 symbolizes the proposed Orbital Space Plane (OSP) project.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The ‘03 Saturn features a novel outer body construction design that increases the odds that the frame will survive in a high-velocity collision.  There are airbags.  Traditionally mechanical systems have been converted into electronic to increase reliability and safety.  Parts of the car have been made idiot-proof.  Warning messages will appear when things are going wrong.  The engine is twice as efficient as my old V6 in the ‘86.  I’m not hawking Saturn’s fine product; what I AM doing is explaining the differences between the Shuttle and a next-generation space vehicle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some have said that the Space Shuttle is a virtual deathtrap.  Thus, upgrades have been in progress for several years.  The “glass cockpit” has made it a bit more user-friendly.  Even still, many people will admit that there is risk is using the Space Shuttle.  That no amount of upgrades will make it as safe to fly as commercial jetliner.  I would put forth that space travel is still very risky.  We are still in our infancy in regards to space travel.  111 out of 113 shuttle missions have been completed with no loss of the vehicle or crew.  That’s a success rate exceeding 98%.  In the forty-two years of manned space travel in the United States, only 17 people have been lost (three in the Apollo 1 fire, and seven each in Challenger and Columbia).  Ironically, none of these space travelers died in space.  Three on the ground, and fourteen in the atmosphere.  One could say that we’re OK as far as space travel itself is concerned.  We only have problems getting to space, or coming back.  So shouldn’t we focus on reducing the ever-present risk in ascent and re-entry?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My ‘86 Oldsmobile was upgraded by various degrees several times, but it still eventually died out, just as it approached 98,800 miles on the odometer.  A new vehicle has proven to be more cost-effective.  I no longer have to worry about spinning out of control at 10 mph in drizzling rain (let alone the two feet of snow my area is receiving as I am writing this).  For at least for a while, I won’t be paying my monthly auto repair bill.  The same thing should go for the next-generation manned launch payload, the OSP.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What NASA, and frankly, the world, needs, is a dependable way of getting humans into space at relatively low costs and at faster turnaround times.  A commercial airliner can takeoff on long flights twice in a twenty-four period.  For a Space Shuttle Orbiter, the best turnaround times are 4-8 months.  Part of the reason is that the Shuttle was never designed to be used like this, and for this long.  The Shuttle was built as an interim vehicle that would provide transportation to space, until a real vehicle was ready.  Thirty years later, we are still waiting for that vehicle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Additionally, the Space Shuttle was not designed to be serviced often.  Repairs and replacements are a tricky process.  Also, it does not help that several manufacturers of Shuttle parts have since gone out of business.  If one of those parts is needed, measures as drastic as getting the part off of Ebay are required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Shuttle just isn’t designed to be repaired.  Technicians must climb through the innards of the vessel between flights for months on end.  The goal should be the operation of a Space Transportation System (STS) that runs like an airline, i.e., after you land, maybe you run through a through sensor and visual check, refuel, and then go right back into space.  Replace certain parts at regular intervals.  Unfortunately, since there will be a very small demand for these parts (no mass production), the production price will be quite high.  Unless fleets of OSPs are built.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the keys to a low-cost system is a fully-reusable system.  The Shuttle, although it is often described as a reusable space vehicle, really is not.  A $120 M ET is used and consumed for each flight.  The twin Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are reusable, but they only last between five and ten flights, and cost $40 M each.  The fuel is comparatively inexpensive at less than $3 M.  Compare this all to a base price of $500 M per flight (excluding payloads).  If the fuel costs ($3 M ?) were only ten percent of the turnaround cost ($30 M ?), space transportation would be unbelievably cheap (which for the average motorist, it would be considered an exorbitant price at the same proportions).  For the amount of money that NASA spends on the Shuttle program, around one hundred flights could be flown yearly at such prices.  Of course, you’d have to have a sizeable fleet in order to make that happen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once you have a space launch system that is totally reusable, you have a higher initial cost, but the maintenance costs will significantly decrease.  Earlier I mentioned the Pegasus rocket was ignited in air at 39,000 feet as it hauled the SORCE payload into space.  Perhaps something similar can be built in the not-so-distant future.  Airplanes are probably the most reliable form of transportation, and at 39k+ feet altitude, you are above the thickest part of the atmosphere (above 20,000 feet, there isn’t enough oxygen to safely breathe), meaning less stress on the launch rocket.  Airplanes are almost completely reusable.  If you make the payload (OSP) fully reusable as well, then you have quite a system.  And that is what is required for affordable space transportation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are some incredible technologies that may come on-line in the second decade of the 21st century (this decade will be relatively mundane, as far as launch technology goes).  We might have payloads pushed into space by laser beams, in which almost all of the powerplant is on the ground, which is an extreme cost-saver.  Nuclear reactors in spacecraft will begin to become commonplace, possibly giving way to a nuclear-powered air-breathing rocket.  And advances in nanotechnology may very well help us in the creation of a space elevator, where the main operating cost will be mere electricity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Until then, however, space travel needs to keep going.  A temporary stop may turn into something too permanent.  Death did not stop the pioneers of aviation, and it should not stop the pioneers of spaceflight.  The Space Shuttle fleet needs to be operational again by mid-summer.  The International Space Station needs to be kept operating and manned.  We need the Shuttle to facilitate the finishing of construction of the ISS.  After construction is complete, Shuttle flights should be reduced to two or three flights per year.  The money that would have gone into the cancelled flights should be diverted to OSP R&amp;D.  The Columbia disaster should move us and inspire us to accelerate the development of the OSP.  Sometimes, it’s just best to start with a new vehicle.  That’s what I did last weekend, and it’s what the manned space program needs to do, too.  NASA currently plans to operate the Shuttle fleet to the 2020-2025 timeframe.  Odds are that at least another Shuttle will be lost by then (and I’m being optimistic).  I hope and pray that the reason why the Shuttle fleet will no longer fly someday is because they’ve been retired in favor of an advanced vehicle, and not because they’ve all been destroyed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our focus right now should be to get the Shuttle fleet up and running again.  Then finish construction of the International Space Station.  And then devote all possible resources in the research and development of a new launch vehicle for manned use.  Don’t let the dream of spaceflight die out with the seven astronauts on Columbia.<br>

<br>
Bro. this was a straight-up piece I liked it, plus your analogy to your personal car issue.<br>
<br>
Just one point, from start to finish of any space venture for any astronaut, cosmonaut or space tourist's voyage is a proposition in risk taking but that said, skippers and their crew can't be thinking that the vehicle they command is gonna break-up or explode they normally should be concentrating on the mission.<br>
Confidence is knowing the vehicle your flying is well made, solid and can take some punishment in going<br>
into and out of space and flying the mission in space.<br>
<br>
Just like you pointed out modifications will be made and newer vehicles will flown. <br>
