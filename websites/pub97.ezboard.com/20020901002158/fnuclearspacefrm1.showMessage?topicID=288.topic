Not that it wasn't fun anyway.<br><br>The plan was simple as an idea but as usual proved complicated in practice. Build a remote controlled Zeppelin and drop a payload of flyers onto the big brother house back garden at Dream World on the Gold Coast. All saying 'NuclearSpace.com'. With any luck Peter, Marty or Sarah would pick one up and read it straight into a camera. Live to millions.<br><br>Obtaining the remote control system proved the easiest part, surprisingly. A major hobbyist shop provided me with everything I needed and the staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgable. The instantaneous response time and sensitivity of the systems were very impressive. I only wish I had owned one as a kid. The technology is probably far ahead of what was available back then. After trialling a couple I chose the Futabo Attack controller with 2 servo's included for the bargain price of $110 Australian. I also bought the electric motor and propellor there. Later attaching the motor directly on to a servo with sticky tape rather than mess about with a complex rudder system. For aid in steering, a lunchbox lid fixed to the front was adequate. The battery for the motor balanced it all nearly perfectly. <br><br>I eventually chose 16&quot; balloons each with a carrying capacity of 25 grams. I wanted to get my twin servo's back if possible so I created an elaborate system composed of mainly wire, strings and sticky tape. Pushing forward on one servo remote control closed a circuit and engaged the small electric motor driven propellor. Reverse would release the payload. Full reverse released about half the balloons and brought the mechanism down(theoretically). The other servo was strictly for left and right turning.<br><br>Because balloons don't stay inflated for many hours I decided to fill them only 2-3 hours before driving down to the Gold Coast. I had already picked up the 1.5 litre helium tank on Saturday and rented a regulator aswell. The craft tested fine. I had left right rotation of the motor, on off controls and the release devices all performing perfectly. I made a couple of adjustments (with sticky tape and cotton thread) to ensure that the payload and balloon strings wouldn't get tangled with the propellor at any point. Everything seemed ready. At 4pm I began blowing up balloons. Curiously, the first one I tried was very large. It must have been mixed in with the 16&quot; by mistake but I didn't realise this. Attempting to produce the same result with subsequent balloons created some very impressive explosions. The balloons I had been given looked old aswell. Shelved too long. A few more blew up for no apparent reason. Instead of the 30 balloons I had hoped for I ended up with 20. No more gas. My craft and payload weighed 680 grams. It was going to be questionable whether the thing would fly if I didn't reduce the payload.<br><br>The Sunday night live eviction show would start at 7.30 pm. I quickly discovered that 20 balloons was all that would fit into my van anyway. I tied them to a dumbbell in 3 batches and set off for the Gold Coast. The craft, a torch, emergency tape, scissors and other stuff such as the remote control sat beside me. I couldn't see through the back for the cloud of rubber. All dark blue and black. Even the craft was smothered in shoe polish. Why take any chances? This was a stealth operation. Heading down the highway a few kids gave me curious looks from the backseats of cars. I just smiled back.<br><br>Sure enough I missed the 54 exit. My mind was on possible launch sites but this turned out to be a kind of blessing. On a previous day I had turned down this exit and checked out the target. The 'House' didn't show up on the tourist map I requested at the front gate. The girl at the front counter explained that it wasn't in the grounds par se. It was on Dream World property but outside the fence. I said it was such a shame because I had wanted to tell my friends back home about seeing the Big Brother House, not the shop selling T-Shirts, the actual house. Where was it precisely, I inquired. Could it be seen from the fence? No, she said. For &quot;security&quot; reasons it was deep in the bush. She then pointed out roughly where for me. Driving around back lanes and friendly chat with residents of the area confirmed that some unusually secured dirt tracks(raised barriers visible) were in fact back entrances to the Big Brother House. Looking over some old maps I became reasonably certain of an approximate position. The area it had to be within was quite small and the house wasn't visible at all from encircling railway line or street. I also knew that the Dream World crowd cheering could be heard from the back garden. If enough flyers were dropped from enough height then I had a reasonable chance of getting a few on target. Photocopying the flyers was simple. Manually cutting out thousands of tiny rectangles took many hours.<br><br>Tonight the gale force winds of the previous couple of nights had disapeared as I had hoped they might. As often happens after stormy weather it was now very still. Just a slight northerly breeze. Perfect for a launch from the next highway exit to the south. The exits either side of Dream World went nowhere and didn't join together at all. A few country lanes that tapered away to no place. One way in and out according to my street directory.<br><br>I was early and did some driving about to find the best spot. I selected a deserted rest area between a Mobil petrol station and the car park to Dream World. I had wanted to use the car park but didn't feel good about driving past the front entrance to Dream World. Past all the security there with a van full of balloons. Somebody might have half a brain and take an educated guess at what I might be using them for. The entrance to the car park at this end was closed anyway. That would have let me into the car park without getting too close to the crowd gathered at the entrance. Although there was no obvious sign of security I knew they did patrols of the car park and decided it was for the best that I wasn't able to try it. Setting up would take time. My remote control system had a range of 1 kilometre anyway. This only added 50 metres and once launched I could follow the craft across there on foot.<br><br>The reserve was dark and I parked the van so that the side door opened away from the fast food area and truckers resting in their cabs. Carefully I removed the balloons. Cutting them away and retying the cotton threads on to the craft. I didn't want to use my flashlight which mean't it was a little bit harder. One slip and the balloons would be on their way to New Zealand. As I had hoped, the cold temperature of night gave the balloons more buoyancy and the craft almost lifted. Removing a wad of the payload helped. A touch more and it was pulling nicely. I tied it down by the aerial onto the dumbbell now outside and went back to the van. Taking a spanner to the battery I connected a second terminal to an adaptor and switched on the television I had brought along. It was now 8.15pm. About time to launch. The TV had been in the kitchen and had started playing up today of all days. I brought it along anyway. The cathode tube was on the way out. Still had half a screen though. If my craft wandered close to the 'House' then there was a good chance that channel ten might let me know. Unwittingly giving me the cue to release the payload. <br><br>I went out and cut the craft free but held it from taking off. Switched on the servo's, switched on the main controller, made a final check that everything was operational and walked it to what I thought was a wide open space. When I let it go it was a beautiful sight. Twenty extra large helium balloons slowly lifting above you with a contraption below it is funny to look at. Then I pushed forward on the left servo and the propellor engaged like magic. The controls proved even worse than my minimum expectations. Such a large surface area was difficult to maneuver with such a tiny motor driven propellor. It took time. That's when a sudden freakish gust of wind appeared. A light breeze really but enough to change the direction of the craft from where I was wanting it to go. It was heading towards a tree and I desperately began using the controls to steer it away. I didn't know if it would hit or not. I think I held my breath. The craft was close to treetop level as it struck the upper branches. Miraculously, not a single balloon exploded. I worried that it might get caught up but it didn't. Not until the next tree. Because somehow it escaped death from the initial crash and brushed a neighbouring tree you see. The carrier caught for a second, losing some of it's payload which fluttered down in the thousands. Again it survived however. The freakish breeze was gone and it turned back on a northerly heading. Now above the tree line and heading over the carpark. I ran to keep up. The craft had lost too much weight and was now getting too high. Already difficult to see. It wasn't responding to the controls as far as I could tell. At such rapidly increasing height it would soon be outside of range. I decided to ditch the remaining payload and half the balloons. Perhaps something could be salvaged. It was so far away now I couldn't even tell which way it was facing as I jogged across the carpark holding the controller in front of me. Combined with it's slow response time any kind of control was impossible since I didn't know where it would turn. Another few seconds and it would be gone. I pulled down on the left servo to release payload and gave full correction turn aswell to ensure release of some balloons. I couldn't see it now. I waited. It didn't come back down. Maybe the tree tangle messed up the release system. I trudged back to the car and watched the end of the show. <br><br>I don't know where it is now. It has probably come down in some forest or a farmers field between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. It may have gone out to sea. If it reached the strong winds of the upper stratosphere then it could have ended up anywhere. Some New Guinea tribesman might be poking a spear at it. I kept the transmitter on while driving back home. Locked in the release mode. If it does come down then maybe somebody will find it. If they do and they find any flyers left then they might visit here. If you are reading this then let us know where it came down. I'd be curious to know.<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/uprojectorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>projectorion</A> at: 6/30/02 10:11:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cattlecar>cattlecar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NERVA Spaceplane Pilot</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/30/02 7:51:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~macami/ez/spinthingie.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Mission BIG BROTHER!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Ahhh Man that was damn funny!

Aerostats seem simple &amp; convenient, but there are so many variables that they're actually fairly tricky. As usual, weather kills them most often.<br><br> WIth such a small cargo,it might have just been more reliable to go to the extra expense of using a plane. What was your cargo like -bulky or dense? This determines whether you need a wide body or something more standard. I suspect a stack of flyers deployed by the slipstream could be dense &amp; compact (Think of a stack of books).<br>Planes are just more certain, since they've got enough power to get through mild weather which turns the balloon into a loss.<br><br>For stealth, cut the engine during the bombing run (Even electric powered props can be noisy).<br><br>Other ideas: A kite (!) when it gets to the point where the wind will take the flyers where you want, pull the deployment line.<br> I was thinking of a tethered balloon, where the balloon drifts downwind, and at the end of the line, simultaneously drops the load and cuts the balloon free. Either this or the kite uses no expensive radios, and the kite provides its own lift for free.<br> Do tests to determine the slant height of a kite/balloon, so you know exactly how much line to pay out?<br><br> If you could be sure there'd be no serious charges filed, then you could maybe think about expanding to a circle of conspirators; a friend or contact who knows planes, kites or balloons. For something so harmless, they might do it for fun.<br><br>Maybe do it more directly, and hire a plane to tow a banner! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=288.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=288.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/addreply3.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=288.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.threadControl?topicID=288.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=288.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=288.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub97.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nuclearspacefrm1">Open Forum<option value="nuclearspacefrm12">Space Exploration<option value="nuclearspacefrm20">Mad Scientists<option value="nuclearspacefrm23">Astronomy<option value="nuclearspacefrm24">The Almighty Buck<option value="nuclearspacefrm4">Nuclear Spacecraft (past & future)<option value="nuclearspacefrm7">Nuclear Power in Space<option value="nuclearspacefrm25">Energy For Earth<option value="nuclearspacefrm3">Asteroid Watch<option value="nuclearspacefrm2">Engineering<option value="nuclearspacefrm10">Environment<option value="nuclearspacefrm21">Students Lounge<option value="nuclearspacefrm8">Media and Politics<option value="nuclearspacefrm5">Opposition Movements and Myths<option value="nuclearspacefrm6">Nuclear and Space fiction<option value="nuclearspacefrm16">War<option value="nuclearspacefrm19">Employment Classifieds<option value="nuclearspacefrm22">Snake Oil?<option value="nuclearspacefrm15">Nuclear Waste<option value="nuclearspacefrm13">The Nuclear Preserve<option value="nuclearspacefrm11">Suggestions Box<option value="nuclearspacefrm26">Model Rocketry</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace>NuclearSpace Message Board</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm1>Open Forum</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.nuclearspace.com">NuclearSpace Home Page</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
