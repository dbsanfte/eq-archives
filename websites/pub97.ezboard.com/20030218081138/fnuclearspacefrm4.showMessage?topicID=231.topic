<br>
No contest really, but that’s not to say that Liberty ship is in any way inferior. Liberty (or something very like it) is absolutely essential for the colonisation of the solar system. Orion may be the Daddy of heavy lift launchers, (and I really don’t believe anything else can ever come close) but without a durable large capacity and reusable SSTO the whole project is dead in the water.<br>
<br>
Orion’s great strength is not her ability to travel quickly around the solar system, there are plenty of other ways to do that now, and other ways are under development. What Orion can give us is the ability to build, on earth (i.e. without all that faffing about in space suits and zero g) huge structures weighing hundreds of thousands or even Millions of tons, Factories, Habitats, Ore and chemical processing plants, hydroponics facilities and even shipyards and then to launch them into orbit and deliver them to their destinations as turnkey projects, possibly even complete with their crews. Moon, Mars and Asteroid bases would not have to be painstakingly built out of thousands of pieces ferried from earth at enormous expense and assembled in hostile conditions nor (initially) painstakingly constructed out of local materials (In the longer term this would be the aim but much time, money, effort and lives would be saved by getting the initial infrastructure there in one piece)<br>
<br>
Orion’s great weakness is that She is not very reusable. She can take off, She can fly around for a while and She can land (Earth would be a bit scary but the Moon or Mars should be OK) and that’s about it! For all its mass the pusher plate is a rather delicate structure and though it would be quite capable of providing a landing shock absorber, bouncing it onto a planets surface would certainly damage it beyond repair. Even if it didn’t there is the problem of how we launch the ship high enough to fire the first pulse unit when we try to take off again.<br>
<br>
Orion is, unquestionably, the Daddy, but we also need Liberty, Hotol and Space elevators. None of these concepts should be seen as competing with one another. They are all part of the same picture.<br>

The key to space expansion may rest in the space elevator.<br>
If that happens, the whole frontier will open wide up.<br>

Although the Liberty Ship could do the same thing on a lesser scale. The space elevator <br>
is pretty much political risk free unlike anything nuclear.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's time elected officials, specifically the President, is given<br>
a much longer term in order to get longer term goals underway<br>
that are sometimes the right thing but considered political suicide...<br>
Maybe an 8 year term for President instead of the 4, and remove the 2 term<br>
limitation.  Congress-critters don't suffer from term limitations,<br>

Limits are good-they force change because people arent worried about reelection.<br>
<br>
I envision orbital facilities where Orion will be assembled after it is sent up piece by piece via elevator (avoiding the political risk of a nuclear orion launch from earth).  The Orion could fly around, and be serviced at the end of each mission.  We could build a fleet of Orions for different uses-mining, asteroid management, commerce, exploration, etc.  <br>
<br>
An SSTO would be necessary as well-an HTOL to take goods and people quickly to orbit-thus, the spaceplanes will be like the airplanes of today, and the elevator will be like the trains.  The elevator would be cheaper and for larger loads, while the SSTO will be faster, and for smaller loads.  A spaceplane could be used as a long distance airplane as well (hopefully, we will have maglev soon for  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zaphod4468>zaphod4468</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 1825<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/16/03 6:58:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/user/zaphod2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> I agree, Congress should have term limits...Now, just try convincing them to vote themselves out of a job. <br>
Limits can also cause complacency in the incumbent.  The problem is that no politician thinks beyond the next election.<br>
That means no long term planning or projects... Colonizing space is a long term project.<br>
<br>
The biggst problem with the space elevator hauling Orion parts is that the pusher plate may need to be a single unit, <br>
and as such very massive, on the order of 1000 tons in weight or more... which may be above space elevator capability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zentrander>Zentrander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NERVA Spaceplane Pilot</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/16/03 7:03:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> could we send it in pieces to an assembly plant? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=atomicconspiracy>Atomic Conspiracy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/16/03 8:09:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> I do not know exactly how much of Orion's orbital velocity could be bled off by aerodynamic drag, as with, say, the Apollo capsules, but it has to be on the same order. That is, the Orion could be slowed to low subsonic velocity (.5 mach or less) just by drag. The pusher plate is a very good re-entry shield in both composition and shape. What do we do from there? The minimum drag velocity can be approached at a fairly high altitude. Drive bombs can be fired until the vertical velocity is below the minimum increment for another bomb, say, 100 fps or less. (any more and it starts accelerating back toward space) <br>
Orion's great strength is its lifting power. Among other things, it can easily carry enough chemical rocket motors, and fuel, to lower itself gently from the aerodynamic and bomb-braking minimum. It wouldn't take much. For a 10,000 ton Orion, 15,000 tons of thrust could stop the vehicle from 100 fps in 6 seconds. With an isp of just 300, these motors would use about 300 tons of propellant in that time. More would be necessary, since it may not be possible to time the chemical rocket burn to exactly match touchdown, but not a lot more. For landings on lighter bodies, the thrust requirement is lower. For deceleration on the moon, the bombs would have to be used down to the minimum increment, with the chemical rocket array used below that. <br>
<br>
If we land on the Earth itself, we will probably need to use rocket braking all the way down from the drag minimum. I think that .5m is very conservative for this figure (certain early ballistic missile RVs slowed to .45 m without being designed for maximum deceleration). A higher ISP for the braking rockets could also reduce the propellant requirement. This would be especially likely in later stages of exploration, when the craft can fill its propellant tanks with water-derived  LH2/LOX at the destination point. With the 300 isp, 1500 tons would be required for the most conservative case, rocket braking on Earth from .5m with an additional 500-1000 tons being needed as a safety margin. This is a lot for a 10,000 Orion but well within its capability, leaving several thousand tons for payload. Even with 1/5 of its liftoff mass taken up by braking propellant, Orion is still far superior to any other system in payload/mass ratio.   <br>
<br>
The original Orion plan called for the vehicle to land on the moon on the deceleration of its drive bombs alone. The velocity increment for each bomb could be reduced by detonating it at a greater distance or by using a lower yield device. The pusher plate can tolerate a landing impact speed at least as great as the minimum velocity increment for each bomb. A moment's thought will reveal why: the g loads are the same in each case. A cushion, possibly in the form of an inflatable donut shaped bag around the periphery of the pusher plate, would probably be necessary to spread impact loads during landings on rough surfaces.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zaphod4468>zaphod4468</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 1829<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/16/03 9:03:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/user/zaphod2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>could we send it in pieces to an assembly plant?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There was some discussion about that awhile back in one of the forums here.<br>
The general consensus was that it should be a single piece to avoid any weak spots<br>
or joints where the plasma could erode the material away in an uneven, and <br>
eventually catastrophic way.  <br>
<br>
Probably could just create the plate from material mined from an asteroid... but<br>
that won't happen for awhile unfortunately. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hamster@nuclearspace>Hamster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 715<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/17/03 8:01:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/935754.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The biggst problem with the space elevator hauling Orion parts is that the pusher plate may need to be a single unit, <br>

<br>
1000 tons is way over the limit for Highlift's current design.  The first elevator can only carry 20 tons to GEO.  Of course an elevator can always be scaled up once it's proven to work but mounting the pusher plate on an elevator car might present its own problems particularly since elevators that can carry high payload masses are expected to use multiple tethers,  such as having one at each edge of the climber.  The pusher plate might have to be loaded so its standing straight up and that might present balancing problems. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hamster@nuclearspace>Hamster</A> at: 1/17/03 8:02:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zentrander>Zentrander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NERVA Spaceplane Pilot</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/17/03 8:06:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Orion Vs Liberty ship-Who's the Daddy?</span><hr size=1> what if we built the entire pusher plate in orbit?

<br>
(Cue Dr Strangelove voice!)<br>
<br>
“Orions main advantage is her heavy lift capability, Ze whole point of Orion is lost if you do not launch from ze ground. VYE DO YOU NOT LAUNCH FROM ZE GROUND!”<br>
<br>
If we are into building ships in orbit there are other ways to get around the solar system that are much more efficient in the use of materials than Orion and possibly (eventually) much faster. Orion is a horribly inefficient brute force approach that only works because we have an almost unlimited amount of energy available and is (IMHO) best used in situations where sheer brute force is the only way, IE escaping the terrestrial gravity well!<br>
<br>
Once in space a thrust/mass ratio of 10% (or even 1%) is fine, a fusion VASMIR or a Deadulus type pulse propulsion system would be capable of providing this but neither of them could do ground launches. That is Orions preserve.<br>
<br>
Building an Orion in space to do a flit round the solar system would be an impressive demonstration of the concept. (Prometheus perhaps??) But I believe the technology is better used for launching massive pieces of infrastructure and delivering it to specific destinations (that infrastructure could also include complete non-Orion space ships of course!)<br>
<br>
As far as landing an Orion on her pusher plate is concerned I feel that we are at risk of finding false security in large numbers, I’m far from convinced that it would either make a good re-entry heat shield or survive a landing undamaged.<br>
<br>
When we start bandying around figures like 1000 tons for a pusher plate (or more, MUCH more in the case of large Orions!) it is easy to think of the pusher plate as a massive, almost indestructible assembly. This is not the case. <br>
<br>
On the original 4000 ton Orion, the pusher plate was specified at 1000 tons, but that isn’t just the mass if the plate alone. It is the mass of the plate, its support structures, braces, the un-sprung mass of the shocks and any other mechanisms that would be part of the assembly. <br>
<br>
The plate itself is not a massive lump of steel, it is (reading between the lines of GD’s book, and there are plenty of lines to read between! Its no textbook on how to build Orions!) a disk of aluminium about 1/16 of an inch thick (thicker in the middle) this is an amazingly fragile but utterly crucial component. Yes it can take the pulses of plasma at one-second intervals but I doubt if it would last more than a few seconds in any serious attempt at aero-braking and it would be crumpled and punctured beyond repair by any but the gentlest of landings on the softest of surfaces.<br>
<br>
It would also be completely inappropriate to use it as any form of shielding against space debris (as has been suggested elsewhere). In fact I recon it would be advisable to protect the pusher plate in some way during the coasting stages of any journey, the slightest damage would cause imperfections that would allow the bomb driven plasma to tear it to pieces. <br>
<br>
It would also be subject to fatigue damage. A pusher plate of this design may well not last more than a couple of thousand pulses before it started to develop cracks that would render it useless. The idea of large Orions making regular trips around the solar system like Ocean liners of the 19th century would probably not be possible without extensive “Dry dock” facilities for routine replacement of pusher plates <br>
<br>
Orions can open up the solar system in ways that no other technology can come close to (space elevators included!) But only if we use her for what she is really good for.<br>

Second, the Liberty Ship, while very capable, is a very narrowly optimized design.  Assuming we can solve pusher-plate design, EPPP is a better way to go, once you can get out of the biosphere.<br>
<br>
So, there are two MAJOR caveats to an EPPP design.  The Liberty Ship, radical as it seems, is a lot closer to reality in my humble opinion.<br>
<br>
Once we are in space in a major way, the simplest and easiest way to get around in a serious way is to export Pu239 and U233 to space, build crude (read cheap) pulse units and convert Near Earth Asteroids to orions.  Huge, crude, fast.  What's not to love?  No need to fool with pusher plates either, just reinforce the whole thing with straps of nanotubes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nebobgrenville>nebobgrenville</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://my.oregonstate.edu/courses/1/NE_114_X001_F2002/uploads/homepage/_1060577_1/triga.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NERVA Spaceplane Pilot</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/20/03 6:02:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/posticons/fry1.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: pushers</span><hr size=1> In one diagram for a 86' diameter pusher, the thickness is shown as 3.75&quot; on the edge and becoming gradualy thicker towards the center, with groves for attachment of the first stage shock absorbers.

<br>
Political problems. Lack of intestinal fortitude when it comes to blowing off tens of tons of Pu and various actinides and transuranics in the biosphere. (Yes, yes, we have all kinds of arguments back &amp; forth on this too. Would <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">you</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> want to live downwind of the launch site? Hormesis? Go ahead and randomly dust yourself &amp; your surroundings with fission waste products -I'll watch interestedly from a remote distance. I guarantee that it's lots nastier stuff than simple Pu239 or alpha emitters).<br>
<br>
 I also call to attention the doubts of the Orion designers themselves (as reported in Dyson's book) that the lack of testability of the flight article, until you actually press it into service, gives pause. Much of the ship would have to be tested in space: that means much of a full ship would have to be launched, assembled, and then tested as if it wewre the actual flight ship.<br>
 Anything launched from the ground, or from the top of a ballistic arc from a first stage, means that each &amp; every bomb, and every part of the ship must work perfectly the first, and every time thereafter. A misfire, and the ship falls...<br>
 Given the need to test in space anyway, the best way would be to launch parts, and test in space something which resembles the flight ship. Eventually, the actual ship is built most of the way intact, and gradually tested. Miniature bombs first, with no firing mechanism needed, then a few in a string.<br>
I also point out that if the ship's naturally designed environment is ground-to-orbit, then it's inherently inefficient to use that same ship in space -and vice-versa. Personally, I feel Ok with what we've got to get into orbit, or what's around the corner. Where we need the kind of revolution in capabilities Orion offers, is in interplanetary space.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, we've been over &amp; over this. None of these others really shines in the environment which is actually Orion's preserve, and where only it of all we can build now, works best: interplanetary space.<br>
Sorry to deflate your bubble, but chemical rockets and disintegrating fireworks work just fine to get off the ground and into space. Where they fall short, is in interplanetary space, where they force you to condemn the crew to slow death or privation or debilitation.<br>
 Only Orion is buildable now, and offers the performance needed to get crews around the solar system, before they are so weak &amp; sick they can't perform the mission.<br>
VASIMR &amp; Daedalus all require new breakthroughs. Orion doesn't. VASIMR doesn't even offer the same quality of performance as Orion.<br>
 You wrote favorably of Ion engines, and even the utility of low G acceleration ships -presumeably ion and VASIMR. While your highly eficient but low power ship is gradually spiralling out of LEO (and your crew is building up a radiation dose and deconditioning from extended exposure to microgravity), Orion has already been there, and is on its way back.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't see how a later generation large space-built ship for thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of tons cargo, and quick transfers is a &quot;flit around the solar system&quot;.<br>
Sure Daedalus would do this -if it can be built as economically as Orion- but NEP or VASIMR or GCNR or NFSWR, though some of them might have similar perfomances with smaller ships if they'll work, but we do know right now that Orion will work to these expectations.<br>
I also question how the puny 10 meter space assembled, HLV boosted, space use only ship is a &quot;flit&quot;. Show something else as attainable, with the same caliber of performance.<br>
<br>
 Your vision of entire factories is intriguing, but unrealistic (Where do you get any factual information about launching ships of &quot;hundreds of thousands or millions of tons&quot; from the ground? Apparently George Dyson couldn't find any such thing among the works of the original Orion designers.)<br>
You actually want to waste lift capacity on bulk structures?<br>
Read permanent.com on bootstrapping. over 95% of a space manufacturing facility is bulk structure and simple stuff which could be readily built up by a seed factory from readily available materials. Concrete, rolled &amp; stamped metals, drawn wire for cables (drawn wire cable is Roman-era, as is concrete). You could lift parts for 2 or 3 whole factories instead of the beams &amp; concrete foundations of the first factory.<br>
I suggest you argue the merits of bootstrappng with the AIAA, SSI, NASA, MIT, Stanford, etc. They all seem convinced, and I take their word for it.<br>
In the same vein, I also suggest that your insistence on going to other planets is misguided. Why worry about landing, if the target body has .0001G?<br>
 Once again, I suggest you take doubts about asteroids and space habitats to those who know better than I why taking fully equiped &quot;turn-key&quot; factories up out of our deep gravity well, across space (where energy is free and materials are easily gotten, processed, and built into other things), and then taking those complete factories down the immense gravity wells of other planets is unwise.<br>

<br>
A Lot of good points, I’ll address some now, some later<br>
<br>
“First of all, how about a link to this &quot;Liberty Ship&quot;?”<br>
<br>
Its elsewhere on the message board, I’m sorry I don’t know how to “direct” you too it.<br>
<br>
“Would you want to live downwind of the launch site?” <br>
<br>
No, Not really! That’s why I like LARGE Orion’s. (More Later)<br>
<br>
“the lack of testability of the flight article, until you actually press it into service”<br>
<br>
Yes, This is true; it’s also a problem because Orion doesn’t scale down well. But large, expensive, high-risk projects that con only be tested by just building them and doing it are not that uncommon historically. (More later)<br>
<br>
“A misfire, and the ship falls...”<br>
<br>
Not quite true, except in the first few seconds, a single dud would not be catastrophic. (Think of it as a 400-stage rocket, with another 1500 in reserve, a “Dud” stage can be jettisoned before firing the next one, all we’ve lost is 20M/s) A jammed ejector is a different matter, as would be a premature detonation. However IIRC the team identified one of the worst-case scenarios as being a non-nuclear detonation since it would shower the pusher plate with high velocity shrapnel, which could severely compromise its function.<br>
<br>
“Given the need to test in space anyway”<br>
<br>
I think a space test of a “Baby” Orion would be an excellent idea. I am wondering if Project Prometheus might be just that. It would prove the concept and give the public a glimpse of what this kind of technology is capable of. Also it is certainly true that it would be an advantage to do some of the development work in space simply because we would need a zero atmosphere environment to operate in. But space-baby’s are *not* going to colonise the solar system!<br>
<br>
“I also point out that if the ship's naturally designed environment is ground-to-orbit, then it's inherently inefficient to use that same ship in space -and vice-versa.” <br>
<br>
I think I might actually have been making a point along these lines, build our first  “Space” ships (EPPP or otherwise) and space stations on earth (where it is easy and cheap!”) And use super Orion engines to take them to Orbit. Where we are simply delivering a space station to a designated destination on a one-way journey, optimisation is not so important, once we have these facilities in space we can easily build whatever we like from the abundant resources there.<br>
<br>
“Personally, I feel Ok with what we've got to get into orbit, or what's around the corner. Where we need the kind of revolution in capabilities Orion offers, is in interplanetary space.”<br>
<br>
But it’s SOO expensive, we are using tons of fuel to push tons of fuel to push tons of fuel (all of which has its own environmental impacts) to put a Rover Metro in orbit. Even liberty can only put 1000 tons in orbit. Pretty much The “Smallest” sensible Orion can, not only launch this, but also deliver it to anywhere in the solar system within 6 months<br>
<br>
“Yes, we've been over &amp; over this. None of these others really shines in the environment which is actually Orion's preserve, and where only it of all we can build now, works best: interplanetary space.”<br>
<br>
Actually I agree, DO IT NOW. But we shouldn’t ignore the possible alternatives, which I think, could eventually offer even better deltaV performance than EPPP, though not, admittedly, the high thrust.<br>

“Only Orion is buildable now, and offers the performance needed to get crews around the solar system, before they are so weak &amp; sick they can't perform the mission. VASIMR &amp; Daedalus all require new breakthroughs. Orion doesn't. VASIMR doesn't even offer the same quality of performance as Orion.”<br>

”Your vision of entire factories is intriguing, but unrealistic (Where do you get any factual information about launching ships of &quot;hundreds of thousands or millions of tons&quot; from the ground?

“I also suggest that your insistence on going to other planets is misguided. ETC, ETC”<br>
<br>
Sorry, I was misleading, actually I don’t see much point in having large bases on Mars or the Moon, except in the unlikely event that we find something really useful there that doesn’t occur elsewhere easier to get to (A research Presence, like in Antarctica is a different matter), I only mentioned it as a possibility. Factories and habitats in the asteroids and around Saturn are much more my thing!<br>

<br>
I have posted about it at the www.space.com boards, had a few folks take it to task, no new objections, though.  I miss yales....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Basically, the smart folks here at nuclearspace seem to have given it a pretty thorough wringing, at least at this stage.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for risk, sure.  I followed yales good advice and simply planned for a worst case scenario.  In that case, the total radiation released would be at most twice as much as was released in Chernobyl, but it would be released at worst 6000 kilometers West of South America, out over the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Nothing out there to hurt, really, since the vast majority of the risk from Chernobyl was caused by radioactive iodine uptake from milk drunk shortly after the release.  The fallout would be diluted into harmlessness by the mighty Pacific.  I am confident the Pacific can handle this due to the successful risk mitigation of the CASTLE series of nuclear tests, which released several hundred times as much radioacative byproducts as a total Liberty Ship failure could.  And hopefully, losing a Liberty Ship entirely wouldn't be more than a once a year thing.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for aborts, there aren't many.  Even in the event of the loss of six engines, the Liberty Ship can still make orbit by running the surviving thrusters for a longer time.  After yales harped on common mode failures I decided to mount the central engine on a hard mount, with no gimballing and the simpler plumbing that entails, so a software fault won't take out all the engines.  It is possible to only gimbal 4 of the engines and solidly mount three of them.  OR, if we're truly paranoid, we can eliminate gimbaling entirely and do all our attitude control with the maneuvering jets.  <br>
<br>
(Ok, I am being a trifle facetious.  It can only withstand the loss of two engines in the first 60 seconds of flight.   And losing two engines in the first second would require the dumping of large amounts of cold gas from the maneuvering thrusters to maintain flight orientation and directional stability.  Fortunately, it has 12 pods of 5 reaction jets, just for this sort of event, and it carries a LOT of reaction mass.)<br>
<br>
In addition, since the cargo is carried in a detachable pod on the nose, it is possible to ditch the cargo on the way up then make a controlled landing of the fuel vaults and crew.  (The nuclear thrusters and fuel vaults are designed to be restartable.)<br>
<br>
If the Liberty Ship loses all of it's thrusters, it can still generate almost 1000 meters per second of deltaV by bleeding off the hydrogen in the main tank.  This would allow the ship to make a controlled re-entry and ditch in the deep ocean in almost any loss of power scenario.  <br>
<br>
If the main hydrogen tank explodes, the thrust structure is a solid piece at the aft of the ship, containing all of the fuel vaults.  All radioactive materials are placed into the vaults and the reaction pods that are attached to the thrust structure use the local tanks of neutronically warmed hydrogen to make a controlled re-entry, and a ditch into the deep ocean is arranged if at all possible.  If a ditch onto land is completely unavoidable, the fuel vaults are aerobraked using the thrust structure to the lowest possible velocity and impacted in the most uninhabited area that can be reached.<br>
<br>
Please note, these are risk mitigation scenarios that entail flying down chunks of the ship AFTER it has been blown to pieces, which is a pretty extreme scenario, but somewhat less catastrophic than pulverizing the entire ship into scrap.<br>
<br>
Oh, the crew rides up inside one or more lifepods, which are patterned on an Apollo capsule with a cold hydrogen jet manuevering pod attached.  If the Liberty Ship gets utterly trashed, the crew can hopefully eject inside these capsules and ride back down to Earth.<br>

You know, you mentioned that once before, and I went and took a brief look at that and could not really figure out the posting format.  I much prefer this page, or the www.space.com format, or the format over at www.arstechnica.com .  If you say its a really good place, I'll go take another crack at it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for getting published at this AIAA and AAS outfit, give me time!  I wrote an article for this website first, we'll hafta see how bad Zaphod has to rework it to make it not suck.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have a template for a format, but frabkly that writeup will be very long and detailed, and real life is kinda eating me alive right now.

The puny Sea Dragon is such a fragile weak thing! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, the Sea Dragon is puny and weak.<br>
<br>
Let me see if I can make you see why I say this.<br>
<br>
The Sea Dragon was designed with a sky-high launch thrust of 80,000,000 pounds.  It had a launch weight of a &quot;mere&quot; 40,000,000 pounds.  Why was it accelerating SO HARD?<br>
<br>
For a hint, note the tiny mass fraction to orbit.  Think of gravitational losses.  I would dare say that if it accelerated less savagely, it wouldn't get any cargo to orbit at all, as the increased gravity losses would eat up it's entire cargo capacity.<br>
<br>
As a side effect, the Sea Dragon has a VERY rough ride, leaving the water at two gravities and hammering along at over 5 g's at first stage burnout.  This means any cargo going up on it has to be built to survive a much harder ride than the Space Shuttle, which peaks at 3 gravities.<br>
<br>
The Liberty Ship, on the other hand, never exceeds 2 gravities in a simple full throttle to orbit launch profile, and could have a maximum g load of a meager 1.4 if you want to throttle down the thrusters on the way up.<br>
<br>
Also, note that the Sea Dragon has a TINY cargo fraction.  Most commonly it is quoted as 1,200,000 pounds to orbit.  With a launch mass of 40,000,000 pounds that means that only 3 percent of the rocket makes it to orbit, and the cargo is probably not all of that since some kind of a kick stage would probably be needed.  <br>
<br>
The Liberty Ship takes almost exactly 66 percent of its liftoff mass to orbit, or 4.4 million pounds.  Of that 4.4 million pounds, 2 million is defined as cargo.  The rest of it is the Liberty Ship and the fuel it needs to get back down.<br>
<br>
In comparison, the Sea Dragon is indeed puny and weak, since the Liberty Ship has a mass fraction 22 times higher.<br>
<br>
It's all in how you measure it, you see.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=231.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=231.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.nuclearspace.com/ezboard/images/addreply3.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.threadControl?topicID=231.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=231.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub97.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="nuclearspacefrm4">Nuclear Power in Space<option value="nuclearspacefrm3">Asteroid Watch & General Astronomy<option value="nuclearspacefrm1">Open Forum<option value="nuclearspacefrm20">Science and Engineering<option value="nuclearspacefrm26">Model Rocketry<option value="nuclearspacefrm25">Energy and the Environment<option value="nuclearspacefrm8">Media, Politics & War<option value="nuclearspacefrm5">Opposition Movements, Myths & Snake Oil<option value="nuclearspacefrm6">Science Fiction and Nuclear Power<option value="nuclearspacefrm19">Employment Classifieds<option value="nuclearspacefrm28">NuclearSpace Media<option value="nuclearspacefrm15">Nuclear Waste<option value="nuclearspacefrm13">The Nuclear Preserve<option value="nuclearspacefrm11">Suggestions Box<option value="nuclearspacefrm27">The Rules<option value="nuclearspacefrm29">What if?</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/bnuclearspace>NuclearSpace Message Board</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub97.ezboard.com/fnuclearspacefrm4>Nuclear Power in Space</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.nuclearspace.com">NuclearSpace Home Page</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.107<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
