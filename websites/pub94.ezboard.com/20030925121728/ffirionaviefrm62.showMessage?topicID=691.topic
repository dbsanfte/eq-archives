<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> &quot;Amendment X<br>
<br>
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I understand Hatter correctly, he reads this staement as stating that everything not given to the federal government is given to the States and/or the People.  Since it can be either, it is up to the Judicial Brance to determine who gets what powers, on a case by case basis.<br>
<br>
I read it differently...  The sentence structure is a bit stilted.  These are the phrases:<br>
<br>
1) The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution<br>
<br>
OK, this says that we are talking about anything not given to the Feds.  Hatter and I agree here.  then there is a comma.<br>
<br>
2) nor prohibited by it to the states<br>
<br>
OK, &quot;it&quot; in this part of the sentence refers to the Constitution.  So we are talking about Powers not given to the Feds which are also not specifically prohibited to the States.<br>
<br>
3) are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.<br>
<br>
OK.  What this says to me is that Powers not given to the Feds which are also not specifically prohibited to the States, go to the States.<br>
<br>
The &quot;respectively&quot; signifies (to me) that anything NOT meeting this criteria... Which would be Powers not given to the Feds AND explicitly prohibited to the States, would therefore go to the People.<br>
<br>
I see a trickle down effect - Feds got first crack, they reserved powers for themself, then denied themselves and states certain things.  Anything else goes to the States, and the things specifically denied to the States and Feds go to the people.<br>
<br>
So, I ask, what do people think?  Is that interpretation reasonable?  Or do you agree with Hatter's view that States and People are equal in their capacity to posess the Powers not given to the Feds?<br>
<br>
I'm just interested in opinions, I am not trying to prove or disprove anyone's belief, just interested in seeing if anyone else sees it the way I do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kebkin>Kebkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/03 4:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amendment X</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I see a trickle down effect - Feds got first crack, they reserved powers for themself, then denied themselves and states certain things.

Can't really offer you an opinion here because I'm not really certain what type of powers would fall directly under the control of the People.  <br>

<br>
Judges look at laws to see if they are constitutional ( well they are supposed to) and I doubt they weigh in on whether it is a bad law because it is a power that belongs to the people.<br>
<br>
The reality is the States can and do make laws in any area not reserved to the Federal Government or usurped by the Federal Government. I dont believe that when laws are proposed, someone sits and says  &quot;but wait, that is a power of the people&quot;. And I also dont believe that Judges reviewing laws do that either. <br>
<br>
The State represents the people and so unless some provision of a constitution states specifically that it cant be regulated , then the state can and does regulate when its attention is drawn to it.<br>
<br>
I doubt one could win an appeal of a law based on the fact they believe the state cant regulate there, unless it is SPECIFICALLY denied to the government by a constitution. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kebkin>Kebkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amendment X</span><hr size=1> After thinking about it more, would all of the various Propositions that California has passed over the last few years be examples of a power of the People not specifically granted to the Federal/State govt?  <br>

These Proposition votes are referendums.  If they pass, they become state law.  <br>
<br>
For example purposes, a link below to one of the more famous (or infamous) California Proposition votes:<br>

If the California Propositions count as an example of the power of the People not specifically granted to the Federal/State government, then the followup question is could a referendum that the people voted into law be ruled unconstitutional by a state/federal court?  <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

I think that amendment is just there as a reassurance that there weren't hidden powers secretly given to the Federal Government.<br>
<br>
It basically says if we didn't give it to the Federal Government than it belongs to the States or the People (except when prohibited).  It doesn't make any claims as to which should take precedence (in terms of states rights -vs- people's rights).<br>

<br>
The Webster's Dictionary defines &quot;respectively&quot; as follows:<br>
<br>
re-spec-tive-ly: adv, (1626)  1. in particular : SEPARATELY &lt;could not recognize the solutions as salty or sour respectively&gt; 2. in the order given &lt;Mary and Anne were respectively 12 and 16 years old&gt;.<br>
<br>
If using this definiton in regards to the 10 Ammendment, it is establishing the order and levels of government.  Federal, State, People.<br>
<br>
The wording as I see it:<br>
<br>
&quot;Amendment X<br>
<br>
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&quot; <br>
<br>
Says this in more modern terms:<br>
<br>
The powers not specifically reserved for the Federal Government, or specifically prohibited by from State Governments belong to the States or the People.<br>
<br>
So it establishes the respective order of goverment... Federal, State, People.<br>
<br>
Now, if you go further down the Constitution (immediately after the Civil War), you find what I call the &quot;MONEY CLAUSE&quot;.  Article XIV further limits the power of the states, but not the people.  <br>
<br>
&quot; Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.<br>
<br>
Skipped section 2-4 as it deals with representation, repatriozation and civil war debt.<br>
<br>
Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.  (If you read the Constitution you will find this section is repeated many times after the Civil War to reinforce the superimposement of Federal Government over State government).<br>
<br>
The key phrase is here in section 1., No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge... (etc... hey folks it is right above, so I ain't typing it again).  <br>
<br>
Who decides what law are abridgements?  The Judiciary, when grievance is brought before them in the form of suit.<br>
<br>
So, you might even consider the 14th Amendment as an aid in clarification of the 10th.  It greatly limits state government and authority.  While giving more power to the Federal Government and the People, while limiting the States ability to legislate.<br>

As to the placement of respectively, yes that is certainly correct.  In fact, the same as mine...  I thought you were putting States and People on the same level, thus requiring a judge to decide case by case who gets precedence.<br>

But our argument may be simply semantics... I can't think of a single example where our two interpretations would be functionally different...

And in my opinion wasnt necassary since the first 10 amendments already say it. The rights of the people were delinated in the bill of rights. Additionally any area not covered by Federal or State law is a power of the people. <br>
<br>
But the State can and does create new laws all the time. They ( the state governments) have the authority and the power to do so, only those things specifically denied them cant be made into laws.<br>
<br>
Judges dont sit down and go,,,, Humm is this a state power or a people power. They look to see if it is proscribed from being legislated, if not specifically, then they look to see if it is offhand limited in some manner. No Judge bases his or her decision on....
