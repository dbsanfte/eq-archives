Once in that position he used those same tools to ensure he remained in power.<br><br>The people of Germany never elected Hitler to the office of Supreme Leader.

At the heart of all wars is economics. Hitler rose to power becuase of events that had been boiling since long before he was born.<br>Germany was one of the last of the countries of modern Europe to unite. As late as the 1880's it was still a collction of Duchys and other little kingdoms, mainly Germanic peoples but not united and not very powerful. Also without any great ports directly to the Atlantic and Mediterranean. This added up to no colonies. While England, France, Spain, even Belgium and Holland had colonial empires, which made them varying degrees of capital, Germany had none. They, and to some extent Italy, unifed late and thus came to the colonial table late. Germany and Italy both ended up with some poor colonies (Tanzania, Ethiopia) but it wasn't really enough. <br>WWI had many causes, some of which amounted to nationalism, some to economics, etc. But the result was a harsh treaty that was very unfair to the losers, as England and France tried to basically recoup the money they spent in the war from Germany. The Germans hated the Treaty of Versaille, to the extent that as a symbolic gesture, when France surrendered to Germany in WWII, Hitler made them sign the treaty in the same boxcar that Versaille was signed in. <br>All that aside, it was the inflation that the treaty caused in Germany and the economic ruin that resulted that allowed someone like Hitlet to gain power, not so much blind patriotism. Patriotism was needed to hold this fractured society together, and that is where the Jews came in. Germans thought of themselves not so much as Germans but as Prussians, Munchians, etc. The Jews were the &quot;other&quot;, the outsider, the non-German that Hitler needed to make the German people see themselves as one people.  <p>Palantiri, Ranger of Norrath<BR>Sacred Jesters Of Quellious, Woodfellas<BR>Cosmos Mariner, Destination Unknown<BR><BR>Dohneagle of Firiona Vie<BR>Cuthalion of Sullon Zek<BR><BR>Why is it that every MOB you are hunting is never found unless you are on a corpse run, when they are at every turn?<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/9/01 4:23:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> Heh, for the record, I wasn't even speaking of the actions we're taking now.<br>All I was alluding to is the line that &quot;patriotism&quot; as well as a scapegoat often takes.

Yes it happened , but unlike Nazi Germany, the U.S. Government took steps to prevent it and to prosecute it.<br><br>President Bush takes pains to mention Muslims, Arabs and such in a favorable light in every address. The U.S. A. is not using the events of Sept 11 to attack anyone except those that are believed to be responsible for world wide terrorism.<br><br>I would agrue that our government is actively ignoring potential enemies to build a coalition and keep it going. Rather than whack everyone with a big stick, the Government is going slow and targetting enemies slowly.<br><br>Because sick, demented , evil people use a concept for Evil, does not make the concept itself evil.

As long as you can seperate the fear from the reality.<br><br>I worry that the U.S. government is to far to the left. But I also know that my prespective is skewed because I am a bit to the right. My real fear is that it continues to slip farther and farther left, trampling the very concept of why it exsists. The Constitution and the United States were meant to provide a Country where individual freedom was the norm, not the exception.<br><br>The Left cant or wont trust the people to handle themselves and so works to &quot;protect&quot; everyone by removing freedoms and responsibility. <br><br>Because someone abuses a right or freedom is NOT an excuse to remove that from everyone else. We as a society cant seem to place personal responsibility for actions on anyone. It seems lately that it is so much easier to blame something else. &quot;he&quot; murdered kids at school.... ohh but &quot;he&quot; was mistreated as a child....... ohh &quot;he&quot; was picked on by kids at school......If &quot;he&quot; hadnt had a gun it wouldnt have happened (ignore all the bombs that are around, which are even more controlled than the gun)<br><br>What EVIL acts have been done by the USA in your life time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/11/01 7:03:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> Gee, just the everyday stuff you know... like oppression of pretty much every minority.

Does this make sense? No, it doesn't make traditional sense, but it's quite obvious this country is made for the white male so it makes sense in that twisted manner.<br>The argument is there &quot;hey, &quot;they&quot; can always get an education!&quot; Suuuuuuure, too bad the schools in these areas have poor funding and systems that care more about punishing those who act up than education. Gee, your grades and SAT scores don't meet our requirements, sorry. &quot;They&quot; can always get a job, we got that affirmative action! Yeah, I might be afraid to lose a place at McDonald's due to something like that, I think my W.A.S.P. ass has the advantage in corporate Amerikkka though. Hey, this is the land of opportunity! Opportunity to do what? Work three jobs until I look responsible enough to the government for them to loan me money that I'll pay back at inflated rates for the rest of my life? And then it won't matter, because my small Mom&amp;Pop type store doesn't have a big business backing, and something corporate owned is gonna come in and wipe me out with inferior product and service... but hey, they look BIG! <br>I could give a f*ck if people think the American government is the best thing going. Hey, it might be, but that doesn't make what they do right... it never will. So until things start to even out, until things become equal, until we actually CARRY OUT what we said in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution... well then, I'm going to keep fighting. I'm not content with just being &quot;the best thing going.&quot;<br>The bourgeousie oppression will end, the proletariat will rise. The time beckons, and I'll be front and center to fight when it comes.
