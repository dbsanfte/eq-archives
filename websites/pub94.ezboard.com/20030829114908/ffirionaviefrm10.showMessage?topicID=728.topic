<br>
The tale i will tell is a sad one. It is the story of my life. Its the story of my i am as i am. Why i act as i act. It is painful for me to relive such painful memories but somethings must be done. One day an army attacked felwithe, this army known as Lust for Blood. Poored through the gates in numbers. The stromed into the chapel and mercilessly slew my mother before my own eyes. have you any idea what its like to watch your mother torn apart before your eyes. the screams the agony haunt me to this day. My father fared worse the necromancers got to him. I imagine he is now one of those decaying skeletons in the forest. I by sheer providence managed to reach kelethin alive. I was 20 years old at that time ((keep in mind High elves like for like 700 years)). The wood elves were gracious and Felwithe was rebuilt in no time. I returned thier to try and repair my broken life. It wasnt happening. I was alone in the world. One day though Heaven smiled on me in the form of a bard, Rena. Rena and I were fast friends. She was like a sister to me, she taught we well. She helped me obtain my first suit of armor. She showed me the most beautiful spot in all of Felwithe. A spot that I now show only the closest people to my heart. Rena however never got a chance to know how much I cared for her. She was torn apart by netherbians on an expedition to the moon. I was furious; I should have been there to protect her. I was a PALADIN for Tunares sake sworn to protect and she that was closest to me was slain by my negligence. What hurt most was like with my parents i never got to say goodbye. its a pain i carry with me. With Rena gone my depression came back. i barely ate, hardly ever spoke, and would not train. I was a mess. However some diety must have been watching out for me, because two new companions soon arrived. They were a human monk named Yerig, and a High Elven enchanter named Lendra. And so like I did with Rena I grew close to these two. I hunted with them, partied with them, and ceased my mourning of Rena.<br>
<br>
Yerig and Lendra soon joined Lust for Blood. The very same one that slaughtered my family. In my ignorance I had no idea as to the precepts of this guild. When I inquired to Yerig I was told it was simply an army. I believed him and we continued to hunt together. One day as I hunted with them in Paladual Caverns war struck. The Lust had made war with one of the Tier Dal houses, and the House attacked. Yerig and Lendra were both knocked out. I decided to help the Lust in there war. Clueless to the fact that the Lust no doubtedly started the war. After all the elimination of an entire clan of Tier Dal. What could possibly be better? Gah I was so stupid.<br>
<br>
And so I continued as an ally (never a guild member) of the Lust, with Yerig as my mentor. I once asked him what the point of all the fighting was. To which he replied, what’s the point of an army that doesn’t fight? I answered to keep the Peace. He laughed. On a separate occasion I asked him why he associated himself with vile Tier Dal and even called some friends and guild mates. Tunyric, Tunyric, Tunyric, he sighed, Good and Evil aren’t cut and dry, black and white. You can’t be so dogmatic. This only served to confuse me further as what I had learned back home in Felwithe was so very different. But I was not in Felwithe anymore. Then they vanished, Lendra first, soon followed by Yerig. I was alone again.<br>
<br>
I was left to fend for myself. I was lost and confused. What was I supposed to do with myself? How was I supposed to live my life? All this uncertainty and all this doubt made me angry. Angry at my self. Angry at the world. Angry at Tunare.<br>
How can Tunare expect me to resolve these problems on my own, I thought to myself. I am so insignificant one Elf in all of Norrath. How am I supposed to make a difference? But before I could decide how to make a difference. There was one thing I had to decide first. Follow the law of my people, or follow the teaching of my mentor. It was so frustrating as both were so very important to me. Thankfully Tunare heard my plea for help and came to me. I was missing the point. I am not to blindly follow the teaching of another, be they my people or my friends. I am to follow my heart. I searched my heart looking for what it was that I really wanted. And I found my calling. Peace!<br>
<br>
So here I stand before all of you as a member of Peacekeepers Alliance. I have learned much since my days of ignorance. Yerig you were right about one thing though. Good Evil they are relative terms, not a black and white description. But Yerig you were wrong too. To have an army is fine, but to use that army to attack murder and pillage innocents is abhorable. And that is why I fight. I fight to protect all innocents be they Dark Elf, High Elf, Dwarf or Ogre. I continue to pray, you and yours will see the light. And Rena on the aniversery of her death sent me a gift. One day in felwithe i sat and thought of my past, when the music came to my ears. That voice i knew that voice. IT WAS RENA! I scrambled up and looked for her desperately. I came upon a bard singing her song in a patch of grass. It wasnt Rena. It was a bard named Xiashya. I was disappointed, but that voice. I had to speak with her. we talked for a while exchanging our stories, Her parents like mine were also dead. She was all alone in the world. She was so lonely. I was moved to tears by her plight. We had both lost so much. I decided that Xiashya wouldnt be alone any longer. I adopted her as my daughter. Now both of us have the family we so desperately needed. Rena you now live on. You live on through Xiashya! <br>
<br>
Ive seen Fire and Ive seen rain<br>
Ive seen sunny days that i thought would never end<br>
Ive seen lonely times when i could not find a friend<br>
But I always thought that I'd see you again (Rena) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tunyricllanower@firionavie>Tunyric Llanower</A> at: 2/20/03 10:40:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laaennie>Laaennie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/03 12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=728.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Tale of Tunyric</span><hr size=1> *cheer* <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=491453">Laennie Trueheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
