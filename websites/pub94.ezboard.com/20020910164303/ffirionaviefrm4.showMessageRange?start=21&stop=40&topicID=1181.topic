This is what I dont understand.. You cleared NToV.. Congratulations.. Ramel went into Plane of Mischief when nobody else was in there and just hung out...<br>
<br>
Where's the problem?<br>
<br>
If he went in there anonymous and sat in there picking his nose while nobody was in there, would you really care?  Point of fact would you even know?  How do you know Ramel was the first person on the server to go in there after you guys cleared it.. maybe there was an_anonymous_dood_01 who zoned in and checked it out unbeknownst to you.  <br>
<br>
 What real difference does it make that he zoned into the zone first? You were the first guild in there, you were first kiling stuff in there. So what difference does it make that he walked in there before your guild?.. I really dont get it.<br>
<br>
If some unguilded guy saw that you guys cleared NtoV and thought it would be cool to see a zone they've never seen before and walked in before you would it still be an issue? or is it an issue just because he wears a &quot;rival guild&quot;s tag?  If so thats pretty sad.<br>
<br>
Apparently if you clear a passageway to a zone it gives you ownership of the zone until after the guild that cleared the passage gives you permission.  /sigh<br>

In the last few PoF raids that went down we've had two or three peope come in for chanter epic pieces, wizard epic pieces etc. So obviously Bako doesnt mind people coming in now. Maybe its different because these folks have helped out our guild in some way? Maybe you pissed him off when you were both level 10? Hehe who knows?<br>

First of all he was not anonymous.<br>
Secondly Ramel has harrassed Reso in the past when we have failed on a mob that his guild was able to kill.<br>
Thirdly Ramel I am 99% sure that Ramel has been to POM before. He claimed to pull NTOV for a guild on the Legends server when he transfered there and thus &quot;earned&quot; the right to bring back items not yet available on FV server.<br>
<br>
I am most certain this was an attack by Ramel against Resolution and therefore I point it out. This part of this thread is about Ramel who happens to be in FnF. This is not against FnF, but sadly FnF members feel they must stick up for their very talented and powerful monk. Ramel ate some of our fruit and I am branding him a trespasser.<br>

<br>
So what if he went in after you cleared the way? You guys werent in there at the time, and its not like he went in there when you guys were killing stuff and started looting your kills!  You weren't even in there.  I still dont see the problem here but I guess it because if the situation were reversed and FnF cleared a passageway to a zone, then left and did not go inside and a single person from Reso zoned in and hung out in there, I really wouldnt give a rats ass..<br>
<br>
If he told the entire guild &quot;Hey, Reso cleared NtoV lets get in there and raid PoM&quot;.. now that would be something to be pissed about, but he didnt.. He went ther ALONE.  One single monk in the zone isnt going to hamper your entire guilds progression of the zone, so I really dont see the problem.. To me its a sad thing to be upset about.  <br>
<br>
Sorry Ramel peed in your Wheaties, dump it out, clean the bowl and pour a new one.<br>

You guys cleared the whole way to the zone....and then left? Or cleared the way to the zone and Ramel snuck by and hopped in first? Why didn't you guys just enter the zone when you could have, not to kill things, but just to say you did it? why leave? Did you want a particular person, say a halfling from your guild to do it? If you clear the way to PoM and leave, how long does the route stay clear? Are all you guys in Uber Channel 1 and all know what each other has and hasn't done? How do y'all know Ramel was the first person in, did Guide Billy fly a huge banner over Norrath that I missed? Cause just cause someone says they were the first person to a zone doesn't necessarily make it so.<br>
I mean, what if some AS guys (to use a Guild not involved) had popped into the area, knew that you guys had been clearing, and when they found it clear, figured you had already been inside, so they figured they'd go take a alook too?  I can see why Rollen might be upset., but to me this all just seems weird. <br>
    Not knowing the dynamics of how clearing to PoM works is part of the problem of my not understanding, but as another person says in a fashion, Are people only allowed in if they cleared the path, and if you cleared it before us this spawn cycle we just sit around till we can clear the path?  I can see where you don't want to be the people who do the heavy lifting so someone else can reap the rewards, but in this case I'm confused as to how Ramel was suppossed to know that you hadn't entered the zone yet...cause I know if me and mine had gotten all the way to that point we would have gone inside......<br>

These two guilds represented pretty much every single server first on our server.<br>
<br>
They were beaten to the first Trakanon kill.  A smaller, younger guild went down and killed Trak on their first attempt one day before that alliance had scheduled to go down and try him for their first attempt.<br>
<br>
One of the monks of that younger guild had done the entire Veeshan's Peak key quest except killing Trakanon.  After looting one of the Trak teeth, he became the first player on our server to enter VP.<br>
<br>
That younger guild killed exactly one more Trakanon in the following 6 months.  The alliance of the two stronger guilds dominated that spawn, farmed the hell out of it, had groups into VP, and farmed the hell out of that zone before the younger guild even started being able to kill Trak with consistency.<br>
<br>
If you asked the question today...who was the first guild into VP, people would say it was the alliance.  If asked who the first person into VP was...I doubt more than a small handful could tell you.  Being first into a zone doesn't mean anything without the ability to take advantage of the lack of competition when you get there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/02 3:24:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1181.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pride</span><hr size=1> Zsu if you asked to come to POM after we cleared there then maybe we would say yes.

If it was some other monk who ran there I might just shrug it off, but Ramel made sure that Reso knew he was there through tells. He flaunted it. He may be a great player, but he has disrespected Reso many times through the months and this is just another jab at us. <br>

<br>
If i had spent forever and then some in PoA i could have maybe gotten lucky and had a shaman ring with 3 charges of FD, along with that and a DA idol i feel i woulda had a decent shot at getting there myself.  Now i have not spend ungodly hours in PoA to get the stuff for the quest but suppose i had and suppose i had some luck when i tried to FD / da idol to PoM.   Rollen would u have put me up on the FV boards cause i made u feel like less of a man? cause when i heard that ramel went to PoM i was thinking about if i could do it with the FD ring i can get.<br>
<br>
another thing that is intersting is a monk is supposed to be able to get to PoM even with all of Ntov up, just takes some skill, LOTS of luck and then the gods being with you.<br>
<br>
so my conclusion is that you can be pissed at ramel being in PoM, not like what we say will change it in anyway.  but my question is are you pissed because the person who &quot;cheated&quot; you was ramel?  and if it had been someone else would u have gone to the FV boards to belittle them?<br>

And for any FnF to sit back and say Ramel didn't do that purely to annoy us is completely ignorant, because I know you all have seen some of the things he's said over /shout in one particular zone straight to Resolution.<br>

<br>
He should have been pharming PoM cards a long time ago, then again FaF should have cleared to PoM a long time ago too but Doomshade was up.<br>
<br>
Enchanter Epic pieces on FaF raids - given to some part time gimp because he might be useful as a pez dispenser for buffs and because he had the inclination to complete the quest and get the first Snake to flaunt it to Coriolis.  Subsequent raids always make sure it's not up when you go to kill DRACO because want to keep Resolution from getting it.<br>
<br>
Last 2 FaF Fear raids I went on - Enc Epic piece sold to Zsuzsana and a non-aggro mob killed and the head rots.<br>
<br>
Bako has pride, not the good kind, never did.<br>
<br>
Grats on the Primal Fistwraps Ramel, about time after 5 sets of Warders dying to Patch/Server down.  Sorry for whoever would have gotten a 41 percent Haste Talisman, like a couple of SKs in Resolution have now, to Key a DB Wizard.  But I'll say again DPS DOES NOT WIN FIGHTS and once you can figure out aggro you will be able to kill Baron Ventani assuming you have atleast one of your 4 DB Wizards there.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you could start clearing N ToV with 24, if you're on the 3rd day of N ToV and people can get CotH'ed in you will end up with a much larger number, those part-timers that beef up your roster to 5 dr00ds and one in the oven and 5 enchanters tend to want to be part of the fun.  Of course you could be selective about who you guild, but that's not very family oriented.<br>
<br>
Have fun thinking about the mobs you are able to kill or actual kill them, decide what's more fun for you.  If it's killing mobs you should probably b!tch at Bako for holding down the brakes on the Bangbus, then again that would mean less loot if the Bangbus started rolling so partly self defeating.<br>
<br>
We are so far ahead of Resolution.....<br>
<br>
Can't kill Statue (AS killed him no worries), can't kill Dain, can't kill Ventani, but did kill KT Flawless same as you did with a 6100ish first tank once you managed to pull him without blame my weapons I got aggro dead again around and you dropped Yelinak with only 3 DB Wizards and 7 clerics on the weekend, atleast was more impressive than Draco, Doom and Kael faction pharming (only 1 wipeout in Kael though~!).<br>
<br>
You have the players, the gear and the needed classes and some gimp guild leader holding you down to half your potential at best because he wants a 100hp Crown moreso than the fun and challenge of killing the more powerful mobs that the gear you have already gotten makes you capable of.<br>
<br>
Oops this wasn't really about PoM.<br>
<br>
Sorry to dissapoint you Bako but I haven't been run over by a car yet, keep hoping though.<br>
<br>
******If you don't like long posts******<br>
<br>
Bako has always been the one to bash the guild, making you believe you are capable of so much less than you really are by not letting you try mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 916<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/02 5:45:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1181.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PoM</span><hr size=1> Lol,<br>

If he has been like you said (which I don't know don't care to know) then why not just not pay attention or even use /ignore?<br>
