It is old but seems to be very well used. It is a good size in volume. As it is opened from the beginning you are able to see the words written within. The words and history of the Priestess of Innoruuk named, Tennyo Yuumenio.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Some days I wonder why I am alive. What I am is no secret. Who He was, is not secret. And yet I am here. As far back as I can remember I can see His damn grinning face. It haunts me at night. It drives me to kill. I simply cannot stand Him.<br>
<br>
I was born under horrible circumstances. If I had chosen to live or die that day, I would not be writing this. My Mother, the fool woman that she was, did not kill me when I was in the womb or after I was born. She knew what I was, and yet she loved me, cherished me. I was her gift from Him. And she loved Him.<br>
<br>
He... Shintou the Ranger of the Faydark... He was my bane. My horrible truth. He is what made me what I am. And I hate Him. Mother doted on him so, making sure all His needs were met. I never trusted Him, not even as a child. He would try to coddle me, make me His. Never.<br>
<br>
I knew what He did at night. The whores He kept. Mother was not enough for Him. And I didn't blame Him there. She was so needy. She depended on Him for comfort, support. A horribly pretty shell of a Teir'dal. That is the reason He stayed with us, I believe, because of her beauty.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I have many bastard brothers and sisters out there. I'm sure they are from all different races. He did not care. Whatever satisfied His pleasure for the moment was fine with Him.<br>
<br>
I was happy the day we got news of His death. It pleased me. I smiled and laughed as Mother fell to the floor in tears. It was the day I saw her as she truly was. An empty woman, dependent on a man for support. I suppose that is why I killed her. I hated how she went to see His grave. How she made me grow up in the Faydark because we were close to His home. I was never accepted there, nor in Neriak.<br>
<br>
I am a child of mine own. I do not have a Father. And that is why, I shall never call Him such.<br>

I have sat in the forest and slowly watch her body rot to bones. It was been 4 years since the day my Mother died. I have survived, barely, on my own watching her body melt to the ground as I smirk. I can't imagine if I am either sick in the mind, or to know that this is some form of her suffering for her stupidity that I enjoy. I did not bury her inside the city walls, however, just in the forest. She wasn't good enough to be in the city of darkness anyhow. I can not remember how exactly it happened, but I did see something rather peculiar.<br>
<br>
As I was done setting up the tombstone I looked up. Pretty little green eyes were looking at me from behind a tree. Naturally I pulled for my dagger. Then I realized it was only a child. A little boy. He had been watching me. I yelled at him and he ran away. He seemed very happy, almost giggling as I yelled for him to leave me be. It was not until after he left that I realized something. <br>
<br>
Full blooded Teir'dal do not or even, can not, have green eyes.<br>
<br>
For the past few hours I have feel following him. He lives deep within the forest with his Mother and Father. I suspect it is not his real Father. The blonde tipped hair gives him away. I keep my hood over my head, no one must know who I am here. <br>
<br>
I am enraged with jealousy. How can he live so happily, when I was suffering everyday? I am envious. When I look at the boy, I see Him. There is no doubt in my mind as to who that boy's Father was. But he is so close in age as to when He died. It's almost mind boggling. I am conflicted. Perhaps I shall watch this family more. All I know is that I cannot go into Neriak, and I cannot go from whence I came. I am a child of the Night. In the forest.<br>
<br>
The boy is odd. I almost wonder what it is like, to have a little brother. I am going insane. I am so lonely..<br>
