So Rare usefull items are a bit pricey.<br>Limited Twinking : Folks have one character per account so demand for items is cut by 1/2 to 7/8ths.<br>No (no drop) : FBSS for example now has to compete price wise with hangmans noose, and plane of Air belts.

All very good points.  Prices right now are lower than usual....for some items.  They will be higher for others but I think you are going to see items here will be less for the most part than other servers....case in point was brought up earlier.  The FBSS/Hangman's noose.  Now that the Hangmans noose is sellable....and to my understanding  Easier to get as a druid can kite this thing and get them rather readily....not that druids do that kind of thing in TT....YEAH RIGHT.  This noose IMHO is actually better overall than the FBSS and will drive the price down by its availability.  Im sure no one will bitch over that because that damn FBSS camp suxxors.  <br><br>Other now-droppable items will affect prices in the same way...for example the 2hs off the named dragon in Cobalt star will be dropable and that dragon will begin to be pharmed by upper guilds on a regular basis.  That sword has haste and it drops 2 of them at a time on a regular basis.  Once they hit the markets they will be worth more than the mith two-hander and its price will fall etc etc etc.<br><br>I too hand out lots of gear.

I cant run back to EC Tunnel on my old server and /shout PC on whatever... because that has absolutely no relevance here. Our economy is exactly that... OURS. Im not suggesting that we disregard any previous knowledge of of trade skill creation we may have. I've been a master baker and it can be somewhat tedious and time consuming for a non-foraging race to try to make cookies. So I will gladly pay someone for a stack of eggs. I am also well aware of the difficulty of obtaining blue diamonds, and the outrageous cost of trying to reach 250 jewel crafting, so I will gladly pay over and above the &quot;cost&quot; of making a velium blue diamond pendant.<br><br>But also consider this, I have no desire to &quot;buy&quot; any of my gear, other than stat jewelry. I am green right now, /cheer, I'll be gold when I can quest my armor, I'll surely be rainbow colors after that, then when the time comes, I'll be purple. It will be more fun to enter PoH, fight with my guild for the first time, and don a beautiful pair of purple pants after a narrowly escaped victory, than to pay someone (enter going rate here for cleric PoH pants) say &quot;Thank You&quot; in whatever language they know and wander over to the 20-30's zone of the week. <br><br>I think the role play atmosphere of this server will effect all this &quot;price check&quot; stuff before anything or anyone else does. Cause it doesn't make too much sense in a story line for a level 25 cleric to be wearing planar armor, and the &quot;generous benefactor&quot; story will just get old and tired real fast. <p><center> <img src="C:\Janet\EverQuest Stuff\Firona Vie\Roawensig2test.jpg"> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unakath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nakath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 12:02:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Forewarned</span><hr size=1> oh, I agree with most all of the response points.<br><br>I just wanted to rant.

I think that most people past level five realize that pretty fast and adapt.  I remember when people were trying to sell stacks of batwings for five plat on day two of the server and I got tired of pointing out how idiotic that was.  Eventually they noticed.  Less than a week ago I cleared out all the batwings on vendors in Felwithe and Kelethin to powerskill baking.  I must have bought 400 (and skilled my baking to 135) at 1 silver per, or 2 gold per stack.

You'll need to use a mule or bribe someone to buy your supply for you, though.<br><br>Sooo, I've always wondered why people pay for them from newbies when you can just nab all you need from the shops at about 1/10th the cost and with zero /auc'ing hassles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 4:36:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Forewarned</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Price checks are similary Gay (in the 7th grade sense, not in the lifestyle choice sense). &gt;&gt;<br><br>Your disclaimer doesn't let you off the hook, I'm afraid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhalus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 10:21:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just an FYI ..</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;Sooo, I've always wondered why people pay for them from newbies when you can just nab all you need from the shops at about 1/10th the cost and with zero /auc'ing hassles. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Because we were all newbies once too?<br><br>Halus<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoinfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coinfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 5:33:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Forewarned</span><hr size=1> Yes sliver being austrailian makes you unamerican it simply makes you austrailian, besides i thought you were french =)<br><br>Bump.<br><br>Coinfist<br>Champion of Resolution <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uazdonsoulforger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azdon Soulforger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 4:28:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Forewarned</span><hr size=1> Hehe my 2 cents...1 char one of each item...everyone will eventually have what they want/need and market = NOTHING none buying/selling cause we'll all be lvl 60 with full Gear or restarting a lvl 1 with full gear HAHA 1 player per server does not stop twinking it just stops the market for items <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhalus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 10:56:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Forewarned</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;we'll all be lvl 60 with full Gear or restarting a lvl 1 with full gear HAHA 1 player per server does not stop twinking it just stops the market for items &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>I've been playing for a couple years, and never even considered getting a character to 60 with full Gear, and I doubt I would have restarted her if I did. One player per server definitely stops twinking.<br><br>You've got a point about market stagnation with the single character limit, but I think the low server population is going to be the limiting factor in any kind of market.<br><br>But, beyond trade skills, I could care less if there was no market.

Let's say that there are 3000 people that play on this server (no, not all at once - 3K that play a few hours each week).<br><br>If the Frenzied Ghoul dropped four FBSS's per day, it'll take two years for everyone to get one.  If Nagafen is killed every week and ALWAYS dropped the Treasure Hunter's Satchel, it'd be 57 years before everyone here had one.<br><br>Dumb examples?  Sure.  <br><br>The point is that items that are limited by spawn times (almost every high-end item out there) will always be rare.  They may indeed be more commonly seen on FV than on other servers due the one-account rule, but there will still be supply and demand here - there is no end-game where planar armor is littering the ground outside the gates of Freeport because newbies are all clad in Velious gear.<br><br>Not everyone is going to want everything, but if you say that only one fifth of the server population wants any one item, then you are still talking years of effort before demand is satiated, and that is not going to happen.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=193.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=193.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=193.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=193.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
