Invariably, a few people will quit playing Everquest. Many others will simply give up on their caster, and play something else. But in the long run, I honestly believe today's patch is the single most important thing Sony has done towards keeping EQ healthy and alive for years to come.<br>
<br>
First, the facts:<br>
<br>
1) KEI was an exploit, and today's patch fixed this exploit. Yes, it was a convenient exploit, and yes, it made the game easier, and yes, it went for a long time before being fixed. But the fact of the matter remains; they didn't &quot;nerf&quot; KEI, they <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">fixed</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> it.<br>
<br>
2) KEI prevented new players from learning to properly play their class. (I will allow for exceptions, but I don't think anyone will disagree that this is the rule rather than an exception to the rule.) This is something I've been noticing for quite a while... Casters no longer seem to know much about playing their class. KEI allowed for an endless supply of mana. Often, casters solo more than group, given such a condition. This was essentially creating &quot;10 day wonders&quot; who'd get a shot of SoW, Temp, and KEI before running off to make their next three levels. The Plane of Knowledge allowed for fast transportation to their buffs and back to hunting lands, and all-of-the-sudden these young casters are finding themselves in the mid-level range, without a clue on how to properly play.<br>
<br>
3) KEI allowed any zone to be &quot;that zone&quot;. We all know about &quot;that zone&quot;... once upon a time, it was the Oasis followed by HighHold Keep. Kunark brought us the Lake of Ill Omen followed by Overthere, followed by Dreadlands. Luclin gave us Paludal Caverns, and finally Planes of Power gave &quot;that zone&quot; to 50+, by way of any tier one plane. These zones are focal points for all the people who are inept and inefficient, because even inept and inefficient people can level up here. (Those who are capable still come to these zones, yes, but they must deal with the trains, KSing, camp fights, etc, brought on by the cesspool of others... and I'm sure most of us leave the zone-wide channels off when in &quot;that zone&quot;.) With KEI's endless mana, anywhere was doable by an inept and inefficient player.<br>
<br>
4) KEI allowed for much faster character advancement. (Duh, yes, you know that... but let me make my point.) With more mana, people were able to get more kills, which means more loot and more experience. Everyone loves that, right? Well, my friends, it is no coincident that Sony waited for the experience bonus patch to fix KEI. They let it go unfixed for so long because they *knew* the massive unrest it would cause.<br>
<br>
Today's patch fixes all of these problems, with the exception of &quot;that zone&quot;. With a once-again limited supply of mana, new casters will have to learn to conserve, and be efficient with what they have to work with. Healers will no longer be available to constantly heal, despite mistakes made by their group-mates. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hopefully</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> chain-nukers will now rethink their ways... additionally, casters might just learn how to help handle their aggro. Aggro is not the tank's responsibility, it's a group responsibility.<br>
<br>
Without the ability to solo as efficiently, many will be &quot;forced&quot; to group, if they want to advance their character as quickly as possible. By taking away the endless mana and high HP buffs, people will once again have to learn from mistakes the hard way, through death... which kinda ensures that they'll want to learn, and not repeat with more death. Groups will once again learn to be an efficient team of players who work together, something that I feel is painfully lacking in many characters at the high end of modern EQ.<br>
<br>
Without KEI, no longer can any zone be &quot;that zone&quot;... we shall once again have all the inept experience whores (not to be confused with the &quot;efficient-and-sexy experience whores&quot;, of which I myself am a member,) bottled up into those few zones where the experience bonus is already insane. I imagine that the other zones, deemed &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;not worth it&quot; will stay that way, still allowing for amazing experience gains by an efficient group that knows what it's doing. (My condolences to all of us who formerly enjoyed Planes of Power, however... it appears as though the masses who plagued tier one zones will be moving up. ::cringes:: Ah well, at least we're not forced to hunt PoP for experience, nowadays.)<br>
<br>
The new group-experience bonus will allow for faster advancement, making up for the perceived loss of KEI. It will also encourage grouping, and branching out to take all classes, not just those essential ones. Soloers can still solo if they want, solo experience wasn't nerfed. Even the planes of power weren't nerfed that bad, so I think this is a true win-win situation.<br>
<br>
I fondly recall the early days of this game, and think that through the changes we see today, EverQuest is back on track to being the group-oriented game that it once was.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Sony, for finally rewarding the players who group, and finally taking away the KEI that prevented new players from learning their class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=opir>Opir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/11/03 4:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4465.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The 6/11 patch, and long-term effects for EQ (long post)</span><hr size=1> It wont hurt the pre-45 crowd all that much.

Do you think caster (especially wizard / mage) will group more now with this change ? <br>
<br>
Answer : NOT AT ALL.<br>
<br>
Kei was the twinking method of caster. During a fight, a normal wizard, mage will have to only nuke once otherwise he will go oom in no time. Compare now a melee using weapon that can be gotten in higher lvl zone (ie : a normal lvl 30 will never use 10/20 or better ratio weapon on a newly server), you will see the melee will do much more dmg than the wizard and the dmg will be continue for them. <br>
<br>
Now will you chose the wizard/mage (without any kei) or the twink melee to lvl ? My bet is most people will take the melee in 90% of the time at least.<br>
<br>
Guess now i can go back to quadding and med 10 min between each fights. Sigh.<br>

Notice I have not said 100%. Sometimes you will get hard heads that won't listen. Sometimes you have no choice but to find another group.<br>
<br>
The main thing every group needs, even with friends and guildies is a competent leader. Someone who has a plan. They might not even know the zone but if they plan for the unexpected then they have some clue what to do.<br>

I agree largely with the original poster however...<br>
<br>
The fundamental problem is Groups and grouping - they are very nearly broken for some classes - pick up groups are awful (exceptions sure but still..), who wants to spend hours upon hours LFG? People want to play not to fart around time wasting. I have heard of rogues spending many many hours LFG over a weekend and they are limited in soloing ability - and I know at least 3 personally who have quit because they cant solo, the groups are not there so they have no other choice - who wants to pay £8.50 a month to run around zones shouting LFG?<br>
<br>
This group XP increase (and solo nerf in the Planes) will not make more groups happen, it will not make those classes that already find it hard to get groups suddenly magically get them - all that will happen is that the people who soloed before will still solo now (but it will be slower and poorer XP) and those who grouped before will still group and reap the huge benefits this patch brings.<br>
<br>
Sony plainly does not like soloers or soloing and they seem to be doing their level best to remove as much of it as possible - but being Sony they do not address the fundamental problem and sort the group dynamic out (POP effectively wrote in stone the holy trinity based group and penalised any other group structure at all!).<br>
<br>
Increasing group XP will not fix it, whizzy new LFG tools will not help - they need to fiundamentally address their own vision and the mobs they put in the game.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=samildanachjownes>Samildanach Jownes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/12/03 7:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4465.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:Patch</span><hr size=1> I agree with most of the things mentioned by the original poster here. I think the KEI/buffing limit change is an excellent one and will boost the chances of lower level enchanters getting groups rather than receive the standard &quot;no thanks, we don't need you, our cleric already has KEI&quot; reply. And this is speaking as a high level Enchanter who (in theory anyway) stands to lose out financially from it.<br>
<br>
I can't really agree with the view that it will make it harder for Wizards and Magicians to get groups. As others said, there was life before KEI and to be honest on FV I have rarely, if ever seen people being rejected from groups based purely on their class if the group already has the essentials covered. I think it's easy to feel you aren't getting a group because of your class when a lot of the time it's not down to that (before anyone brings up the &quot;but you're an enchanter&quot; argument, I do also play a  magician and a necromancer).<br>
<br>
In my experience mostly it's because the groups are either happy as they are or waiting on friends/guildmates to join them later. If they don't want extra people then they don't want extra people, be it wizard, mage, enchanter or even cleric. Of course that may change now with the group bonus, which was also a great boost.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I personally take a Wizard or Magician as a damage dealer as often as any DPS melee. Clearly they don't offer the same constant damage output but they offer &quot;good enough&quot; damage for me, provide other utility and more people to talk to is always good.

Not true for all of POP.  <br>
<br>
I make my own groups in POP every single night, and more often than not, my groups do not contain more than 2 of the &quot;holy trinity&quot;.  I have done groups without warriors or enchanters (I am a cleric, third member of the triad) and performed just fine.  <br>
<br>
Case in-point.  When I came home from work yesterday, my girlfriend was grouped in PON.  Her group consisted of : an SK, a shaman, a beastlord, a mage and her (a druid).  NO TRINITY.  And they were kicking the crap out of everything they pulled.  Strategy and solid players made that group work, shaman slowed and helped the druid heal, SK feigned off adds.. beastlord used his regen/clarity for mana regen.. mage was an extra tank and a damn good nuker.  <br>
<br>
There are things that people need to rediscover in EQ.  I hope that this patch will, in time, aid in those revivals.  The value of Wizards, Mages and Necros to a group is immeasurable (granted they are skilled players).   When I build my groups, I always look for casters.  Beastlords are incredible... I am constantly amazed by the skill and abilities of the 2 skilled Beastlords that regularly frequent my XP groups.   Rogues... on the level with casters when I look for people to speed up the kills.  A skilled Rogue is a real asset.<br>
<br>
Not believing in the &quot;holy trinity&quot; has opened up my eyes to the vast opportunities that are available when LFG.  I rarely sit around anymore.  Log on, pop up the LFG window and start dropping tells.. next thing I know, I have a group.  Trinity or not, 9 out of 10 are productive.<br>

My experiance in Teir 1 planes other than Juctice is that you need:<br>
<br>
- Any Tank... SK etc work just as fine as warrior<br>
- Any slower is handy, not just enchanters<br>
- A Cleric<br>

<br>
You CANNOT fight the HARDEST things at your level without the required classes.  But you know... there are TONS of other THINGS to fight. TONS of other WAYS to fight.<br>
<br>
There are charm groups, there are chain pet groups, there are AE groups, there are ranged/root rot groups, there are aggro kiting groups, there are fear kiting groups.<br>
<br>
Example, I was in Valor last night for a short time.  When I got there we didn't have a tank. So things were rooted while the casters DoT'd and rangers shot it.  At 1/2 life people started nuking.  Things died pretty quick.  Yeah, not as fast as with a tank, but was still very productive.  Then a tank showed up and we switched gears.<br>
<br>
I've been hunting by the hedge in nightmare with a druid as healer.<br>
<br>
For those of you who can't seem to live without the tank/healer/slower combo... go ou tand learn how to play differently, you might enjoy it.<br>
<br>
And I've never heard anyone say &quot;Oh, we don't need a rogue&quot; because of any other reason than personal ones (didn't like the guy, waiting for friends, etc) or the fact that they didn't have the group to support it (5 person group with no healer at all, etc).<br>

You sir don't have a clue.<br>
<br>
Ok, I most often group with a cleric, as one is my wife.<br>
<br>
But warriors are not needed at all. Except for raids they really are second rate tanks compared to shadowknights and paladins. Instant and solid aggro is a huge thing.<br>
<br>
Chanters? Sure, you need someone with slow and haste to tank most things. Bard, chanter, shaman and even beastlord all work fine in this capacity.<br>
<br>
I've often grouped with a monk/shaman duo tanking anything in BoT/HoH/Valor that we wanted to exp off. Me and the wife trio with a bard on occasion, in BoT. Works fine. Level 63-64 mobs basically don't dent him.<br>
<br>
Had alot of ranger tanks in all mentioned zones, and not only rangers from uber guilds but average run of the mill 65 rangers.<br>
<br>
Druids and shaman both can heal well enough to replace cleric. Especially druid with their combination of fast heals and cheals. (Much like the cleric in fact.)<br>
<br>
KEI helps. Sure, but it's far from necessary. Ratched doesn't run low on mana even without KEI unless she is also pulling. Even beastlord mana regen buff allows her to keep ranger tanks up in HoH while she also pulls for the group and on occasion melees. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tartarussaignant>Tartarus Saignant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/12/03 9:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4465.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.victoria-dove.com/images/Gnomebird_small.jpg width=110 height=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch</span><hr size=1> Did a PoTactics Diaku group recently with:<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;I make my own groups in POP every single night, and <br>
&gt;more often than not, my groups do not contain more <br>
&gt;than 2 of the &quot;holy trinity&quot;. I have done groups without <br>
&gt;warriors or enchanters (I am a cleric, third member of &gt;the triad) and performed just fine. <br>
<br>
Totally agree. I think too many people have the Holy Trinity thing stuck in their heads. As it happens my regular hunting group is based around the trinity but i've done many PoP groups where I was the only one of these 3 classes present without any problems.<br>
<br>
As long as you're willing to be flexible and realise that while your group may have greater downtime or have to be more selective in picking targets then this need not stop it from functioning.<br>
<br>
Heals:<br>
<br>
A pseudo-CH capable druid or shaman works just fine for xp grinding in the planes, provided the player is comfortable in the role of healer. Paladins can also play main healers in a pinch (in Tier 1 anyway) under certain circumstances (e.g. they're not also the main tank, mob is slowed, etc).<br>
<br>
Slows:<br>
<br>
I've noticed people often won't do PoP groups without a &quot;real&quot; slower (Shaman or Enchanter). If i'm in a PoP group, especially a low DPS one where i'm keeping a charmed pet up and the healer's mana is good then I'll often switch from my best (70%) slow to my level 24 (50%) slow. So far, i've never actually had anyone notice the swap, or if they did, care about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Beastlords, bards and epic rangers are also perfectly viable slowers as are necromancers when fighting undead mobs.<br>
<br>
I've seen groups in Tier 1 and Tier 2 (CoD) without any form of slower at all working just fine. Sure, mana efficiency takes a big dive and your healer needs to concentrate more but it's workable.<br>
<br>
Tanks:<br>
<br>
Paladin, Warrior and Shadowknight are all equally viable for xp grinding (many would argue the warrior falls behind the other two) so no trinity requirement there. Monks and Rangers can actually tank PoP mobs a lot better than many people think too (with slow).<br>
<br>
Non-tank based, workable PoP groups (depending on location):<br>
<br>
- Pet based. No tank or healer class required. Pets tend to get chewed up pretty fast in PoP but can tank many mobs providing they are slowed.<br>
<br>
- Aggo kiting: snare + something to piss the mob off + any source of damage you like.<br>
<br>
- Fear Kiting: Many permutations here that don't have to involve any of the trinity.<br>
<br>
- Snare &amp; dot/nuke. No tank required.<br>
<br>
- Non-melee group with a charmed pet as main tank. Yes charmed pet xp has been nerfed and aggro issues make this a lot harder now but it is still possible (you may need to keep the target mob rooted and/or snared and have everyone sit well away from the mob).<br>
