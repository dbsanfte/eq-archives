I'll turn the bad word filter on for this one.<br><br>You're right. If this was like, Innoruuk or some other Server, I couldn't tell you how to play. Innoruuk is a server (And I'm just using Innoruuk for an example, for I can pretty much point to any other Server and say the same thing) where you go and have uber loot and do this and that, its where its supposed to be done.<br><br>But this is different.

Let me click on Quests..<br>Hey! ShadowKnight Epic!<br>Click!<br>Hey! What is this! Is it TELLING ME HOW TO DO IT?<br>Yes. Why I think it is.<br>So let me go out, bring like.. I don't know 20 or so people to each event. Point to the epic Monster. Hit A.<br>Go get a soda. Come back in about 5 Minutes. Epic Mob is dead, all is happy.<br>Because you know what? Thats all I did on Epic Mobs.<br>Even doing things to work on my epic (Which I didn't FEEL like getting) was just a big Yawn.<br><br>I fall asleep on Planes raids. Why? Because its not hard work, its flat out Boring.<br><br>Its like an EQ Scavenger hunt. Go around. Pick up pieces of a Quest. Turn it in, recieve your prize.<br>Is it FnF or any Powergamer's fault its like this.<br>No.<br>But one thing for sure. Don't come at me OOC and say an Epic is Hard work, because in reality, its not.<br><br>You need one thing and one thing alone for Epics.<br>Time.<br><br>You say, you have the right to play on this server.<br><br>I say you are just manipulating Verant, who really worded this server incorrectly, because they don't want to admit that their other servers failed them and their Vision.<br><br>I say you don't, Quxx.<br>Do I have friends on FV?<br>Yeah, I'm sure I have some.<br>Are some of them playing Good?<br>Yes sire.<br>Am I powerleveling/assisting them?<br>Nope.<br>Are they assisting me?<br>Nope.<br>We RP. We fight. Then when all is done, and EQ is off, we go outside and have a soda or somethin.<br>Thats no excuse.<br><br>RP. Its a time honed skill, but it does require two things.<br>Effort and an Imagination.<br>Its hard not typing in short hand.<br>I know it for a fact, because sometimes I'm suspect of it a little.<br>Its just little things, like CT instead of Cazic Thule Temple.<br>Or MM instead of Mistimore.<br>Or OMW instead of On My Way.<br><br>And you know what? I really don't care if you use Arcos. I'd perfered if people didn't, but their are some people that are Learning how to Roleplay.<br><br>And more power to them.<br><br>But Guilds like FnF? I'm sorry but I just don't buy it. <br>Now Qixx, you said you don't want to be that 'I'm Uberer then thou.' Attude?<br><br>But, what are you really saying when you broadcast an epic?<br><br>&quot;Lookie at what I got. And Lookie at what you don't. /flaunt /flaunt /flaunt Bow to me!&quot; <br><br><br>because I can look at an Everquest Cheat Page and Follow Directions.<br><br>By the way, www.innoruuk.com does it too. Just look at the Entry Page.<br><br>Share your loot?<br>Come on? What am I, a poor underprivagled EQ Toon? If this was the other post, I'd tell you where you could put your loot.<br><br>Its over. Enought is Enought. Pack up your little things, and go to an server that suits your needs.<br><br>And they are Generous now. Sure I bet you they are.<br><br>Wait till the Secont Uber guild pops up and starts competing for Space.<br>And the Third, and the 4th!<br><br>Soon, the Roleplayer will be snuffed out on this server.<br>We'll be mocked. Pointed at, told how much of 'Gimps' we are just because we do not want to Powergame.<br>Everquest is much more then you seem to relize.<br>And that will be a shame.<br><br>Uniting Roleplayers for the Cause of Enjoyment.<br><br><br>Games are fun. Games become unfun when someone walks in on everyones thats playing Pinoccle, and forces them to play Spades.<br><br>I'm playing Pinoccle.

However there are two things to consider. <br><br>First, these are your perceptions based on your style of roleplay - clearly you &quot;get into it&quot; and quite enjoy it...however I didn't get a How to RP on EQ servers guide with any product I bought from Verant.  Thus, we all have different styles of RP, some of us may have played pen and paper, some may have played Final Fantasy as their roleplay background...and some of us may not wanna RP at all.  FV is a roleplay PREFERRED server - end of sentence.<br><br>Second, you do not own the server, you do not have any special status on the server and you don't have the right to slander or harrass other player because they don't fit your vision.  You're looking at things from one angle my friend - someone in Fire and Fury posts that they got their epic and all you think is they are flaunting, all you can think is that everyone in Fire and Fury...or who doesn't adhere to your ideal of rp on this server is a greedy, powergaming, lewt whore...  <br><br>I'm not a defender of Fire and Fury or any other guild (me and my friends do our own thing on this server) but what I am a defender of is my right to utilize this game, for which I pay a subscription fee, any way that a choose, provided it doesn't violate the user agreement.  <br><br>Qixx posts a very innoffensive message and you railroad it.

To be honest I also believe that eventually we will become like that as well.  It starts out with one uber guild, then a second pops up.  Often these two will work together, but then a third shows up and decides they need to farm Venril Sathir for legs and screw the rotation...  What I do think is that this will take a long time on this server.  It took 8 months to get ugly on Luclin, it took a year on Torvonnilous to get real bad.  It could be two years here.  And i think we will never have the population of 60's that most servers do.   Many of us have been in the high end game on other servers and we came here to start fresh.  I am not in a hurry to get to those levels again, and I will never again be a serious raider.  Plane raids  = watching paint dry, like Shintou said.  I think the thing to really get from Shintou on this issue is that a certain amount of vigilance is needed.  We should't and can't bar people from playing here, nor tell them how to play with their money.  But While is FV is the (Roleplaying preffered) server, it really is the (doods discouraged) server and with luck the rulesets will keep out much of the trash. It seems to have worked in the low end game, perhaps it will also in the high end game.  I am bothered by posts that say things like &quot;remove anon&quot;, or &quot;TLC petition&quot; because though painfull this is what really keeps us the way we are.<br><br>Shintou has good points but they can't be enforced.

Where in the roleplayers rule set does it say:<br>Only the humble shall be considered role playing?<br><br>Would you not tell people in real life when your first son is born how proud a papa you are? Acknowleding an accomplishment, and reconizing others pride is called being sociable in my eyes. Roleplaying or real life.

Yep, sure it is.<br><br>Does the word prefered mean they absolutely have to? Nope, not at all.<br><br>If folks truly want a roleplay server I would suggest the test server. Great people there. All of them will roleplay back with you if you roleplay with them (most of those folks are GM's, guides, beta folks and some folks that are physically challenged). Low server population too, under 800 as I last saw. Either that or wait for Neverwinter Nights to come out.
