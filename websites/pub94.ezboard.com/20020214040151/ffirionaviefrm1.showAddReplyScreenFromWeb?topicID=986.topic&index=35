Me and a friend completed it 4 times before I outleveled it by helping each other.<br>
He took Edden since I had no real way of killing him, and I got Slittra since I could kill her.<br>
We took the halflings &quot;together&quot; (I watched at least and hit some) and bought our paintings, then we travelled all the way to Katta and completed our swords. All done in a few hours of game play and tons of fun.<br>
<br>
TLC does not punish high levels, rather forces alliances that would not really be an effective option otherwise.<br>
I am sure that Baku could just as well offer someone of the appropriate level to come with him and a friend to kill the particular monster and also get some insight into that particular place instead of offering his stick for trade.<br>
<br>
Ethereal warhammer me and a shaman friend helped with for free but got payment anyways after by the ones that needed the help. Once again an alliance that would not be an option otherwise.<br>
TLC becomes more of an obstacle then a real hindrance if you take some time to counter it effectivly instead of just buying the items.<br>
I did sell a quest item for a outrageous sum of money once, so I could repay a debt. But it was not a demand from my side and we could surely have worked it out without the money as well, paying out of your arse is not really a effective way around it, just the easy one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 12:33:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Uh, if you're worried about ..</span><hr size=1> .. Guk farmers, TLC would not stop them.  I don't think any of the nice frogs are trivial at 60.  Hmm, I remember goofing off in guk with my monk at around 55 and getting xp.  The names are higher level, so you can reach them from at least there.  Most of the nice farmable &quot;ebay&quot; fodder is not effected by TLC.  The big thing scaring farmers off is likely not TLC, but that they only have 1 character per account -- that's pretty limited as far as bank space goes.  They can't farm with one set of chars and play on another.<br>
<br>
I agree that TLC does not punish high levels much.  That's my point -- it encourages people to level up quickly.  It punishes the mid-levels severely.  Those levels where you can't afford to either pay someone to help or can't do the quest because it's blocked.  Casters don't learn the research skill until level 16.  A couple levels after that, they can't do the concordance quest themselves, but must pay for a GLS.  Even 10p is a huge sum at that level.<br>
<br>
No, the only real impact is on quests.  Can't do quest discovery.  Can't do quests yourself that were designed to be completed yourself.  Epics, for instance, were all designed with *starting* at level 50+ in mind and with the idea that most of the pre-work -- the ugly long camping -- would be solo.  With TLC, the common thought of &quot;I'll worry about my epic at 50&quot; could cut you off from ever obtaining it.  And, yes, epics are absolutely required for the high level game.<br>
<br>
Don't y'all care about the newbie folk that play the game more or less pure?  What about solving a quest yourself without a spoiler?  Isn't there anyone that likes do that instead of waiting for someone else to do all the work solving it for you and post it up all nice and tidy with levels and how-to's on the web?  Being first on a quest is a ton of work, but it's also a lot of fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 12:52:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin quests...</span><hr size=1> So far, I've enjoyed this server because of the overall TLC affect and not in spite of it. I think it's good that bottom-feeders have a measure of resistance here. At only level 26 I have not attempted many dungeons, but the few I have been in were completely farmer free. There's not much to farm in Kurns, but I can guarantee those few things are farmed heavily on any other server. It's quite fun to crawl a dungeon, as opposed to exploring it from the zone line via an ooc camp check role call. Anyway, I am strongly opposed to any change that would cause FV to become just another blue server.<br>
<br>
TLC is not that long of a row to hoe. The example made in the opening post of a high level monk offering a trade to a low level quester is good. However, contrary to the posters intent, the example demonstrates how easily TLC works for all of us. I'm appalled that such an honorable, allbeit generous, solution is now insulted and twisted to fuel this lukewarm ember of something that is supposed to be a fire.<br>
<br>
I out leveled a few drops in the shackle quest. I guess that makes me effected by TLC. The quest is unaffected though. It still requires the same components as it always did, and they still drop at the same rate every time the mob dies. If I want to continue this quest, I will. I'll use any one of the solutions found in each and every one of these threads. Until you can prove that Quest X stops here and there is no way around it because of TLC, then you have no argument against TLC. Well, except for the argument that you can't do it all alone. But that sounds awfully petty, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
To me, a good challenge will have me asking a simple question. How bad do I want it? The best challenges will have me ask it a few times.<br>
