You've been trolling these boards and complaining about the Mods since before I did the job, and that was a *Long* time ago.  The answer always has been exactly the same.  Jaxy has no obligation to provide the kind of board you want.  She's providing the kind of board she wants, and I and many others choose to support it by being here.  If you don't like it go start your own damn board, and we'll see how many folks like your style of &quot;constructive&quot; argument enough to come by and support it.  No, don't worry about us here on Jaxy's boards, we'll get by just fine without you.  Don't let the door smack you on the ass on your way out.<br>

You are here at Jaxy's pleasure.  [bold] However [/bold] I would hope the goal of this (or any other message board) is to facilitate the free expression of ideas.  If it's not, what is the point of ever bothering to express yourself?   Why go through the effort to post here under the pretense of freedom of expression when you can see you really have none because of the moderation/ownership? <br>
<br>
My suggestion isn't that the moderators need to be replaced, it's that they need to do their job, without ado, without taunting, and without ego.  Unfortunately, we've already seen that must be incredibly tough for some of the mod's, because mostly they [bold] enjoy [/bold] banning people with whom they disagree.  To me, that isn't right.  Agree or disagree, respect or disrespect, and even love or hate, people should be treated as equitably as possible by the mod's.  That's their job.  They aren't doing it very well, but that doesn't mean that they can't.<br>
<br>
I don't own the board, I don't run the board, and I certainly don't moderate the board, but that doesn't mean that my opinions (or everyone else's opinions) have no bearing or weight.  I would hope that the owner of the board would be more interested in the liberty of the board users to say their opinions, than whether they agree with the opinion.<br>

And it's not new mods we need, it's new posters. Half the people on here couldn't think their way through a door, much less type out a thoughtful, coherent post.<br>
<br>
In response to Zel. That's all well and good, but what is a moderators job then? As near as I can see from what your posting, it's to........what? Stay out of the way? Add new posting areas? If it is not to do the job they are currently doing, then what would it be? Personally I think they let people get away with much more than I would. Reading the same exact posting rules they do, I would interpret them much harsher. They draw a more lenient line then I would, but I gather you would have them draw an even softer line on what's posted. At that point we are now arguing not the rule, but how we would want the rule interpretted. Just because we would interpret it differently does not mean that one is bad, or not doing the job right, but merely doing it differently than you or I. <br>
<br>
To me, most of the complaining falls into the &quot;Peach Pie is best&quot; area. It's not a fact, it's an opinon. Some people hate peach pie. Some think pumpkin is best. The people on SZ prefer Twinkies.<br>

<br>
To a certain extend.  Obviously there are going to be limits, like someone couldn't go around calling people racial epitaphs or threatening to kill someone.  Just like you can't yell fire in a theatre.  They might need to close a thread here or there in cases where people &quot;cross the line&quot;.<br>
<br>
A perfect example of bad modding... the final warning thread.  It should have been closed immediately after it was posted.  I can almost see the need to post that someone was on their final warning (I did say almost), but it should have been closed off there.  I would prefer an email to the person.  Same with banning.  No need to flog someone publically (really, banning shouldn't ever happen unless someone goes way over the edge, hurting others or threatening to hurt others).  Definately no need for morons to discuss how big an idiot the person in question is.<br>

Personally, I think that there are too many personal attacks on this board. They let it go with the broad stroke approach however. I'd almost say it's time to make the Soapbox a restricted zone, and then let it be Free For All.<br>

<br>
If you are getting warned or banned you have  done somehting against the community or the members of it.<br>
So people can see what the reprocussions of certain actions and behaviors are. Maybe they can learn hey this is unacceptable on the board.<br>

No way in hell I would ever be a mod over something like The Soapbox. Take out the politics, the histories, the lack of recognition or reimbursement, and the wide-open expanse of criticism whenever you make one of the 4 billion daily inevitably-controversial decisions you have to make, and the job is still a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Do I agree with every decision they make? Hell no. There are too many grey areas that they have to make decisions about daily for anyone to agree with them unilaterally. But whether I agree with them or not, I always respect them for the energy they invest into making this board, and by proxy the server, a superior environment in which to communicate ideas, opinions, and information in a mod(erately) civil manner.<br>
<br>
More people should try it before suggesting we get new ones. I think they're doing a good job.<br>

<br>
A good moderator will make the rules crystal clear, will enforce them consistantly and uniformly (as much as they are able given time constraints, etc) and fairly.  I think our mods have been doing a great job in the time I've been here, but I still think there's room for improvement.  The most important thing is that they seem to be learning as they go.<br>
<br>
I've seen a board fall apart due to moderators taking the wrong approach towards a close knit posting base of users.  I've seen that same board come back and become active again because of a change in moderation.  Moderators do make a difference to a board.  Bad moderation is far easier to see than good moderation, however.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1513<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/16/02 12:40:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1385.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I want new Mods</span><hr size=1> Ermok never bitched about my modding, Val.<br>

Don't confuse the fact that you complained about something and got your way with anyone actually caring what you have to say or giving a damn about keeping you happy.  You complain about damn near everything.  Sooner or later something you complained about is going to end up being reversed, most likely in spite of the fact that it has the incidentle side-effect of making you momentarily less of a miserable sod.  You are hard enough to tolerate as it is, please don't start having delusions of relevancy.<br>

And you know what happens if he doesn't?  He warns someone in private, then bans them, and then a bunch of you  know-it-all  hotshots spend a month complaining on the board how someone was banned without even a warning.  You can't have it both ways.  I think it's fair to give someone a public warning so all can see what lines have been crossed and what rules are being defended.<br>
<br>
The truth is, they don't have to give a warning, and they don't have to give explanations.  But they do.  You should appreciate that.<br>
<br>
Once again, this isn't a democracy.  Free Speech is not a right here.  You want free speech, go find yourself a nice street corner, or start your own board.  The thing is, you guys don't want the responsibility of running a board, so you keep coming here and then complaining about how this one is run.  Well, put you're money where your mouth is.  You think there's a better way, start your own board.  <br>
