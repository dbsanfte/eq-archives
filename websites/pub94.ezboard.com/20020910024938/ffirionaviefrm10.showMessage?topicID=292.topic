I<br>
loved my father, but we had often had our differences.  I am Teapray, daughter of the<br>
noble House of Cinderwind, first born to one of the Lords of Felwithe, and I was<br>
about to make a stand.<br>
   My father entered the room, and seemed surprised to see me there.  &quot;Are you not<br>
supposed to at your studies in the wizard guild, Teaflame?&quot;<br>
   Teaflame.  The name he had given me upon my birth.  It was obvious to him, even<br>
before I was born, that I would follow in his footsteps to become a mighty wizard. <br>
He had never even bothered to ask me if my heart would willingly lead my feet upon<br>
this path.  &quot;No,&quot; I said evenly.<br>
   He stopped and gave me hard look.  &quot;Teaflame, you know very well...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Teapray.&quot;  He blinked at me, obviously taken at a loss.  &quot;I have been accepted<br>
into the Order of Tunare.  I have chosen to be a healer, rather than embrace the<br>
power of fire and ice.&quot;<br>
    He held his anger in check, as skill that he, like all powerful wizards,<br>
maintained at to not turn to ash all that dared displease him.  &quot;Young lady, Tarker<br>
Blazetoss and I have both agreed that you shall be most...&quot;<br>
    &quot;Stop!&quot; I shouted. Unlike my father, I had not yet mastered complete control of<br>
my emotions.  &quot;It is not up to Tarker Blazetoss, nor it is up to you.  My name is<br>
Teapray, and I am a cleric.&quot;  He took a deep breath to further argue the point, but I<br>
held up my hand.  &quot;There's more.&quot;<br>
    I could see in his eyes that he didn't want to hear it, but he said nothing.  &quot;I<br>
have fallen in love, and I am going to get married as soon as I reach the Age of<br>
Self-Destiny.&quot;  Of course, my father had arranged a marriage for me, to a very<br>
promising young wizard, from a family that was almost as prestigious as our own. <br>
&quot;His name is Lenny.&quot;  The stony silence was almost painful. &quot;He's a warrior.&quot; <br>
Father's nose  flared slightly.  There were paladins amongst the elite of High Elves<br>
of Felwithe, but no warriors.  I took a deep breath, then another.  &quot;He's an ogre.&quot; <br>
Silence.  &quot;I love him, Daddy, and he loves me.  He's not like the others of his<br>
kind.  He has a good heart under his coarse manners.  I don't care what others think<br>
of him, or of us! &quot;<br>
   To my surprise, Father started to laugh.  But he stopped quickly, when he saw that<br>
did not join him.  He stood stunned for a moment, then exploded in a flurry of<br>
words.  I had never seen him loose his temper before, and I was scared. He told me<br>
that Lenny would never be accepted in Felwithe, or even that city of chittering tree<br>
squirrels, Kelethin.  Even the base humans would shun him.  Even my own guild would<br>
be obliged to kill him if they were able.  And I would not be welcome in any of the<br>
festering pits of evil that such a creature might find sanctuary in.  If I continued<br>
with this madness, I would bring shame to every High Elf in Norrath, and especially<br>
to the house of Cinderwind.  And especially to him.<br>
   I did not attempt to stop the torrent of words.  When he finally ran out, I simple<br>
said &quot;I know.  I accept this.  Perhaps, in time, we will change the prejudices of the<br>
narrow-minded, such as your self.&quot;<br>
   To his credit, he did not unleash any of his fearsome powers.  He struggled with<br>
his fury for a minute, or perhaps it was an eternity.  &quot;Get out,&quot; he finally said, in<br>
a calm voice that was low with the menace of barely suppressed rage.  &quot;Leave my<br>
house.  Take nothing with you but the clothes you wear.  Take off your gems.  Take<br>
them off now, and leave your coinpurse!&quot;  I nodded, trying not to cry.  My  jewelry<br>
really was quite pretty, and I had never gone without a bag of coins at my side<br>
before.  I laid everything of value I had upon his desk.  Soon I was dressed in<br>
nothing but the pretty blue house dress and shoes that was in the current fashion of<br>
the Felwithe maidens.  &quot;Now leave, and never come to this house again!&quot;<br>
   I nodded, then turned and ran out the door.  I was so scared that I could scarcely<br>
breathe, but also I feel something I couldn't ever remember having felt before.  I<br>
felt free.  There were tears in my eyes as I left my father's house for the last<br>
time, but also laughter in my heart as I ran to where my Beloved Lenny lay hidden in<br>
the forest, waiting for me and for our adventures to begin.<br>
