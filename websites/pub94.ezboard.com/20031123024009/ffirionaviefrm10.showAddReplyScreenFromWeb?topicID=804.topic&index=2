The recent influx of trolls had forced most of the occupants to seek lodging elsewhere, only the most desperate and tenacious remained.<br>
<br>
“I am back from slaughtering paladins in West Karana mother!” Maelgroth shouted as he pulled aside the ragged curtain that separated the shack from the street. He carefully stepped over Jabaner the house guardian. The poor skeletal pet had seen better days, most of his ribs were missing and the local children had “decorated” him once again, replacing his rusted halberd with a toilet plunger.<br>
<br>
“My son, it is good to see you have returned.” Naelaelayle whispered. She was an old Teir Dal, the servant who had rescued Maelgroth those many years ago when his family had lost their position. She invited him further into the room with a gnarled hand, and twitched her good ear into a better position.<br>
<br>
“Where is my brother, Malingrad?” Maelgroth asked with some degree of trepidation. Malingrad was the natural son of Naelaelayle, and more than a little jealous of his mother’s continued loyalty to a fallen house. Mael had taken his position at the lodge of the dead, leaving Malingrad to make his way in the world as an assassin.<br>
<br>
“He is out, gathering information, preparing for The Day.” Naelaelayle hissed. The Day had become an obsession with her, becoming more urgent and important as the aged Teir Dal slipped into cronehood. She knew it was only a matter of time before she died, to a drunken Troll, an accident in the forest or simple old age and disease. She drove her sons relentlessly.<br>
<br>
“Where is Blisshadow?” the Necromancer queried as he opened his backpack and began to remove its contents.<br>
<br>
“Your sister has left us, she did not see the value of revenge.” His mother growled. It was the same answer every time he asked about her. He knew that Bliss was a point of serious concern for the whole family, as the only eligible female, she would take over when his mother died. She continued after stifling a dry cough, “She still seeks power through the clergy, forgetting who she is and where she came from.”<br>
<br>
“I have brought you some food…” Maelgroth said as he began to lay out the supplies he had collected. When he was a youth, they had subsisted off whatever they could scavenge, now it was with some pride that he presented real food to his mother. Sure it was simple peasant fare but it was better than rat tail stew.<br>
<br>
As his mother ate, with all the delicacy an elder matron of a noble house, he looked about the one room shack. Rats had long learned not to come here, lest they end up in the stewpot. Curtains divided the single room into sections each barely large enough for a pallet to sleep on. It was fortunate that the Teir Dal could see so well in the dark, no fire provided light or heat, it cost too much. Maelgroth had learned to read in darkness. <br>
<br>
“Tell me of our enemies.” Naelaelayle sighed, as she did each time she asked. It was a daily ritual when her children were growing up. Each day it was the same, each day his mother seemed to gain strength from its being repeated.<br>
<br>
“House Chath’elg’Caress (the Fire Hags) lives in 3rd gate, where we used to have housing for our cousins. House Sol’Calar (the Eye Eaters) live in 2nd gate our first ancestral home. House Vlos’Shannaal (the Blood Chalice) lives in the shrine to Innoruk built by my family.” Maelgroth paused for the requisite time to let the enormity of what he was to say next to register. “House Ragar’Golhyrr (the Truth Finders) rests in our rightful place both in our home and in the eyes of the court.”<br>
<br>
“It is good to have such a dutiful son.” His mother whispered. “Tell me now what is the real name of the Ragar’Golhyrr?” By this she meant the meaning of their house name before they rose to the 3rd gate. In Teir Dal it was all about inflection, the same words with the right inflection could mean a hundred different things, all similar, yet different, names to the Teir Dal were like onions, each had a hundred layers.<br>
<br>
“They Uncover Tricks, matron they are snitches.” Maelgroth replied with considerable venom. Of the four houses the most hatred was reserved for the Ragar’Golhyrr who had seamlessly assumed the position of the Waes’Harventhars. Rising from the reviled position of snitch to that of torturer within a generation. Now they squatted like a bloated spider in 3rd gate garnering the respect and wealth due the Waes’Harventhars. It was even rumored they accepted bribes to determine the length of the torture.<br>
<br>
“You know, between the three of us children, we could easily afford to move you to 2nd gate.” Mael began carefully, it was an old argument, but it was one that he refused to loose. It would be a tragedy if some accident were to befall his mother before the family could extract vengeance.<br>
<br>
“I will rest in my old quarters in 3rd gate or I will die in this shack!” Naelaelayle howled.<br>
<br>
“As you wish.” Mael deferred.<br>
<br>
“Do you know there is a young maiden of the Chath’elg’Caress that has reached the age of marriage?” his mother said with a sweet smile.<br>
<br>
“Have they opened their house to suitable courtiers?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed they have, an announcement was posted in 3rd gate just yesterday.” She reached into the folds of her dress and removed an invitation. “Your brother was able to acquire this from the Ragar’Golhyrr, they would never consider an alliance with such trash, and it was easy to rescue this item from their care. <br>
<br>
The matron stood from her rocking chair slowly and hobbled over to a large chest that had been sealed all Mael’s life, she carefully removed a small key and opened the chest. It was protected by more than a lock, powerful wards glimmered momentarily before fading.<br>
<br>
“Long have I kept these things in preparation, as you progress more heirlooms of your house shall be returned to you, but you will have need of some of this now.” She carefully removed several packages, each wrapped in spider silk and each apparently as fresh as the day they were first put in the chest.<br>
<br>
First there was a simple black robe, made of spider silk, the tailoring was exquisite but in a style that had gone out of fashion a century ago. It would cause quite a stir, however, since a similar fashion was currently all the rage, and it was apparent that the younger generation had no idea they were actually aping a much older style.<br>
<br>
Next she handed him a simple mask made of bone. “In the old days, great houses wore masks to avoid embarrassment when courting other houses.” Her gnarled hands caressed the mask with great fondness. “I think it is time that we bring this tradition back.”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth dressed carefully in the clothing, it fit him well, though the robe did not radiate magic. The mask had a slight aura about it, and it grafted to his face with no trouble and remained there. He was amazed that his mother had access to such wealth, yet had not made use of it during all their hardships, it spoke volumes about her loyalty to his house.<br>
<br>
His mother handed him the knife last, it was made from the tooth of a walrus and it was as sharp as sin. As he cloaked himself in shadows and left the shack, he heard his mother whisper, “win her heart…”<br>
