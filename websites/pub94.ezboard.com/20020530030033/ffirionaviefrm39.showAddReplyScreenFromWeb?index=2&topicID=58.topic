What I was trying to explain, and Vallaen did much better than I, is we really just didn't take this 'reservation' seriously.  Most of us, before this, didn't even know the address for this board.  So, based on a post on our board trying to get people for an open naggy raid, I really didn't think it would happen.  And even so, is that all it takes to reserve a mob?  Can I post here and say &quot;Hey, I got Naggy reserved from here until the end of time, and if anyone kills him they're a big fat jerk!&quot;  Or can I reserve any number of mobs that we don't yet have the power to kill and get mad when someone who can kill them does?  Anyway, I hope I can find the self-restraint not to post about this anymore.  As far as honor, there were no agreements made or violated.  I really am sorry for the people who were planning on going on the raid, and to Oogmog, but I maintain we did not break any rules, treaties or etiquette. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uattumadabeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Attuma Dabeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/2/02 7:44:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misconceptions about Naggy</span><hr size=1> DA would never rush in and kill whatever mob just to ruin someone elses party.That being said planning a raid on a mob that spawns every 7 days two weeks from now is just not going to work.Those guilds that can get the fire power to kill said mob right away should not have to plan it so they kill it so it pops whenever so and so had it planned for.<br>
<br>
 I would suggest if you want to make a naggy raid and whatever future big raid dont make them for in two weeks from now see if said mob is up and then start putting it together.This is they way it has been done on many other servers and will be done on this one also.Claiming a mobs two weeks from now is just crazy and not fair to those who want to kill it but cant because they would mess up your raid?<br>
<br>
This can be taken as a flame which is fine but i think of it as a healthy dose of common sense.<br>

I have played on at least four servers now, and all of them have had some type of calendar or rotation system to allow folks to schedule raids in advance.  I've never seen anyone schedule something like &quot;Hi, I'm booking ToV for the next two years&quot;.  People generally are reasonable about their plans, and if they aren't, other people let them know.  This helps keep guilds from colliding over zones, mobs, etc and causing the kind of thing we are seeing here.  There are always rules about what happens if the day comes and the group scheduled to raid can't do it. <br>
<br>
Basically, if we were to follow the thoughts of several of the posts from your guild in both threads, is that the only people who deserve to do raids are those with large enough and mobile enough guilds to respond the instant things pop (FFA), and forget anyone who is trying to create an event bringing multiple guilds together.  And this is fair .. how?  It's not, it's what you are suggesting because it's a lot easier on you than trying to cooperate with multiple guilds on this server and *gasp* schedule your events around other people.  And I take it you enjoy these arguments about who had rights to the mob, because that's what FFA gets you.  <br>
<br>
I have seen in several posts a general sense of disdain for this message board and its relation to the FV community.  Your guild may want to look through some of the posts and see the names of some of the major contributors on these message boards - guild leaders from most, if not all of the major guilds (and a good portion of the smaller guilds) all participate here. That should tell you something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/3/02 2:25:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misconceptions about Naggy</span><hr size=1> Attuma... and how do you expect an open raid to take place if people can't plan in advance without guilds taking the mob anyways? what about all the non-guilded people out there? they dont have any guildchat or any way of mass communication to get people together for a raid. open raids HAVE to be planned.<br>

<br>
It seams that many of the people who play on FV are long time players of EQ or know the game well now that being said<br>
trying to stick a lable on a guild as uber or greedy or just rude has been done to death.<br>
<br>
I myself have been in the *uber* guilds the small family guilds and the guildless and the one thing i notice about the guilds that cant do the plane raids or the end game uber mobs they all do the same thing....They bitch and whine and cry and point fingers and say how its someone eleses fault.<br>
<br>
So here is a novel thought lets say your in a guild who just cant do naggy by yourselves or fear or whatever how about getting together 3-4 guilds make a dam alliance and then guess what? you will have your 30 50+ that can do all these great things but no people just love to bitch and point fingers and lable guilds as *uber* greedy evil ruining everything in their path guilds.<br>
<br>
This all started on a naggy raid planned two weeks in advance as of now i know not of and callander program on FV.<br>
If we want to do fear in two weeks on a sunday but dont ask FnF or reso if they are going to be there and we show up and their there then oh well we move on.<br>
<br>
Lol and please taking off work just to camp fake items please i like the real items rather than the little items on my screen if DA was doing a raid and i had to work i would not take time off of work to do it heh but to me thats just crazy.<br>
<br>
I would say if you want to kill naggy get you team ready whoever wants to go naggy doesnt die as soon as he spawns like on the other servers and if you have to stay lvl 52 for awhile to do it its all up to you guys we have many in guild that put 100% in AA so we dont outgrow naggy/vox and get screwed in the future.<br>
<br>
But i guess not everyone thinks like me if i have a problem with a GL or member i dont go whine on a MSG board so those who dont know the story or was there can make the own accusations i do it the old fasion way /tell and if it goes bad /duel but i guess some people need others sympathy which i never have!<br>

<br>
Attuma also said: &quot;one thing I notice about the guilds that cant do the plane raids or end game uber mobs they all do the same thing .. They bitch and whine and cry and point fingers...&quot; etc.<br>
<br>
Some of us have been playing long enough to know that trying to stick a label on small guilds or unguilded folks as jealous whiners has been done to death.  There is hostility on both sides of the fence here, and it does no good to start seperating folks out into &quot;greedy ubers&quot; and &quot;jealous noobs&quot;.<br>
<br>
Aligned guilds still take some time to mobilize, more so than a single raid-oriented guild.  Again, even small guilds as part of an alliance benefit from being able to schedule time.  And seriously, how much does this cut into the raid schedule of the &quot;uber guilds&quot;?  Not a heck of a lot.  If you could mobilize to take on a zone on one day, you can do it easily the next, and while you are off in places like ToV while everyone else is scheduling Nagafen, Fear, or some other place .. big deal.<br>
<br>
Let's face it.  With only one character per account eventually many of us will be in the post-50 game and we need to learn how to reasonably accomodate each other, be on the same playground without constantly fighting over the ball.  And it isn't always going to be as easy as checking with two main guilds to see if they are there or not.  If nothing else, this incident should show that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/21/02 5:55:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misconceptions about Naggy</span><hr size=1> I honestly think they should up the power of the Uber Mobs at random, just to throw off these ridiculous timetables/schedules.

Sure it would make everything a free for all but hey who care's, it would stop any more thread's like these from poping up. Stuff like this breed's animosity beetwean people in game and actually causes more thing's just like it to happen again. If everyone didn't know exactly on what date and time these mob's would show up there would be no arguing who got it and none of this claiming this mob or that mob. All it takes is the one black sheep guild that decides that they dont honor the schedule system and all hell will break loose. Personally Im against anyone trying to impose a schedule system of any sort just for that verry reason. Eventually it will fail although everyone here may honor it for a time. People come and people go and sooner or later that one guild will pop up that decides to take whatever they want. Then guess what, it's a free for all for everyone. Id love to think the people on friona vie are above that and can work somthing out. But when it come's to people in general its best to just expect the worst.

There is no such thing of calendar System.<br>

<br>
You play on a ROLE PLAYING SERVER for God sake.<br>
You role play a character back on the ... well who the hell know what ages is that but is ANCIENT for sure.... where those things, such as FFA wording is NOT even invented.... Communication is not supposed to be allowable at this time....Paladin should kick errr be kicked by shadow knights.... Good should win errrr lost against evil ....<br>
<br>
<br>
There is only: &quot;you come, you see, you destroy&quot; <br>
There is only: &quot;Vini, Vidi, Vici&quot;<br>
<br>
That is my thought ..... you play on role play server with your &quot;OWN&quot; risk<br>
<br>
no offense to anyone ..... just my thought ..... anyway I am an ignorance :P<br>

Verant (or at least Brad) was fond of making Lord of the Rings comparisons .. you don't see Frodo reserving the Cracks of Doom for the completion of his epic quest.  He goes, fights something and the quest is finished.<br>
<br>
But at the same time, you don't see 10,000 other hobbits in line to complete it at the same time arguing over whose turn it was, because last time Frodo's guild got to use the crack of doom and they ALWAYS get to use it and how it isn't fair etc.<br>
<br>
Even on a roleplay server, it's still EQ, and we have to try and find some way to co-exist without constantly colliding over loot, in my opinion.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 534<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/12/02 1:45:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> In response to the stuff about the Unguilded having a harder/impossible time killing Dragons...<br>
<br>
Well, though it may be a shame, that IS one of the drawbacks of being Unguilded.  NOBODY has a 'right' to any particular encounter.<br>
<br>
One of the benefits/reasons for having a Guild is to make the sort of coordination to undertake multi-group Raids possible.<br>
<br>
I'm sure evey effort can be made to be civil and accomodate as many people as possible, but frankly, claiming Lord Nagafen for an Open Raid in a week or two shouldn't be a guarantee that you get the spawn.  What if the Raid is cancelled?  Fails due to lack of participation?  I don't see why other groups should not play EQ as they see fit.  Especially when probably not the entire server population uses these boards.<br>
<br>
Compromise is good, though, and I'm sure there is plenty of room for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/12/02 2:22:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> I claim all mobs over level 55 until the end of time.<br>
