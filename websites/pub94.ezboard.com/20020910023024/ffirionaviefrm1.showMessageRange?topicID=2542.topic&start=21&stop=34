Why charge at all, level 60's won't need the prizes, as you pointed out, because we all roll in plat.<br>

The idea was fine, the need for plat was just something that didnt sit well. I didnt want every person climbing in here declaring they are running an event and charging plat.  <br>

No worries.  No harm done.  Trust me, Czak isn't trying to &quot;scam&quot; anyone.  If he needs plat, he can come to me.  I just think by charging an entrance fee he can provide a prize and have himself &quot;a nice shiny nickle&quot;.  <br>
<br>
He would probably stand to make 50-200pp of hosting it.  Less if he chooses to pay the play-by-play announcer.  Regardless, this would be a fun event and I encourage everyone to attend.<br>

<br>
I appeal to you to advise what day and time is best for you to attend this event.  I think all of Norrath would love to see you all in action.  I know I do.  Being that I am not a level 60 raider, I do not know when you all raid.  I went with the day and time that was convenient for me and would allow European players to join in.  Again please let me know what time is best, so you would be able to show up in force.  <br>
<br>
Also, because I am not familiar with high end capabilities of the classes I bow to you to come up with a division of classes that seems most fair in a PvP situation.  Again this event is being held for you to showcase your abilities.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
