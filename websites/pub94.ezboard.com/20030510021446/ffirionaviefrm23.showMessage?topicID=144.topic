<br>
....I was born. Created between the hatred of two people, their very races created to fight against one another.. and their very souls pitted aganist one another in combat, even the moment when I was put into my mothers womb was a violent act all in itself.<br>
<br>
I could of come out as anything. From a Elven Bard taken by Veeshan and forced to sing boring songs about Dragons to what I am now, a Dark Knight of the Father Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk took me before I was even born and decided that I would not be one of Tunares pitiful children. He allowed me to be born for the most part in the form of his perfect children, the Tier'dal. He gave me the signature ability of the dark knights, to gather parts of my ki, my hate, my rage, and unleash it in a form of energy from my fist.<br>
<br>
This is what makes me dark. By this right, he predestined me to a path of darkness. I would not get the chance to lay up against some silly tree and giggle at every stupid thing. Love is an luxury that I'll never be able to afford, and freedom, I only get that from fighting. I am a ShadowKnight. Killing is my art, and I enjoy painting the scenery.<br>
<br>
But, is it just this that makes one truly dark and evil? Why is it that the Ebon Storm is able to maintain its dark Aura, but all the while allowing Barbarian Shamans of Justice to fight along side them? What is with that, these souls which Apep has succeded in truly turning their sprits into bleak beings of darkness.<br>
<br>
I have seen them, and looked into it. I do it with many of the Guilds of Norrath, scoping them out with my various network of people, sometimes even doing the work myself. Seeing who has what, who is dark, who is evil. I have watched the Vah Shir of Ebon Storm from afar, stalked the Barbarians from a distance, heard them talk, watched their eyes and their motions, and I can see no trait of lightbringer within them. Ebon Storm isn't the only example I have.<br>
<br>
I have killed many, many that have shown to have a side of darkness. I killed them, holding back the very questions within myself on this very topic. <br>
<br>
I have seen many Dark Knights like myself fall. Even Nercomancers, who are supposed to be the darkest of the dark.. the masters of death show nothing but roses and lightbringer nonsence. Look at Guilds like Fire and Fury, Resolution, and Dreadstorm. You will find many examples of them. Masters of death? Masters of only helping Lightbringers.<br>
<br>
As I said, I kill because I am a Knight of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Taking a pure example, why doesn't this same thing apply to one like.. say Antoin. He's a Dark Knight like myself, but he's parading around with Kimaya in the Twilight Baston.<br>
<br>
The Twilight Baston, the softest guild in all of Norrath. <br>
<br>
An even better example would be the Knight known as Cadien, a ShadowKnight of Tunare.. or former one.<br>
<br>
How is such a thing possible.. I throught Innoruuk made us Dark Knights because we were to kill and destroy those that need to die.<br>
<br>
But this is not the case, I look about and only see myself, and a few others out doing the deeds of death. Most 'Dark ones' of the world now relax upon the world. While the ones you expect to be dark and cruel run about like Woodelves..<br>
<br>
The woodelves are out talking about how much they enjoy the taste of blood! By Innoruuk, what the hell kind of twisted world did I awaken to!<br>
<br>
Is my entire system of judgement, Trusting only those that were chosen by the Gods to Wield powers of Darkness.. <br>
Like.. Only fighting along side ShadowKnights, Nercomancers, Priests of Dark Gods (Innoruuk, Cazic, Bertox, and Zek ~which dont exist I know~) followers of the dark gods and such..<br>
<br>
But.. I seen those that fall under my little category.. and they are being more light then the ones I have faught and killed my entire life!<br>
<br>
I believe this has tormented me for a very long time, only now I am able to bring light of my dilemna. This has caused some extreme .. things to happen within myself. Their were some times when I sat down with the enemy, yes, I sat down and talked and picked at the minds of these lightbringers who came at me not wanting to fight.<br>
<br>
And it confuses me to no end.<br>
<br>
Its almost as if I should sit down and try to 'Corrupt' those that seem to want to awaken to darker qualities. I already try to kill every 'Cadien' ShadowKnight I see, those that are turning their back on darkness.<br>
<br>
But what do I do, when that Highelf comes to me wanting me to turn her into a being of Darkness. The easy answer is to send her to Innoruuk himself. But now, the answer doesn't seem so clean cut, <br>
<br>
Am I faltering?<br>
<br>
I've spent my entire life slaying all who I felt were not dark. If their attude was of a lightbringer, they died, reguardless of who they were.<br>
<br>
And I slain them by class. I cared not how dark and evil they acted or claimed to be. I destroyed them.<br>
<br>
..Am I wrong? Should I be looking deeper into them, to see if they truly can be corrupted.. like Sarhea was those many years ago?  Should I base who lives and who dies off of ACTION and not off of.. Race and Class?<br>

I do not know you, and must admit ignorance to the language your sigil written in.<br>
<br>
As you have posted your message publicly... I will assume you wish a public response.  <br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, you are considering things far to much.  Judging by your words we both serve the same Master... Give yourself to his Will.  Act on his accord, and do not color it with your own opinions.  Be his Fist upon this decrepit world.<br>
<br>
If we stop to consider if every soul we crush beneth our heel.. or every elf we break upon a rack.. is meant to be of the darkness, we will fall into nothing but doubt.  How can we preform our most holy tasks in His name if we doubt ourselves?<br>
<br>
There is truth in your words.. many misuse the gifts He has given them.  They should be put down, they are worse then then Koda'Dal.  Traitors.  As for those who wish to turn to darkness, they must prove themselves.  Should they be given the opportunity, if they fall into our grasp?  Perhaps...  Go with what you feel.<br>
<br>
Do not make such a decision with logic and thought, act with His Will.  If they are worthy He will make it known.  If we kill them are they truely meant to live?  I think not.<br>
<br>
Do not let these doubts plauge you... Remember that with in us burns His Will... and to deny it is blasphemy.<br>

In service, <br>

<br>
I mean, its quite obious that he frowns upon the ..well as I put it, those like the Tier'dal who side and guild along those that are with the Twilight Baston.<br>
<br>
What does Innoruuk think of those like Apep, who corrupts all those about him, his Vah Shir Minions or his Barbarian Shamanic Women.<br>
<br>
What does the father see from those who spent their entire lives using all, Tier'dal and lightbringer alike to gain their status of power, the path most females take.<br>
<br>
What does Innoruuk think about the one who takes the Woodelf, and turns him or her from a docile tree hugging bastard into a complete retardation of what Tunare created tehm to be? <br>
<br>
The fact of it is that we really dont't know what Innoruuk wants. I don't fight because Innoruuk commands me, he only commands me that I walk in total and complete Hate.<br>
<br>
I fight because thats all I've known my entire life. Every question I could answer with my sword.. execpt for the reason on why I am still weak while they, as in the rest of them, gain in much power and strenght.<br>
<br>
What am I doing wrong, I wonder.<br>
<br>
What I feel.. I've lost touch of what I feel I think. Its becomming as if I am tiring of fighting, espically now since the battles are no longer ones I can win with my sword. <br>
<br>
The Lightbringers Dominate this world. They grow in power while I am dammed to an existance in my 55th level of power for .. hell I don't know how long.<br>
<br>
But I remember when your words were my words. Back then, when the world was still a battle ground.. I could let my hair down, draw my sword and cleave into some Elvish flesh. <br>
<br>
Damn Norrath, and damn the lightbringers for changing this world to their liking. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I see as you do, and quite frankly, it scares me.<br>
<br>
I have spent most of my life fighting creatures of darkest pitch, their hearts sewn with evil beyond redemption.  Even yourself, from time to time.  Now however, things have become...  mired.  The lines are blurred.  I see Vah Shir attacking cities that give them no harm.  High elves, even paladins, simply walking over dead guards and even BEGGING the attackers to allow them to loot weapons from the dead and the dying.  Druids even slaughtering their own charges en masse, all in the name of this accursed balance.  They can justify anything with balance, you know.  It's a universal excuse.<br>
<br>
I know you have seen the same.<br>
<br>
Things are changing, but instead of being a final victory, it is becoming one massive shade of grey, corrupted, power driven.  More evil than anything the darkness could bring. And that, Shinai, leaves people like you, and me, out of luck, and out of time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eveningshadow>EveningShadow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/03 8:43:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods, Classes, and Darkness?</span><hr size=1> I will admit that I am young, perhaps I have not yet had time to become jaded such as you.  Will I in time?  Perhaps... but I can only remain true to His Will as best as I can.  There is no way to tell what is his Will and what is merely our wantings, we can only do our best to act in perfect Hate.<br>
<br>
As for the others, both the tainted lightbringers and the damned soft Tier'dal who walk with our enemies, we can only act upon what we feel.  If they come before you and are found wanting... cut them down.  If He desires their service, He will return them in some way.<br>
<br>
What are you doing wrong?  I can not answer that.  I can only tell you my observations based on your notes.  You doubt yourself, it seems, because the rewards you wish are not  forthcoming.  We do not always receive the reward we deserve, when we feel we deserve it.  All things come in time, for some it takes longer then others.  Obstacles merely prove dedication, and make us stronger.  I will not sift the blame and say something trite as &quot;His Will bring all things at the time HE wishes,&quot; because it is simply not true.  We make our own path.  There are many diffrent roads to his Will.<br>
<br>
Do as you say you always have done.  Tear through whatever stands between you and where you wish to be.  Rend it asunder with your sword.  Burn it with your touch.  The very fact these things attempt to prevent you from your goals should be reason enough to destroy them.<br>
<br>
Through destruction we will grow, that is the way it has always been.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah, knight, now you see into the depths of my very own confusion. For I always believed the Koada'Dal to be creatures of gentleness, kindness, and purity, but then I hear tales of torture and murder of Tier'Dal within the walls of our fair city, when never had I, in all my long life, even suspected such of my King. Where are these dungeons to which the Tier'Dal are dragged and beaten and murdered? I would have writtten the tales off as lies, had I not heard the stories from so many different dark witnesses. Yes, the dark ones might lie, but lie in such numbers, some with no knowledge of the others who told such a tale? There is no &quot;good&quot; in torture or outright murder; there is no &quot;good&quot; in genocide. And, since violence is how so many &quot;lightbringers&quot; bring the light to Norrath, how are they any different from a Tier'Dal who spreads hate through violence? Both are evil. And in my mind, the worse evil is evil done in the name of good.<br>
<br>
I teasingly threaten a certain mercenary with my wrath, but in sooth, he has nothing to fear from me. (I hope he does not read this and guess my identity, or else my bluff will be called.) True, he harmed one of my dear coven sisters, but my way is not to repay violence with violence. My way is to teach &quot;goodness&quot; by example, through mercy. Laugh, if you will, but  if even one act of violence is prevented when an angry soul remembers an act of kindness from the past, then I have succeeded in spreading the cause of &quot;good.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have always maintained that all life drifts in shades of gray. As a result, I am an outcast. But I'd rather be an outcast than allow intolerance, hate, and self-righteousness to drive my actions. Those driven by such are evil, no matter what banner of light they carry.<br>

It is not the destination.<br>
 <br>
The destination is to become as we are,Shintou-ones who understand that the world truly works as it does. If one wishes to slough off the dedication of themselves to the gods of light,they must willingly sacrifice everything to do so.<br>
<br>
To live a life undedicated to the dark powers is to always have the chance of turning away from them.<br>
 <br>
There is no turning away for us,short of the total sacrifice of our mortal souls in order to become something truly different. Devote yourself or deny yourself the truth in your soul.<br>
 <br>
Corruption is the comfortable middle of the road-both for lightlover and servant of the dark alike. It's so much easier to live that way...though they should wonder about what comes later.<br>
 <br>
There are many corrupted folk that wander Nektulos,their bones chattering still. Some claimed to follow the dark. Others the light.<br>
 <br>
In the end,they are all called to be judged by what they followed.<br>

&quot;I guess I will stand forth for Lust for Blood and what may be considered the Grey path, though ye know my clans history,<br>
ye know we do not sit on the fence as the others do, our kind of darkness is our own, tis our path to create the chaos and war that we believe the gods want. Aye we unite all of the races, but in away that goes beyong good and evil, ye would hate those like us that walk a path like yours just because they where not born under the thumb of the Dark Father like ye and I where? Does not actions speak louder than words<br>
and petty beliefs? Do ye simply seek to destroy for the sake of the chaos? or do ye wish to rid the world of your enemy?<br>
Then what? Where will your hatred go then? Will ye turn it on your own city? the city that now is shared with the trolls, the city that is so corrupt that as long as the pay a high enough price pale skins can shop their wares in side the commons?<br>
Few believe like ye do Baron, I commend ye on your convictions, but I am affraid that I have foreseen in your minds eye that they may be your end as well, beware the tricks that he plays on us, your reward is not what ye have been promised.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melediweaver>melediweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dirges, a specialty</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/27/03 9:59:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods, Classes, and Darkness?</span><hr size=1> Shintou, I see there are two paths followed by the dark, that of the pure, and that of the corrupter. I will ignore for the moment the weak, who do not remain true to any particular path, but rather worship the gods of coin and level.<br>
<br>
The pure will not aid, assist, or touch those of the light save with an instrument of death. They will not allow a paladin to lay hands on them, even should it cause them to fall. This is a valid path. <br>
<br>
The corrupter's path is no less valid. They will use the ones of light, but consistently, and only so that they may be turned to darkness.  Would it not be right, for a cleric of Innoruuk, such as Gray, to try and spread the faith of his evil god to others? And to do such would he not have to walk among the &quot;unbelievers&quot;?<br>
<br>
Those of the light of course, have it much less hard. For sometimes good may see a hint of hope for one of darkness, and their gods are more of mercy and kindness.<br>
<br>
I of course, am a despised neutral. I do not mutter of the balance, but rather enjoy my ale, and sing songs where they will hear me, and leave the agonizing on the gods to such as you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 <br>
I see those who claim to be &quot;evil&quot; in a high elf's skin. Embrace the truth and cast off the powers you gained from dedication to a god of light and join us,then.<br>
 <br>
To do otherwise is to try to play both against the middle in your search for personal power. The rewards are great,in this world.<br>
 <br>
You will find them less so when you finally pass from the realm. No matter what you use to justify them,your acts will be judged by who you pledged to serve in the beginning.<br>
 <br>
There will be no mercy on your souls as a result. Not that Father Innoruuk even considers &quot;mercy&quot; worthy of contemplating,but he rewards the faithful and condemns the infidel.<br>
 <br>
I think the gods have a sense of humor. To create creatures of great power,they often take the spiritual remains of something of great power and twist it. The Father does this to even the weakest of failures,making the bitter dead that wander Nektulos and Kithicor.<br>
<br>
So many of them were as you were in life. You turned from your gods for power,not realizing that if they died still dedicated to the god they blaspheme....you will still go to them in the end.<br>
 <br>
Even Marr has no pity for the one who turns his coat. Tunare knows it is un-natural. The Tribunal sees it and passes judgement,as any who walk the planes know. <br>
 <br>
Your fate will not be glory,or legend. It will be as fodder to be slain and tormented again and again,since the only service you could provide in life was doing to same to your own...and perhaps if your god is more merciful than mine,you will not keep enough of yourself to know it.<br>
 <br>
The faithful gain their own rewards-indeed,the gods sent examples of these to many towns,to show that there is indeed great and better things for those who hold true to their gods. They are heroes. <br>
 <br>
You are faithless scum. The pale elven servant of Tunare that failed her goddess and instead slew what she would,never minding the balance? That &quot;corrupt,evil&quot; druid?<br>
 <br>
I enjoy killing you every time I see your dull,mindless cur of a beastly body wandering by in the Commonlands. I laugh more when I see your brothers and sisters do it. Some are respectful enough to thank their goddess for the gift. They would be more so if they knew how that wolf,that bear,or that cat came to be.<br>
 <br>
The others will eventually learn what it feels like. It is their fate.<br>
<br>
If you choose to follow a new path,devote yourself to it. Or join them.<br>

You are right Erudite. Innoruuk grants me the power that I wield, but what I conquer and what I slay are not for him. I allow the Father to guide my blade, my feet and to grant me the ability to destroy all that stand before me. But Innoruuk shall not lead me with a leash. <br>
