So if you go against a mob that can hit anyone close by within melee range, your right, a melee wizard isn't the best idea for that particular mob. <br>
<br>
As I clearly stated, you have to KNOW when it's a good time to melee and not. <br>
<br>
And I should have mentioned, yes at the Higher levels, melee becomes more and more usless, since the max you can get with any weapon is 110, making most mobs at those level unhittable. <br>
<br>
But it doesn't mean you can never melee at those levels. You just have to lear to judge the situation.<br>
<br>
But I also suspect most caster give up melee long before they have maxed out thier skills. (But not all, I have talked to other much higher casters that have melee skills at only half of what they can)<br>
<br>
Also, I never said that a wizard (or any caster) should giveup casting, for just melee. Just that it can be a way to extend you mana. <br>
<br>
Basically, I feel if you have a skill that can help out, why not max it out? I've got the spell True North, which I never use, cause with Sense Heading of 170, I don't have to stop and load the spell, cast it, and then change the spell again. <br>
<br>
Good melee skills allow me to also go after things that are much lower for raw materials I need for skills. Rather then burn up mana I can hunt them myself. <br>
<br>
And as stated by another player above, what good is getting a staff or dagger with a really nice proc if your melee skill is say 43? cause at 29, you said, heck with fighting, I'm a caster, I'm to good for that.<br>
<br>
And if you are so against any wizard meleeing, why where you stabbing that phase spider? <br>
<br>
I'm just supporting a players right to PLAY HIS OR HER CHARACTER any way they want. No one has the right to tell another player that they can't play the wat they want to.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ututmosisnakptah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tutmosis Nak Ptah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/6/02 12:32:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mighty tank wizards</span><hr size=1> There really is no need to get defensive, as I stated its just my 2cp worth. I was hitting the spider as a joke, you know to get a few laughs, to have fun and not take things to seriously. <br>
<br>
While we are still on this, I might add that when the group you are with is chain pulling you will need all the mana you can get just to stay effective. To me that means medding. Now don’t get me wrong I have cursed my lack of melee skill a couple of times when I have run out of mana while soloing and had to med to finish a mob off that was running away.<br>
<br>
Are there reasons for a Wizard to Melee?  I am sure there are. For me however, I choose not to on the grounds that it just takes way to long to kill something that way.<br>
<br>
I would never try to tell somebody how to play, but I would make suggestions based on my experience, I have done the wrong thing so many times that I think I am becoming an expert in “How to Die Fast”. Take it or leave it, it makes no difference to me.<br>

<br>
Oh, and here's a tip for all casters wanting defense and dodge skill ups... late 20s, go to Echo Caverns and take the Needlite room, there's only one double pull... stay away from the plants, root those suckers, and go melee.. they hit VERY fast for low amounts of damage, and will help you raise defense and dodge quickly with less pain than typical mobs of that level.  Just bring a healer.  Worked for me, I capped out block almost as soon as I got it. <p>-----------------------------<BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438' target=new>Rhatha Sha`Naya</A> and Swiftclaw <Ebon Storm><BR>

Lies!  It's all Lies!<br>
<br>
Meleeing as a wizard is not going to kill you unless you're the type who normally plunges off the ramp in EK to save travel time.<br>
<br>
At level 55 I'm still meleeing.  I do it for a variety of reasons (not the least of which is RP.) And, my melee DOES contribute to the total success rate of my party (at times.)<br>
<br>
With my maxxed melee skills (thanks buffing party members!) I do hit things often enough to get procs in. I have an entire bag full of weapons with various procs. At the start of some melee mayhem I grab one and drive in to the fray. Some of these things proc minor debuffs, others minor DoTs. Some proc DD. And while I do hit and do help get the baddy's health bar starting to empty out, it never gets me agro.<br>
<br>
I'm far safer meleeing than nuking.  My melee is much less noticable than that of the big brute of a warrior who is hacking and slashing it dead. Well, that is until I get my Skull Shaped Wand (20dam 20dly, procs Ice Comet ((1120 DD)), MR/FR/CR/DiS +5, Evok skill +5%, cold dam. +4, Nec/Wiz/Mage/Ench, All races.)  I think THAT would make me more noticable than all the taunt buttons on Norrath pushed at the same time... then again cast Shock of Snowflake seems to get more agro than a Warlord can gain in an hour.<br>

Now for the record, just yesterday, Melee saved my life. Me brother and me took our younger brother into Sol A to help him level up (so he could group with us more) and to plunder the place. I'm a level 36 wizard, one brother is a 35 level Cleric, and we were leveling up our brother, a druid of level 24. <br>
<br>
Well, for most of Sol A, we where fine. But once we started getting deeper, we actually ran into Goblins that gave xp (none conned higher then dark blue). After one battle, an only at half mana (and sitting and resting like a good caster), the Cleric brother pulls a train of 4 goblins. So we start and things are fine, only 2 more join in. Things were looking grim. Rather then just bast away, I mixed a few blasts with melee and  Tishan's clash. Those four extra second can make a difference. Soon 6 goblins were 4 then 3 then 2 and I was OOM, but still doing damage, and once we were down to 1 goblin, I parked it and let my brothers finish it off. <br>
<br>
But there is no doubt that if I hadn't meleed (and hit 80% of the time for 12-22 damage, love that shaded dagger) we would have or at least I would have died. Once I was OOM, if I hadn't had a maxed out piercing skill, and been able to do some damage, all I would have been able to do is stand there taking hit afte hit.<br>
<br>
Same day, later, me and the Cleric brother go after Chief Goonda together. The Chief and the Preistess are up and we pull them both. I root the Chief and down goes the preistess. I start in on the chief and after four blasts (he healed himself partially once) he gives up, and wanders away. I chase after him and melee him to the end. I had enough for a blast, but wanted to save that for the pet. Blast, OOM, melee, melee. One dead pet.<br>
<br>
Now if only a players pet stayed around after the player died and kept fighting that would be nice. What spells do these casters have that allow them to have pets that out live them?<br>

All way through fight i could land my lifetap Dot on it (not striaght lifetaps) so i prob healed 1500-2000 hp from taps (total on all reavers - lifetap dot lasts to long to effectivly tap a reaver to death) <p><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Braellarth/sig_02.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucatafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cataFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Firemunchkin</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/29/02 4:25:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/sigs/redwizard2.gif height=60 width=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mighty tank wizards</span><hr size=1> OK, got my offense and defense past 100, dodge 75, piercing and 1hb are both around 70.

<br>
Bind wounds capped at 100!?  Dodge capped at 75!?!?!?  WTF ... this is so unfair.  If anything I'd think casters should be BETTER at dodging than melees, seeing as we're less encumbered with all the armour, and more inclined to run away! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's so unfair...<br>
<br>
Anyway it IS worth working on these skills... I was in Splitpaw last week and my group had some adds, the melees were pretty low on health and taking a lot of damage.  I managed to tank one of the adds for the entire battle, it only managed to hit me 8 times between all the misses and dodges, and I only lost 1 bubble of health.  The tanks were so surprised, they were almost offended that I didn't need their help ... =)<br>

Today someone in our group parse my melee damage as I was goofing around with different weapons.  I think I got up to 7.5 DPS and my low unhasted was around 2 DPS (PoP mob seem to have no AC at all).  My crappy weapon is a ok damage weapon 30/32 and I am an enchanter so my nuke would have been for 775 plus focus.  The mana I lose standing up just isnt worth it.  With that said I tank for my pet sometimes just to keep it alive (chanter pet are such wimps) and so I figure I am getting hit might as well swing back.  Not sure wher I was going other then for the most part unless your goofing around you not going to melee a lot. Wth that said I keep forget Loqual likes to melee, but his problem is when his weaon proc he tends to die.  Nothing like hitting a mob at the start of a fight for 6 pts and haveing your weapon proc for 500 and getting the mob to turn on you at 400-500 a proc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dukvodjurunecake>Dukvodju Runecake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/30/02 5:55:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mighty tank wizards</span><hr size=1> Dear Friends,<br>

I will share with you only this wisdom: Practice when young at least 2 weapon skills. Build your skills to their maximum. Always carry a melee weapon (doesn't necessarily have to be wielded). There may come a time that it will save your life. The simple truth is: without mana, we are NOTHING !!! That is why you must have knowledge of the weapon crafts!<br>
<br>
For all those that say don't worry about melee once you are of veteran status ... Humbug !!! Shame on you for steering the young ones down the dark path. There has not been a day where I have not used a weapon in melee combat.<br>
<br>
There have been many a dire situation where I have charged into battle to face the onslaught of our enemy so that I might save the life of a friend. Granted the occassional effort is futile but my record holds and so does my reputation. I will always be there to save a life. Just because I'm out of mana doesn't mean I can't make a difference. <br>

Not training your melee skills is foolish... <br>
<br>
A true War Wizard trains all his offencive skills with one handed bash being the most importand one. <br>
<br>
The best example I can give is the War Sorcerer Xova who claimed that he did more damage with his burning staff then with his spells. The staff was quite exceptional however doing a 300DD proc. upon his enemies.<br>
