 &quot;Iris&quot; <br>
And I'd give up forever to touch you <br>
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow <br>
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be <br>
And I don't wanna go home right now <br>
<br>
And all I can taste is this moment <br>
And all I can breathe is your life <br>
And sooner or later it's over <br>
I just don't wanna miss you tonight <br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
And I don't want the world to see me <br>
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <br>
When everything's made to be broken <br>
I just want you to know who I am <br>
<br>
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming <br>
Or the moment of truth in your lies <br>
When everything feels like the dramas <br>
And you bleed just to know you're alive<br>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Crude and simplistic, yet the bard had some shadow of truth in his song, no doubt parroted and far distant from the one who understood enough to form the words. No doubt the one I heard singing had as much comprehension as of his later screams in the lower chambers....<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, I adopt the name, 'Iris'. A flower, I'm told, in one of the lower collections of grunts and clicks of the world. I will not call them 'languages'.<br>
<br>
Yet how can I cling to my superiority when faced with this...base attraction? I have rejected the path that leads to the highest strata of society, though it is my birthright.<br>
<br>
Will I replace it with new beliefs? No. I am not stirred to passion by new ideas. Yet...I am weakened, inexplicably shaken by the lowly, fit only for entertaining torture.<br>
<br>
My father, practically the avatar of Hate himself, says he will reform me. Does he know? How can he not? But he has said nothing. He is more devious then any, but I cannot see his plan.<br>
<br>
I shall record what must be remembered for I play with forgetfulness, and what is hidden in the shadows for safety can be lost.<br>
<br>
I am more and more taken. Am I attracted to the belief? To be Iris instead of myself, Vexomza, is to be 'loved'. If only I could. But I court the weak and frail emotion and defy the strong and indestructable one. I am doomed. What drives me to destruction, I wonder? Am I only bored? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvexomza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vexomza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/12/02 2:46:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Weakness.</span><hr size=1> Weakness.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 What is happening to me? My father is right. All paths apart from hate are weakness. But what kind of weakness is this?<br>
<br>
He obeys me like a slave, for 'love'. But who is the master? It is I who feel weak, though he submits to my every wish. How can this be? It is as if he submits not to me, but to some intangible thing, which bids him to submit to me.<br>
<br>
He pleases me. For nothing. He asks for nothing. 'Asks'? He should demand! How can I be...feeling what I am towards such an obvious weakling? But he does not feel weak. I do not see fear in him when he obeys me. Or better, the impotent rage which would show me truly to be his master. Why does he obey me?<br>
<br>
How can I be feeling anything but hate? It is proverbial. My race shall never lower itself, shall never apologize, shall never deign to speak the lower languages (though we may understand them and even write them the better to manipulate those who think we would not), and shall never, never know any motive but hate.<br>
<br>
Is this some sort of new shade of hate? Do I humiliate myself this way out of self-hatred? I do not know. Worse, I do not care. I am happy in a way I do not understand. He is not properly subdued, secured to a rack while hot implements are inserted in delicate places, yet I take pleasure in him. How can this be? If not hate, then what do I feel myself drowning in? Surrendering to?<br>
<br>
Is this his god? He talks constantly of his god, but he is not preaching. He simply cannot discuss his own motives, needs, or desires without discussing his devotion to his god. In a very strange way, he reminds me of my father in his complete devotion to his god.<br>
<br>
But even my father does not blindly trust his god. Quite the opposite, my father must control every moment and aspect in order to feel a proper servant. But he, my he whom I dare not name...he...trusts! I do not know how he can have lived even as long as he has. Or have won my heart.<br>
<br>
He knows my fondness for music, and has shared me a song. It talks of daring, and salvation. It is like him. Confusing, but not...unattractive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvexomza.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vexomza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/12/02 2:47:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dare You to Move</span><hr size=1>  I Dare You To Move:<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 How can one choose to be bound? The roar of hatred is strength even in me, though not a comitted believer, I am a Dark Elf. As the crowd of thousands roars for blood at the arena, so is the intoxication of hate rushing through my body! It is my birthright, this strength.<br>
<br>
Yet my soul is become bound to one who rejects strength. He is physically more powerful then I, but does not overpower me. This is not for the sake of technique, or precise control, for I well understand placing temporary limits on strength for subtlety sake. No, he calls this 'gentleness'. I cannot even say that in my speech. It sounds like 'weakness for weakness sake'! And it stirs me.<br>
<br>
He is so naive! He wants to wander back and forth, in and out of the gates of Neriak speaking and listening to me for hours! He offers his life for the amusment of my race whnever he does this, yet he is unscathed. And unafraid.<br>
<br>
He is fascinated by the concept of death, yet not as the High Art describes it. He is weak for his god (he calls this 'love'), and I think he wishes his soul would be with his god sometime rather then reawakening at its binding place. Oh how I desire it were bound instead to me. As mine is now bound to him.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=163.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=163.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=163.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=163.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=163.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
