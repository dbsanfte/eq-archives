Say you had a group and an item falls which would is very good for warriors and paladins but useable by other melee yet weighs 3 stones.  If you were a monk, would you roll on it?  Most people roll with NBG and the monk wasn't going to roll but said 'I will roll for a friend'.  Well, the monk won and I said I thought it was unfair giving the item to someone else and he said 'Well... I'll use it'.  I've never played a monk, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen a monk who would use an item that weighs 3 stones (although it did grant 5 strength).  I personnally think the monk will give the item to someone else but it just lead me to think.<br>
<br>
Do many people function like this?  I once did the mistake (I realized myself) of rolling for an item that wasn't meant for me, but I lost the roll and since then, I've been a major need before greed pain in the ass, but do many people do this, roll on items which would advantage someone else in a group to either sell, trade or give it to a friend?  I won't mention any names here, but to say the least, I wasn't the least bit impressed as it would have been a very good item for me and I could have easily used it up until our guild is strong enough to raid a plane but I came up second on the roll.<br>
<br>
What do people here think, was the monk right in going against the need before greed rule? (assuming he won't wear it, which I doubt he will as he had changed his claim from giving it to using it).  What would you people have done? Refused to give him the item, blacklisted him and his guild or nothing at all?<br>
<br>
Just an FYI, the item was a cloak, 8ac, 5strenght, 10 save magic which weighed 3 stones.  I give the stats as I think it was given to someone who posts here and I'm curious as to what the person will say to defend themself, but I know it certainly led me to reconsider the way I call an item which I can use, but might or will not in a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aleira>Aleira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 10:51:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ethic question</span><hr size=1> Sad to say, but most likely he didn't really intend to use it. 3 Stone is a lot for a Monk to bear, and his initial reaction indicates that he had no intention of using it. If he wasn't going to give it to a friend, it wouldn't surprise me to find that he had sold it at auction.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, things like this can happen when loot gets doled out. It's sad, but it's hard to avoid 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
However, if the group knew about the Monk rolling beforehand, any objections should have been raised before the roll. If they don't object to his rolling on it, then they cannot realistically object to his winning.<br>

And it happens that I was pondering on this very topic last night - wandering thoughts for a traveling soul...<br>
<br>
My humble opinion is that if someone is not a party to the event that led to obtaining the item (killing the mob that dropped it), then they should not have someone act as a surrogate to obtain it, nor should anyone act as a surrogate for someone else.  This is when partied in pick-up groups (various people together).<br>
<br>
The only time that I feel that it would be appropriate is if someone came to a group stating that they were specifically, explicitly looking for the item in question, *and* the group agreed to it.  This would paticularly be reasonable if the ones trying to obtain the item were not guilded and the item was hard to obtain alone.<br>
<br>
The only other scenario I think it would be appropriate is if the item was dropped more than once, and everyone in the party that wanted it had obtained it during the current battle.<br>
<br>
For your particular situation...  If the item was nice, go back and try to obtain it.  It is frustrating to be in the situation that you were in, but there are things to consider...<br>
<br>
I percieve that the monk was allowed to roll because the odds looked like they would not win anyway.  But on the other hand, at worst there was a one in six chance that they would.  It seems in this situation, the easy thing was to go ahead and let the monk roll with the hopes that they would lose the roll anyway.  The hard thing would have been to tell the monk &quot;no&quot; and try to work out other another compromise for something the monk obviously wanted out of percieved greed.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's best to let bygones be bygones.  There is no telling what the monk will do with it, and at this point, it is probably mute.  Blame leads to pain, as someone dear to me is fond of saying.  It holds true.  Then we have to go back and eat humble pie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .

<br>
I do know one thing, I will never be in a party with him again or with the person who told him to roll as I have no choice but to say that they have no honor.  I have played with a few in the guild he is in before and they had always stressed a strong NBG philosophy, no questions asked, if someone could use the item, they took it and no objections were raised. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 11:59:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ethic question</span><hr size=1> Well, I've played a monk up to 60 and am playing one again now.  I'd say it would really depend on the item.  If it was the best item in it's class in the game, I might use it.  Weapons for monks are typically heavy; eg. the fighting batons are 2.0 each and well worth using two of them even if it puts you overweight.  The nice 2HB's often weigh 10.0 and are also well worth using.  So, unless you can be specific on the item, it's really hard to say if a monk would use it or not.  If it was a nice weapon, I'd say almost certainly worth it.<br>
<br>
OTH, the way I do loot when running a group is that if you put in a class-claim for an item (ie. I deserve this more than others because my class gets far more benefit from it than yours and I'd use it 100% of the time), then that person needs to hand down the item he upgraded.  Otherwise, the class-claimer gets both an upgrade and a trade item.  If it's not worth handing down the old item, then it's not worth class-claiming the new one.  This cuts out buddy-looters from class items.<br>
<br>
I like &quot;commie&quot; looting best: all trade-items and all scrounge loot goes to one person with autosplit turned off.  That person then does an equitable split before the group breaks up or before adding/removing a groupie, either after selling off all the junk or after adding the value of the junk to the pool and splitting it then.  This is often hard to do in a pickup group and many people don't like to be the comisar.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's just how I run things.  My advice to you is that when making a pickup group, lay down the law on loot in advance (eg. NBG with hand-down.  I will resolve all loot disputes as group leader).  This isn't being mean or greedy, it's just making the group's goals clear -- part of good leading.  If you're not leading, be sure to ask what the looting style is and also ask the leader to act as final loot arbiter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhueth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hueth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 12:01:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ethic question</span><hr size=1> ___________________________________________<br>

I was not looting and this was not a pick up party, is was 3 members of my guild fighting and the monk asked to join us.  There were no loot rules defined as there is no loot on Luclin almost, we just followed our normal loot rules.  As to what was the item, I did say what it is, its' a cape with 8ac, 5str and 10 magic resistance which for a warrior is very good as it contains strength and magic resistance on the same item.  When we are fighting for loot and not experience, Im usually the master looter and we've never had this type of problem before since we normally play the same group in the guild.  With the others outside the guild I play with, its need before greed with either commie or ffa with honor.  This was the first time I was faced with this type of situation but im sure most will agree that paladin and warrior would have had dibs on this item. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utheycallmetasker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Theycallmetasker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 1:26:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> commie looting hah!</span><hr size=1> Ok Bjond now i know your an ex tunare player!

<br>
As far as looting in groups goes, its a tuff call, different people have different views and when they clash over loots...<br>
<br>
I personally cant stand NBG, so many times Ive seen players scream NBG then learned later that they have sold or traded the items off. NBG is way too easy to abuse if you dont know the people you are grouped with well. However if you do know the people you are grouped with then NBG works great.<br>
<br>
Assuming you are grouped with some people that dont know each other, If you do 25% of the work killing a mob, do you deserve a 25% shot at the loot? If the monk in question turns around and sells that cloak to buy a fighting baton, is that wrong?  Remember, even if you lost a roll on an item, you still had a fair chance at it.<br>
<br>
The best way to deal with this issue is to make sure everyone understands the rules before the loot drops, Aleira said it best, Communication is the key.<br>

There are 8 million ways to justify taking an item if you want to do so, it's really up to you. You were a guild group you could have even said that all loot in this group goes to the guild.

<br>
Well I think one caster did heh. I had always been pro NBG, but then I started to see that it was somewhat flawed. A warrior wielding a Wurmslayer and a Lam Blade in the offhand would get defaulted another Lam blade because it was best for him to replace his slayer. So he'd get the blade, and the next day he would be in north freeport auctioning off his Wurmslayer for 5k (back when they sold for that much). So in effect he wins a new weapon and 5k and the group who helped him get it wins nothing.<br>
<br>
Things like this happened alot and the more I saw it the more I thought it was wrong, I didn't play a caster either, I was a Ogre Warrior, so any claims I was a biased caster could be thrown out of the window. So I talked about the idea that when a character is defaulted something, they must giveup whatever they are replacing it with. Sure sometimes the old item would suck compared to the new one, which is fine, but sometimes the old item may be very close in value to the new one, which is ALSO fine. Anyway everyone hated the idea, as a group leader I enforced this two times before I just gave up the idea as it led to many heated arguements.<br>
<br>
The second and last case of this was a Paladin who was wearing Gauntlets of the Black, and Deepwater gauntlets droped in karnor castle. He wanted it to be defaulted to him, and I agreed that they should be, as long as he let the group roll on his old Gauntlets. He FREAKED, said I was a greedy bastard and that he woudn't do it... so I told him tough luck and the Gnome Enchanter won shiney new gauntlets. After the hole thing went to the boards, everyone agreed that is was a bad and &quot;lame greedy&quot; idea for rolling, and they pretty much all agreed that people should be able to keep and sell their old gear even when they are defaulted a item.<br>
<br>
I've thought about trying this idea here for my groups, but I am almost scared to even bother with it again if history is going to repeat itself heh.<br>
<br>
Oh and with the Monk, I'd of simply held him to his first comment, I've done this before also. <br>
It won't make you popular, but denying people loot for any reason, valid or not won't make you popular.

The idea behind class-restrictive looting is that you want to help people outfit their characters.  It's not a means for increasing your chances at obtaining stuff to trade.  Some form of NBG is best.  Think about it.  If you do full random on, say, a nice warrior item and won, would you turn around and sell that item to the warrior you rolled against? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/29/01 6:36:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 7:25:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm.</span><hr size=1> I am a huge fan of need-before-greed (NBG if anyone doesn't know the appreviation) but I also know that looting styles on this point are an open question.  I would never join a guild where NBG was even a question, and I think it's natural your guild functions that way, but...when you invite someone from outside the guild into the group you are probably a lot safer out-lining how things work in advance.  I normally take it as a given that if I join a group of three in progress, all from the same guild, I am expected to follow their policies.  But I'm not sure that attitude can be assumed.<br>
<br>
I think it's a shame the monk rolled on something he probably (in my opinion) isn't going to use himself.  Or if he does, at most, it will be a situational piece equipment.  However, I think it's also a shame he saw a nice item drop and then had people tell him he had no rightful claim to it, if he hadn't known in advance the group was working that way.  Always best to take a moment to clarify these things.  It doesn't really take long.<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S. There are levels and layers to NBG also.  For example, what if someone would get considerably more use out of an item than another person in the party, but both would honestly use it?  I have a set of int gear (earrings, rings, a held item etc.) I use only for trade skills, prefering charisma stuff for fighting (I am an enchanter) but trade skills are pretty important to me.  So I would definitely use a better int item even if I wasn't wearing it full time.  But I'd feel bad rolling against a mage or a wizard or a necro for it, if they intended to wear the item full time.  I don't have any hard and fast advice on this point, it's just something to think about.  That monk might have the cloak sitting around his bank account for backup in raids where there will be a lot of casters.  But better there, or on the back of some warrior 24-7?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umidwestpatriot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MidwestPatriot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 2:50:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=975.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
Wow, tough questions.  I have to agree with many of you.  <br>
<br>
I'll pick a path to talk about, since there are so many ways to go with this thread.  And loot rules are up to the leader of the group you join.<br>
<br>
Since I practice trade skills it is hard to get a chance at int or wis items when there are any int or wis casters in a group, as most people don't practice trades and do not understand the importance of int and wisdom in such things.<br>
<br>
So, I end up having to trade or buy the int items, get hand-me-downs, or pray that there is not an int/wis caster in the group when a nice one falls.  <br>
<br>
My high elf brother, Anloq, is working towards high skill in blacksmithy to someday be able to crafted cultural armor.  Finally, he has his int, wisdom, and charisma above 100.  That's pretty good for a paladin I guess.  Yesterday I got a ring of Goblin Lords while grouped in Sol A, I will give it to Anloq the first chance I get as the +3 int and +3 strength will both be appreciated by him.<br>
<br>
Plus, I can't wait until we are able to begin outfitting our brethren in some nice armor.  :^)<br>
<br>
p.s. As a woodelf master blacksmith I don't plan to spend anymore time or plat improving my skill beyond occasionally making banded armor for profit or for guild members since the woodelf cultural armor is made primarily through tailoring.<br>

I won't argue with the choices you have made, regarding what looting policies you like best, but you should make a point of asking about policies in addition to expecting to be told.  However you feel about it, NBG is quite common on this world, and it's everyone's job to prevent a possible looting nightmare later on.  Honesty and openness is the key.  No one particular system is right for everyone, in every situation.<br>

<br>
Now for the analysis: NBG should rule the day, however, that isn't always feasible.  If you do something else (all roll), or for that matter do NBG, state this clearly at the beginning.  Group leader is responsible for this.  Though this has been said in previous posts, I'm saying it again, as it is so imporant.  Guilds have broken and people have quite living on Norrath because of this oversight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rolling for a friend&quot; is simply bullcrap to the 10th degree.  Don't tell me the person's name, because they'll get a Black Alloy Lonsword in their back by me.  Anyone who even says that before a roll should be kicked, no questions asked.  Maybe I'm harsh, but that's my opinion.<br>

<br>
I wont beat the dead horse but Ill just lay it out as ive seen it happen in the past.<br>
<br>
Guild group-  NB4G hand down...always.<br>
<br>
Non-guild group-This is where we all get screwed up or screwed eventually on NB4G.  Lets say you hunt a zone where the cleric gets squat.  There are places like that and clerics know this....but you need clerics/healers or whathavya.  If you NB4G these places you are rarely going to get a cleric there.  There are places like this for many of the hybrids. <br>
<br>
As stated before you cant tell everyones intentions either...does the warrior already have a jade mace?  Does the Shaman already have a spear like that one in their range slot and they just handed it to their buddy so they could loot that one.  Hell take velious gems for example....(MY FAVORITE ARGUMENT FOR THIS CONCEPT!!!  BY FAR)  <br>
<br>
A Vel gem drops and a person in the party says &quot;I get that because I have the piece&quot;  That drives me nuts!  <br>
<br>
1 Prove it<br>
2 Ill probably have the piece tomorrow ...and ill need the gem<br>
3 How many gems do you already have of that type.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you really cant trust people.  I like to.  But i have been hosed 3-4 times in the last two years so I choose not to anymore.  So that said....NB4G is almost too hard to choke down.  I cant trust people I dont know.  If I became friends with them over time....sure np  There my buds and I would jump into the pit of the HOLE if I could save them or drag their corpse out.  But if I dont know you Ill be damned if I will hand you a jade mace because you say NB4G.<br>
<br>
That is my 2cp.  Sorry if it was a long post.<br>

<br>
I am a big fan of NBG in guild groups.  You join a guild, you adventure with them and you all work for the common good (generally).  If you adventure in a place where warrior stuff drops, it goes to the warrior.  No worries if you are a rogue, since you trust that eventually you'll be in a similar situation with the same folks where rogue stuff drops.  So if you are running around with guildies, NBG every time, no question.<br>
<br>
It's pick-up groups where NBG breaks down.<br>
<br>
You are a caster (any kind, doesn't matter) and are invited by another group to go and camp the Frenzy room in LGuk.  Then the FBSS drops and you are not allowed to roll on it since you are not a melee.  Whoa!  You all fought equally hard and likely you'll never lay eyes on one another again.  [of course if you are invited down there and they lay out the rules ahead of time, you have only yourself to blame]<br>
<br>
Now, I'm a big believer in the &quot;first right of sale&quot; for pick-up groups.  You roll randomly for the item, and the people who can use it get to bid on it for a reasonable price.  Perfect?  Easily enforceable?  No way, but it beats some of the NBG abuses.<br>
<br>
Now to be fair, FV is different.  There are few enough people here that once you get above 40 or so, you are almost bound to know everyone's name.  Heck, I'm only 18th level and I think I know the better portion of my contemporaries on sight.  In the best of all worlds, your reputation and habits will precede you and a zone-wide NBG may be a possibility.<br>
