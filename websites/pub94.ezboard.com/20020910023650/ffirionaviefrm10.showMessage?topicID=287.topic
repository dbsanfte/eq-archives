For what it's worth.  *grin*]<br>
<br>
The hidden cave was cool and dry, though its serene silence was scraped away by Cronadan’s harsh whispers.  Kimaya sat quietly across from him, wondering if she was too close to Cronadan or not close enough.  Should she stroke his hair away from where it tousled into his face, should she nod and smile or should she kiss his cheek...?  She never was quite sure how to react when his rage welled up within him, twisting his smooth features into a horrific mask of pure animosity.  Yet he continued on in anger as he had before, and she wondered if he was ever aware of the conflict she faced so often when they were together.  <br>
<br>
Cronadan spat dryly at the dusty floor, the echoes of his voice rising.  &quot;She is a monster, and I hope her dreams are haunted every night for the rest of her days.  I will no longer call her abbil.  To me she is not just a blank face, but a devil.  Though she declined it, my challenge to her still stands.  Not only does she kill innocents, but she also mocks me for being weak.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He paused a moment to sharpen his rage to a precision-point, his eyes gleaming with the hatred that bittered his voice. “Ohhh how I long to skewer her, and pin her to a tree for the carrion birds to feed on her.&quot;<br>
<br>
The precision-point cut deeply, though not into the heart he had wished for it to pierce.  Kimaya bit her lip and turned her eyes away, her voice lowered to a soft whisper.  &quot;Um… you know… that doesn't help...”<br>
<br>
The deep creases on Cronadan’s face softened -- only slightly, only for a moment – as he paused again to reassure Kimaya that he was merely venting his rage so he was less likely to act blindly on it. But the edge remained in his voice, and almost instantly the hardness returned to his words.  “She is a filthy animal, and I will treat her as such every time I see her.”  His eyes narrowed, his anger as fiercely overwhelming as Kimaya had ever felt it to be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  In the echo of his next words, “She is an animal to me....” her mind also echoed with memories of one of the many hunts they had joined in the Stonebrunts.  They were fighting an elder panda that had gored her fairly badly, when Cronadan flew into a flurry of wrath.  He had often grown dark and furious in battle, and she had tried to accept it because he said his anger made him strong.  But this time, seeing her wounded so deeply pushed him over the edge in a way that made Kimaya feel as though she were the one who was falling.  <br>
<br>
He snarled with hatred at the giant beast, piercing at it and slashing in the rhythmic flow that Kimaya often watched dreamily when it wasn’t a dance of malice.  But then it was a dance of anger and hate, and every movement of Cronadan’s weaponry was designed to send the panda into a world of pain, and of death.  As he thrust the killing blow, he cried out in rage, “My name is Cronadan, beast!  Recall it on your way to the underworld!”  And through the faint pain of her wounds, all Kimaya felt was quiet and small, lost in the waves of hatred flowing from one she loved...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
...much as she felt now.  She tried again to speak, thinking of the panda as well when she said, “Um, you know, I love animals too.”  <br>
<br>
He turned his eyes toward Kimaya as once again he almost softened, slightly more this time.  Even his voice had blunted a bit as he tried to keep her from feeling the pain that had welled up within him.  “As do I abbil, but she does not deserve, nor will she ever have my love again.  Love her if you must, I never will again.  All that glitters is not gold, and I see her ugliness now.  It is a pity that I was too blind to see it before.”  As he reflected on the betrayal he felt, the compassion he had tried to show for Kimaya was washed away by fresh waves of anger.  “Now, I have cursed her.  She will be haunted by my face for many years, even into her next life.  What she did to me, and those poor people was purely evil.  I will never forgive her.”<br>
<br>
He paused, finally noticing how quiet and still Kimaya had remained and realizing how hard it must have been for her to hear his words.  He sighed and lowered his head a moment, then continued.  “Forgive me, but I have one final rant... I must let this out to diffuse the anger I feel...”<br>
<br>
Kimaya nodded quickly, insisting that she’d seen all kinds of anger and that this was nothing different – it was all okay!  As she said it though, she wasn’t certain if she was finally learning to lie.  And if she were, she was even less certain whether it was to him, or to herself.  As she gazed into his eyes though, all she could think of was that the fire that smoldered within them was so similar to the smolder she had seen before, the passion of a different kind.  At least, it felt different…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  They were in caves far underground, trying to find a mutated fungus so that Kenyon could study it for a cure.  They had been sitting closely -- perhaps a little too close for Kimaya’s taste, as Cronadan had once told her they weren’t to be “kissing friends”, and she so wanted to give him more than a quick brush of her lips against his cheek.  <br>
<br>
She couldn’t remember what they were discussing, or even if she had said something funny, when that same fire flared into Cronadan’s eyes.  He quickly pushed Kimaya backwards into the corner of the cave, gently pinning her as he locked her in a kiss that even in memory felt like forever.  Then just as suddenly, he pulled back shyly, as though he never wished to do that again.  A few times after he’d kissed her again, but if she ever even touched him with her own lips he would back away, shyly, blushing… with him it was always swiftly passionate rushes forward that swept her inward, then pulling back and ebbing outward, away…</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kimaya looked closely at Cronadan, hoping to see a glimpse of his passionate fire fading to burn itself out like it often had before.  Instead she found it fueling itself into a blaze, and she braced herself to keep from being burned -- for when Cronadan’s rage peaked, it was far from the furious rant of one lost in blind anger.  Rather, he maintained control of it, wielding it with as great a precision as he did Tormentor, his chosen blade.  <br>
<br>
His voice sharp with the honed edge of delicate hate, his voice cut smoothly into Kimaya’s ears, the ones that tingled so when he traced his finger along them.  “If I see her again, I will rip her heart out with my bare hands and feast on it while it is still beating, and delight in the horror on her face as she crumples to the ground in agony.”<br>
<br>
The stillness in the air after the echo of his words faded was enough to snap him from his vision of vengeance.  Without looking up at Kimaya, he said he needed to meditate, to clarify his thoughts.  “'I am sorry.  Now you know the extent of my anger.... it frightens me.”<br>
<br>
She leaned forward to brush he lips against his cheek.  “'It's okay sweetlove, I just hope I can help”<br>
<br>
He blushed slightly, his lips toying with half a smile as he tried to reassure her.  “You do help abbil, in more ways than one.  I need you to keep me focused.  Without you, my anger might consume me... I am sorry that you just witnessed the depths of it.”<br>
<br>
She bit her lip, trying to find the right words to say.  Quietly, she said, “I really do love you, Cronadan.  I don't want you to get lost...”<br>
<br>
He looked at her for a moment with eyes she found hard to read, then responded, “I know abbil, and I love you as well.  I think it’s best if I try to diffuse my anger now through quite meditation.”<br>
<br>
She forced a bright smile as she nodded and rose to slip away.  “Oh, then I’ll leave you to be quiet!  I’m here for you if you need me.  And it’s okay, I understand.  I’ll always understand.”<br>
<br>
And as she crept quietly away, she realized she wasn’t quite lying, whether to him or to herself.  His thoughts and feelings resonated within her more strongly than almost anyone else’s, and there was a part of her that would always understand his hurts as well as his joys.  But that part of her in which he resonated was growing quiet again, and lost, and confused.  It haunted her in a way she never fully knew, causing pains she never fully recognized.<br>
<br>
Yet as she caught a glimpse of Cronadan sitting peacefully, she knew that it was okay.  She loved him, and she made him happy, and he made her happy too.  All the tarnish could be worked out, it was the brightness of joy that mattered.  She just needed to make certain that, through the chaos of pain, he found his joy. <p><p align="center">
