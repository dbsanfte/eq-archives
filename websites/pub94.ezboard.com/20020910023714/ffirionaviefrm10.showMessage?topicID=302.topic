/Expeditionary Force report #345-A<br>
Area of operation: The Ferrott<br>
Objective: Marsh bear<br>
Att: Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
<br>
Greetings Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
I write to you with a bit of mixed news. On our recent expedition with our beloved Zoo-keeper, we ventured into the marshy Ferrott, a rather dangerous area filled with Ogres, Lizards and worse. <br>
Coldhaine, our Zoo-keeper, was specific on getting a certain type of bears living in these lands, a so called Marsh Bear, to add to the rather extensive collection of beasts in our Zoo. So we headed out with a small but well-equipped expeditionary force comprising of me, ensign Trimanus, the Half-elf guide Strongbranch, Coldhaine and our ally from the Eldrich Collective, the Wizard named Panlounimos.<br>
The Wizard made sure our travels were short and managed to teleport us near to the area were Coldhaine expected to find the largest numbers of Marsh Bears, and luckily we made into the Ferrott without much trouble as we kept a low-profile and travelled by nightfall. <br>
<br>
We were very cautious as we entered the Ferrott and remained on guard at all times, just as you have taught us. And surely enough after scouting ahead of us, Strongbranch managed to locate an isolated Marsh Bear that seemed large and particularly vicious. Just what Coldhaine had wanted for the collection of beasts. <br>
We managed to rather quickly overpower the Marsh Bear with our nets and the specially tinkered cage-contraption Tinipus made for Coldhaine years ago. All went well, we got it towed back to the waiting Panlounimus, and he began to prepare the cantrip to get us back to safety, when all hell broke loose. <br>
Out from the green haze that hangs over the entire swamp, an enormous Ogre charged us with a set of claws and a ferociousness unmatched by any beast I have met before. As the Ogre were slashing left and right, the bear seemed to gain a surge of strenght and started to snap the bars of its cage, just as Panlounimos spoke the final words of the spell, magic whirled around us and we found us back in the Forest near the Steamfronts...Fortunately this event seemed to have confused the Ogre and bear quite alot, so we siezed the initiative and decided to retreat as fast as possible.<br>
Trinamus, Coldhaine and Panlounimos towed the cage, while me and Strongbranch covered the rear making certain the Ogre would not follow us. I personally saw Strongbranch fire what must have been a dozen arrows swiftly into this beast, almost before I could react, and the Ogre fell before us. To make sure it was dead, a couple more arrows were fired at the bleeding body of the Ogre, and we rushed as quickly as we could back through the Forest and into the Steamfront mountains.<br>
<br>
As I caught up with the others, the Wizard had managed to strenghten the cage with his Magic and the beast seemed much less aggressive as it have lost sight of the Ogre, but I fear that in the moment of chaos before the teleport was completed the Ogre managed to give Trimanus a deep wound in the chest.<br>
<br>
We made it home in one piece and with the objective we set out to capture, but I must recommend as strongly as I can, that ensign Trimanus be rewarded a medal of bravery and a good months vacation. I hope you will look kindly upon my request.<br>

Note : Next time I would suggest that you try to talk Coldhaine into settling for a more peaceful beast for the Zoo. As proud as I am of it, I cannot help but dread the day, we loose a Gemchopper because Coldhaine have unrealistic expectations.<br>

/Guard report 562-BH<br>
Area of operation: The Ak'Anon Zoo.<br>
Objective: Regular guard duties.<br>
Att: Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
Greetings Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
I bring bad news, as I fear the old saying that, one ill event seldom comes alone, holds true in this case.<br>
Some time during the night, a beast of an Ogre have managed to, somehow, slip past the outer guards, and travel inside Ak'Anon. As if this is not dreadful enough, it have managed to find its way to the Zoo where it broke in and started to free the Marsh bear that we recently captured in the Ferrott. (See report #345-A)<br>
Coldhaine the Zoo-keeper woke up from loud noices coming from the Zoo, and he proceeded to sneak down there only see the Ogre, that we had ran into on our expedition. Wisely enough he contacted me immidiately, and me and Haritiom rushed down there to stop the beasts from unleashing untold havoc on a sleeping Ak'Anon. <br>
I ordered Coldhaine to go and wake more Gemchoppers and send them to the Zoo at once. While he was away we tried our best to keep the Ogre and the Marsh bear trapped inside the Zoo, untill we could get reinforcements to overpower both of them. Upon seeing us the Ogre charged us, fierce fighting errupted and we tried our best to stand ground. <br>
Only in the nick of time did Coldhaine return with more guards, as the beast had already torn Haritiom to shreds and was turning its attention towards me. With the help of 3 other guards we managed to force the Ogre to retreat down to the tunnels underneath the Zoo. Coldhaine, being always on the look out for the most vicious beasts to add to the Zoo collection, rushed into his personal quaters and brought forth a dart-shooting device of this own creation. <br>
He ensured us that he could take care of the Ogre, if we could just corner it and hold it at bay for a moment, and seeing that Coldhaine have managed to surprise us countless times before with his tinkerings, we proceeded down into the lower tunnels.<br>
Fortunately for us the Ogre had ran into one of the old service tunnels leading to a dead-end, so we had it cornered and were ready to strike it dead, should it try to charge us. Upon seeing it, Coldhaine pulled the lever of his device and shot a dart into the beast. Seemingly the dart had been dipped in some of his special concogtions and the enormous Ogre fell to the ground almost instantly.<br>
<br>
We inspected the body and it was still breathing, though completely paralyzed, and an arugement broke out since Coldhaine insisted that we kept the beast for study and eventually to be displayed in the Zoo, while the rest of the guards argued that we slay it right there. <br>
Feeling grateful that Coldhaine had saved us for what could have been a rather nasty battle, I chose to grant him his wish and we dragged the body to the strongest cage we had, and put it in shackles.<br>
<br>
I know that Coldhaine have sent a plea to the King, suggesting that we keep the beast, but I must admit that I had regrets on not killing this foul creation when we had the chance. So I will write a letter to the King suggesting that we kill it, if not for Ak'Anon's own security, then for the retribution of Haritioms death.<br>
I hope you will support me in this case, Captain.<br>
<br>
<br>
I shall report back to you tomorrow, or as soon as we hear from the King.<br>

/Expeditionary force 657-EG<br>
Area of operation: Faydwer.<br>
Objective: Execution of the known criminal Maladominus Poxbringer and the escaped Ogre.<br>
Att: Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It has been some time since I have written my last report, and for that I humbly apologize, Captain.<br>
Much is there to tell you, and I fear that it is all of ill news to us and Ak'Anon. <br>
<br>
As you know, I set out with the remnants of Expeditionary force #43B in search of the criminal Maladominus Poxbringer, and the beast the necromancer recently releashed from captivity in our Ak'Anon Zoo.<br>
As we already know the Outlaws of the Dark Reflective have become quite adept in threading lightly and leaving little clues for us to follow, but this time we were in luck. A stealthy Necromancer might be able to out-wit our patrols at times, but not even such one could cover up the tracks of an Ogre.<br>
<br>
Before I left I quickly summoned Strongbranch to help us in executing a suitable revenge on the Necromancer and the beast, but it seems that troubles have also arissed in Kelethin and he had returned to the Greater Faydark immidiately. Exactly what problems there were in Kelethin I did not hear, but I did hear a rumour of a powerful lizard from far away lands going on a rampage there. Although I find that hard to believe, I would suggest that we send an Emmissary and escort to find out exactly what is going on there.<br>
 <br>
Regardless, I took three of my most trusted Gemchoppers and a young apprentice from the Eldrich Collective to accompany me on this dangerous hunt, and we set out towards Lesser Faydark. We did not have to go far to see the first signs of the Ogre stomping through the lightly wooded area in the Steamfront Mountains near the Faydark forest. Broken branches and heavy footprint was easily spotted, and we had no trouble following their trail even without our Feir'dal ally.<br>
<br>
We made our way into the Lesser Faydark without any sightings of the Beast and the Necromancer, but we did encounter a small troupe of Rangers who had begun to build primitive defences near the entrance to the Greater Faydark, and as I asked them why they were doing this, I only got an unwholesome answer. It seemed that there were trouble in the Greater Faydark with a mansized Lizard running around killing people left and right, plus there have been a Teir'dal invasion just a few days ago. It would seem darkness have swepted over Faydwer more than usual in this last past month, and I can fully understand the Feir'dal position. In that note, I would suggest we begin to strenghten our own fortifications as well, because even though the Koala'dal and Feir'dal seems to be the prime targets, I am certain that the Dark Reflection is trying their hardest to bring death and darkness upon us all as well.<br>
<br>
I questioned the Rangers about wether or not they have seen our targets, but unfortunately, they had only arrived just moments before we met them. We were allowed to pass the Rangers and moved as swiftly as we could into the Greater Faydark. <br>
Having always appreciated the tranquility of the forest-home of the Feir'dal, I was shocked at the sight and smell that met me. The road was heavily patrolled by groups of guards, all in highest alert, and in the air we could smell smoke...An experience that lead my mind onto another escaped criminal of Ak'Anon. The Arsonist Tanheuser Finkelstein. We were informed that we should stick to the road at all cost and stay in the higest alert, since they were still not sure wether or not they had chased the Teir'dal invasion force completely out of Faydwer or if the Lizard were vanquished or had left Faydwer.<br>
<br>
We sat out with quickly, pondering wether or not our actual targets might be the least of our worries. Tales of Teir'dals on Faydwer is most disturbing not to mention this Lizardman they talked about...<br>
The trails of our escapees were as easy to follow as they had been from the beginning, and fortunate enough for us, it seems that they had chosen to stay on the road leading to the Butcherblock Mountains. This I hoped would be our advantage as there would be a very good chance of them running into one of the many Elven patrols that were about.<br>
<br>
As we travelled down the road towards the Butcherblock Mountains, the smell of smoke and the cries of help became all the more clear. It was a chilling experience to travel the roads on the prowl of the Necromancer and the beast, but knowing that a Teir'dal raiding party or a man sized Lizard might ambush us at every turn. The only good news was that the trail was still relatively easy to follow, and it seems that they have made no attempts as to cover their tracks at all. I presumed they must have been in great haste, or counted on the war-like situation in Faydark to distract us. <br>
<br>
Near the entrance to the Mountains we encountered a small band of Feir'dal sentries huddled together over a wounded elf. I approached them and ask if there were anything we could do to help, and if they have seen our two suspects. It seems that one of them have been badly mauled by an Ogre and that his friends had successfully chased off the beast, but not before this unlucky elf had almost been killed. I could see that one of his friends where a Druid, as she applied her Tunarian magics to heal his wounds and stop the bleeding. <br>
As much as I hate to admit it, I was glad that we met this band of warriors, as we were now sure that they have proceeded into the Butcherblocks, and I was more than happy to leave the Faydark forest. For now the once so merry and tranquil forest have suddenly lost its calming effect on me, and rather gave me the chills to walk in this forest.<br>
<br>
<br>
I lead our group through the pass into the Butcherblock Mountains, and as expected, we were met with a large force of Dwarven guards who had set up at the end of the small pass leading into Greater Faydark. It seems that the dwarves were also doing all in their power to stem up for this Teir'dal invasion.<br>
In this land it would be alot harder to follow the Necromancers trails, so I told the group to pick up the pace and hope that we could catch up with the Beast and the Necromancer before we would loose trail of them.<br>
Before we left the dwarven guards I met a young Gemchopper, who I ordered to head back to Ak'Anon with this report you read now. I shall write to you as soon as I get an opportunity.<br>
<br>

/Expeditionary force 657-EG<br>
Area of operation: Faydwer.<br>
Objective: Execution of the known criminal Maladominus Poxbringer and the escaped Ogre.<br>
Att: Captain Compolten.<br>
<br>
And I thought the last report I send you, Captain, was bad news. I fear this is even worse if possible.<br>
As I mentioned in my last report, we picked up the pace and made our way quickly into the Butcherblock area in hot pursuit of the Dark Reflections Necromancer and the Ogre. <br>
We quickly passed many of the dwarven guardposts in the area, and tried to follow the trail of the Ogre as best as we could. Most of the dwarven guardposts had not seen the Ogre in question, but it seemed that many of the guards were more busy drinking and playing cards or arguing who would slaughter the most Teir'dal when the invasion hit Butcherblock, than they were actually guarding the road. A typical dwarven trait, I presume.<br>
<br>
It seems that the jovial mood of the dwarves had an infectious effect on our Gemchoppers as we proceeded down the road towards the docks at the mouth of the Sea of tears, people actually started to crack jokes on who would jump onto the back of this Ogre and who could sever its head with one blow...Obviously none of them had ever stood face to face with a battle raged Ogre before, but I kept my silence to keep the pace and morale up.<br>
<br>
As we passed the gates of Kaladim, of young ally of the Eldrich Collective the heavy footprints of the Ogre leading off the side of the road into the wilderness towards the southeastern parts of the coast. We quickly made our way through the underbrush and followed the trail as fast as we could. We climbed the hilly terrain and began nearing the coast, it was at this point our chase seemed to be nearing an end. Rolann, one of the senior Gemchoppers, had been scouting ahead and he came back to us white as a sheet and out of breath. He quickly informed us that he had spotted a ship lying off the coast, and loading this vessel have been an Ogre and a small dark figure, presumable the Necromancer. <br>
I quickly layed a plan of attack and readied the Gemchoppers for the coming battle. We would try and get as close as possible to them, and hopefully we could take them by surprise.<br>
<br>
We climbed over the hill and sneaked in on the two as they were loading the ship with supplies and crates. We did not get far though, as the Ogre stopped suddenly and swirled around sniffing the air, the cursed beast could smell us even and this distance. It alerted its master and the gnomish Necromancer turned towards the hill and began to mutter arcane words, at that I knew we do best to charge, before he would lay all kinds of diseases and poisons on us. <br>
A loud cry was uttered and I charged down the hill to engage the Ogre and told the others to attack the Necromancer. A swift and bloody battle ensued, and I am afraid that I did not see what happened as I was busy trying to out smart the towering beast of an Ogre. I heard screams of pain and saw darkness fly from the Necromancers hands as he continued to wield his foul magic against our Gemchoppers...I fear that our young ally from the Eldrich Collective was the first to fall from the dark magic and the youngest Gemchopper ran away in terror...It all seemes to be a blur in my memory. I tried to lounge at the chest of the Ogre and dealt it a deep wound, but it was only followed by a deafing roar and I was struck with its massive fist in my chest. I remember feeling my body being flung meters at this blow, but all after that went black.<br>
<br>
Some time later I awoke, by the feeling of cold water hitting my face. As I opened my eyes I saw a dwarven patrol standing at the sight of the battle. They helped me on my legs, but as soon as I stood I could feel that most of my bones in my chest had been broken and I felt deadly sick. I looked to the side only to be greeted with a sickening sight. The Wizard of the Eldrich Collective lay on the ground with his face all white and his eyes clawed out by his own hands...And only few meters from him lay Rolann. I could see his skin was filled with blisters and had a deadly green tint to it...The works of the Plaguebearers. Shortly after I feingted. <br>
<br>
<br>
I now lay in the sanctuary of Brell in Kaladim, with the clerics treating my injuries. I can still feel the sickness running through my veins and I see the worried looks up the clerics faces when I ask if I will recover.<br>
It is with utmost shame that I must report that our mission failed and all but me now lay dead. I fear the two have escaped to Antonica and we might never get our revenge. But alert our friends in Freeport and Qeynos, and tell them to keep an eye out for these to wile creatures.<br>
<br>
If I shall return to Ak'Anon is doubtful, for if I do not die of this horrible disease, I might die of shame for the loss I have put upon Ak'Anon and the families of the dead.<br>
