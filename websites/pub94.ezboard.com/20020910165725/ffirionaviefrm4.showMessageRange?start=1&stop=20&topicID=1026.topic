As the flames die down, the thread starts sinking and sinking, and is occasionally bumped by someone who either hasn't been reading the forum in a while and wants to get in their 2 cents, or by some goofball who bumps it just to ask that people let it die.<br><br>Dead horse threads can be extremely active, but everyone's offering the same arguments as previously and/or there's no resolution to be found.  An example would be the &quot;Role Playing Preferred&quot; arguments that used to be in here all the time.  Some people thought FV should be mandatory RP, some thought it should be optional.  Some people wanted to know why people who didn't want to RP would come here, some people wanted them to understand.  And they'd go back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, and back, and forth, etc.  The posts might've been very active, but everyone was just re-treading the same ground.<br><br>People who call a thread a dead horse probably do have a strong opinion, it's just that they recognize no one's gonna change their mind and get tired of seeing the thread drone on and on.  I've seen plenty of people who agree with the original poster call a thread a dead horse.<br><br>- Syll<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A> at: 7/17/02 2:22:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/17/02 2:32:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1026.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dead Threads</span><hr size=1> And so what if an issue goes back and forth?

Consider it akin to spectators in an arena yelling for blood when the gladiators get tired and just start swinging sissily at eachother and not doing much.

Was trying to convey the impression of two gladiators swinging weakly at eachother, as that might be the audience's perception.  Also wasn't trying to imply that the arguments <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> were</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> weak, just that that could be the perception of the person making the dead horse statement.<br><br>Mini-rant: Say what you mean.  Seriously, if you're talking specifically about Apep calling a thread a dead horse and closing it then say that, don't couch it in generalizations of dead horse discussions in general, cuz it wastes everyone's (in this case, read that as mine) time replying to an argument different than the one you were actually making.  We can take criticism (I welcome it actually).<br><br>Apep's closed one thread in here (that I've seen) for being a dead horse, and it was the one about democratizing the forums.  It was my perception that he closed it because leaving it open gave the implication that it was an issue up for debate, and it's not.  It wasn't a thread about the game, but about the way the boards are run, and as he's one of the board administrators it's kind of his right to say &quot;This is the way it is and if you don't like it tough&quot;, isn't it?  <br><br>I locked the two NT threads in here, as a favor to everyone involved.  In both cases the people directly affected by the subject matter didn't want the discussions continuing, because friends were getting drug into them / hurt, etc.  That was enough for me to consider them both closed.  If a post is about a Kudos for Xarp by Kzan being deleted by Kais, and Xarp, Kzan, and Kais all consider the issue resolved and don't want the discussion continuing that's good enough for me.<br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uburanmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BuranMcMuffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/17/02 3:38:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1026.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dead Threads</span><hr size=1> &quot;...people declare threads to be &quot;dead horses&quot; out of a will-to-power to silence the discussion because allowing the discussion to continue is not in their own interests. I do not believe people declare threads to be &quot;dead horses&quot; out of boredom with the topic...&quot;<br><br>There is evidence on this very board just over the past week to support the first conclusion and refute the second . <br><br>For instance, if you can stomach re-reading the &quot;Ogah (Akane) Stole Nabiki Account on FV Server&quot; thread again, check out page 6, where Ogah--who obviously has a vested interest in the conversation wrapping up--requests it be closed. Apep's response was a sagacious one--to leave it open, and be consistent. <br><br>At the same time, not everyone who declares a thread &quot;dead&quot; or a &quot;dead horse&quot; has a vested interest in it. For instance, check out the last few pages of the 9-page &quot;The Heagan Fund: Not a Flame, Im Being Serious&quot; thread, where at least one person who is not in a high level guild and has no vested interest in the situation suggests that it be allowed to die. In this case, the arguments had become cyclical, and the person was pointing that out. <br><br>It was her perrogative to do so, and I bet she was speaking for a majority of readers by that point. Obviously, people are free to keep it going, but most threads involving conflict do eventually reach a point where nothing new is being brought up: the battle lines have been drawn well before then, and if neither side is moving, they arent likely to do so. Sometimes it takes someone pointing out &quot;Wow. The past 20 responces are off the original topic and not accomplishing anything. DEAD HORSE&quot; for the two sides to step back and take a breather.<br><br>In terms of mods shutting discussions down...<br><br>Being a mod is similar to being an editor, which is what I do for a living. (Except, of course, mods dont get paid, which amazes me...) Unlike being an editor, mods learn in a public forum; every single mistake they make is immediately visible and critiqued. There are a myriad of questionable calls mods have to make every day--it takes patience, a great deal of knowledge of the writers involved, a certain amount of intuition, and a thick skin.<br><br>Experience also helps a great deal--knowing where to walk lightly and when to put the smack down. Ive seen the &quot;hands-off&quot; approach lead to chaos almost inevitably. Why bother having mods if they dont do anything? And dont ask me to believe that everyone is capable of editing themselves, because we all can think of folks who dont do that...<br><br>I guess my point is--be patient. New mods tend to be more active than they need to be, because they're trying to learn boundaries, and get a sence for what works and what doesnt. It **is** important to help them learn this, and one way of doing that is to speak up when they get near the boundary of being too aggresive.<br><br>At the same time, its also important to give all mods a break now and then, and not be overly harsh. They're only human. Some situations are complete judgement calls, all in grey, with no black or white... Put yourself in their shoes every so often. Its a very difficult job, and both sides need to give and take a little.<br><br>I think the &quot;give and take&quot; process is what we're going through at the moment. Its good to see that dialogue taking place. *smiles*<br><br>Kudoes to the original poster of this thread and the other threads who have been pushing for clarifications on things, and kudoes to the mods for responding and trying to do so.<br><br>Buran McMuffin, the original Iron Chef<br>**Slayin gnolls n makin muffins since 3174** <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uburanmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BuranMcMuffin</A> at: 7/17/02 3:42:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 686<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/17/02 3:51:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1026.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dead Threads</span><hr size=1> Heya Two,<br><br>   I posted this somewhere else, but I wanted to note (as a clarification) that the rules (as posted) are the stuff that will get you in trouble.  Other circumstances might result in a thread being closed, locked, or moved.  <br><br>   It's not against the rules if everyone involved with a discussion wants a thread removed, but I think that's a valid reason for deleting a thread.<br><br>   Like if someone posted &quot;Dude, my best friends KS'd a snake from me&quot;, and he wrote back &quot;Dude, I was lagging, I didn't know you were attacking it&quot;, and he wrote back &quot;Oh dude, I didn't know, I love you man, please delete this thread&quot;, and the other guy wrote back &quot;Dude, I love you too, yes please delete it&quot;, no one broke any rules but I wouldn't see any problems with it being deleted.<br><br>   I don't think Apep or any of the mods have the intent of stifling discussion in this forum.  If two guilds wanna have a 100 page argument over who had the rights to a willowisp that spawned by the druid ring I'm totally fine with that (so long as they keep it clean).  I might get involved if they keep starting new topics about it so that more people hear their opinion (ie: If new topics keep getting posted that were clearly intended as replies to an already ongoing discussion), but it'd mostly be for forum cleanup purposes (Moving the new posts onto the tail end of the original thread).<br><br>   However, if the topic spills over to board policies, and a direct answer has been given by the administrators to the question asked, I will probably close the discussion down if it keeps going on.  If Heagen asked for exclusive Veto powers over moderator decisions, and Apep said &quot;No, if you want that make your own board&quot;, and Heagan kept going and going yeah I'd probably lock it (if someone else didn't first). <br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 687<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/17/02 3:58:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1026.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dead Threads</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, if the topic spills over to board policies, and a direct answer has been given by the administrators to the question asked, I will probably close the discussion down if it keeps going on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>PS: That more or less is in the board rules, as &quot;All decisions made by the Admin is final&quot;.
