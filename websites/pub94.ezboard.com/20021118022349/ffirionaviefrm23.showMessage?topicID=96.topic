I knew that my home had been attacked. <br>
 Before tears, before stumbling and falling to my knees, I went to places I knew. Old stores, churches and even the Temple chambers, all ravaged by unholy powers. I grimaced at the thought, of had my mother been here, what I would have done, had I been here what I would have done. <br>
 But it was the temple that faced the most scars. The ancient halls of Tunare and the will of Nature ravaged by the hands of those that would think themselves gods.<br>
 I summoned an elemental of water to quench the flames. They soon went away and all that was left were the sounds of those that didn't perish fully; either to be placed into the hands of the druids that would save them, or prayers and kisses placed to thier eyes. They would pass on into nature; Tunare's breast placed to the lips as they would grow again, come back again.<br>
 I picked up a part of the stairs that had been demolished to a blast of magic, and saw the scattered remnants of a child's toy broken into shards. My eyes closed again as I saw within a holy vision those that did the act. I saw the gleaming maces of clergy, the armor clad and shining, layered in the blood of Koada'dal. But whats this? Among them, my own kin? Slayers of our people born of my own lineage? Did they know the curse they placed on themselves? Did they know what they did to the parents of those children left behind, and the mouths left hungry? <br>
 I saw the children brought together, and relatives to them step from shimmering portals, taking them to other homes in the Faydark. small places where they could learn and become strong. Some left that day with swords and shields, bound on vengeance. I could say nothing to them, for I knew had it been me, I would join them.<br>
 I placed my hands deep into the soil closet to the river, and felt tears finally streaming. I then closed my eyes and simply meditated.<br>
 As my sould opened into the universe I saw the faces of the betrayers. There were others there but the ones that used Mother to gain powers, they walked the world after this act, to think there would be no revenge. Why would the Mother allow them to keep power? Is there a lesson to this? Who would be the teacher of this &quot;lesson,&quot; as the young here were not able to face them and slay them...<br>
 I looked into myself, hoping I would be worthy. I thought of the many foes I had faced and those that I did call enemy...<br>
 I would learn names, I would bring her betrayers home. They would die as those they killed, head after head placed into a basket. If I died in the process, I felt it would be best, as had I been here when this took place, I perhaps would have been among the ashes, or been the one that changed the history to this bloody incident.<br>
 I closed my eyes as I felt the winds displace around me, and the gate open. I looked around one more time, resolved in what I must do. I must have more fury in my heart then those that betrayed the Mother. They gained power through her...now they must feel her wrath turned on them. <p><img src="http://baptiser.50megs.com/images/serion_aubauch.jpg" border="0">

<br>
All this talk of pain, of vengeance...from one who managed to leave a warrioress feeling almost raped by just his words...<br>
<br>
I would almost give pause to think about this tale, had it not come from that terrible mouth.<br>
