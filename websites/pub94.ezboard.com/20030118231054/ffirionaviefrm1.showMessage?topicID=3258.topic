With all the debate about RP going on lately, I thought it might help generate some *constructive* discussion.  My view toward roleplay has always been that if you can back up your story with believable elements, then do what you wish. My character may not agree with yours or like yours, but you will maintain my OOC respect for having a reason *why* your character is who/how she is. This has been revised a few times, and I'm certainly open to suggestions/updates.))<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Introduction to Roleplaying:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Roleplaying can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be. Some people like developing a character completely different from themselves. The shy, gentle gamer might choose to play a confident, arrogant warrior. Or, some players just play a character that is similar to who they are in real life, and they just adapt that character’s traits to fit into the environment of the gaming world. Some people write long storylines to accompany their characters, and some roleplay complex situations in game. <br>
<br>
But roleplay can be simple too. Roleplay can be as simple as merely refraining from discussing your ooc real life in game---like how your favorite sports team just r0x0red an opponent, or a long discussion about the latest trouble in the middle east. (That’s not to say discussing these things are bad, as we all enjoy a nice ooc chat sometimes. However, such topics, if not integrated smoothly into the world of Norrath, are at odds with immersion into the world, since your favorite sports teams and news about current conflict in RL are from the Earth year 2002.) Roleplay can be simply using the terms of the realm or demonstrating your hatred for your enemy in game. Roleplay doesn’t need bells and whistles to make it roleplay. You can make it as simple or as complex as you like, and both forms are enjoyable and add much to the game. <br>
<br>
The following tips are primarily for those who wish to roleplay in a more complex manner, though casual roleplayers may find them useful as well. These guidelines are not intended to tell anyone how to roleplay. The tips below are only to help those who might be interested in fleshing out their characters but don’t know where to start. No one is going to read through your posts and mark the monitor with red pen every three words! These are just training wheels to help new writers become comfortable with roleplaying in game and writing on a message board. Most importantly, roleplay how YOU want. Roleplay is meant to be fun, not a chore. <br>
<br>
I. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Useful Terms to Know</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Po</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - A way of referring to the player of a character. Example: PoIsharra<br>
B.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FV</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Firiona Vie server<br>
C.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IC</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - in character<br>
D.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IRL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - in real life <br>
E.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>OOC</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- out of character<br>
F.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Player or “mun”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Another way of referring to the person behind the character. It's short for &quot;mundane.&quot; Example: Isharramun <br>
G.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PvP</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Player vs. Player <br>
H.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>RL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - real life<br>
I.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - storyline<br>
<br>
<br>
II. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Roleplaying Basics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
A. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Remain in character:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If you want people to get to know your character's personality, please stay in character as much as possible. Keep OOC /say comments to the barest minimum, using /tells for most ooc banter. Preceding OOC talk with “OOC” is always helpful if you are mixing ooc talk with roleplay. For instance, if you are going to talk auto mechanics or sports, make sure you designate your discussion OOC as you speak, so that others around know that you know the difference between OOC and IC and you are currently having an OOC conversation.<br>
<br>
B. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Use appropriate world Language:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I personally am not picky here.  As long as you don't resort to D3WD 5P3AK to communicate, say whatever you want. But DO talk in the terms of the realm: <br>
<br>
C. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Interfering with roleplay:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> When others are disturbing roleplay in game, you can ask them politely to stop or /ignore them and proceed with your own roleplay. Likewise, if you see others roleplaying, please do not interrupt or interfere by making comments ooc that conflict with the tone of the roleplay. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Example of violating another’s roleplay:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
/em Shara races to Boran’s side, finishing off the foe, then quickly lowers the wounded Boran to the ground, her brow furrowed with concern. <br>
Roth says, “LOL, get a room!” <br>
<br>
D. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Understand the difference between OOC and IC.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Try to keep the two separate when engaging in roleplay. Please do not take things that happen to your character personally. If Dravor, a characteristically gruff character, tells you to bugger off IC, realize that the player behind Dravor is not a bad person-the character is just that way.<br>
<br>
E. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Know the difference between OOC and IC knowledge.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> As a mun, you may know details about another character that your character does not. Some information learned in storylines can be considered common knowledge that anyone living in close quarters would have of one another. However, much of it is something that would have to be told directly to you via roleplay in game or on the message board in order for you to specifically know the details. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Example 1</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: The kidnapping of a member could be common guild knowledge, whether your character was specifically told or not. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Example 2</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: The fact that a female is pregnant would NOT be guild knowledge, even if she posts a story about discovering it on a public board, unless the character specifically shares that info with another or everyone in the story or in live roleplay. In other words, if I post a story about Isharra suddenly discovering she's pregnant and not knowing what to do, but at no point does she share that info with another character in the story or during live rp, then no character will be aware of it (until she starts showing, of course).<br>
<br>
F. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Roleplay with ooc respect for the other player’s character and be mindful of how your roleplay may affect another’s character.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If your character is being treated in an unrealistic or inappropriate manner for your character type, consider sending a /tell to the mun to help him or her understand more about your character. This promotes cooperation and communication. Likewise, be open to suggestions of the same--something you may be doing could affect another character in a way in which they are not planning to go, and it is not your right to alter another person's character without permission.  (For instance, in my former matriarchal guild, males were supposed to be submissive to the females. However, some males consistently played the rebel, making it difficult for the females to roleplay strong, intimidating figures, since many male players would not cooperate by showing appropriate deference. In reality, the females could whip the males into submission, but, since “whipping” was roleplayed and not a true physical punishment, the males would just play that they could withstand the pain and STILL be rebellious.  I finally had to ask the players behind the rebellious males to at least “pretend” to obey the females and rebel behind their backs, so that the females could effectively play the strong, intimidating type without feeling impotent in their ability to discipline disobedience.) <br>
<br>
G. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expect other character types to behave realistically toward yours (and vice versa) in keeping with the character types and their abilities.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> For instance, if Maaxon is a stone-faced warrior who rarely shows emotion, don’t expect him to get all teary-eyed when you relate to him your tale of woe or to be all huggy when you show up for a raid, though his mun may give you an ooc hug in /tells :-D . <br>
<br>
H. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Important: We are not mind readers.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> In most circumstances, you cannot read the thoughts of other characters, so you cannot react to that unless the person displays an observable behavior from which you can make inferences. <br>
<br>
&lt;EDIT&gt; Took out examples until I can come up with better ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*Use common sense:*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> When characters show their emotion, whether it is through gestures or facial expressions, then by all means, react and respond. But unless your character can actually observe/sense it, there is no way for you to know the thoughts of another character. <br>
<br>
I. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Be sure that your character has weaknesses and flaws.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There is NO perfect person on the earth (except for me ;-) ), so it is unlikely that a “perfect” character exists in EQ. Consider all the great fictional characters you have read about in stories or books and you will find that they all have flaws to lend interest to their personalities and realism to their struggles. Many times players create characters that are the most beautiful/handsome, strongest, fastest, most powerful, most mysterious, and most intelligent one of their kind ever. Now, one or a few of these traits individually is no problem, but characters who have no flaws have one really big flaw---they’re boring!! <br>
<br>
J. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Remember that every move you make reflects on your guild.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Thus, choose your actions and statements wisely. Show pride for your guild by treating the badge of membership you've earned with respect. Be conscious of it. Know that when someone judges you on FV, they are also judging the guild. Bring honor to the guild in all you do!<br>
<br>
<br>
III. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Storyline Writing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why write storylines?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> While often not nearly as entertaining as live-action roleplay, roleplay by posting on the message board has certain advantages. <br>
<br>
--It is sometimes easier to inject suspense and mystery. <br>
<br>
--It can be used if your online hours are limited to times when few people are present.<br>
<br>
--It allows much more depth of character development and other useful writing tools.<br>
<br>
--You have more control over story segments. <br>
<br>
--It adds dimension to live-action roleplay in game.<br>
<br>
B. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Everyone is different.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Be aware that people come in all shapes and sizes, and not everyone is gifted at writing. Some have incredible skills in math, or can take a vehicle apart and piece it back together easily, but when it comes to writing, jotting even two words down is a task. The guidelines listed here are just that, guidelines. Not everyone will be able to write a storyline that rips your heart out, or makes you laugh, or makes you eager to read more. We all understand that and are just eager to learn more about your characters, in any form. <br>
<br>
C. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Writing guidelines</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
--Pay attention to facts/details discussed in previous posts in a thread. When responding to an ongoing storyline, be sure to remember details from previous posts, so you do not end up incorrectly representing the facts of the storyline. Sometimes misrepresenting details changes the whole feel of a storyline, as other posters after you try to adjust their storylines to your details and not to the details in the original posts.<br>
<br>
-- Make the reader cry!!! Or laugh, or scowl, or swoon. Try to produce a sense of sorrow, happiness, love, hate. Use lots of color and description in your writing.<br>
<br>
--SHOW the reader what is happening; don’t just tell them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Telling the reader:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Leaving Oasis made Shara sad. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Showing the reader:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Seeing the sun set over Oasis for the last time brought tears to Shara’s large hazel eyes.<br>
<br>
--Develop your character using storylines and reflections. Use reflections or interactive roleplay to flesh out your characters so that when others encounter you in game, they understand your character’s behavior and can act accordingly. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Storylines:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Typically a storyline is a piece of fiction written open-ended to include other character interaction on a thread. Sometimes, though, a storyline is not open-ended, and is simply written as a short piece of fiction to give others a glimpse into the character. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Reflection:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A reflection is a storyline written as a reflection of a player’s thoughts. Often, reflections cannot be actively responded to, since other characters would not know what is going on in another character’s head. However, sometimes reflections can be written in tandem. For instance, one character might post a reflection describing her confusion as a woman with amnesia and her conflicting feelings about the man who is supposedly her husband. The husband might post his own reflection in the same thread portraying his heartbreak that the woman he loves does not know him. However, neither posts would contain references to information found in the other, since the reflection consisted of thought and thus, was not known to others.<br>
<br>
--Portray another person’s character accurately. When you portray another character, try to represent that character properly, as the character’s mun would. Do not portray any character in a negative light in a way that is not consistent with their character. For instance, if someone plays a placid, intellectual character, do not write about that character having a temper tantrum over your new shoes, unless you have agreed with the player to do so. If you are not certain how another person might respond, then shorten your SL and allow them to respond or contact them before writing their character into your SL.<br>
<br>
--Suspense captures long-term attention. Use it when developing long-term plot lines.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Most importantly, do what makes you comfortable and have fun!!! Ask questions, offer suggestions to others, praise others. Be playful at times, be approachable, and bring honor to the your guild.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
EDIT: Based on input from Dronk and Caillou, I removed a rather confusing set of examples.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT2: /em is simply there to indicate that an emote is going to follow, *not* to show EQ players how to emote, since &quot;/em Isharra flips you the bird&quot; would actually result in &quot;Isharra Isharra flips you the bird.&quot; <br>
<br>
Am I missing any disclaimers?<br>

<br>
I don't see what the difference is between the 'Appropriate' and 'Inappropriate' responses. I can think of valid roleplay reasons for all of them. <br>
<br>
Overall it is a very good guide for generic roleplaying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 698<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 10:50:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3258.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introduction to Roleplaying</span><hr size=1> The difference is that in one, PoLaryssa and PoSynthia are telling PoZach/Maaxon via her emote that she does not want the characters to see or respond to her true feelings.

<br>
One of the most annoying thing I've encountered is when my character *thinks* something and everyone around her reads her mind. <br>
<br>
Now, this really doesn't apply to the casual EQ RP, but where I began RPing, thoughts were forbidden territory. You can't know what the other character is thinking if the character is hiding it. <br>
<br>
My issue is with the player using OOC knowledge to respond ICly. Perhaps I did not make that clear. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 12/10/02 11:08:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oligith>Oligith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 10:53:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3258.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/10869.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introduction to Roleplaying</span><hr size=1> I see the point that Isharra was getting at with those responses.  The point is the fact that we can't see the heart fluttering behind the dismissing wave.  (though the smile/glare is kinda confusing and men misinterpret those all the time in RL)  And we don't see the fear, but do see the placidity---another word for calmness---and hence should RP to the calmess instead of the fear.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I would not /em things that another character cannot see, but that is my own style.<br>

Isharra, it was an excellent guide.  Many future role-players will owe you their thanks<br>

The other thing that got me was the actually text of the responses. “Don't worry, babe. I’m fine.” and Don't worry hon. Ol' Maax is here to protect ya.” just don't sound Norath to me.<br>

When everything you do is written (ie no visual graphics), then you go into much deeper detail, and the *point* of emoting thoughts is to give players an idea of the inner workings of your character. I.e. if you play a hardass all the time, but your character is truly a big softy, then without using &quot;thought&quot; your character will only appear to be a hardass. Character development is heighted by the &quot;thoughts&quot; of RP. When your characters are so intertwined with other characters in a text RPG, thoughts very much come into play as part of the entertainment value and to help other players know how to write your character properly in involved storylines. <br>
<br>
EQ doesn't provide that depth of RP, so I don't use thought a lot here, since usually people do just that: use the thought as IC knowledge. But in my previous guild, thought *was* used as it was pretty intensive RP about deceit and manipulation. Without the other players knowing my character's thoughts, the entertainment value is lost because they can't see the manipulation as it happens. Perhaps thought is the wrong word---what I mean to convey is that there are some things, even gestures, done for which very clear cues are given in the emote to show the other player that his or her character is not supposed to react to it---at this juncture, at least. Later, when events unfold, that character might think back on things and say, &quot;ooh, that's what was going on back then...&quot; <br>
<br>
That's why it is included here---because in my guild players were required to respond accordingly. /sigh I had so much fun back then.<br>

In my view, to properly roleplay a person who is not showing emotions, you don't show them. To show the depth of your character, you must let them out in IC slips. <br>
<br>
An example might be; Isharra says &quot;I'll be fine, tend to the others&quot; /em The look in her eyes betrays the pain she feels from the wound on her leg<br>
<br>
Now, you can choose NOT to betray your emotions, but to do so and not expect a reaction to them would be a bit unfair to your fellows. If you Act like you are tough, but React in a way that betrays your &quot;true feelings&quot; the person who you are roleplaying with has a choice to react accordingly, with information they have. They don't have to filter out information they are not supposed to have, but you gave to them 3 seconds earlier. <br>
<br>
There is a difference between telling a story, and acting out a story. That is all in the perspective of the audience. When roleplaying, there is no audience, there are only actors. As there is no script, all the actors take cues from their co-stars. Meta Character/Game info, that may be part of the story you are trying to tell, is only known by you. If you want to let your fellow actors know these things through dramatic play, it has to be done in character. <br>
<br>
My rule of thumb is this, Say is used to act. /emote is used to react. If you choose to use /emote to act, it has to be consistant with your other actions, because the other players will read it as a reaction, and act accordingly. <br>
<br>

This is a roleplaying game, not a novel or a movie. It is not up one person to write the story, and everyone else simply to read the lines. It is up to the GM to provide the world and the backdrop, and up to the players to play. Each player provides what they want, and what you get at the end is totally unexpected at the beginning.
