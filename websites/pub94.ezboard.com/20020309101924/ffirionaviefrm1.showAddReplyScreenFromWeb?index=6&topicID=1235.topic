Abbey of Hate became the Plane of hate, so I bet the Plane of Decay is incoming...<br>

<br>
Weary of foot, her voice ragged from three days of constant warring and travel, Minuet pushed through the mist of Nektulos Woods. Despite the fatigue, her spirit was still buoyant, for upon her legs were the gorgeous blue Lambent Greaves, as promised to her by Walthin Fireweaver. Meeting his price had turned out to be difficult, much more then she had bargained for. If only it had been the simple collection and delivery of obscure minutiae from around the continent, as the task had originally presented itself.<br>
<br>
She still struggled with the memories of the Dark Troll and his slave. Her mind waging war on itself, she clung to her belief that it takes all kinds to fill the world. Even if some of those kinds were of an evil best not to be mentioned by name. In the end, vanity won. She ran her hands along the cool azure armor, as she had done unvaryingly since taking them from Walthin’s hands. Vanity, it wasn’t a sin.<br>
<br>
The Tier Dal guards gave her only a moment’s glance, thanks to the clever disguise afforded her by her enchanted mask, and she passed unmolested through the heavily guarded checkpoints along the road. The steady cadence of her drum kept her moving and it was not long before the woods began to thin and the pastures of the Commonlands surrounded her. It would be good to have the warmth and protection of the Sisters’ hall for a night, and she looked forward to the bath and warm bed that awaited her there.<br>
<br>
She was startled by a raspy voice. Disembodied, it echoed off the isolated buildings. She searched for source as it pronounced in a ghoulish tone,<br>
<br>
“You will not escape the grasp of the Plaguebringer. Bertoxxulous will strike again.”<br>
<br>
In her haste and distracted by her search for the speaker, Minuet failed to see the cluster of ghouls until the last minute. They were huddled over the corpse of some poor sod, squabbling over some choice morsel. She veered away at the last moment, but it was too late. She had caught their attention, and the horrid wights began to give chase, more interested in the hunt for fresh meat then in their current meal. <br>
<br>
Now as most people know, a bard at full tilt is the fastest thing on the face of Norrath. Minuet had no fear of being dragged down by the vicious claws and fangs of the pursuing ghouls. As she had a steady gain on them, she stopped to look back. To her horror, the ghouls had veered off towards another traveler, who was unaware of his plight. She raced towards him, shouting,<br>
<br>
“Run!! Run blast you!!!”<br>
<br>
 She was too late and the ghouls descended upon the hapless man in a blithering mass of foul teeth and rotten flesh. Hoping to save him in the only way she knew how, Minuet pulled out her mandolin and played a dissonant chord. Even their unlife could not defend them from the majik she summoned forth from her instrument and in anger they leapt from their victim and began to give chase to her once more.<br>
<br>
This time Minuet knew she could not let the ghouls continue forth on their rampage. She held no love for the folk of the Commonlands, but they treated her fairly enough, and they were not deserving of such calamity. She looked back over her shoulder. One, two…five ghouls had given chase. She muttered a silent prayer to Erollisi, and turned back into the horde.<br>
<br>
Undead are stupid, at least the simple creatures such as these ghouls. Minuet led them on a merry chase, all through the early morning and well into the day. She taunted them by letting them close on her, just until they were within earshot and then blasted forth another dissonant chord. As they reeled she would speed away. Twice she let them get too close and they pummeled her and laid at her with their filthy talons. She found herself rooted to the spot by their fell majk. But at the last minute, when it seemed her doom was certain, she was able to break free of the paralyzing grip, and she continued on her parade. Slowly the ghouls were overcome by her playing and they began to fall to the side, whatever force that had animated them beyond death now driven out. The last ghoul turned to flee and Minuet promptly ran up from behind and finished it with a resounding crack from her mandolin.<br>
<br>
She rested for a moment but then caught sight of another group of three ghouls skulking along in the shadows. She licked her lips, gritted her teeth, and set off after them.<br>
<br>
“Taboot!”<br>
