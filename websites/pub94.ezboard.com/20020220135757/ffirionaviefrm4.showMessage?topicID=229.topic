I'm not talking about mild annoyance, I'm asking: &quot;Why do we get upset enough to berate or dictate to those who do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a serious question.  I honestly want to know.  However, I recognize that this is a volatile question, so I decided to start this thread in the Soapbox to save Valquiss the trouble of moving it later.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I apologize in advance for the length of the post -- cause it is long, so skip it if discussion on this topic doesn't interest you deeply.<br>
<br>
As I've said in another thread, I couldn't possibly care any less about twinking when it doesn't directly impede my own activities, and the same holds true for powerlevelling.  I'm guessing that my views on that are mostly because of my RL personality -- I'm an original-text Taoist and generally don't get upset about too many things for very long.  Because of that, I honestly don't understand why others get angry about these topics.  So I'm going to post the only reasons I can think of and how I don't let those reasons affect me.  Those who can help me with their own reasons and solutions can (please) fill me in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> READ THIS FIRST:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I'm going to make some generalizations and observations.  These are based on past gaming experiences and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> refer to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ANYONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> who is playing here on FV.  If it looks like I'm hinting at someone in particular, whether it's you or someone else -- not only is that not my intent, I don't even know I'm doing it.  So please, please, please don't take anything here as a flame or use this thread to flame anyone else.  I lost my asbestos suit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Jealousy ~</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This little green goblin is alive and kicking in both RL and in online games.  When someone wants something and sees that someone else has it, sometimes folks let this goblin wrench around on their insides to give them an excuse to get mad about it.  Maybe to lessen the sting, they make sour-grape-style judgements about the person that has what deep down they want to be THEIR prize, transferring the inward upset of want to an outward upset of hostility.<br>
<br>
How I overcame jealousy: I just got over it.  When I first started on the original JediMUD waaaay too long ago, all I wanted in the world was a Jelsentronix Superstabber.  (Yes, it was actually called that.)  I can't describe how much I wanted it, nor can I describe all the sniping and gossipping that went on toward the lower-level twink whose high-level boyfriend got it for her.  I joined in on the envy at first until I realized something: I still didn't have a Superstabber.  I wasn't going to get a Superstabber.  Whether she kept hers or lost it or gave it away, I could waste all my energy being annoyed that she was twinked and it still wouldn't get me a Superstabber.  So I felt heartily ashamed of myself and moved on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Snobbery ~</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Some people just like any reason to feel that their work, their character, their behavior, etc. is superior to someone else's.  Whether it's to justify themselves, to be judgemental, or even just to get attention, they'll see something they don't like and feel it is their duty and their right to tell that person what they're doing wrong.  Sometimes this telling will be at great length.  And the triggers for this reaction are as varied as the reasons for being snobbish in the first place -- pretty much, everything that's different from how someone else would do it could elicit a bossy response.  Sometimes it's someone's background story, sometimes it's someone's RP style, and sometimes it's just how they choose to spend their time on the game.<br>
<br>
How I overcame snobbery: I'll admit, I still have to actively work on this one sometimes.  I've been on the other side of the fence often enough, though, that I think it's important.  This one I learned on a shared-universe fiction-writing newsgroup with a truly ridiculous premise.  It started off well enough, but then one person started to try to &quot;take over&quot; the group and impose his personal preferences on everyone else's writing, I found myself on the fringe of those being bossed around.  Even though I worked to keep the character I wrote &quot;realistic&quot; given the world's silly premise, I really, really don't like anyone telling me how to be creative, especially when I think that person is an arrogant twit.  Eventually I realized that arrogant twits seldom realize they're arrogant twits, so I started working to minimize my chances of being something I truly dislike.  That &quot;live and let live&quot; philosophy naturally applied itself to powergamers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Fear of the Slippery Slope ~</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This is a pernicious one.  When there's something out there we don't like, there's a fear that it will take over the environment and become the norm.  In FV, I'm guessing it's the fear that if folks powerlevel and twink here, most people will become uber and FV will be just another duplicate of what many folks moved to this server to avoid.  As a duplicate, there could be a fear that mass-uberdom will make it an environment hostile to roleplaying.<br>
<br>
How I overcame this fear: Actually, I understand this one.  However, I don't think this fear is particularly valid when it comes to FV.  First of all, this server was created as a haven for roleplayers, and I think enough of us will come here to roleplay that we can't be &quot;taken over&quot;.  Second, I haven't heard anything that indicates that powerlevellers or twinkers on FV are the least bit hostile toward RP.  Instead, I've seen the majority work hard to make sure that they can enjoy this server without impeding the enjoyment of anyone else.  There will always be a minority who muck it up, but they can be safely ignored.  (Sorry, I told you I'm still working on snobbery.)<br>
<br>
Even if I had this fear: Getting hostile wouldn't do anything to prevent uberdom.  The whole point of ubers is that they don't care about anything but their own pixels, and griping at them will either a) get me ignored or b) encourage them by giving them attention.  All it will accomplish in the end is adding hostility to the environment, which is something I left other servers to escape.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Enforcing RP ~</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This one comes last, because it sort of ties in to all of the ones above.  Some folks view twinking and powerlevelling as actively OOC/unrealistic (even though I could point to tons of RL examples of twinking and nepotism).  And when these same folks feel that FV should be Roleplaying Required, sparks can fly.  Unfortunately, when folks feel RP should be required, they tend to have their own sets of rules for what RP is and isn't, so this can splash any number of people whether those folks try to RP or not.<br>
<br>
Why I don't enforce RP: Now this is the one that hits me close to home.  I love RP.  There have been (frequent) times where I've practically lived for RP, especially in online games.  But every place I've been where RP was enforced, the tension between opinions and styles grew so heavy that it actively impeded open RP.  So many people either focussed too much on pleasing popular people or quit even trying that things just got... I dunno, &quot;unfriendly&quot;.  I don't know about you, but nothing breaks the RP environment for me faster than someone getting all judgemental about an OOC thing like how someone RPs.<br>
<br>
My worst example: One company's monthly-subscription text-based games.  Not only was roleplaying enforced, you got exp bonuses when a GM saw you doing it.  This resulted in two things: people tended to only get actively involved in GM events (caring little for player events), and when events happened, people were so busy trying to prove their RP skills that the point of actually enjoying the event got lost.  This was especially annoying as a GM trying to run the darn things -- though I did learn to recognize when people were really trying as opposed to just rewarding the RP that I personally liked, so I guess I got something out of it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for reading (or at least skimming) down here to the end, I know that was incredibly long.  But that was my best attempt to describe what I see as all the possible reasons for folks getting actively annoyed about things like PLing and twinking, and my perspective on how the server as a whole could move past those reasons.  I did this for one purpose -- to see if there's another answer I hadn't considered to my question:<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do we care?&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for any answers you could give me!<br>

<br>
I'll admit to it. Innoruuk was my first slippery stone. I watched uberguilds appear, and you know. I sat back and said nothing about it untill it was too late, and Innoruuk became the Lewt Whore Server of Uberdom.<br>
<br>
Enforcing RP ~<br>
This one comes last, because it sort of ties in to all of the ones above.

<br>
Maybe. But I'm not here trying to tell people HOW to RP..<br>
<br>
I'm out here, telling people TO RP.<br>
<br>
This is the Roleplaying Server. Not Roleplaying at all, its inexcusable.<br>
<br>
I care, because I'm sick of pretending everything is okay. I'm watching the Roleplayers out there slowly beginning to Twinkle down to nothing.<br>
If this place fails, where else do I have to go? No.. Not I.<br>
<br>
If this place fails, where else do WE have to go?<br>
<br>
Most of us came here for one thing, and one thing alone.<br>
<br>
To roleplay. To get new experences and see what Everquest is REALLY is.<br>
<br>
But their are some that come here for one thing, and one thing alone.<br>
<br>
To abuse and use the system to their own gain. I don't think I need to call them out anymore, you know who I'm talking about. If you don't, just ask and I'll say.<br>
<br>
That is all. Very Informative Kimaya. I hope this cleared up some things. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">Shintou Shinai, A Follower of the Life, and Words of Lanys T'Vyl.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 12:27:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=229.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Powerlevelling &amp; Twinking - Why do we care?</span><hr size=1> Hehe...people competing for exp rewards based off of roleplaying...if you ever played a Vampire LARP you'd need no explanation of this whatsoever...<br>
<br>
Enough about that though.  I'll share my thoughts.<br>
<br>
I actually fall into a few of those categories, to be honest.  The slippery slope would be my MAIN concern.  After coming back to this game I've been mystified by FV, and were it to go back to those base servers, I'd miss it really bad.  Sure, I'd have 10 bucks extra a month and I'd have time again to get back into my Half-Life communities, but I would miss it.<br>
<br>
Secondly comes the RP enforcing.  I agree with Shintou (whose post wasn't there when I first hit the reply button) in that it isn't about the people who roleplay differently, it's about people who make no attempt at it.  I still fail to see why someone would come here.  There are Low Pop servers that have a standard ruleset.  Unless you're overly fond of the language barrier or the trivial loot code...<br>
<br>
Lastly comes the snobbery.  I don't feel my RP is better than anyone else's, and often I feel like I just don't add up to others.  It's that I do feel like I deserve something more than &quot;d00d spare a SoW plzkthx&quot;  And YES, I HAVE ran into people who talked like that.  Again, this is the RP server, even if Verant labeled it &quot;Preferred&quot; rather than &quot;Enforced.&quot;  I feel like I have every right to be annoyed at people who don't respect mine and others' RP experiences.  IMO, you can do whatever you want in groupsay or guildchat.  That's up to the group/guild.  But when you are talking out-loud, you disrupt the atmosphere for others who are trying to play in-character.  It disrupts our suspension of disbelief.<br>

<br>
I got sick of Half-Life because of 133+5p34k and there all I have to do is shoot someone.  Here I try to involve myself in others, in the environment, and I have a serious problem with it.<br>

<br>
Shintou, you keep hounding on the &quot;this the Roleplay server&quot; thing.  Firiona Vie is a roleplay PREFERRED server.  That means that it is preferred that people roleplay on FV - but they DON'T have to.  <br>
<br>
I consider myself a hybrid player - I enjoy RP style interaction, but my group of friends also enjoys furthering ourselves in the game, conquering new mobs, exploring zones, and gaining new abilities.  Obviously there are going to be people at various points along the spectrum...and we all have to learn to live with each other.  <br>
<br>
What you are exhibiting is intolerance...which is a degree or two away from racism.  The difference between the two is who the hatred is aimed at (a race of peoples based on genetic makeup or a cultural/social group based on ideology).  It's ugly, and it has no place in this world let alone a frickin game.<br>
<br>
To speak from the heart, my cultural background and heritage stems from a place in the world where people are persecuted and killed (and I mean ARE because it's still going on) solely based on their religious and cultural backgrounds.  Complete and utter b*llsh*t!<br>
<br>
The stuff you're saying has an underlying tone that reminds me of the ugliness that I've seen firsthand due to intolerance.  Am I over-extrapolating from what you've said?  I doubt it.  I'm pretty confident that if you could click a button to *poof* all the non-roleplay people in Firiona Vie or Everquest for that matter, you probably would.<br>
<br>
I don't seen the so-called powergamers flaming you or criticizing you for your lack of &quot;uber&quot; gear.  Try to extend the same courtesy and just learn to live with other player's choices and differences.  All you're doing is alienating yourself and drawing a line in the sand between roleplayers and powergamers when the game is clearly designed with both in mind.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>

Why should I have to stand back and FORFIT my enjoyment so someone else can stomp and rain on MY parade?<br>
<br>
I've been patient. I've kept silent, looked the other way for WAY LONGER then I should had.<br>
I let Ubers do as they wished. When the Oppunity came (FV opening), I made my peace and left them in peace.<br>
<br>
I'm done being stepped on. I'm done watching people buck the System and use it to their own desires. I'm sick of feeling like I cannot RP on a RP server.<br>
<br>
&quot;I consider myself a hybrid player - I enjoy RP style interaction, but my group of friends also enjoys furthering ourselves in the game, conquering new mobs, exploring zones, and gaining new abilities. Obviously there are going to be people at various points along the spectrum...and we all have to learn to live with each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
Look. Their is NO problem with that. In fact, you are NOT any kind of Hybrid Player. Their is NO problem with wanting to advance yourself in the Game, within the fair and true ways of the Game. <br>
If you level Fast, legimitally, More power to you.<br>
And you say you Roleplay. RP style Interaction.<br>
Its all good. Everything is nice and fine. I'm not fighting about this.<br>
<br>
Non Roleplayers on this server DO not Roleplay. This IS a Roleplay Server.<br>
<br>
You seem to not understand. <br>
<br>
This IS a Roleplay Server. Preffered, its just a word Verant used because it doesnt want to admit that the rest of its servers are UberTrash.<br>
<br>
This server was CREATED for Roleplayers.<br>
Roleplayers, like me, you, and everyone else who roleplays.<br>
It was not created for non roleplayers.<br>

<br>
I just want to be clear here Shintou...is the above quote based on:  1) these powergamer/non-roleplay types actively interfering with your gameplay by taking spawns, spamming you with &quot;I 0wZ j00&quot; type slogans and otherwise specifically targetting you or your friends for ridicule or harrassment over how you roleplay, or 2) the knowledge that there are people on the server who do not roleplay?  <br>
<br>
I honestly want to know, because you are stating that these non-roleplayers are ruining your enjoyment and if they are ACTIVELY doing things to interfere then that should be addressed.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

Thanks to everyone who posted here, I really do appreciate it.  I have two comments:<br>
<br>
Sarhea: I didn't mean to ask &quot;why do we care what happens on the server&quot;.  You had the obvious answer to that though, &quot;we play here, therefore it is our server as much as anyone else's, and so OF COURSE we'll care!&quot;  At least that's how I read it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Shintou: Thank you for clarifying how you feel.  I'll be honest, I very much mind when someone d00dz around in front of me.  I personally would far rather see everyone use public channels to, if not RP, at least &quot;play along&quot; so they don't break the scenery for those of us who are.  However, I will argue against the idea that powerlevelling is inherently OOC.  There are those who feel that I have been seriously &quot;powerlevelled&quot; in my current career since I first started with this company less than two years ago, so I suppose that's where I'm coming from.<br>
<br>
So now I have two questions (for anyone, but mostly for Shintou because he seems to have the most time to post detailed responses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ):<br>
<br>
1) Do you believe that roleplayers will stop roleplaying with one another if we have to share this server with folks who d00d around?<br>
<br>
2) Regardless of the answer to the above question, what about others' behavior gets to you on such a personal level that it makes you so upset you can't enjoy the game?<br>
<br>
And I'll answer first:<br>
1) Nope.  I really do believe that folks who have even half a mind to RP will continue to do so, so long as we continue to foster a community that supports those attempts.<br>
<br>
2) This is only a half-answer, because it doesn't get to me that much.  I honestly do get annoyed, I won't deny that.  I get annoyed because I hate to see people begging when they're perfectly capable of fending for themselves, I don't like to be bothered, and I don't even know where the heck WOOT! came from!  But I keep that annoyance limited to a couple minutes of venting to myself (and to Kenyon, sorry Kenyon!) because I've found that getting strenuously bothered by it is bad for my health.  I play EQ to have fun, not to get mad, and the more I work at it, the more that goal is accomplished.<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for the responses so far, both for the content and the fact that there aren't any flames.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
EDIT: BTW, Shintou's last post was the only one up when I posted this.  But I can't address any more after that because I have to get back to work.  <br>
<br>
Also, I forgot to admit to something.  I actively ignore people who d00d around or beg.  I know that's rude, and I apologize, but I do so in order to preserve my own gamefun.  Sorry!<br>

I'd like to answer.<br>
<br>
1.  Yes, and No.  I think it's relevant to how bad it becomes.  Yes, roleplayers will always roleplay.  But No, in that if it becomes too bad here then the roleplayers will leave for another server or another game, and when other roleplayers see fewer and fewer people to roleplay with, they too will wander on, until eventually noone is left to roleplay with.<br>
<br>
2.  What gets to me is the way some act.  I've had very nice encounters with non-roleplayers, and I've had some pretty ugly run-ins.  I think it just comes down to respect.  I've no beef with powergamers or what have you.  I really don't care if someone cheats, so long as it does not affect me directly.  What I do care about is when people who don't RP feel they have the right to walk over those who do.  I'm not allowed to criticize non-roleplayers but somehow they have the right to criticize me?  How is that fair?<br>
<br>
True, it generally shouldn't upset anyone.  Life is too short and besides, the point of a game is to have fun.  If it isn't fun anymore, don't play it.  But that also doesn't mean people should just let their rights be torn to smithereens, y'know?  We all pay our 10 bucks, anyways. <p><center><font size=+2><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bmaidensfancy">Shiden Kaidan</a></font>

<br>
Yes. I've seen it break Innoruuk down over the Course of Two Years. Their is nothing better then a Total Immerision of Roleplay, in my humble opinion. Would you enjoy roleplaying with someone that just said, thx, gratz, roxor, OMW OTB TO BB. While you were trying to Roleplay? How much would your Roleplaying Mood would be when you run upon powerleveling, done in an obious non roleplaying Situation, on the so called 'Roleplaying' Server? Yes, I was pretty mad too, at the time. <br>
<br>
2) Regardless of the answer to the above question, what about others' behavior gets to you on such a personal level that it makes you so upset you can't enjoy the game?<br>
<br>
Because I've really seen it all before. When I came to FV, I came for two reasons.<br>
I tried and failed to Roleplay On Innoruuk, due to the fact that Roleplaying is Pratically Shunned there.<br>
FV is the Roleplaying server. I figured that I could Roleplay here, as I wished to do.<br>
<br>
Now I see FV becomming Innoruuk all over again, and its an Horrible Horrible thing. Yes, sure, Right now they are nice to everyone.<br>
Soon, people will want to be just like them, and they will become Uberguild_02, and Uberguild_03, and Uberguild_04.<br>
<br>
What a Horrid thing for a Server to have to go throught, being dominated by the Uberguilds and their petty fights over loot.<br>
<br>
If that happened, I'd quit Everquest for good. I don't want to quit Everquest, cause I enjoy this game. Not to the point of Obsession mind you. EQ goes off when my Philly Eagles are playing, for example.<br>
But I enjoy playing this game, and its a great game and I have fun.<br>
<br>
I don't want that here.<br>
<br>
When Verant created this server.. they created it with one type of player and one type of player at all.<br>
The roleplayer.<br>
<br>
Powergamers have EVERY OTHER server out there, maybe even the PvP servers..<br>

This and the Zeks are the only servers where the end game is pretty much open to anyone who wants to play it. Reaching that end game on FV is no great accomplishment, but being able to play it surely has some appeal. Personally, I'm not an RP fanatic but I enjoy the RP environment. My main reason for being here is all that green grass!<br>
<br>
Anyway people aren't processing what RP PREFERED means. Shin(somethin) has it right. <br>
RP = Role Playing<br>
PREFERED = We at VI can't strictly enforce a RP ruleset<br>
<br>
While FV was NOT created for people who have no interest in role playing, there is no viable mechanism for exluding them. The coded hardships (TLC, language, etc.) served to discourage most of them, but there apparently are a few that were willing to work through that. I am. Now, you can wave the &quot;PREFERED&quot; flag around and insist that VI intended this server for you, but we all know they didn't. They simply didn't invest the resources to keep you out. Anyway, accepting that no one can be excluded we must consider how to accept everyone. That's really the bottom line.<br>
<br>
Oh, and On Topic:<br>
<br>
Twinking isn't an issue with me, so I reckon I don't care. I enjoy acquiring my own equipment, which is another reason why I love this server. In the before days, I might do a boring camp of a green con for a new axe for any one of my barbies. In the these days, TLC keeps me at some minimal challenge level at least. It's loot+.<br>
<br>
Others twinking? Have at it.

So from your responce we can conclude that no power gamer has actively interfered with your roleplaying by spamming you or KS'ing you (I dont know what happened in cazic, so I don't know if that person &quot;interfered&quot; with you or not&quot;) and that most of this is stemming from some  fear or anxiety you have about how this particular server will develop?<br>

Do i try my best to RP with those who would appreciate me to do so?...yes.<br>

Do i consider myself an RP'er?...yes. Although some may have the talent to be more RP able than i, i am willing to work on this server for the enjoyment of all.<br>

I tell myself not to post these things, but here I go again.  <br>
<br>
What is a casual RPer?  I am a casual RPer.<br>
<br>
I left my other servers because, I too, was tired of doods, phat lewt, and all that other stuff.  Yeah, I picked up &quot;woot&quot; from those other servers and I still keep it with me.  But I also picked up hooray, and yippie, too.  But I detest RoXor, and l33t and all that other stuff.  I can't even decipher half of it.<br>
<br>
When I was on other servers, I was flat out told that people would not want to group with me because &quot;Luminas showers a dreaded evil %t with the righteous glow of Smite!&quot; or because, &quot;You know you're speaking elvish, right?&quot;  Uh, yeah.  I'm an elf.  Or people making fun of my rhyming Bard.  That was her thing.  That was how I set her apart.  But, alas.  She was shunned.  But Luminas and Veralyn both zoned, and were omw (half the time, the other half - on my way), and oom, and camped for the night.  <br>
<br>
So I came to FV.  I created a background story for myself after being on a few days and getting the feel for the server.  You can read it if GuildMagic is working today.  And I still zone, am omw (or on my way, depending on what my fingers say, not my mind), and am oom.<br>
<br>
When I first came here and tried to &quot;wander through the magical curtain, &quot;Provide healing for %t by the Power of Tunare,&quot; and be &quot;out of the magical force that sustains my etheral energies,&quot; I was also shunned.<br>
<br>
  ~*~On this server.~*~ <br>
<br>
I even had to walk away from a dark elf who almost violently berated for my attempts at rp-ing by telling me repeatedly that &quot;'Drow' was copyrighted by AD&amp;D, ooc.&quot;  That was so not RPing.<br>
<br>
What's a gal to do?<br>
<br>
But, within my guildchat, I am oom.  I am zoning.  I am omw (or on my way).  When I meet you, I am pleased to make your acquiantance.  I will march forward, if you like, to right the wrongs of the gnolls inhabiting the lands.  Or I /gasp if you happen to be oppositely aligned from me.  Or if you set the tone for it, I will go on a raid with you.  But if you once tell me &quot;WTF!  D33d I RoXor with my PH4+ lewtz&quot; I think that we need to part ways.<br>
<br>
What is a Casual RPer?  I am a Casual RPer.  Don't hate me for it.  Don't dislike me for it.  Just let me be, as much as I will accomodate your 100% emmersion in RP and try not to break your illusion that you strive for everytime you click Enter Norrath.  (I know the above comments aren't directed at me specifically, I'm saying &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; generally.)  I **totally** respect it, and wish that I were better at it.  People get impatient with my lollygagging while I try to do that stuff (RP), so I have to speed it up a little with zone and omw, and cut some, well, a lot of my story line out.<br>
<br>
I always try to be helpful and friendly to those around me.  I even try to give the &quot;evil&quot; races the benefit of the doubt, until they show me that they are truly dedicated to their evil gods.  Then,  /gasp.<br>
<br>
I will never give up FV as my server of choice.  There is no Casual RP Preferred server.  No in-between places for the likes of me.<br>
<br>
C'mon people now, smile on your brother (or sister)<br>
Try to love one another right now.<br>
