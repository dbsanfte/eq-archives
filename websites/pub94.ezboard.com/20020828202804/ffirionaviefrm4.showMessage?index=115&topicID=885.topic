Maybe you and the person who bought your account are happy, but guess what, it's *wrong*.<br>
<br>
What I was asking other people, not you, if you never reply to this thread again, it would suit me fine, is *why* your account hasn't been banned, with public admittance that it was sold.  You're selling stuff off in the market channel (I've heard you doing it), and certainly some other folks appear to have the impression that you're doing it in preparation of selling your account to someone else.<br>
<br>
I want to know, in general, from people on the server, what does it take to get an account banned when they violate the EULA with regards to transferring accounts? <br>
<br>
What does it take, when I *know* about several accounts in Awakened Souls on this server that are no longer under control of the original owners?<br>
<br>
Does Verant just not care?  Do they actually not have any method of verifying this information from within?  Can they only catch someone even more dumb and obvious than the accounts about which this thread is posted?<br>
<br>
If Verant doesn't care, should we?  why or why not? <br>
<br>
Either you don't think there's a problem here, and the EULA is just a way for Verant to avoid liability, but isn't actively enforced, or Verant actually does have a problem with it, but are not competent to do anything about it (which makes it a bad joke), or Verant does care and can do something about it (but, for example, in this case, hasn't yet?). <br>
<br>
I don't get it.<br>

If a verant official happened to read this thread and does happen to follow up they can trace the payment records that will show who paid for it etc, providing it wasnt on game cards. They do a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; which can take up to 6 weeks I am told.  Then if they have sufficient evidence they go ahead and take action.<br>

Its a good real life case, and just because the money was returned does not resolve the issue itself.  Time was spent on the filing of papers, time was spent by paypal. To my mind, they should all be reimbursed as part of the original scam.<br>

Reading through it many had alot of good opinions.   Credit to everyone for holding to the subject.  <br>
<br>
Ogah was removed when we got wind of this. Shoug followed suit as did Exxy.  Why Shoug and Exxy disbanded not sure as the reason.<br>
<br>
Reghar was put on ignore due to his irrational perspective he spins on any problem he tires to fix.  Reghar is the Mr. McGoo of help (imo). He sent me a tell that read like he was talking through a Ham Radio (/points at reghars post above).  It was my last straw dealing with Reghar.  I told him to finnish what he had to say to me and he would be put on ignore.  <br>
<br>
As for the rest of his post.. Everyone knows me well enough and in my practices to build a strong guild with integrity and trust.  We trust our members.  If we get screwed now and then it happens.  We wont walk around with blinders on because we are afraid to get a small stab in the back now and then.  Our members are our asset not our opponent so if some leak in that are shaddy of character and we find out about it we can take care of it..  Gear can be replaced easily, trust is something that takes time.<br>
<br>
This problem has been worked out but we shouldnt forget it nor let it rot at the bottom of the soapbox.<br>

if this is true take a look at ur fucking roster and look to see how many joined cuz of my work and look to see how many joined cuz of your work.<br>
<br>
i think you will then rethink who &quot;built&quot; the guild. <br>
<br>
as for the Mr. Mcgoo shit.  i got a hegan for you<br>
/yawn<br>
<br>
and if u put me on ingore for helping zok comunicate with u cuz u say u wont listen to it.  once again <br>
/yawn<br>
helping people is good so i dont give a shit if u have me on ingore<br>
<br>
you had your last staw dealing with me? or relizing every thing i said was true?  maby u put me on ingore becuse  you relized what an ass u are and how u clame to be the leader of the guild yet rollen and macgee plan the raids and run them.  all they ask of you is for u to bring ur bitch alt cleric.  if thats the qualifications for being guild leader why are there not more guild leaders out there.  no u never relized GL acutly have to Lead.  maby if u did so your span that you keep members would incres insted of  knoing people will leave eventuly to go on to antoer guild.<br>
<br>
u kenw ogah was akaen and u did not even let them know so u FAILED your guild like u alwse do.  maby next time u will think to take some one else advice<br>

The comparison to a soap opera is apt. Most of the people I talk to are aware of the major plot points. Some of those people post here frequently, others seldom. Some don't even visit these message boards. So you may be unaware of them (us). But, come on! You guys are celebrities. You get talked about.<br>

BTW Seems like Reso did a good job at cleaning this up. I cannot comment on what went on in the past, but they deserve kudos for stepping up and putting and end to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/2/02 11:28:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: lol</span><hr size=1> Enheduanna,<br>

I admit that I can be clueless. I moved to Seattle in 1991. About 8 months later I was visiting some friends back in Illinois and was looking at one's CD collection. I saw that he had Pearl Jam's 10. I said &quot;Oh cool you guys have heard of Pearl Jam out here. They are a pretty good local band from Seattle&quot;<br>
<br>
I had no idea that the album had sold about 10 million copies and thought they were mostly a local band. Point is things got hyped up on all the local bands that you couldn't tell if they were popular outside the Puget Sound area.&lt; I did know Nirvana hit it big btw so I wasn't totally clueless <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &gt;<br>

Its like reality TV through the web, &quot;real people, real lives&quot; (well sort of real).  Drama, betrayal, claim and counter claim, mighty houses locked in struggle, fantastic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

About the /yawn thing.  I think the idea is you either make your point <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> or</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you /yawn.  I don't think you can do both <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
