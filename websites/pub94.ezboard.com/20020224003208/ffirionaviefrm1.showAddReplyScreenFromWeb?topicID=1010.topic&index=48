It is a problem when a quest is designed to be done at or below level 6 and it cant be done by then with OUT help. <br>
<br>
I seriously doubt that the shaman quest was accomplished by someone on Firiona Vie with no help. I finally managed to make the grey jar, it was NOT trivial at a pottery skill of 38.<br>
<br>
Except for pure BLIND luck, no newbie will be able to have the needed materials before TLC stops them from gaining the needed materials. <br>
<br>
Although, I will say here, if you are a shaman Vah Shir, concentrate on get Xakra Bile. It will be the one thing that will trivial first and be the biggest head ache.<br>
<br>
You need xakra bile to make two sweet waters, I got lucky and managed it at a skill level of 10 on brewing, but it was not trivial then. AT least Brewing you are warned about and can spend level points to raise to 10 at level 2. Assuming you accept that you cant hit anything till you manage to learn by doing your weapon skill.<br>
<br>
You also need Xakra bile to make the clay to make the jar. This is the problem. At 38 skill in pottery it was still not trivial to make the unfired part of the jar quest. at 22 skill it was not trivial on the kiln portion. At 38 it was trivial on the kiln portion.<br>
<br>
By 6th lvl you will find VERY few xakra larvae that give experience. they are light blue for the most part at 5 (though a rare one was blue at 5 and one even at 6 I believe). So your basicly going to need to kill Larvae and scorpions only till level 5. the mud can be found in one spot on the ground (dont know the spawn time) and the beetles are still blue (though few) at 6. the mud is pretty common.<br>
<br>
Killing only larvae and scorpions means no money (except maybe from silk if you find any) for anything else, and you will need money for food (after you make 4th lvl, prior to that just suicide on a guard (ya real roleplay I know) and water and firing sheets. Dont ask me where you will get money for spells or bags. (much less any armor).<br>
<br>
Of course rather than do this, maybe you should just work around it, you know level fast and gain money to buy it from those vendors and players (after all isnt that what tlc is for) and do the quests when your higher level and can afford to buy the stuff, assuming you find any for sale. Or just dont do the quests at all, after all they are only good for a low level back piece and a shield, neither have much ac or stats to speak of. Dont bother doing what your guild expects you to do, just level and get better things later. Roleplay? Bah, roleplay you cant be bothered with what your people and guild expect of you. Wouldnt want to interfere with the TLC vision after all.<br>
<br>
Remember though, these quests arent broken nor are they bugged, on any other server you could do them. The vision here is just a different one. <br>
<br>
Dont bother to read my post, someone will be along shortly to pick (toatlly out of context) parts of it out and explain why only power levelers, impatient people, poor players and the like have any problem with TLC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<br>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 274<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/7/02 3:18:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> Not at all.<br>
<br>
Fact is, you're right on several points.  And, I can draw allusions from what you're saying to the Taruun quests.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think it would be great if the Pit were exempt from TLC, at least for quest items.  As no one but a Taruun can actually run those quests, it makes sense to let them be.  In fact, I tend to think that this was the original intention, but the Pit was an oversight.<br>
<br>
That having been said, I completed the Taruun dart quest anyway and can now make owlfeather darts.  Calare, my better half, has completed the Shaman apprentice quest and we're both questing after the SWB weapons now.<br>
<br>
I noted to Calare that actually completing each stage of the quest appeared to be unnecessary... just getting to the point where you can upgrade your tools appeared to be all that was needed.  And I was right.  It appears that you need to make two jars total, and after that all you need to do is turn in your tools to get past Xakra Bile altogether.  The last stage, if I remember correctly, uses Sonic Wolf Blood, so that's a stage that's WELL beyond newbieville.<br>
<br>
Mind you, I don't think this is how the quest was intended, but it's a workaround.  And I'm not telling you that you're a powerleveller or greedy or lewt happy.  Just sharing what workarounds we've been able to find.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, I believe that the Pit was an oversight rather than by design.  Verant said that it was excluding certain quest items from TLC, and I think that, had they had extensive play test on the affects of TLC on the newbie quests in Shar Val, they probably would have excluded Xakra Bile from TLC.  Maybe even hopper eggs (one would hope... they're tasty!) <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>
