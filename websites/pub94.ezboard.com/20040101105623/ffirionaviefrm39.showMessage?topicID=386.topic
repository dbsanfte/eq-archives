<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;">[Sat May 24 12:06:19 2003] The figure of Odic, adorned in armor of the deepest ebony, steps forward as silence descends upon the assembled mourners.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:06:40 2003] His eyes filled with sorrow, Odic clears his throat before speaking, &quot;On behalf of those who serve the Princess Firiona Vie, I bid you all welcome and thank you all for coming to stand vigil as we recount the deeds and honor of Guide Rachnor&quot;<br>
[Sat May 24 12:07:00 2003] Odic pauses for a moment before continuing, &quot;Many will speak today, and not all possess the greater voice. I must ask that all reframe from using shout save those who are called upon to speak.&quot;<br>
[Sat May 24 12:07:18 2003] Odic continues, &quot; I yield now to Senior Guide Amato who has journeyed far from the lands of Vazaelle to open this memorial with words of the heart.&quot; Odic nods to Amato.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:07:39 2003] Amato clears his throat, and says, &quot;We have come together here today to celebrate the life of Guide Rachnor.  Life in passing is often mourned, but that isn't appropriate here.&quot;<br>
[Sat May 24 12:07:49 2003] Today, we will remember the good times.  We will hear from people who can tell us of Rachnor, and celebrate his enjoyment of others.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:00 2003] We will hear of his enjoyment of guiding, and his care for other people.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:08 2003] As we stand together here, we remember that life continues.  By remembering Rachnor, we also help him remain alive, for no one truly dies as long as they are remembered.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:16 2003] Now, let us open with prayer<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:24 2003] Please Rise<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:41 2003] Most Holy Lord God, we ask your blessing at this time.  Bring your gentle comfort to those here, as we come together to celebrate Guide Rachnor and his service to others.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:08:52 2003] Watch over those entrusted to your care, and may your peace and blessings be with all.  Amen.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:09:06 2003] Please be seated<br>
[Sat May 24 12:09:35 2003] M'Lord Odic, if you will.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:09:39 2003] Odic nods once before speaking, &quot;Thank you Amato.&quot;<br>
[Sat May 24 12:09:39 2003] Odic - Oft when we play games such as EverQuest we forget that behind every avatar is a person, a living being just like ourselves. The world in which we play is populated by real live people with needs, wants, hopes, and dreams.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:10:15 2003] Odic - Like any community there are some who choose to give part of themselves to make the whole community better. Such people go by many names, but here they are known as Guides.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:10:38 2003] Odic - One such Guide went by the name Rachnor and he gave his time, dedication, and his heart to both the Guide Program and to the players he served. Rachnor began his service March 29, 2000 as an apprentice on the Quellious server,<br>
[Sat May 24 12:11:14 2003] Odic -  He left the program in December of that year only to return last March as a servant of the Princess Firiona Vie.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:11:50 2003] Odic -  It was a pleasure to serve with Rachnor, and with zeal he took on numberous extra duties such as planning some of the recent events for all to enjoy.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:12:12 2003] Odic - It is only appropriate that we hold his memorial here, in front of the great arena door in this site of many events past, present, and future.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:12:49 2003] Odic - Rachnor's passing came as a shock to the Guides here, I had just spoken to him the day before his accident about what new events would be fun for the player population.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:13:26 2003] Odic - He took his duties as a Guide Seriously, and it was always a joy to be on server with him. He touched our hearts, as you will soon see from the rest of the speakers.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:13:55 2003] Odic - We are truly diminished with his loss. Rachnor was a very special person, and one who cannot be replaced.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:14:33 2003] Odic - He was our friend, and will be sorely missed. Our prayers go out to his family especially his son who is also in the guide program.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:15:10 2003] Odic takes a deep breathe, and says, &quot;I believe Guide Silae has a few words to say now.&quot;</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;">[Sat May 24 12:26:00 2003] I would like to take this time and say that I am proud to have worked with Rachnor.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:26:15 2003] He always had the welfare of the players in mind.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:26:54 2003] He spent many hours later than his shift to help me on pressing issues and player concerns.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:27:36 2003] There were times he even skipped dinner to assist me with petitions when many matters were pressing.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:28:13 2003] Guide Rachnor always carried two items.  A broom and a shovel.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:28:57 2003] He told me the shovel was to dig out monsters and players from the world.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:29:24 2003] The broom... it was to clean up the messes of issues he may have made.<br>
[Sat May 24 12:30:44 2003] I am proud to have worked with Guide Rachnor.  I don't know the mind of God, but I think he made this decision because even He may need help every now and then.... and He selected one of the best there is.<br>

[Sat May 24 12:39:44 2003] Xavienne shouts, 'I said to Odic during this memorial that something occurred to me here this evening.  I remembered that Rachnor had sent an endorsement to the Grading Team in regards to his son, Casey, who had reached an age where he could apply.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:40:34 2003] Xavienne shouts, 'It really says a lot about how much Rachnor cared about the Guide Program that he would not only give over 3 years of his life and passion, but also inspire his son to contribute of himself as well.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:42:12 2003] Xavienne shouts, 'The Guide Program is much the poorer for the loss of Rachnor, but he has left us with a wonderful legacy...and obviously many great memories to those who stood beside him day after day.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:43:38 2003] Xavienne shouts, 'Thank you for hearing my small contribution to this great memorial.  Please turn your attention to Thrads at this time.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:44:05 2003] Thrads shouts, 'Thank you Xavienne.  We have all gathered here, on Firiona Vie, as Rachnor's home.  We stand here on the roleplay server, but there is a time for roleplay, and there is a time for being without it.  Now is one such time.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:44:47 2003] Thrads shouts, 'I stand before you all today not as Thrads von Tepish, not even as Guide Thrads, but as a human.  I have my own life behind this character, and so did Rachnor.  I did not know James personally, but I wish I had.  I spoke with him once, and not for'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:46:46 2003] Thrads shouts, 'After my own absense from the server, Rachnor took over the position I used to hold.  He became the Event Coordinator for our beloved server, and he was more dedicated than any I'd ever seen before.  He held his events weekly, in this very arena, beyond this door that stands before you all.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:48:03 2003] Thrads shouts, 'He did a far better job than I could have dreamed of.  He did his best to bring a smile to everyone's face that he met.  As Jindrack showed, with mention of Rachnor's broom, he continues to do so, even now.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:50:19 2003] Thrads shouts, 'When I returned, he contacted me immediately, and we laughed as we spoke.  He offered me back the position he so loved and cherished.  He told me of his love for you all, and his dedication.  I told him to keep the position, for he was someone few could match up to.  That... was the first, and last time I spoke with him.  Only three days later, he passed away.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:50:52 2003] Thrads shouts, 'Rachnor... James... you will never be forgotten, and we will all make sure of it.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:51:08 2003] Thrads shouts, 'Semlaen... if you please.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:51:23 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'Thank you, Thrads.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:51:48 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'Guide Rachnor...  Yes, he will be missed by all.  But, he will never be forgotten.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:52:12 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'So long as one person remembers even the smallest detail about him, he will live on forever.  '<br>
[Sat May 24 12:52:47 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'Yes, we are saddened by the loss.  Friend, compatriot, fellow Guide, and father.  '<br>
[Sat May 24 12:53:21 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'But also, we must smile at his sense of humor.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:53:46 2003] Semlaen shouts,in Elvish, 'I can't count the times that he and I dueled in CSHome arena.  Anyone ever seen 2 Necromancers duel without spellbooks??!'<br>

[Sat May 24 12:57:26 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'At the begining of this ceremony, Odic mentioned briefly that it was a shock to us.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:58:48 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'What an understatement.  When I first heard that he was in a car accident I thought a quick silent praryer for his recovery, and honestly believed he was going to be okay, and put the idea aside from my mind.'<br>
[Sat May 24 12:59:32 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'Only to hear a few days later that he had not survived. My mind reeled.  And that the memorial Service was going to be on this server.  My mind drew a complete blank....'<br>
[Sat May 24 13:00:31 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'I found myself trying to comprehend the situation.  Rachnor was someone I knew right?  This only happens to other people, on other servers, in distant times past.  Not to us, not here, not now...'<br>
[Sat May 24 13:01:17 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'I had to go to the board to recall my memories.  To make sense of it all.'<br>
[Sat May 24 13:01:46 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'I did not have opportunity to guide with Rachnor really, my hours are too weird, and of late they have been sparse as well.  '<br>
[Sat May 24 13:02:18 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'I found myself reeling, wishing I had been here more, wishing I had talked with him more, gotten to know him better.'<br>
[Sat May 24 13:03:26 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'I look around at the ASTOUNDING gathering here, and I realise, each one of these toons is a person.  Look around to one another now.  Look at the names, the faces... each one is a life. A person. A friends.'<br>
[Sat May 24 13:04:10 2003] Brekka shouts,in Elder Elvish, 'Do not take a single moment for granted.  Remember that every time you encounter another person, you touch a life.'<br>
