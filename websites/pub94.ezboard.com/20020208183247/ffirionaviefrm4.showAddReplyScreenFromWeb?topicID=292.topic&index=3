<br>
you are simplifying the entire issue and trying to martyr Shintou.  Blatant personal attacks are never warranted, however what he said was quite insulting to many people - he repeatedly tried to tell people who didn't conform to his ideals to leave the server - and when you try and dish out that kind of abuse, you're setting yourself up for a backlash.<br>
<br>
I was vocal opponent of his point of view and I never resorted to direct name-calling...and frankly, outside of a few posters who did resort to slagging, the majority of the thoughtful posters who were active in all the threads did not call him names either.  <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, Shin stuck his thoughts out there, they clashed with a lot of people and he those people argued back.  Life it tough.  Don't martyr him for exhibiting a lack of tact and tolerance.<br>

But I think that happens much too often -- everywhere.  Rather quickly, it became fairly discouraging, and both sides lost any hope of converting me to their point of view.<br>
<br>
As an aside, and not totally off-topic;  I only see a handful of active participants on this board, and many of those were in opposition to anything Shintou said (I'm aware that's an over generalization).  It seems that if Shintou could have set aside some of his ego and placated his opponents with a bit more docility, he may have been able to state his case for a longer period, but the result would have probably been the same.  I didn't see anyone being overly rational in the several debates involved (another over-generalization). <br>
<br>
Things don't often go smoothly when fanatics are involved, and it seemed several diametrically opposed perspectives came into conflict.  It was sad, and discouraged me from becoming a bit more active.  Especially when I come to play a game.  If I can't play the game the way I want, I move on, either in-game or too another.  If FV doesn't pan out, then I'll be in another game.  Hopefully one I enjoy will be released soon.  As it is, EQ is the only one of this genre I still desire to play.  <br>
<br>
I do hope more objective moderation becomes a norm for this board. Since I don't feel part of &quot;the crowd&quot;, and will probably not be extremely active here -- it would be nice to feel comfortable posting here once in awhile.  As it is, I almost feel as if I'm intruding on a private playground.  <br>
<br>
Okay, to close this lengthy post and try to swing back towards the topic -- what was it, btw?  Oh, I think both sides of the numerous discussion behaved poorly, and it wouldn't have been so lengthy and troublesome had more moderation been present, or moved to a more appropriate location.  There would be no discussion of whether or not someone was a martyr, how poorly they were treated, etc.<br>

<br>
Regarding the whole &quot;Shintou&quot; arguement...I guess you had to be there from the beginning.  If his thoughts have been, perhaps a bit more digestible, things most likely wouldn't have escalated to the point they did.  However his initial post, he literally exploded and came out with both guns a blazing - clearly pent up anger over the game situation and/or RL.  Every force is met with an equal and opposite force.<br>
<br>
Regarding moderation, perhaps they should have locked and or deleted his initial post.  However there was nowhere to move it to as this is the Soapbox and it's for these types of discussions.  Hopefully future &quot;hot topics&quot; will not be so hot tempered.<br>
<br>
Live and learn I guess.<br>

Now suddenly his little anger-boomerang has returned, and he can't catch it. <br>
<br>
He wasn't a hero, he wasn't a martyr. He was just good at what he did, which was roleplaying. Even then, he admitted to ripping off most of his stuff. It's pretty easy to seem like you're better than you really are when you're copying someone else's writing. Hell, I probably could have gotten away with posting some exercpts from Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos novels in the Hero Heart Tavern and made everyone believe I was a great writer. All I would have to do is change three or four names, and that's it. <br>
<br>
Bottomline is that he wasn't that great. He was just a decent roleplayer.

<br>
I'm probably used to larger boards, or the small guild ones.  The larger ones have more opinions, more moderation, and the smaller are actually private little clubs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Yes, I missed a lot of the Shintou debate, and from what you said, stronger moderation may have been key.  He would have either had to find a more &quot;palatable&quot; method of expressing his views, or found another outlet on another board.  Not to keen on censorship or limiting viewpoints, but with such diversity, a balance must be achieved.  <br>
<br>
Opinions and ideas can be expressed, quite passionately, without making them attacks, combative, hateful, etc.  Just takes some forethought and a little maturity.<br>
<br>
I do hope some learning occurs from this debacle that recently occured.  As I catch up on old threads, it seems that every other one for the past weeks involved Shintou in some way.  I'm leaving work and going to shower to get some of the bile and &quot;hate&quot; cooties off me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    It seems the matter is over, I think I'll just begin to quickly scan any thread to make sure this topic isn't present <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugoestwoodwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goest Woodwalker</A> at: 1/28/02 3:15:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rexfelix>Rexfelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 3:05:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=292.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: *shrug*</span><hr size=1> ...oookay Robin Goodfellow, good to know...doesn't change the facts unfortunately. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 3:24:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=292.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: *shrug*</span><hr size=1> Just for a quick check ...<br>

<br>
I can appreciate that you may feel the need to defend Shintou, or whomever, but again, realize that there are people who had very legitimate arguements against his...and opposing his, your, or anyone else's view does not necessarily constitute a &quot;personal attack&quot;.<br>

It says he's &quot;intolerant&quot; (and implies that he's &quot;racist&quot;), or that he's characterized by &quot;intolerance&quot;.  This is a rhetorical device designed to deflect attention away from the actual issues involved and appeal to peoples' emotions.  After all, everyone disagrees with intolerance and racism.  It commits two logical errors, the first being ad hominem attack, and the second being an unfair emotional appeal.<br>
<br>
Unwilling to let this go, however, a few days later, on 01/17/01, in a thread started by yourself, you wrote:<br>

It adds nothing substantial to the argument, and it attacks Shintou's character, not his argument.  It implies that he's got a psychological problem, and that's why he disagrees with you.  It's also an attempt to position yourself above Shintou: &quot;I'm normal, Shintou's sociopathic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, and I can find more, if you like.  Shall I continue?<br>

So, how exactly do you &quot;contextualize&quot; these statements?<br>

<br>
I never claimed (infact quite the opposite) that I did not get down to Shin's level during that exchange. I do defend Rexfelix though because he is my friend and you were taking HIS comments out of context.<br>
<br>
I believe he asked you to point out where HE (Rexfelix) resorted to &quot;personal attacks&quot; and you have yet to do so. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

<br>
You claim I'm taking Rexfelix's comments out of context.<br>
<br>
Then put them in context.  I've already put them in the context I believe the were meant to be read in, and that context is as ad hominem attack.<br>
<br>
If youv'e got an alternate reading of those same comments, or can further contextualize them, please feel free to do so.  But on the face of them, the few comments I've posted here (and I can post more, believe me) are fairly damning.<br>
<br>
The floor's yours.  Have at.<br>

<br>
I recongnize you as a very intelligent person from your posts on this board and from others on the vnboards. You are a skilled debater and practiced at the art of deflection. I will answer your challenge by saying this. Rexfelix's posts are fine as they are. Let the posters read them and make up their own minds. Luckily you provided the links in your posts on this thread. I am sure noone will find Rex's posts have been personal attacks and I think anyone would be hard pressed to get him to stoop to that level. <br>
<br>
Rex is just a much calmer, more well spoken person than I will ever be and I would encourage you to step back for a minute and re-read his posts. If you do I am sure you will agree.<br>
