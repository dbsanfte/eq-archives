I'm no Dean Rusk or Richard Holbrooke, but here you are...<br>
<br>
1.  There is an important distinction between nationalism, patriotism, and jingoism.  Patriotism is a good thing... it implies that one will work to preserve what is good and fix what is bad about one's nation.  Nationalism is a mixed bag... for the oppressed and those that celebrate their culture, huzzah.  For those that use it as a matter of individualistic foreign policy, it shows a lack of global perspective.  Jingoism is what we have to defend against internally, as the previous two points can develop to the third if left unchecked.<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to be proud of your nation and your culture.  But don't be afraid to be challenged and don't be afraid to point out what is wrong either.<br>
<br>
2.  The U.S. is not a democracy, it is a democratic republic.  It seems like a small difference, but without the ability for the general populace to vote on every matter of policy, the voting public's only way to influence policy is through a) voting and b) public outcry during non-voting terms.  <br>
<br>
Those who defend leaders and policy without question, carrying the jingoism banner (NOT patriotism) do their own nation a disservice.  A republic NEEDS the whingers and the dissidents.  It cannot rest on mooers.  The mooers are a bigger problem than the whingers, because the mooers accept the bad with the good.<br>
<br>
3.  I would hazard a guess that the biggest reason the U.S. will be more diplomatic with North Korea ... China.  While not &quot;allies&quot; per se, the Chinese very likely would come to the defense of North Korea if the U.S. were to try to attack.<br>
<br>
That would be a Bad Thing.<br>
<br>
Also, don't think that a conflict in North Korea - even one that didn't include China - would be a simple matter of air strikes.  The rugged terrain of the Korean penninsula and dense ground cover makes anything but carpet bombing or close in helicopter rocket attacks really effective.<br>
<br>
Plus, there's the added complication of airspace.  I doubt even a neutral China would allow U.S. warplanes to cross into their space, and South Korea, Japan, the former USSR states, and the Phillippines would all be very susceptible to reprisals afterwards - suggesting a long-term holding force being station in the region, on top what is already there now.<br>
<br>
4.  Terrorism is a tool of those that are unable to face an enemy head on, and is usually only considered after other avenues are exhausted.  It is usually a direct action against the general populace to provoke a reaction from the head.<br>
<br>
Anybody who immediately dismisses the (at least) partial responsibility of U.S. foreign policy in the creation of terrorist states isn't paying attention...<br>
<br>
5. ... or getting his news from FOX.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Let me ask you, where in the Media do you hear that this is still the Greastest Country in the world? You don't. Ever. The media is run by liberal hacks. The only station out there that is remotely close to have dual opinions is Fox News. Which, btw.. has the Number 1 and 2 Rated Nightly News Cable shows.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, that's a bit pointed.   Rupert Murdoch's newspaper properties are outageously opinionated right-wing tripe, and have garnered a fair bit of popularity not necessarily for their content, but for the bullheaded bellicosity of the writing.  It's not news, it's entertainment.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Liberal&quot; media - comprised of massive mutlinational profit-driven conglomerates - aren't much better.  But don't fool yourself, media is a mirror of the public at large... they don't feed us a liberal agenda unless it sells more papers.  Why do you think the Food &amp; Wine section of your local paper is larger than the international news page?<br>
<br>
I would argue the value of having &quot;dual opinions.&quot;  I don't WANT my media to have opinions.  I want them to present facts.  I'll form my own opinion.<br>
<br>
6.  Coslin, not to harp, but the voting results of a leader who has absolute control over the voting process should be taken with a grain of salt (see - Slobadan Milosevic)<br>
<br>
Also, if you want to compare body counts - take a trip to Vietnam.  While I'm not detracting from the horrific acts of last year, the people who lived under the flight paths of USAF B-52s would likely hold a similar view.<br>
<br>
First rule of politics... nobody is innocent.<br>
<br>
7.  We are at a point in our polictical and military development where most conflicts will take place in urban, populated areas.  A scenario for which the U.S, military is woefully underprepared.<br>
<br>
I'm sure more will come up.  But I need to get back to work for an hour or so. <p><div align="center">

<br>
I hope everybody sees the farce in (i think it's FOX) FOX News' &quot;News you trust&quot; campaign.<br>
<br>
You should never trust news.  Question it.  Media Analysis is as fun as it is frightening.  Hell, even if it's just comparing the movie reviews in the New York Daily News and and the New York Post.  Find one movie where the two differ wildly on opinions, and then check to see if Time-Warner or Fox Films produced or distribute the movie.  It's pretty amazing.  If they'll do that for &quot;Bubble Boy,&quot; imagine what they'll do when the stakes are higher.<br>
<br>
The most even, responsible, and fair news program out there is the BBC World News.  Great stuff... makes a mockery out of anything I've seen here in the &quot;media capital of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sad, really, when the most honest news program out in the U.S. is the Daily Show.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoslinroguebarbarian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/02 2:14:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1582.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Confessions of a Curmudgeon</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. one tends to wonder if you contradict yourself..<br>

So, harping back to my point.. if Fox has the Number 1,2, and 4 top rated Nightly news television shows.. I suppose they are just &quot;entertainment&quot;?<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming. But that is how a small point is coming across to me is. <br>
<br>
On a side note.. everyone seems ot be taking my post and using it as examples. Which is fine because I posted it on a open forum. But, to think that I'm some dumb, crazed gun-toting Left-Wing Conservative Nut.. well..<br>
<br>
<br>
You're Damn Right. Except, I fully believe in the Constitution.  Which includes its right to free will, free speech, right to bear arms, freedom of the press (Entertainment, ie National Enquirer, or News Worthy) is the fundamental value of this country. And, before everyone gets all crazy.. It is NOT Outdated. Ask the Supreme Court.<br>

&quot;Friends&quot; is the #1 rated show in the U.S.  I don't ask Jennifer Aniston her views on renewing China's Most-favored Trade status.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming either... don't get me wrong. I've just found that FOX news (mainly papers, mind you...) has routinely glossed over important facts, critical analysis, and balanced reporting for quick jabs at pols (hate that term - I think it's a NY thing), heated rhetoric, and openly sniping at any Time-Warner holding while advancing the Murdoch agenda.<br>
<br>
Which is fine, in its own way, so long as it is in the open.<br>
<br>
What's funny about the liberal-conservative argument is that they both rally around the Constitution while insisting the other doesn't.  *shrug* The Constitution is not outdated... like horoscopes, it is written in a vague enough manner so that the same precepts can be used to argue widely differing viewpoints - a Good Thing - and has a built in mechanism for self-correction should parts ever become outdated.  Never a question as to the document's worth.<br>
<br>
Now the &quot;well ordered militia&quot; that is supposed to have the right to bear arms?  That's up for discussion.  As is how &quot;well ordered milita&quot; became &quot;the general populace,&quot; how militia groups became criminalized, and how &quot;bear arms&quot; can be taken as &quot;carrying concealed handguns with Black Rhino bullets.&quot;  But, that's an argument for another thread.<br>
<br>
In the interest of full disclosure, I vote Socialist, and I have no qualms whatsoever about leaning to the left or to the right.   Politics is a balancing act.... gotta have weight on both sides to make it work.  I believe in diplomacy over the bomb, and in the power of an informed electorate.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I meant to say this in the original post.  Bush isn't a terrorist, and I'm not willing to say he's a crappy president YET.  I will say, however, that he is one of the worst statesmen I have ever seen in my life.<br>

His comparison of the stock market plunge to a &quot;24-hour drinking binge&quot; lifted the eyebrows right off of my face.

They reflect the political veiwpoint of the people who appointed them.  It has become painfully apparent that turning to them for an impartial judgment is just naive.<br>
<br>
I believe in the constitution to.  It is designed to protect us from ourselves.  In the US we elect our government, and as the saying goes, because of that fact we may not get the government we like, but we do get the government we deserve.  And that's what scares me.<br>
<br>
Our entire foriegn policy agenda right now is being driven by a public appetite for jingoism.  It has carried over into domestic issues like privacy laws and our right to due process.  I am not comfortable with a nation that creates one standard for citizens and another for folks the government labels as &quot;dangerous&quot;.  We had that experience 100 years ago with Native Americans, and the results will be a black mark on our nation's soul forever.<br>
<br>
I agree, attacking North Korea would be incredibly dumb.  But I don't think the fact that North Korea is a militarily &quot;hard&quot; target, while Iraq is a &quot;soft&quot; one, justifies a double standard.  I want a rational, coherent foriegn policy based on the best interests of the United States, not one based on the best interests of a particular economic sector, or one that seeks to divert attention from pressing domestic problems during an election year.<br>
<br>
The American media today is, in general, laughably biased.  They do in fact tell us what we want to hear.  That's why the evening news that showed Palestenians dancing in the street after Sept. 11th never mentioned the billion dollars a year in military aid the US donates to supress them.  <br>
<br>
You won't see any uncomfortable discussions of the &quot;why&quot; behind these conflicts on CBS evening news, and you certainly won't see it on the Fox channel.  To be blunt, Rupert Murdoch's news edeavors are about supporting a particular political viewpoint, not informing people.  You may get a little of it in some print media (the big 4 - Wash. Post, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and LA Times being the best of the bunch), but still, not a lot.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I have my own politics and opinions.  But I will reiterate, the #1 threat to America today is ourselves, and our own lack of knowledge and understanding about what is going on around us.  It doesn't matter what your politics are.  Don't take things at face value.  Ask obnoxious questions.  Don't simply assume that since politician X is from the party you support, he can do no wrong.  Read a newspaper every day.  <br>
<br>
A poster above cited their support of the 2nd Ammendment.  If American loses it's freedoms it will not be because the US military stages a coup and we need to use our guns to defend ourselves.  It will be because a blind and apathetic public signed those freedoms away, because they just didn't care or know enough to say no. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoslinroguebarbarian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/02 2:41:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1582.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Confessions of a Curmudgeon</span><hr size=1> Eh. sorry.

<br>
Simply put when they see something wrong it's pointed out.  Hannity and Colmes is a great show.  Both sides give their opinion and tell basically how the Democratic and Republican viewpoints are.<br>
<br>
Bill O'Reilly - love him hate him he is not a Democrat nor a hardcore Republican (his views might be the same but he is not blind)  Actually watch his show some time and see who he criticizes ... more often its the Republicans although he has a special dislike for hippiesque people who are living in the 60's.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the posters who are speaking about the problems with invading North Korea (I personally think they don't want any part of it and thats why they admitted it).  No it wouldn't just be airstrikes.  But the technology of the US Armed Services is far beyond what our closest allies have.  Britain and other nations were amazed at what we did in Afghanistan (technically not that we did it) and the enourmous leap in technology from the Gulf War til now.  Don't fool yourself into thinking that a war would be so difficult.  <br>
<br>
(In all reality this is a horrible thing as General Lee once said It is a (grand I think) thing that war is so horrible else we grow fond of it)  Not a direct quote but the general idea is there.<br>

When something is wrong with what a Democrat is proposing, with public schools, with environmental protection efforts, with social issues, Fox News will go after it like a pit bull.<br>
<br>
When something is wrong with a big business executive robbing his shareholders blind, a major religious institution embroiled in a sex abuse scandal, or the vice president refusing to turn over documents regarding how much influence businesses like Exxon had in setting US energy policy, they give it the soft touch.<br>
<br>
I would prefer to watch CNN when I get home from work, but unfortunately, all CNN has on when I do so is Larry King Live, so I end up watching either Fox or MSNBC.  Frankly, neither of these are exactly bastions of journalistic integrity.  The editorial bias of the network is clear, even in the “hard” news reporting.  Having two guys debate opposite political viewpoints is nice, but it cannot make up for the editorial slant in the day to day news coverage.<br>
<br>
I watched Fox News the night after the Israelis dropped a bomb on an apartment building in the West Bank in order to kill the leader of a Palestinian militant group.  Of course in the process they killed half a dozen innocent people, including children.  The news coverage showed the wreckage, showed the Israeli Prime Minister expressing remorse for the loss of life, then showed Palestinian protestors burning American flags.  The viewer at home was left with the impression it was an unfortunate accident that occurred as Israel went after a terrorist, and that all Palestinians are terrorists who hate Americans for no reason.<br>
<br>
What the newscast didn’t mention was why those teenagers might blame America for what happened, namely the “made in the USA” logo on the bomb, and on the plane that dropped it.  Or why Palestenians are pissed off enough to strap high explosives to themselves and blow themselves up in a shopping mall, namely being driven into refugee camps as a result two foreign powers decided to re-appropriate their land in 1949 for the creation of a new country, without their consent.  <br>
<br>
Most certainly the terrorist acts were not justified, and the news coverage should never imply that they were.  But they should at least try and explain the “why” behind the events, from both sides point of view.   And that’s where Fox, and pretty much every other major broadcast media outlet, fails, either by accident or intent.  <br>
<br>
When you ask “why” you start to raise questions that make us uncomfortable, and these days our news media is much more interested in selling advertising than in challenging Americans to learn more about their nation and the world in which we live.<br>

<br>
I may argue that the creation of the nation state of Israel was wrong ... but the people who did it worked with the Palestinians and other Muslims who were similarly remorseful for what happened to Jews during WWII.  <br>
<br>
You know thats not put in the news over there ... their leaders actually took part in it.  It wasn't a we are taking your land like you portray it.<br>
<br>
And Fox has had more about business corruption than any other network <br>

At the time Palestine was a colony of Great Britain, and had little say in the matter.  Like all properties of the British Crown at the time, there was no democratic process for the people being ruled.  Britain, suffering from enormous economic problems following World War II, was beginning to divest itself of colonies around the world, particularly troublesome ones (militants supporting the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine had run a fairly low-intensity guerilla conflict against the Brits for years).<br>
<br>
The decision to re-appropriate some of the land within the borders of Palestine for the creation of Israel was made largely by the United States and Britain, but covered under the auspices of the newly-formed United Nations.  The average Palestinian had about as much say in the process as the average Native American had in the settlement of the American West.  <br>
<br>
Since that time Israel has expanded it's borders through military acquisition and occupation of Gaza and the West Bank (though Israel was certainly within its rights to defend its citizens from foreign aggression, which is what it was doing when it acquired them).  Unfortunately hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced from their homes during these conflicts, and Israel has never allowed them to return.  Worse (at least from the view of the Palestinians), Israel now has a settlement program that aims to create new communities on this same land.<br>
<br>
The BBC has an excellent web site on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  It is well worth checking out for anyone trying to figure out the mess in the Middle East:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2001/israel_and_palestinians/timeline/">news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english.../timeline/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
There is no &quot;right&quot; side on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  Things have gotten so bad I'm not sure it can ever be solved.  But Americans (and others) who are watching it from afar should be informed that their are two sides to the story, and both have fairly compelling reasons for what they are doing.  It is not as simple as labeling one a &quot;terrorist&quot; or the other an &quot;aggressor&quot;.  And we should also understand the role that we have played, and continue to play, in fueling the conflict, and all the assorted nastiness that spins off from it around the world.<br>
