<br>
Yet you chose to make your very first post here a rant?  Try posting a story about your character and see who responds.  Or drop by the tavern and write up an intro and give some people a chance to see more to know about your character than that the player behind the character speaks Dark elven.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So I'm getting beat down by a leatherfoot scout and a yellow conning ogre with a lammy and a yellow conning SK in full plate just stand there and watch me die.

<br>
With the new newbie rules, death is preferable to being saved from a tactical standpoint.<br>
   Death = full health &amp; mana restore.<br>
   Being saved = sitting on your ass for a few minutes.<br>
<br>
They weren't necessarily being jerks by not diving into the fight at level 3.  Your main problem here seems less that you weren't helped, and more that they have gear they didn't earn with that character.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then I start seeing all these dead NPC corpses laying around unlooted and think that it is odd... then I get the answer... over 50% of the new characters in nek are twinked and dont need to worry about loot. <br>
<br>
*sigh*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not all twinking.  This server has a 1 character per acct rule.  If you want to make a new one, you have to reroll (if you only have one account).  Most people find it fair to transfer the gear to the new character.  Inheritance seems the most common explanation, though I've seen others (murder, found treasure, etc).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A few days of this go by and I try again... and I see it all again... I approach a fellow Rogue on the freeport dock... I inspect him...

<br>
*sigh* <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You come to the server wanting roleplay, and upon meeting a person, this is the greeting you pick?  I doubt you'll have much more luck doing this than running up to people, screaming &quot;TWINK&quot; at the top of your lungs, and then expecting them to want to roleplay with you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> He then comments that he is not a twink... rahter, he informes me that he is a GM doing a live quest and that I shouldnt get upset. He then tells me that I dont understand this server. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Even the most poorly played GM characters don't generally tell you they're a GM.  Nor do they typically mill around at the dock waiting for the boat to Butcherblock mountains.  I'm assuming you're trying to sarcastically convey your displeasure with someone impersonating a GM -vs- conveying displeasure at being tricked into thinking you were talking with one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I give the guy some history about myself... much like I have done here and ask him what he thinks I should do.

<br>
You haven't told us anything about your character other than that he's a dark elven rogue.  You've also told us that you (the player behind the character) write good stories and can speak dark elven.  When taking the time to introduce yourself, the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> first</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing you mention is the level of your highest character, and the time you've spent playing, as if either have bearing on roleplay.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why are the RP chanels password protected?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Much the same reason people don't usually like playing D&amp;D at the mall.  Sometimes it's nice not to have to worry about some dork showing up and messing up the fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do RP guilds have lvl restrictions on a RP server?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Same reason a company might not hire someone with no work history.  Guilds are often organizations, and they don't just go handing out memberships to anyone who meets race/class requirements.  There's an underlying expectation that you'll have accomplished certain things in your life.  An order of elite knights probably won't take in every Freeport Orphan who can swing a sword.  A Tier'Dal house might want someone who's proven their usefulness in a manner more important than the collection of 4 moss snake scales.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Should I follow his suggestion and cheat? Make a fast lvling halfling and then Twink a reroll? I have 2 accts and I could do it easly...

<br>
Switching back and forth between serious questions and sarcasm is confusing at best, annoying at worst.  It insults the same people who are here trying to answer your serious questions.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is some of what I'm talking about above.  You make an informative statement, and mix it with sarcasm such that anyone who would care enough to learn such a fact gets insulted in the process.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyone have any suggestions at all?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Drop the attitude.   No one is going to want to play with you if you lead off with veiled insults..<br>
<br>
Here's some scenarios:<br>
<br>
You're wandering Nek forest again, and meet an Ogre newbie wearing crafted and wielding a langseax.  Which choices will likely provoke roleplay.<br>
<br>
A) Ah, the langseax, a crude Northman's blade.  I trust you gutted the fool with his own sword in obtaining it?  Nothing like waiting for their corpses to turn blue in the Everfrost snow.<br>
<br>
B) You!  Yes you, beast.  I am Xathari, an assassin of Innoruuk.  I order you to accompany me whilst I fight back these wretched halflings.<br>
<br>
C) asf7h qyf79ah agaf ;oausg.  That's Drow for &quot;Nice gear, twink&quot;.<br>
<br>
D) My blade thirsts for halfling blood.  Have you seen any scouts roaming these woods?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hint</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: All but one.<br>
<br>
   I really would be sympathetic if it sounded like you had been going about trying to roleplay and finding no one in the commonlands area to RP with, but it sounds to me like you're dragging a lot more baggage around in your backpack than a rusty short sword and some rations.<br>
<br>
  I've found the community as a whole very responsive to RP, and very nice to boot.  Are there a lotta newbies in higher level gear nowadays?  Yup.  Are there a lotta people who just came here to enjoy the peace and quiet of a low population server?  Yup.  But there's also a ton of people who love to roleplay.  It's not everyone for sure, but plenty that if you go out looking for it you shouldn't have much trouble finding it.<br>

<br>
You are correct... I had a bad few days on this new (to me) server and I started jumping on the first person I saw with an 'out of lvl range' item.<br>
<br>
To tell you the truth... I jumped right offline after that and came straight to the boards. <br>
<br>
...bringing all the frustration with me.<br>
<br>
Some of you let me vent... and to those... I say thanks.<br>
<br>
Syl... you slapped me in the face with reality... thanks.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I offended anyone.. or if I came off as an FV hater. <br>
<br>
I only mentioned the high lvl characters cause it seemed that the only people RPing were of high lvl. A bad call on my part. <br>
<br>
Asking someone if he killed a dragoon and took his dirk is sorta like  A) Ah, the langseax, a crude Northman's blade. I trust you gutted the fool with his own sword in obtaining it? <br>
<br>
...with a touch of attitude. *blush*<br>
<br>
Other then that... you pretty much called me on everything else. Guess I should count to 10 before I post in anger.<br>
<br>
I'll give ya 2 rusty cp for a chance at a first impression again.<br>
<br>
Any lvl 2 newbies in full armor got 2 cp I can barrow?<br>
<br>
*grin*<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to the whole 'server wide' RP experiance and have decided to just lay low and &quot;sneak around&quot; while paying attention to the ongoing and epic RPing that is all around me and slowly make my way into the whole scheme of things.<br>
<br>
I have also cut down on the use of the &quot;drow&quot; language... after noticing that most dark elfs use only hi and bye... I dont want to scare anyone away or seem like my language filter is broken. <br>
<br>
The RP guild I came from on my old server was pretty strict about it... as much as you can 24/7. Weather talking to other guildmembers or not. They considered that if you were not speaking Drow that you were not RPing. That inturn produced non RPers claiming that they were RPing cause they said Aluve and such.<br>
<br>
So if I have made anyone uncomfortable or came off as 'what the hell is he saying' ...I am sorry.<br>
<br>
Well... I think that covers all of it... time for a do-over.<br>
<br>
Again... thanks to all those who have been helpful and friendly both on the boards and in game.<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for an intro in the comming weeks... <br>

<br>
Well, I'm not very knowledgable in the &quot;Dark speech&quot;, whatever you might call it. Now if you would like to get together, I could possibly teach you some languages you might not know. Knowing another's language is one stop closer to knowing them.<br>
<br>
You might be one of those Tier'dal that can't stand the sight of humans &amp; if that's so, then that's your loss. I'm sure that a majority of Humans would rather see you on the end of their weapon then speak to you also but I'm not one of those (doesn't mean I will turn my back on you though).<br>
<br>
If you feel like conversing or conversely you feel like taking your hate out on me, then you can find me in the Commonlands for the moment. You could also send one of those little Pixie messengers with a message if you want to put your skills to a test with me or against me.<br>
<br>
That's all.<br>
