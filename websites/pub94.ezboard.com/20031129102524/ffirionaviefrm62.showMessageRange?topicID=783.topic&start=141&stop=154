I'm sorry, but I do have to disagree with this. How often does the left come down on Sen. Byrd's (D - WV) past membership in the KKK?  Bryd, at one time, was affilliated with an organization more or less dedicated to genocide, but usually gets left alone by the liberals.  Rush gets constantly harassed for making a bunch of really dumb, racially insensative statements in the past.  It's not &quot;Once a racist, always a racist&quot; it's &quot;Once a Conservative racist, always a racist&quot;.  <br>
<br>
And, Kazot, I think that's what racist <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>use</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to mean.  I think now it means anyone who says or does anything a member of a minority doesn't like, whether it's racially motivated or not.  Im sorry, I don't take the term too seriously anymore; the left has &quot;cried wolf&quot;one too many times.<br>

<br>
The key here is &quot;at one time&quot;.  Has Byrd recently been speaking and acting along a platform or line that would indicate he still supports or believes in the doctrine of the KKK?  If he still does then there is definately a problem there, and it should be looked into.  If not, than I can honestly say I see no problem.  People ARE allowed to change their minds, it is a one of the many wonders of the human condition.<br>
<br>
Case in point.  The late Senator Strom Thurmon.  He once ran for President (in the 40s) on a very segregationalist platform as a Dixiecrat (a long dead politcal movement).  He then became a Southern Democrat during a time when the south was known as the &quot;Solid South&quot; (when southern states had a hard record of voting democraticly).  He then switched parties to Republican later on.  During this time Thurmon dropped his segregationalist ideals and some of his other &quot;hardline southern&quot; beliefs.  Do people today say nasty things about him?  No, not really, yet he changed his mind and said some very racially NUMEROUS times in his earlier career... but then moved to more moderate lines... was he a racist, I would say no... because, like all capable human beings, he changed his mind, and I have no problem with him.<br>
<br>
The issue with Rush being &quot;racist&quot; is a bit different.  He has said things that are racially insensitive, sterotypical, and infer very racial ideals.  There is no real evidence of him recanting these past behaviors, because he still does it on his show.  Now... if he were to stop doing things (like using &quot;ax&quot; in the place of &quot;ask&quot; or playing the theme to the Jeffersons when refering to black legislators or callers) I would definately have a different stance than what I do.<br>
<br>
I personally think Rush is a racist.  I think he is VERY careful to just toe the line of racism.  He is a smart man and is very smart about his racism.  He knows what and how to say the right things... just enough to piss people off... but not enough to get slammed by the FCC or other Federal agencies.  Like I said, he is a smart man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

He mimics the accents and language patterns of many people regardless of their race. I don’t recall him ever using the Jeffersons as bump music but if he had are you claiming that the show the Jeffersons was racist? The problem isn’t that he is a racist it is that he is a conservative and doesn’t conform to the liberals requirements of PC Speech.<br>
<br>
Either a person is a racist or they are not. Using the dictionary definition he can not be a racist. If you choose to make up your own criteria then you can claim any one is a racist if you try hard enough.<br>

I used to put down the Enquirer a LOT because I believed that the majority of stories in there were complete BS conjured up to sell newspapers. I used to put the Enquirer in the same category as The Weekly World News. I was comfortable in my assumptions against the Enquirer until they actually did some real quality investigative work. At some point, they started reporting accurate stories and got to the bottom of investigations way before the police detectives could. Then, to top it all off, the police departments were using leads that were discovered by the Enquirer. Now it seems the Enquirer is conducting the initial investigation, and the police detectives are following it up! I understand the reasons the Enquirer can get a hold of information that the police detectives themselves cannot get...the Enquirer pays people for their testimonies and evidence to support the claim of whatever is going on. <br>
After dealing with the brain scramble that it produced in my mind, I have come to accept the fact that the Enquirer has become a paper that for the most part, prints absolutely accurate news when it comes to subjects like this, and releases the news well before anyone else can. <br>
As far as the amount of drugs the Enquirer said he was taking, I have my doubts he personally was taking all that...but I feel that they are probably accurate in the amount of drugs he would purchase...which would lead me to believe he either had the intent to sell (probably unlikely looking back on it), or he purchased it to distribute freely to his fellow junkies. I've never been a drug addict, but I would suspect that &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot; when it comes to drug use. Whether he had the intent to sell it, or just distribute it, it's still a felony punishable by a fine and prison time of over 1 year. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

But you never know about people and the strange things they will do. Maybe there is a whole group of pain killer addicted junkies down there going deaf by the droves. It will be interesting to see if anything else comes of this.<br>
<br>
My intuition tells me that by the time he comes back from the rehab program the majority of us wont even remember this unless we are reminded.<br>
