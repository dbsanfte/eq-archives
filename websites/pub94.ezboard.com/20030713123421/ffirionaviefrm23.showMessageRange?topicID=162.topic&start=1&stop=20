She dropped her satchels at the door. Throwing her cloak open and back off her bare shoulders, you see she wears lavender leathers under the finely etched cloak.  She orders a glass of chilled wine and turns to survey the room. <br>
<br>
Announcing to the patrons, some known to her and some not, &quot; I have returned. I have traveled the world, and visited every city in Norrath.  I have pondered my future in this world, and come to a decision. I was born a dark elf, full of hatred and condescension of all others not like myself. Now, so many hundred years later, I am not the young girl I once was.  I have loved more deeply than anyone of my race will admit to.&quot;<br>
She takes a long drink of the wine before she continues, &quot;Shintou, Morgrist, Azhaagh, Braellar, Gray, Kaifreel are those of note who I shared this confusing emotion called love. Humans and dark elves.  None of these have really made me happy. Fulfilled the dark passion ? yes, perhaps for a time.  Shintou would say love is for the weak. Love makes you blind. blah blah, he is a fraud hiding behind his sword and his god. Afraid to admit he cares that deeply for another for fear it makes him weak. Morgrist ..well..let's just say he loves the ladies..all of them!!  Azhaagh...ah he's more my friend than anything.  The rest..well...they have a story as well.. but not for the telling this night.&quot;  She takes another drink of her wine and continues speaking, &quot;There is one, who because of my race I ignored. I pretended i hated and that I felt nothing for him.  A wood elf.  A perfectly blond haired, blue-eyed elf of Kelethin.&quot; <br>
<br>
She watches the faces of some of the patrons of the bar as they absorb what she's said.  &quot; So I say publicly, I am no longer the girl I once was. I will no more be forced to choose. I choose one that will possibly bring me ridicule and perhaps lose a few friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Once, I took the god Innorruuk to be my own, for the sake of my house did I do this.  But really, never did I truly worship him.  It was a mockery.  The gods use their followers, oblivious of the needs of their children. I say now, I follow no god. I follow my heart for once, and it leads me down a much different path.  For the first time in my life I am happy.&quot;  She sits on a stool and awaits the responses of those she knows will have something to say to her news.   <p><br>

Dalion said it best.<br>
<br>
Those who follow their heart will find that it shall bleed.<br>
<br>
Love only has one true purpose, and that is simply an exploitable weakness in your enemy. This I know. I've exploited and had it exploited it all my damned life. I like to be the exploitee, thank you very much.<br>
<br>
But thats why you are here, somewhat in a wallow. Love clouds your mind, do you not see that weapon which the lightbringers use against you? Of course, you'd naturally be emotionally weak enought to run off with that thing.<br>
<br>
But I hide from nothing. When I did away with Citrellis, what little heart I had left died. The Undead have no love for anything, their cackling mad attacks are only fueled by their madness. This is an example I'd like to follow. They have no fear, only hate for all things living. This is the reason Innoruuk grants us the undead, just as he granted us his only Daughter.<br>
<br>
To show us the true path of hate. And I tell you now, those who say you need to love to hate are sorely mistaken. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Do not again refer to him as a &quot;thing&quot;. He is more the man than you shall ever hope to be. He admits what he feels and embraces it, not hides from it and denies its existance as you do. *smiles* Do you not now, push Kai from you? she who has confessed she holds you in her heart and wishes you would her in yours? Even though through all your &quot;teachings&quot; you've pounded the opposite into her mind. Stop fighting. Admit that to all things there is a balance. Good Evil, Light Darkness, Love Hate.

I'll say it-ya either look fer what ya aren't in others,or ya look ta find someone what's like ya as much as can be. I ain't one fer balance. Somethin' comes first in yer life,an' what that is be yer choice...though ya will have ta face up ta it in t'end.<br>

Shintou seems ta think ya can't put Hatred before love. Others will tell ya all it leads ta nothing but pain. I say they're wrong.<br>

Holdin' love FIRST,now...that's askin' fer it. Let it warm ya,and ya can burn down cities with yer passions. Let it consume ya,an' ashes are all ya get.<br>

* a slight dark elf with a shape and face very familiar, a face burned into your mind when you  slaughtered her and bound her soul to a dagger so you could control her looks at you *<br>
<br>
Lady Genashai, you've changed atleast from the days that my mother speaks of you. You seek again to find love and acceptance outside those that would support you. You did so with the Lord Morgist, and brought  down your house in the fractured fighting.<br>
<br>
You say you have love ? That's nice for now, how long until his people reject him for your blackened skin, and blackened heart. You ruled a house, your soul belongs to Innoruuk, you belong to Innoruuk, there is no way to escape it.<br>
<br>
You take a fancy boy for a while, that is your choice, your hatred for yourself drives you to attain things that are self destructive. I don't challenge your choice. It's yours to make, I watch as again you destroy yourself allowing the fathers blessing to control and rule you.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can convince yourself that the love you feel is genuine, an perhaps for a creature not formed of hatred it could be, but your body, mind, and soul are formed by the father, you are hatred, either  hatred for others, or hatred for yourself.<br>
<br>
This day with your grand statement you are hatred for yourself. <br>
<br>
*she raises a glass*<br>
<br>

<br>
But thats your business. Innoruuk made your ass, he can break your ass just as easily.<br>
<br>
Hiding from feelings? I don't HAVE feelings. I destroyed them long ago when I stoped dealing with you silly women. I have more important things to worry about, like the endless slaughter of cattle, then to worry about the emotions of some silly girl who'll probably end up marrying the cattle in the end anyhow.<br>
<br>
You don't have hatred? Then you're cattle as well, for thats their mark.<br>
<br>
So another Tier'dal wants a woodelf. Its a common thing now a days. Shame my mother died because of something thats openly accepted now, but thats something I'll handle once the time comes.<br>
<br>
Again with the balance defence. Their is no god damned Balance, the Lightbringers outweigh the darkness by a LONG shot. As I said, Tier'dal bedding woodelves is fairly common now a days. Thats got to show you something. I don't see any woodelves claiming that they have nothing but hate. Spare me.. and even such...<br>
<br>
Balance will end. Its the first thing to go once the time comes.<br>
<br>
Three Years time. Three years time this age of balance will last. Then everything you hold dear will be shattered against the ground of a world tossed into the darkness of Chaos. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I do not convince myself of anything. I do not &quot;bed a wood elf&quot;. I do keep his company, i do hunt with him occasionally. I am in no hurry to put myself at the mercy of another male.  As for being conceived of hate? Your mother has not told you all of my tale, child. For if she had, she would have mentioned my own mother bore me outside the house away from the family because of the love she had for my father. So no, i was not born of hate, i was born of love. Perhaps that is my one fault. My capacity to love others, to feel compassion and empathy.  <br>
<br>
oh oh shintou *tsk tsk* I do so love to raise your ire and get you to ranting at me. *smiles* I have to say aggravating you is one pleasure I doubt i'll ever grow tired of.   As for the wood elf..well..he's not cattle, and he's not a lightbringer. no more than you would be by nature of your halfbreed blood.  His curse is to be born of Kelethin, his path is that of hatred of his people and the Goddess they worship.  If anything, he has more hatred than I ever had.  What better match is it than of a teir'dal  without a house who is filled with silly notions of love and a wood elf who hates his own kind and seeks out a child of innoruuk for his mate?  So shintou, you go on with your hatred and silly challenges of everyone you deem unworthy and a &quot;lightbringer&quot;.  At the end of each day, you have your sword and your hatred to keep you warm and comfort you, While I'll have a flesh and blood companion who has more of an understanding of the dark passion than you or any other Teir'dal man ever will.  <br>

The only way she could ever feel for someone was to be bound to them. She respected you, that I know. <br>
<br>
As to being born of love or born of hate, look at your skin, you're black, twisted and blessed by the father. You know his love, inside of you, you can't get away. Your heart beat's black spoilt  blood blessed by the father.<br>
<br>
Your hands are long stained in his deeds, there is not way to reverse what you are. Put on as much white make up as you can, quaph potions until you're sick and dieing from them. In the end Innoruuk's blessing of our race will still run though your veins.<br>
<br>
You can pretend  not to hate, but when the essence of your being is hate, there is nothing else.<br>
<br>
As to who can you tell ?<br>
<br>
When she was reborn from your  dagger, it was a high elf  child that she was forced to bond with, the child  came from a preistess of Love, Innoruuk's touch on her soul twisted that  child back into it's proper form.<br>
<br>
She was raised the second time among the most loveing environment around, and still his taint,  brought the hatred forward in her.<br>
<br>
In the end she was as she always was, hatred, for you, for every one, for our race, for those that oppose our race.<br>
<br>
Tis the same in you, you long ago lost your essence to the father.<br>
<br>
While you dally with your  latest toy, it will creap forward again.<br>
<br>
Now as for me *grins* I'm just another lowlife. It's nice to meet a fallen matron, welcome to the common blood side of things.<br>

Its just a sign of the comming world, which I've accepted that will and is in power.<br>

Hell, you know what? I just realized something. That means all three of the people I ever came close to loving are with lightbringers now. I wonder if I'm to blame..<br>
<br>
..Nah.<br>
<br>
Three years everyone. Innoruuk gives you all three years to live the life of a lightbringer. I'll sit by and abide my hate as my diety does. When that extreme hatred comes to its full, the age of Endless Slaughter will begin, and their will be only one other I leave alive.<br>
<br>
I have a promice to a little woodelf. A smiling little thing. I promiced her that she'd watch the world burn. That I'd whipe the smile off of every single one of their faces, including hers. Who do you think I'm going to destroy to make that dream a reality.<br>

All that have given up their darkness.. so in final.<br>

But I love him for that dedication. He is more devout than any welp come from Neriak in my lifetime, for certain. If he wishes to share his great devotion for Him with another, then why shouldn't he?

Listening with great interest to the one called Genashai she takes mental note to soon meet with one so bold to speak freely beliefs so close to her own.
