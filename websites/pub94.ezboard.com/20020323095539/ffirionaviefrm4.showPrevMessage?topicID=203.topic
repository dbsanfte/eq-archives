The question of what's appropriate to sell TLC quest items for, whether it's good for the game that this is going on, and how it can best be done.  Rather than letting that other thread go on, I've moved my opinions onto this new thread, and hopefully we can begin a new discussion a tad more civilly.  I encourage the few other people who posted reasonable observations to that other thread to post here as well.<br>
<br>
My opinions, in brief:<br>
<br>
1. It's hard to claim there is any fair market rate, since most of these things used to be No Drop. The price people pay for quest items they need to contract out will probably vary widely case to case.  That doesn't mean anyone is getting cheated, necessarily, it just means that few quest items will be sold often enough to really standardize anything.<br>
<br>
2. Depending on the amount of support the person paying for items is willing to give, hunting TLC items could involve a lot of risk and potentially multiple deaths. The ghast hearts needed for the Symbol of Tunare series are one good example of this. Anyone level 12-15 hunting in the Lesser Faydark is either dedicated, insane, or just doesn't know any better.<br>
<br>
3. I am almost embarrassed to admit how much Windroll has been paying me for help with the Symbol of Tunare run, so I won't. But it's a lot. And when I got a ranger to help with those ghast hearts I gave him &quot;more money than he's ever seen.&quot; I didn't ask the rates I'm getting, Windroll volenteered them.<br>
<br>
All I'm really saying is think that lower level people who are willing to quest for what someone 20 levels higher than them needs deserve some fair compensation. Yes, you could probably hire them for less, because basic armor and spells and such can create a huge money crunch, but try to be fair. I personally think it's really great (and conducive to friendly interaction, if not role-play) that lower level people now have something they can do other than farm bat wings and bone chips. TLC needs also provide great opportunities for entering into a guild, or for serving a guild, as something of real value that a lower level person can do for a higher one.<br>
<br>
If there is something you can't get, cut a deal and find someone who can. And probably even better than giving them a pile of coin, why not ask what /their/ needs are and try finding them some equipment that you can get in the meanwhile? For help with my second set of ghast hearts (yes, I did it twice, because I'm insane) I paid another young ranger in enchanted jewelry, and I've never seen a young character more polite or more grateful. Both the rangers who helped in this would have my immediate voice in their support if they wanted to join Starspun. And that's a hell of a lot better than filling out a form on some guild's website.<br>

Of course this only helps the 2% of us that read message boards, but I know there must be others willing to do this sort of work (Me for example at lvl 12), and an apparent demand to have it done.  Many of us may have a piece or two of tlc loot in the bank mouldering or gathering dust.  Just a thought.<br>

I do not believe in a standard price for ANY item.<br>
<br>
If someone is wanting to charge so much...so be it. Either they will find a buyer or not. I find this just and fair in every sense of the words just like i find it just and fair that some sellers choose not to sell to certain people or races...in my opinion this can be RPing. It may not be, but at any rate, I find it the RIGHT of the seller to ask for whatever price he sees fit.<br>
<br>
Some may argue that this isnt fair...I find statements like this to be one of whiners. For if they didnt make the effort to get these pieces themselves...if it is easier for one class or level than another to obtain the item, that is way 'the cookie crumbles'. Like real life, the world of EQ isnt always fair and that i do find cool. If it was any different i believe my experiences with the game wouldnt be half as enjoyable.)<br>

if you(in general) wanted to powerlevel without thought to what you might need along the way, so you could be the first to 50/60, or so you could farm the high level stuff before anyone else, or just for a power trip... then i have no qualms about selling what you need for as much as you will pay. <br>
but there are a few people that powerlevelled themselves simply because they only like the high-end game, or that have done me favors or been extra nice or gone out of their way for me. those people i have no problem with. you know who you are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
as for quest items in general, i trade/sell them fairly cheap unless they are a pain to obtain, or very rare. and if they aren't hot sellers like Hearts of Fire, then i'll likely make you a good deal if you can't afford my asking price. <p><BR><B>Veloxia Voluptuous <Clan Werre></B><BR>

so for those that don't read spoilers it isn't quite fair to say that they should have known at level 30 what they would need at level 50+ (power of fire for example)<br>
as for what they pay... it is up to the buyer and the seller.<br>
personally i think giving uber loot to a level 15 character is not only silly, but detrimental to the level 15 character's playing ability. They will not know the skills they should, say if they had level 15 aquirable armor. but that is my opinion.<br>
overall though, it is up to the buyer and the seller what the items go for.<br>

It's pretty unfair to say that everyone knows what they're doing unless they're powerleveling.  Just because you ran to all the major spoiler sites and printed out everything you could find doesn't mean that everyone else does to.  If everyone DID then there wouldn't be as bad of a problem with TLC, don'tcha think?<br>

What are you complaining about ? How do you even know that the item exists ?<br>

I was exploring lava storm and &quot;found&quot; this one entrance to this place and just happened to talk to the right guy inside... um right.<br>

I personaly feed 80% of my quest items back to my guild, then hand others out for favors done. I'd rather have favors and good feelings then cash anyway. But I don't have any problems with folks selling them, each to their own if there wasn't a  market then they wouldn't sell the items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 139<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 7:46:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Selling TLC Quest Items</span><hr size=1> Well Dalninil, we care because later we find that for our epic we need an item that is trivial to us.  That's why.  Your logic is not exactly sound.  It's like saying that just because I don't fly to Japan daily that I shouldn't care if it sinks into the sea.  I expect if I ever needed to go to Japan I'd be upset if I found it was gone.<br>
<br>
And Hrain, I find much more RP in hailing NPCs (and I have hailed every NPC I have come across in the game so far and read as much as I could, even when some NPCs take offense and murder me for it) than in going to a site and mapping out a course for when I should have what items.  THAT is not RP.  That is powergaming.  If I never run across an NPC that leads me to my epic or to my armor quests, then I won't care.  If I see someone else sporting them, my RP response though will be that it is unfair for someone to wield power that I cannot, and THEN I will start hunting down things.  Unfortunately by then everything will probably be trivial.<br>
<br>
I truly enjoy hailing NPC's.  I even hail vendors, as a few have interesting stories or some saying that I find amusing.  I've made pilgrimages to several different NPCs that have different stories and taken the logs and saved those stories.  My last guild was based on alot of in-game stories that came from Kerra Isle.<br>
<br>
But oh well.  I don't expect others to think of me, or of anyone other than theirselves.  And for the record I'm not opposed to TLC.  Which reminds me that this thread was hijacked.  On that topic, if I needed some item and could not get it, I would be willing to pay insane amounts to get it.  I'm not fond of deleveling myself and if someone else is willing to sell me what I need at a somewhat reasonable price, I'll buy it in a heartbeat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/9/02 4:15:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ghast Hearts &amp; the Initiate Symbol of Tunare</span><hr size=1> This is off-topic, but only slightly.<br>

I did this quest in less than 24 hours at Fifteenth level with the help of a few rangers.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know how much those Hearts were selling for.  Oy.  I hadn't seen that much platinum in one place at that time.<br>
