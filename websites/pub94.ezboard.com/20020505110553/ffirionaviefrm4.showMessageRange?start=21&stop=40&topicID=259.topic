&quot;good and evil, or enemies of any kind getting to together to destroy a common foe is completely ooc, and also unheard in any books,movies etc. People who do these things are NOT roleplaying the way they should be.&quot;<br>

Are you stating this, or are you restating what the people who don't believe opposing ethos should mix are saying?  Heheh, maybe if I could hear the tone of your voice I'd have a clearer understanding of what you are saying.<br>

Trolls are perverse monsters who think it is fun to rip something apart limb from limb and watch the innards fall out. Ogres are either the &quot;epitome of the strength of evil&quot; or huge creatures who eat everything they see. Iksar are reptilian bigots who have spent their entire history killing and enslaving anyone and everyone they could get their claws on.<br>
<br>
An &quot;uneasy alliance&quot; (as I see it, and I'm certainly not an expert) would be an alliance between a human guild and a high elven guild to do somethingorother. They don't necessarily trust one another, but they don't hate each other, so they band together reluctantly and do what needs to be done (remember how the people of Gondor distrusted the elves in Lothlorien?)<br>
<br>
But an alliance between evil and good in EQ...that'd be like if someone killed my family, and then I &quot;grouped&quot; with the murderer to do something. Or like if the elves in Lorien decided to team up with the orcs to do something. It just wouldn't happen.The evils want to kill or manipulate the goods, and the goods understand they could be betrayed at any time, and killed and tortured. Can you picture an RL priest &quot;grouping&quot; with a blasphemous homicidal maniac for any reason? <br>
<br>
Okay, so I'm not saying that this could never ever happen. But some seriously intense and drawn-out RP would have to happen before it got to the point where it was really believable. And something tells me when it comes down to it, when there's a semi-high level good guild and a semi-high level evil guild, and high_level_mob_01 is ripe for the picking...RP will be gently pushed to the side. And I don't think that's a good thing for the server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubormwarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Borm Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 4:42:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is this the future of FV?</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>

<br>
To say that good and evil, troll and woodelf CANNOT mix under any circumstances and if they do it's a cop out is pretty weak.  Fantasy literature is full (as per my previous examples) of these types of alliances.  It is up to the people, however, to make the whole thing work out.  <br>
<br>
Think about how boring the Dragonlance series would have been if Tanis said &quot;Raistlin, you evil bastard...I cannot group with you and kill mobs...&quot; and then he proceeded to kill him or kick him out of the group.  It's the conflict of the intermingling of opposing types that makes that stuff interesting. <br>
<br>
For those so-called roleplayers who are drawing some imaginary line in the sand, step up to the plate and prove you are a roleplayer by using your imagination and make the whole thing interesting rather than a semantic arguement over &quot;I am good elf, I cannot help an evil ogre with anything.&quot;<br>

Is anyone any less of a Roleplayer for NOT grouping with that Druid, when it would make life just o so much eaiser in OOC standards?<br>
<br>
I don't mind if some people go Good. Its only a 'Cop out' when its pretty obious when the person is just doing it for the OOC 'Easy Way Out. Druids Got SoW, heals, Damage Shield. Screw this Soloing crap! Come here Happy Woodelvenlove!' Instead of a logical RPing reason.<br>
<br>
Like, &quot;A Troll Raised by Woodelves&quot;<br>
<br>
Or.. &quot;A Gnome that lived his life around Tier'dal&quot;<br>
<br>
Or anything that your RPing Imaginaion can come up with. Yes, situations like these add a good flavor to the game.<br>

<br>
and that &quot;flavour&quot; is what we all need a bit more of.  I could care less if according to Verant's ever-shifting mythos a troll has no business in Kelethin, let alone hanging out with woodelves.  I love it though, when a player breaks the rules and decides that his troll THINKS he is a ranger...so he prowls around the woods of Kelethin, mimicking woodelves, tries to become friends with the ranger community - with the end result being inventive and amusing.  <br>
<br>
I mean as long as the player shows some initiative, I'll buy anything:  why is that necromancer permitted in that predominantly good guild?  Well perhaps because at one point he was a priest who lost his beloved and fell into the necromantic arts in order to communicate with his dearly departed.  And while he has become somewhat twisted by the dark arts, those that new him before remember the good that was in him...<br>
<br>
If it's fun and not overly /ooc or &quot;convenient&quot; then why the hell not let it happen? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unakath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nakath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 5:57:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   about calendars and the sleeper and maybe a little about RP</span><hr size=1> Serverwide calendars always disintegrate. Vindication is causing it the way that every guild that is capable of taking all of the uber mobs always does.<br>
<br>
To think its 'bad' or 'good' is just silly. These calendars were started pre-kunark (or at most a short ways into kunark) when there was a limited number of places for an uberguild to go. (five, to be exact).<br>
<br>
Now, for the 50+ set, there are: 5 planes, TOV, Veeshan's Peak, Trakanon, 4 Outdoor Kunark Dragons, the Hole, Kael, Skyshrine, Western Wastes, Chardok, Old Seb, Howling Stones (aka Charasis), Upstairs City of Mist, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that there is always a place to go and if you're good, you always go where you want.<br>
<br>
EVERY guild but one that has released the sleeper did it in reaction to another guild being close to Farming the Warders. Simple economics: You get your kicks from being able to do things first, you keep the ability to do things first by ALWAYS being first. By perma-killing the warders, you are slowing down your competitors. Any uberguild (but the one) that claims otherwise is either lying to you or themselves.<br>
<br>
No offense to the other hardcore RP'ers on this server... but this setting isn't worth a steam-pan full of warm stool as a RP setting. It is generic, trite, boring, and overdone. Getting bent about Gnomes, Halflings, Elves, etc having or not having RP reasons to do something is just delusional. This is NOT a creative setting, it is a generic setting... you can ASSUME a RP reason exists because the 'hard and fast' rules are illogical, unrealistic, and are flags of disbelief of themselves.<br>
<br>
If you want an RP setting, ditch some of the wierd races and deal instead with some real motives and real stories. Cheezy gods and bizarre religions do not a good setting make. <p>Nakath<BR>

I also think the hole &quot;screw it, my Troll was raised by good elves,thus loves good - now sow my ass&quot; is fairly lame too.

Goods motives for killing the Dragon could be ridding the world of a Beast capable of great evil, Evils motives could be spitting in the face of Dragonkind along with intense greed and hope of getting their grubby paws on the creatures Treasure.<br>

Unless either Guild was a Guild of PROVEN outcasts, ((I'm not saying this is like some regulation, but how Shintou would accept a neutral outcast is for him to Slay his brother, Becomming KoS in his Home City)) then I just do not buy it.

<br>
FV is a Roleplay server, so this should be reflected in the way that we handle these things.  It would seem to me that, generally, Evils would cooperate and Goods would cooperate but that we might fight for contested spawns.  Therefore, the following structure:<br>
<br>
Good/Evil rotation.  With a twist...<br>
<br>
If evils wanted to jump ahead on a spawn claimed by goods, then they could.  All they gotta do is win a guildwar.  Same if the goods want to jump ahead on an evil's spawn.  Just win the guildwar, and the spawn is yours.<br>
<br>
Now, this does mean that one group would be able to dominate spawns that they're interested in, but only if the opposition couldn't find support from the other like-minded guilds.<br>
<br>
Of course, this would also mean that we'd have to have a system in place where, once all guilds on the server had agreed to a set of base rules, any guild that declared FFA would be blacklisted.  No res, no port, no group for members.  Harsh, but if you're gonna associate with Attilla the Hun, and you're gonna wear the 'Attilla's Huns' tag on your shirt, don't be suprised if the Roman's attack you on sight without getting to know you first.<br>

FV is a long way from having raids that are so well oiled that someone might do an FFA and &quot;snipe&quot; your planned raid.  Also, what if it's your turn to kill something and you leave it up for days?  &quot;Turns&quot; should definitely have a small window, a day at most.  What if a guild doesn't like to do wars?  Why would a guild risk loosing their slot when they have their shot all set and the people scheduled to show up on the proper day and time?<br>
<br>
This is a very young server.  Organizing a raid is not going to be like snapping your fingers and yelling &quot;Trakanon Now!&quot;  It's going to be a huge effort for many and risking that effort on a war is a pretty big risk.<br>
<br>
BTW, as a neutral monk, I will cheerfully help out both sides on anything that needs a monk.  I will be especially happy to help the winning side.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/22/02 10:39:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is this the future of FV?</span><hr size=1> How is it easy to gain Neriak faction (that is, without killing other factions)?

If Lokar is green and not agro and you can sneak, it takes about 20 minutes and 20p to go from scowly to dubious with the guards and to push you up to ally with the merchants.  If you have religion or are one of the races hated by Teir'dal or both, it can take a lot more cash.  If you can't sneak, it will take a partner that can invis you or a friend that can charm.  I think the hardest class would be a high-elf paladin.  Race hatred, religion hatred, class hatred all piled on top of born with low inky faction.<br>

If you hit a wall with the faction up for the quest, I've heard you can die to a MOB with the proper faction and then go back to raising it some more.

Once you've got your faction up good and high, kill him and take his head to his sister.  She'll give you a book for it.  Take the book to the oracle in OOT and get a torch in return. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>

You have slain Lokar Tobiath!<br>
This fight was trivial for you or your party!<br>

I was 21 (I think), when I killed him.  Lokar is 9 or so.  BTW, I used a pair of those torches on my monk for hard/long pulls until I got a rainbow hued shield.  Hard to beat a free 10 ac and the extra 10 charisma is nice for vendors and final 20 skill ups -- torch is 5 ac/chr 0.5 wt all/all primary/secondary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 1:14:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bjond sobs over the TLC ..</span><hr size=1> Back to the subject at hand, I doubte we'll ever become like the other servers... for one thing, we'd need to disband most of the guilds to form big enough ones to match other servers.<br>
<br>
Also, good and evil are separately working on big alliances so that they are able to fight bigger mobs.  There is some thread in the RP forum for an alliance of 5-6 evil guilds and the some good guilds are working on an alliance of 6-8 guilds which isn't discussed here.  <br>
<br>
As the server is small, we'll only have a few guilds ever able to kill the bigger mobs by themselves, some guilds will band together to do it, and most guilds will never abide to anything as they will be small and stay small but they will still have as much fun as everyone else.<br>
<br>
Do we need a rotation?  No, because if you ask me, we don't have enough people to go and kill the 'uber' mobs in the first place.  It might totally s*ck that the server has a small population, but at least it does fix certain issues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 2:20:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=259.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is this the future of FV?</span><hr size=1> Fen have you checked out the FandF member list or the Resolution list?<br>
<br>
They have quite a few folks.  They are getting up there in levels.  They are going to be rocking the house soon.  There will be very little they cant do, well that your normal upper 50+ guild do on other servers.<br>
<br>
Dont get frustrated.  Hang in there.  Keep meeting people and grouping.  Youll see things will happen.  <br>
