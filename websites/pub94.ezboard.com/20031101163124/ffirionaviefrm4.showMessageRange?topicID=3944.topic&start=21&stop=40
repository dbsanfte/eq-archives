My main character doesn't duel.  I can't really explain why he doesn't, but he doesn't. I think it has to do with the only duel he has ever participated in.<br>
<br>
 He has only dueled once and that was against his best friend Mixxi Bixiebane, who was being swayed to serve Zek.  He dueled her to defend the guards of the Vale whom she had come to see as weak.  When she killed him and saw his blood spilling on the ground, she realized how misguided she had been.  She was punished by the leaders of the Vale, sworn to protect Tuppen, and forced to disarm whenever she entered the Vale from that moment onward.<br>
<br>
For some reason, the thought of dueling with Tuppen (my character) makes me feel as if it would diminish the most significant (and one of the best RP moment) event  with one of his (and my) friends in EQ.  Mixxi's player is gone from EQ now while Mixxi the character is retired.  Preserving Tuppen's only dueling experience by NOT dueling somehow honor's that memory for me, the player, and for Tuppen the character.<br>
<br>
That being said, I love to duel with my secondary character, Ceniwen.  Ceniwen has won about half of the battles she has engaged in and has had some incredible dueling experiences.  As a player, I always find it exhilarating when engaged in a duel...it gets the adrenaline flowing.<br>
<br>
The other day, in Neriak, as Tuppen was aiding one of his favorite paladins in killing tier'dal guards he was taunted and he responded in kind.  When I was approached about a possible duel during /tells, I explianed Tuppen's refusal to duel.  I was quite grateful that the challenger understood the situation.  I feel that I made a RP contact with the folks I chatted with via /tells, while verbally sparing with them in /say.<br>
<br>
Sometimes people have good reasons (and sometimes RP reasons) for refusing to duel.  Please don't sell them short just because they refuse to do so.<br>
<br>
BTW, I did offer to wake up Ceniwen for the challenge despite the fact that the challenger would have been red to her.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We decided against doing that though. /sigh. <p><img src=http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/sig.gif>

Her second blow was a thrust, perfectly placed, entering that sweet doorway of bone below the arm and traversing his chest to his heart. <br>

He had dropped to his knees, dead already but not knowing it yet. And then, at last, she had looked in his eyes and seen only his concern for his home and his friend.

If I did it was probably because it was in the Plane of Knowledge where you can't fight even if you tried.  I've dueled people 20 levels or higher above me and gotten my butt handed to me.  I've also dueled people who were red to me and beat them too.  Even a red con epic'd mage, who I would have beat twice if it weren't for listening to the advice of a non-enchanter on being able to charm a pet.<br>
<br>
I've also sparred against 3 people at once, 2 of which were even and yellow to me.  And I won, although a 4th person who was 10 levels higher than me gravity fluxed me up and out of the bazaar arena before I could finish off the 3rd person.<br>
<br>
I think some of my favorite dueling experiences have been watching my guild leader and Kazanti go at it.  They're the most entertaining for single one on one duels.  But we've also met battle in the Rathe arena in full force a few times.  It was spectacular.  About 50 people total in one battle, what with all their SK and Necro pets.  We lost in the end, but not after putting up a good fight being very outleveled for the most part.  And silly me I looted my whole corpse before checking and seeing that pain and suffering had killed me and I lost XP.<br>
<br>
Dueling is one of the most fun aspects to role playing.  If you find good roleplayers you'll find people willing to duel.  It's only people who are concerned with their XP bars and not their character who will run from duels.  Besides of course cases like Tuppen's but then he would most likely RP his excuse rather than shouting insults and running, or worse yet, training guards. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/blinkun_copy1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

It's a role play thing. I'm a monk. I play my character as a very centered, balanced person who doesn't need to defend his honor. The simple act of defending it that way would tarnish it greater than any insult you could give.<br>
<br>
An odd note to this, the arena in the bazaar is one of my favorite hangouts. I very rarely get attacked there though (unless Uliamarath is around, hehehe). But, if someone does attack me in the arena, I generally die, because I don't run out of the arena.  I'll stand there a while, then I might run all around the arena, but I won't leave it just because someone is attacking. (I have killed a green con who started swinging on me, but it was repostes.) I will try to Instill Doubt in someone who attacks me.<br>
<br>
That said, I will duel anyone from LfB. I love the concept for that guild, and died to Gore and several others numerous times. (one time a bunch of us teamed up and actually managed to kill him. I think it was about 14 to 1, and it was still a very near thing.) Unfortunately, I haven't known anyone in that guild for ages, and have had no interaction with them since shortly after Gore left. ( That plus it seemed everyone in LfB I saw after that was green to me, and I'm not going to walk up to some green con I don't know and challenge him to a duel just because he's in a guild that requires him to accept.)<br>
<br>
So, if you're not in LfB and challenge me to a duel, don't be surprised when I either refuse or ignore the challenge. I'll likely talk to you and find out why it is you want to duel me, and if you can convince me of a good reason to duel I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> accept. I doubt you'll come up with a good enough reason though. I know I've frustrated Shintou this way before. (plus a mutual friend was there telling him to play nice, even more frustrating for him)<br>

Ven has been under lock and key by a Dark Elf Shadow Knight. Day before he told her to go to the arena. She did as told, and went. There he made her fight his mate. She ran from her the first time when the Rogue was almost dead. She wanted another go so the two ladies went again. She started to run at the end... but this time Ven was quicker and expected her to run. The Rogue died. As taught by her Master, Ven then went and collected a vial of the Rogue's blood. <br>
<br>
After a bit, confident he would win, the Shadow Knight told Ven she would duel him for the blood. Months back Ven dueled her master in practice and he took her blood easily slaying her. He now offered it back to her in exchange for his mates blood. If he won, He would be returned her blood and still keep Ven's. And if Ven won... Well, she would get another vial of blood. Ven said no, knowing she couldn't kill him. Immediately her loyalty was questioned.. so reluctantly she agreed. After a couple of shaky starts they finally began to engage. Ven won. She collected her prize. <br>
<br>
He demanded the blood back, said it was stolen. When Ven explained why she felt it was hers, he in short disowned her... cast her off..<br>
<br>
and ooc... put me on ignore, because he says I played out of character. It makes me sad that he would do something like that because I played Ven totally in character the whole way through it. Instead of rping with me more to get the blood back... I'm on ignore now.. oh well, his loss as I see it. I just don't get it though.<br>
<br>
And to the quote I made at the beginning of this post.. I whole heartily agree. This duel meant allot to me. I expected to die, but I won, against someone I thought was unbeatable by myself.<br>
<br>
Well fought unnamed SK...<br>
<br>
Ven<br>

<br>
Some of my favourites... Notuanot... we found that if we dueled drunk I could actually get him down to 86% before he killed me *beams*  I believe however his alcohol tolerance has since increased.<br>
<br>
Shintou is a favourite.  *reminds herself to bind closer hehe<br>
<br>
Demaste taught me the ways of wizards and how a bard could defeat them. I will always be grateful *grins evilly*<br>
<br>
Finarfrin taught me the ways of druids and why they will wipe the floor with you *speculates a moment... humm.. Fin, you and Shintou should duel sometime...<br>
<br>
Dreyk showed me what a master can do in the arena. (would love to sic Dreyk on Shintou ... or just watch them fight some day...<br>
<br>
And of course Leerick taught me about dueling other  bards and Ledbane helped me better appreciate short powerful clerics. <br>
<br>
And I cannot forget Raires or Willayen, or other members of the fight club as we talk on dueling !<br>
<br>
For me a duel is best as part of a storyline, it does not have to be long and elaborate but to me without the rp there is no point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And I apologize in advance if my dots kill you. I am a bard, I use what weapons I can... if you cant take that a death might mean exp loss... do not fight me.  To me there should be some consequence to dying. <p><img border=0 src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/meledi-sig.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuppenfv>Tuppen FV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 4:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3944.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Mycen!<br>

I enjoyed the verbal exchanges and had hoped to see Alarielle take on a few challengers, but unfortunately, she went LD and that pretty much ended the evening.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think it is important to interact a little bit OOC before and after the duel...to make sure both parties know what is happening and what the reason for the duel is.  When someone is decent in an OOC manner, getting your butt kicked is no big deal *chuckles*<br>
<br>
I have lost many duels, won a few...killed those I have lost to after my dead body hits the ground.  And some of my better EQ friends are people I have dueled.<br>
<br>
I do not usually give the challenge when I duel as I am not out looking for a fight...but I respect anyone's right to not duel.  Just don't start the names and trash talk without being willing to at least RP some vengeance play.<br>

This game isn't really balanced in duels... I don't fight when it won't be a challenge for me, or when I know I can't win.  Let's face it, it's not fun when you know as a rogue you're going to be slowed, DoTed, and then DSed to death and they can go afk if they want, you still won't win.<br>
<br>
But any duel that's a challenge, I'm up for.<br>

Like the first post in this topic is the reason i left this place... Exiled banished whatever... People just can't handle someone with eagerness to fight... I heard of shin and hes the only one I halfway respect even though he called me lame ass names. Theres Bloodlust they were cool. But the rest of the population I faced is a bunch of panzys. Only bits of PvP action I could find besides the ones I mentioned was Ogarth, Orsen, Endalmir and that human monk in the bazaar arena. <br>
