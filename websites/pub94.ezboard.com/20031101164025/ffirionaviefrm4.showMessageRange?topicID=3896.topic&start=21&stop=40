<br>
Went something like this:<br>
&quot;So you think your a bad ass huh? (get right up close to them) You feel the need to impress your friends by beating on somebody smaller than you , Huh? (Get closer) &quot;Okay then, come on let's show just how bad you are&quot;<br>
<br>
And you get your ass beat.<br>
<br>
After a couple of times they start avoiding you. In a matter of fact I had a few of them turning around and taking off when they see me by shouting &quot;There you are, come on we got unfinished business!&quot;<br>
<br>
Worked for me, and the scars and lumps go away after a few years.<br>

<br>
There's no easy answers in this, and the reason is, different people react differently. Some people, if you ignore them and their bullying react by torturing you further, because you suffer in silence -- they get off on making you feel bad, and they know they are doing it, and don't care if you react. On the other hand, if you react, there are some bullies who like this response and the attention they get, and it will just perpetuate. You'll have to make your decision based on experience and knowledge of those involved.<br>
<br>
But I will say you're not the only one who was ever tortured by fellow school-mates, physically and mentally. My high-school bussing experience was the most tramatic experience I had of the day for the most part. It made getting up and going to school every day the most dreaded experience in my life. I was already having problems at home -- and I was severely depressed. To have fellow bus-riders attack me, call me names, belittle and berate me throughout the 45 minutes it took to get to school in the morning and home in the afternoon was just too much. It was horrible, demorializing and has helped to make me the insecure person I am today. I'm not entirely sure what I did, or what I said or how I behaved that made people do this to me. There was just a little group of them all that seemed to get off on walking on me. Only one thing tempered it a little bit -- my friendship with one of the buss riders named Brett. They all liked him, and one day he had to sit with me -- and found out we had a lot in common. (No he'd never taken part in the harassment either). So when he sat with me, they'd pretty much leave me alone -- and after a while it seems he sat with or by me every day -- so I think he realized that his presence had a halting effect on the situation. This was junior year and sophomore years of highschool. <br>
<br>
Senior year, he had graduated the year before <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . So unfortunately he was no longer there -- and we had a new crop of buttheads who decided they'd take part and join in on the fun. However, my sister -- who was a freshman that year took heavy umbrage at my being attacked and felt it reflected on her. We eventually had to petition for a bus-change and wound up walking an extra 5 minutes to another corner to take a different bus to school. Things got better after that. But that wasn't the end of it -- these people were still at school with me, and one of the fellows who rode the bus also worked with me after school and carried it on there -- don't know why we never got fired <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
All I can say is hold your chin up and keep telling yourself it doesnt' matter and don't believe anything they say. Or: Make a joke out of it. <br>

It's a curious reversal of power because you're giving permission to be hit while at the same time pointing out that when they do hit you, they're weaker and engaging in cowardly actions.<br>
<br>
The only sad part, as I said, is that cowards often aren't too bright and take a while to get the message... which can hurt in the meantime.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ignore them...&quot;  I say no, unless you're one of the rare people who can really just shut it off and not care.  For everybody else, you're not ignoring the assaults, you're absorbing and being harmed by them without protecting or responding.  <br>
<br>
If you were practicing this approach in a martial arts class (aikido is my personal love because it teaches strength, awareness and RESPONSES to violence, not tricks for how to break arms), you'd stand there looking away while your partner punched you over and over.  You'd get hurt.  Badly hurt, if your partner didn't like you.  And in the end, it would only end because your attacker walked away, leaving you an injured victim and leaving you open for tomorrow's practice session.<br>
<br>
I think that what I do to handle this kind of thing isn't going to work well for you.  Why not?  Two reasons.<br>
<br>
First, because I'm 40 (in two months) and I just don't give a rip about a lot of things that you still do.  When I was 14???  I was a freaked-out, pathetic nerd.  Now, I'm just a pathetic nerd and a whole lot of stuff just doesn't matter anymore.  Funny looking?  Inconvenient?  Old?  Hell, yes, I am... what, am I supposed to disagree with the ridiculously obvious???  What I can't change, I just accept nowadays.<br>
<br>
The other reason is that for whatever reason, folks just do not mess with me in person.  It's partly appearance (I'm not real tall but I'm fairly... &quot;thick&quot;, sorta brick-shaped), and partly... I have no idea.  I'm amazingly unviolent and unthreatening in spirit, but people just leave me alone.<br>
<br>
But there are a couple of things to think about anyway...<br>
<br>
1.  Accept and understand what they are doing.  If they bitch at you, stand up and bow.  Or, cry happily, &quot;YES!!!  I ALONE CONTROL THE BUSES NOW.  YOU ARE AT MY MERCY.&quot;  Do make fun of it because it's a stupid assault.  You have every right to be on the bus, and it's not because of you that the buses are late.  They're late because they leave too late to do all the things they need to do.  If you must react, react with humor rather than defensive resentment.  <br>
<br>
Will they like you?  Hell no, they'll think you're a freak.  But you know what?  They already think that or they wouldn't be casing on you.  If you react with visible humor, there IS somebody out there who will eventually see that and become your friend for it... just not one of the fools who's picking on you.  If you react with a victimized silence, you'll miss an opportunity to find an ally in your life.<br>
<br>
2.  Learn by practicing #1 to use humor to repair your soul.  While you acknowledge the attacks, you can feel yourself be strong in their face, and that feels good.  Personal strength and cleverness build on themselves.<br>
<br>
3.  Go find an aikido dojo that has teen classes.  You're plenty old enough to go to class, do the motions, learn to fall, learn to throw others, and suddenly realize that all that physical work is teaching you how to handle verbal attacks and threats just as much as the physical ones.<br>
<br>
If you learn to be strong in the center of your body, you will eventually learn to create a strong center in your soul.  And when that happens, the taunts will become wind and rain on the roof rather than something that threatens your safety.<br>

I should know…I have one of my own. But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>seriously</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Magiith, don’t listen to those peeps telling you to “ignore” the situation.

Someone I knew when young was bullied. When he had been pushed once too often, he grabbed the bully and tried to throw them *both* off a third floor balcony. Extrieme, but it worked for him. He was small, a book worm and so an obvious target, but he never got bullied again after.<br>
<br>
But what ever you do, you *have* to mean it, so start by convinicing yourself.<br>
<br>
I know some say us 'older' folk may give advice that's not suited for 'youngsters', but many of us are looking back at the mistakes we made and trying to help you avoid those mistakes. In the end, it's your battle. You need to decide where to draw the line.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if it's too hot to walk now, then maybe make a point of walking when it's cooler? Asthma is nasty, but walking can help some people reduce it's affects. Again, I know Asthma sufferers who walk and cycle and have found it helps them a lot.

I honestly am not so far ahead of you that I don't remember how it was, and to see that you will find more of it at the end of the tunnel.  Those bullies that learn to intimidate in highschool will grow up to be intimidators in everything they do.  I meet them all the time in each job I have worked.  You will meet the same people throughout your life, but they will change their names and faces.  If you find a way that works for you now, you will use it later in life.  <br>
My way is to be friendly--if someone thinks I am a pushover they will think twice before I am through with them, but it's because my resources are my allies.  It's kinda hard to single a person out in a crowd.  Make friends with people.  I was very cynical when I came into High school, my middle school friends didn't all mesh well with me.<br>
Then there was this girl that was always saying comments like:  I love your hair or that is such a great shirt.<br>
Because of my previous friends I mistook her attitude to be sarcasm.  She was sincere.  Well as soon as I saw that I totally changed my attitude toward her.  She talked and dressed different and never got teased because she gave out <br>
&quot;honey&quot; instead of &quot;vinegar.&quot;  Instead she got friends in return for her admiring compliments.<br>
Sure you could beat people up, but I had friends that were like that and they didn't finish school, they didn't even make it to High school with me.  So I would go for making friends with people who deserve your company.  It it is nice to have some sympathy on your peer level.<br>

<br>
<br>
You can skip this entirely to long example and see my &quot;Overall advice:&quot; at the end if you want...<br>
<br>
<br>
Meet 'John'.  See, I lived in Georgia but moved to Pennsylvania during my 10th grade year.  The old, historical town I live in now has serious issues, esepcially with people that didn't grow up here.  So when show up in mid september, I was talking to this nice redhead girl (we're good friends now) and some fucking football player throws me up against the lockers tells me something like &quot;and stay the fuck away from her&quot;.  I kinda sat there for a second, the laughing subsided, the crowd dissipated, I picked up that fucking thick ap european history book, thought about slamming it in his face.  thought better of it.    <br>
<br>
So now the guy recognizes me and harrases me on a daily basis.  I take a long way between third and fourth mod to avoid him, he eventually finds me and harassment continues. <br>
<br>
December.  I worked at the ski resort (popularity points, good bonuses too) and tried out ski blading, the short death-wish skis.  They were a blast, I love anything that gives me adrenaline, and I wasn't half bad.  I buy my own pair and join the ski club.  Well, the winter wasn't to bad during december '02, but it still iced up pretty bad after a night of sleet, and the entire surface of freakin central PA was a sheet of ice.  (yes, they still ran school buses), I step off the bus in the morning, I've got my backpack on one shoulder and my heavy duffel-style bag with my ski blades, boots, and ski pants on the other shoulder.  Now I'm not exactly Mr. Coordinated, so I'm guessing you can vision what happens next.  Most people are standing around outside, in the snow and light sleet, like always, because the school won't open it's doors until 7:00, I go to step off bus and..<br>
<br>
my chin hit the frozen curb with such velocity that I chipped two teeth, split my bottom lip, and had a pretty deep cut in my chin.  There was blood everywhere pretty instantly.  Well, &quot;john&quot; was right there to witness it all, he pointed, said it was gnarly at first, but then started his usually bullying routine.  All the blood rushing to my face, I was beet red, and my eyes started to tear up, not from pain but from a combo of embarassment and adrenaline.  Well, I opened my ski bag and took the towel out that I wrapped around my ski's after every use, to keep them from rusting and just keep them nice (they're friggin expensive!), I was holding the towel to my face, left my bookbag and threw my duffel bag over my shoulder, tried to walk around him and his croonies but they moved into my way.  it was obivious they didn't intend for me to get to the front of the school, so I suddenly had quite an enlightenment.  The edges of the skis are really sharp, for carving turns on the slopes, so what'd I do?  Well, acted like I was putting the towel away in the bag, with my back turned to him, pulled a ski from my bag, swung around and hit him square in the face with the thing.  His buddies beat the shit out of me, but he had a &quot;gnarly&quot; scab and later light scar for the whole year.  He had to get 14 stitches, the ski lashed from his right ear to his mouth corner.  <br>
So his buddies beat me up pretty bad that day, but he never came close to me the rest of the year, and even now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall advice:  Some day your adrenal will get so overloaded you'll go off like a bomb and get a good lick or two in on the jerk, and he'll probably leave you alone.  Some people like you and me just don't have it in them to go after some guy without the aid of adrenaline.  What can I say?  I'm an adrenal junkie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azindar>azindar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/azindar/sign.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/03 1:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3896.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/azindar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: You aren't going to like this suggestion....</span><hr size=1> I wrote a story about my school days and then it stroke me that although how nice it felt to remember it (NOT) it really doesn't matter in your case ... <br>

How you can get out of this? <br>
<br>
First please realize you don't' need their respect, kids with load mouths are usually cowards, their bark is much harder than their bite. <br>
<br>
If you can physically get into a fight and not go to jail or hospital (CONTROL YOUR ANGER), then go a head, it is a fun experience.<br>

Just walk. Asthma is bad but you can help yourself immensly if you dont take the easy route.. go exercise, aka walk.<br>
<br>
I had to use a bike to get to school, and I lived on a hill.   Down to school in the winter I FROZE to the handlebars.  Going back up in the summer I sweat up a river.  But... I could benchpress a huge amount that year, surprised the heck out of the coach... <br>

One, dont fight black people unless they are alone.  Two, dont fight retards unless they cant walk.  The former is because they fight with pack mentality and the latter because the mentally retarded are usually blessed with ungodly strength, no knowledge of pain, and the inability to know when to stop.<br>
<br>
If you are going to get in a fight, go berserk like a kid with &quot;special&quot; needs, which you say you are.  You dont have to take them all on.  Just consentrate all your blows on the ringleader, or one of the weaker higher echelons.  Beat and scare the living shit out of him and the rest will fall in line.<br>
<br>
I know that your first response is to be a pussy and not want to get suspended or whatnot, but trust me... I have one regret from High School.  That single regret is that I never got into a good all out brawl for fear of academic reprisal.  Besides that, everyone knows the shit nerds go through on the busses and they are not going to hold near as much against you as they will the bullies.<br>
<br>
btw, it wont end and wont go away until you assert dominance and make them fear you.  Violence is the only answer and I challenge anyone to question that.  I am sorry to say that your peers are at an extremely primal mentality.  It will only take one time.  So just man up and get it over with.  <br>
<br>
But I realize that if you havent done it already and continue trying to handle it in a non-violent way (asking for advice on the Internet) then you probably wont go through with what is neccesary.   <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/ermoksig1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 781<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/03 10:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3896.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  You know....</span><hr size=1> This thread is like some kind of social experiment in finding out what kinds of advise adults really have to give to teenagers, so long as they have the advantage of anonimity, no need to take responsibility for the consequences once the advise is given, and it's somebody else's kid....<br>

&lt;groan&gt; *shh* I never said that!<br>
I can look back and see what worked for me and what didnt.<br>
<br>
I was always the kid who got picked on and bullied-- I didnt go to the same school with the same kids every year, I attended at least 12 diferent schools from K through 9th. (we moved alot), I cant tell you how often I was given the &quot;ignore them&quot; advice and tried to put that into practice.<br>
I tried- I realy realy tried.<br>
<br>
 it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> worked for me, not once, not with a single person. not ever.<br>
<br>
<br>
when I got fed up, when I got pissed off and beat the living shit out of people who pushed me too far--- that worked.<br>
<br>
I learned that my self esteme and self respect and my value as a person is very obvious to others by the ammount of Sh!t I will take  or will not take.<br>
<br>
For me it was worth every black eye, fat lip, bump, bruise, and scar. <br>
<br>
Now sadly my son, who is 8 now has been having the same type of problems (is this like a genetic &quot;kick me sign?&quot;)  and I have tried to advise non violent ways for him to deal with these children, but for the past 3 years non violent solutions have not worked---<br>
<br>
so last week I gave him my permition to kick some ass if nessasary. <br>
I also told him to remember to duck face shots- those hurt, dad just said &quot;dont get kicked in the nuts&quot; lol<br>
