Religion, sex, everything. Language is no exception. How many people use the word &quot;gyped&quot; when they feel ripped off? This is accepted slang in almost any enviroment but not to long ago (and perhaps even today) some folks would have found it really offensive. Same with &quot;jewed&quot; which is now included in most dictionaries to mean pretty much the same as gyped. This one is a little more recent, but thats the point I am trying to make.<br><br>The english language evolves constantly. It evolves much more quickly nowadays because of the access to different forms of media. This doesnt stop people from trying to slow its evolution. I think we will always practice some form of censorship because we feel there is some part of the population that needs protection from what we feel is unacceptable. /shrug. Go figure.<br><br>Gay, nigger, chink, jew, nazi and the many other slurs will not be immune to these evolutionary changes. So trying to &quot;protect&quot; people from the use of these words is ultimately futile. What is more important to me, is understanding how someone is using the word...  what context, what tone, etc. The negative use of these words is what we should watching for and protecting people from not the word itself. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A> at: 3/26/02 2:32:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubormwarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Borm Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/26/02 2:43:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Evolution of language</span><hr size=1> I completely agree and to take it a step further, how can anyone allow an anonymous poster on a meaningless chatboard to cause you real damage through the use of one of these words. I submit, and this is only my opinion, that one cannot actually be hurt by the use of these words - only offended. To be hurt requires some sort of emotional attachment. If your friend, neighbor, parent, etc calls you a name then you can actually be hurt. It is not the name, but the actions of the person that causes the hurt. You cannot have an emotional attachment when no real interpersonal communication takes place. <br><br>Now, if you are offended by some language used, then do not come here.

Equal rights for women and minorities are just one example of exactly what I mean.  In the past, they were non-existent, because society said so.  However, does that mean that the oppression was ok, because it was socially acceptable?  I would say no, and if society for some reason decided once again women shouldn't have equal rights, it would still be equally wrong regardless of what society says.  If not, then we have no right to say other countries are wrong for suppressing religious-freedom, free-speech, sexual, gender, racial, or other rights.  It's clearly what that society says is ok, so we should just butt out and let them do whatever they want.<br><br>&quot;All it takes for evil to triumph, is a good man to do nothing.&quot;<br><br>A more extreme example, multiple societies in the past have tried to justify the killing of innocents, and this continues today.  Because it's acceptable in the society, does that make it right?  Were the Inquisitor's right in torturing and killing &quot;heretics&quot; because society at the time ok'd it?  Nazi Germany killing the Jews?  The murder of a million armenians?  The ongoing massacre in Sudan?  It does not matter if the society tried/tries to deem them acceptable for whatever reason, the killing of innocents is not now, and has never been, right.  <br><br>Oppression is never right, regardless of society's view.  Killing of innocents is never right, regardless of society's view.

Homosexuals who may have been beaten and abused for their lifestyles.  Jews who's own grandparents may have been killed under conditions that don't bear repeating for their religious beliefs.  Blacks who may have suffered systematic discrimation all their lives for the color of their skin.  The list goes on.<br><br>Obviously, you feel rational about this.  Good for you.  For the most part I am a rational person also and on the basis of cold logic I can agree with you.  But in this case I think the rational person has a humane obligation to bow out to the irrational.  Even though you should obviously be excused if you ever hurt someone unintentionally, that does not spare you the obligation to avoid hurting them if it is reasonably within your power to do so.  And if that means avoiding a term or two than so be it.<br><br>And telling anyone who can't deal with it to go somewhere else is clearly stepping beyond a rational approach to this.  That's like smokers saying anyone who can't deal with their secondhand smoke should never go anywhere public.  A reasonable society can take reasonable steps to make everyone reasonably comfortable in a public space, even a virtual public space, like this board.  If you don't feel like making concessions well, I can't make you.  But don't expect me to thank you for it, and don't expect me to respect you for it.

I know where I stand, and I'm not going to let your petty, whining, 'poor me' trash talk dictate the way I speak. <br><br>Do the world a favor and stop asking for preferential treatment. Exclaim to the world that race, sex, sexual preference, religion, etc DO NOT MATTER...instead of acknowledging the things that make us different, because the obvious is pretty stupid and boring to talk about.<br><br>Can't you tell it like it is from a non-gay, non-black, non-jewish, non-christian, 'sexless' being's standpoint? Is that really so beyond you? <br><br>I see some of you pride yourselves on being intellectual.

Disagree with me three posts in a row without response if it makes you feel your position is stronger.<br><br>Every generation grows into this world feeling shut out by an establishment they can't fit into and therefore feel marginalized by.  And every generation walks around saying &quot;Well, fuck them.

I'm 26 years old.  But in a virtual community I think that leaves me older than the curve, certainly older that the average internet gamer.  Not that there aren't exceptions, I know.  Retirees who play EQ are great!<br><br>I won't argue with you Heagan, because I know nothing I say is going to have an impact on you personally.  But I will continue to state my beliefs because I think it's important to expose people to them.  Especially younger people on the internet.  Especially in an age where people may get more social contact on-line rather than in person.  Especially if they play EQ and rarely see the sun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>It is okay to respect other people.  Even if that means curbing your behaviour sometimes.  You don't need to understand or agree with whatever makes them uncomfortable.  How is it your right to judge the validity of their feelings?  Measure the sacrifice required of you against the good it will do them.  If avoiding a single word can make someone else feel worlds more comfortable, why shouldn't you?<br><br>It is okay to respect the common practises of society.  Not everything that's come before is wrong or stupid just because people are trying to enforce rules.  You may find if those rules went away you'd be the first to reestablish them, or similar ones.  It's the fact that they are enforced that most people dislike, not the rules themselves.  Surfers who can't deal with even the existance of moderation on a chat board...how do you people function in society?  If you acted like this in RL you'd run over the first crossing guard you saw holding his sign up in front of a line of first graders.<br><br>And yes Heagan, it is okay to be intellectual.  It is okay to discuss something in words of more than one syllable.  It is okay to settle disputes by sharing opinions freely and without mockery, rathar that settling arguments by seeing who can shout down the other person first and call them &quot;ghay&quot; the most times.  It is okay to listen to reason and modify your own views based on a compelling argument.  It is okay to admit you might be wrong rather than resorting to less and less coherant flames.<br><br>No one will believe me now, if you don't already, but sooner or later most will grow into these views.  Because mankind is a social animal and we have ways of making society work.  Now, flame away, if that's the way you want to go on interacting with the world around you.

Nor is “but he started it”.<br><br>No one is saying that such-and-such derogatory remark is permissible while this-and-that remark is not.  They are saying that knowingly using any term that is widely considered hurtful to a fairly large number of people should be discouraged – the identity of the group doesn’t matter.<br><br>And honestly, pointing to the people who are saying “please stop” and accusing them of being pitiable shrinking violets who can’t take the world as it stands is just being insulting.  If you don’t like something, you can remain quiet and take it, or stand up and do something about it.  Personally, I will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> respect the ‘whiner’ over the sheep who just take it, regardless of what I think of their cause.<br><br>Back to the original point of language evolving: it does indeed change, and it can be steered in the direction you want it to go.  In the last couple decades, many ethnic slurs have been more-or-less stripped out of common usage.  It was not long ago that calling someone a “Mick” or a “Wop” was simply accepted in casual, non-derogatory speech.  Today it is not, and we are none the poorer for it.<br><br>Finally, for the record, I couldn’t care less whether <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> others</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> use the terms being discussed here; I am only really concerned with how my kids and I speak.  In my aloof, haughty, “intellectual” way, I am simply enjoying the arguments people are putting forth in defense of keeping targeted slurs in the vernacular.<br> <p>----------------------------<br>-Henk<br>Grumpy Cleric of Brell<br></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=481.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=481.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=481.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=481.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=481.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=481.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
