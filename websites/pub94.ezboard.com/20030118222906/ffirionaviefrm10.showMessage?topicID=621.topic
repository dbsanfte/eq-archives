This is the story of the beginning of his &quot;redemption&quot;. It is quite long, so hey, good luck if you actually try to make it through.))<br>
<br>
<br>
Talastius sat in dim morning twilight, looking out over the expanse of the Overthere, which had long since been his post, as it had been his father's. The fingers of daylight were creeping over the land, and aided by his infravision he could see them out there, all the things he had so easily hunted for as much sport and pleasure, as any sense of duty. He was confused, and hurt, and angry, and he couldn't grasp or understand why. It wasn't like him, it wasn't who he was. <br>
<br>
Angling his eyes up at the sky he saw the gathering clouds in the distance and found him self speaking aloud to no one, &quot;There is a storm coming.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pixxii was gone, but the confusion and chaos, the feelings he could not fully explain lingered. Only one other had ever made him feel in such a way, but that was another he had lost; and even then there had never been acknowledgement of anything on either parties part. But Pixxii, she had adored him and if such a thing exists, loved him openly and freely. Despite the prejudice and hatred drilled into him from his birth, the conditioning of his education as a knight of hatred, even his own malicious plans, he could not help but admit she had gotten to him, made him feel this way. <br>
<br>
He had come here, to his post, to hunt in peace and contemplate his future. She was gone, running to the safety of the dream realm, fearful of the coming darkness that would consume Talastius, knowing that it could not be stopped. He awoke that morning, and found himself alone. The one that had charmed him slipped forever away, and so he came here. Here he could hunt, here he could think, here he could be who he was. <br>
<br>
He wondered out, away from the safety of the oupost into the wilds. Little here was a threat to him anymore, the hunting being more sport than anything. It was in its own sense relaxing, a pleasant escape from the usual chaos of life. Soon he knew that he would have nothing left to learn here, his time serving in the outpost gone. But for now, he had his guilty pleasures terrorizing the local fauna.<br>
<br>
Lost in thought, Talastius never heard the stomping of the rhino. Out of nowhere it charged, slamming into the knight's back and tossing him to the side. Wincing in pain, Talastius rolled out of the way of the charging rhino and sprung to his feet, grabbing the mace hanging ready at his side. It was at that moment he first realized something was wrong.<br>
<br>
Pain shot through his arm, the Mace of the Shadowed Soul falling useless to the ground. Dodging another charge he cradled his arm a second and fumbled for another weapon. He was less skilled with the spear, but it would have to do. Deftly he planted the tip in the rhino's thick leathery side and smiled at his prey. Raising a hand he called on the dark magics to fill the beast with terror, but it would be Talastius that would panic. The energies would not form, the spell not take shape. Quickly he fumbled with the incantation of another, hoping to at least call darkness down on the beast. But the spell would not come, the magic gifts of his god had been revoked.<br>
<br>
The rhino thrashed, throwing Talastius to the ground, getting up again as quickly as he could he jerked his helmet off, that amongst the other bits of armor made for his order beginning to sting and burn the flesh underneath. As he stood there, contemplating his next move the rhino charged, its horn piercing through the armor as if it attacked a sheet of parchment. Talastius screamed in pain and threw out a fist, instincts driving him to deliver his harm touch. That it did not land held little surprise. Stumbling, Talastius grabbed his weapons and did the only thing the injured Tier Dal could do, he ran.<br>
<br>
In the Outpost General DeVeers and the others gathered around Talastius as he lie, bleeding and weak in one of the decrepid buildings. Some protested that Talastius had served well amongst them, balancing between his duties to his house, and his duties to his post. They said he should recieve attention, but the general would have none of it, instead ordering a captured Sarnak brought and chained, so the knight could tap its life force at his leisure. One by one they all left, save the general. When the two were alone he leaned over into the knight's face and whispered,<br>
&quot;I know everything.&quot;<br>
Spitting in Talastius's face, he straightened himself and went to leave the room, looking first at the paniced Sarnak and then sneering at the helpless knight on the ground.<br>
&quot;Drain it Talastius, if you can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shortly there after Talastius slipped into a tortured dream, the pain and blood loss draining his strength.<br>
<br>
He was alone, on a desolate grey plain while harsh winds whipped about him. Figures moved in and out of the edge of his vision, never coming into view. He could hear voices, but not understand the things they said. Hands groped at him, though from where he coul not tell. As he spun in confusion and fear he saw him, a blurr at first in the distance, seated on a strange dark throne. As Talastius focused, the throne moved closer, the figure becoming more and more defined in shape and form.<br>
<br>
Talastius dropped to a knee and bowed his head in humility. &quot;My liege,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Naught stood from the throne, his motion strange and fluid. He looked down at the Tier Dal before him and smiled. The expression was both comforting and unsettling in its nature. Naught spoke:<br>
<br>
&quot;Funny, dat whut knights say, and yoo no knight Tal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius rose slowly, looking up at the ogre. &quot;Yes, I am punished for my sins against my blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without moving his lips the ogre let loose a bellowing laugh that rattled the landscape and sent skeletal birds flying into a sky that was turning red and boiling like heated blood. Turning his gaze on Talastius he spoke without speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Tal, yoo not bein' punished. Yoo bein' tested. Yoo lost yooself, let yooself be tainted. Now the gods want to know what yoo gonna do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius looked down at the blood running down his side, pooling at his feet. As he looked into the pool, a purple mist bubbled up out of it, hovering and flowing all about. &quot;I'm going to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tentacle, emerged from the mist and wrapped itself around Talastius's leg, moving up his body, binding him and keeping him immobile. The warlord spoke again.<br>
<br>
&quot;So dat it den? Yoo jus gonna die. Yoo are weak now. She must have done a number on yoo bad. So is that what yoo want Tal, yoo wanna die? Or maybe yoo wanna go back, be wit her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius leveled his gaze at the ogre and snarled at him, &quot;What I want is to be what I am. She dug things up, made me feel in ways I was not meant. I will not lie and tell you that I don't care for her, that she didn't touch me. But along that path is not my place, not my world. She is happy now, and better off where she is. My life would have destroyed all that she is. I don't want to be with her ogre, because it would destroy her and leave us both worse for wear. She is gone, nothing now but a memory of a few moments of feeling and a dream of a part of me that was never meant to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ogre smiled, and spoke again, the tentacle tightening with every word.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what yoo want then Tal? To be what yoo are? And what is dat?&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius gasped for breath, the constriction making every word torture, &quot;A knight of shadows. A protector of the Tier Dal and a emissary of the Nightmare. I am hatred and anger, pain and torment. I want to serve again, to have purpose. To bring pride to my culture and to those I call brethren. I want to return to the Nightmare.&quot;<br>
<br>
The tentacle melted and faded away, dropping Talastius to the ground. He lay there, panting heavily as the ogre spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then yoos gonna hafta get up an go Tal. Yoos got a long road and not much time. Yoos passed this test, but others are gonna come. And yoo made a sin against yoo blood Tal, yoo will be punished, yoo may even be killed. But if that what yoo want, yoo gonna hafta do it. Yoo gonna hafta go willingly and take what they throw an yoo gonna hafta thank dem for it. They gonna break yoo in ebery way. Death would be more merciful. Fleeing to your lover easier. So yoo gonna do it? Yoo gonna go back or yoo gonna run? Last chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius struggled to his feet. &quot;I... I'm going to return to the Nightmare, accept my penance, become myself again.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sky began raining in huge droplets, screaming as the blobs crashed into the ground. The ogre began to fade away. Talastius reached out to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Naught....&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice spoke quietly from the ether around Talastius, &quot;No Tal, yoo on yoo own dis time. I don't know yoo. Maybe I know what yoo become, if yoo strong enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Talastius awoke from his fevered dream and sat up. Carefully he bandaged his side as best he could. He was already to weak to concentrate though, and the attempt made little difference overall. Staggering and weak, he got to his feet and gathered his things for his journey. <br>
<br>
As he moved slowly and painfully toward the doorway, his gaze settled on the Sarnak, still bound and huddled in a corner, awaiting its fate. Sneering, Talastius moved slowly toward it, stooping to pick a broken blade up off the ground. Smiling darkly he came up on the bound victim. Softly he said to it, &quot;Maybe I can't drain our essence, but that doesn't mean I'm harmless, by any means.&quot; The next morning Talastius was gone, and the guards found only the slaughtered body of the Sarnak, and some words written on the wall in its blood: You Know Nothing.<br>
<br>
The guards found him in the woods. His wounds infected and festering, the insects plaguing him. He was too incoherenat and near death to speak, and they doubted he knew where he was. Unsure what to do, they decided it was best to bring him back, present him to the Mistress and let her decide.<br>
<br>
For three days he lay, strapped to a slab in the bowels of Prime Nightmare's keep, screaming in torment as the maggots and bloodworms feasted on his wounds. Young healers of the house were called on to attend to him, to keep him hovering the line between tortured life, and merciful death. At the peaks of his torment, Brynvin would come to observe him, laughing sadistically at his suffering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at you...,&quot; she snarled, leaning inches over his face to be sure he could see the unbridled hatred in her eyes, &quot;Your hatred is as pale as your hair, your blood barely fit for the worms feeding on it... You have betrayed the very core of what you are, and what we stand for. You have grieved the only beings who ever cared about your pathetic existance... endured your madness... fought by your side... But they were not enough, were they? And still, when you have nothing left, not even a corpse to steal this time, you return to them. Tell me how it feels.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he writhed and bellowed in anguish, not answering her question, Brynvin took her leave, stopping to call back to him before leaving the chamber, &quot;But have no doubts, you who are so unworthy of redemption, we will take care of you. One way, or another.&quot;<br>
<br>
Three days he screamed before an audience was granted. He was cleaned and clothed and forced to march, weak and stumbling to the Mistress's chambers, where she would determine his fate.<br>
<br>
There collapsing to his knees, the fallen knight Talastius sat humbly before the grinning Mistress of Prime Nightmare, Lady Cielo Infierno. At her sides, the clerics Vyany and Brynvin sneered mockingly at Talastius. Unable to fully concentrate, the knight was aware of others in the room, most likely Fajon and Grogo. <br>
<br>
Finally, after much silence, Talastius spoke, bubbles of blood erupting from his lips, &quot;Forgive me.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/JCOLE1/pnimages/Tal.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

She had brought the notion up to him in the hopes of visiting Talastius one last time. But even at the mention of her idea the centaur had shown a thunderous side she hadn't yet seen, and she had left him, chastened, holding back a torrent of tears. That night, braving Morell Thule's wrath just for one more glimpse of her love, she sought out the dark landscape that would be Talastius's dreams. She knew that Morell Thule's powers did not extend here, and that if Terris Thule or his minions found her creeping around  his kingdom, she'd face death or worse. But just to see Tal one last time, to see his dreams and to give him one last moment of happiness was worth all fates.<br>
<br>
She found his dreams easily, her love for him guiding her, but what she found there was not her lover. What she found there was beyond her darkest imagination, cruel, bloody, deadly. <br>
<br>
She fled. She fled to the realm of Dreams and fell sobbing into Lord Thule's arms. Though he wanted to scold her, he felt all the pain in the tiny elf's form and just held her. She had learned her lesson well enough, he thought. <p>Pixxii's me name. Mischief's me game.<br>

Despite Talastius’s willfulness during his entire time in the Nightmare, he had always managed to regain her respect and admiration, as a friend, a brother, and a knight.  She and the Nightmare had indeed forgiven many things, but this was the worst of them all. This deed had made a mockery of all that they were, and she would not see it go unpunished.<br>
<br>
 The dark and hate-filled part of her wanted to strike him dead with her very own magiks, yet death seemed either too merciful, or too severe. And through it all, the nurturing part of her held on to a small amount of hope for his dark salvation. Now, after 3 days of waiting, he was before her, near death, begging for the forgiveness of the family. <br>
<br>
She stood with her arms folded in front of her chest, her signature grin decorating her indigo face. <br>
<br>
“Well, well...here we are..” she purred. “ I must say, Talastius...you are quite the pitiful sight. Once a strong and noble knight, now stripped of all power, brought to this pathetic mess before me. It’s all quite sad”. <br>
<br>
Cielo walked over and stood directly in front of the battered ex-knight and looked down at him, her face now wearing a scowl.<br>
<br>
“Some in this very room think you unfit for redemption in any form. I would tend to agree with them, although what I have in mind will cause such incredible pain, death would be a gift from the gods“. Cielo knelt down and lifted his chin, forcing his eyes to meet hers and spoke softly to him. “So, it’s forgiveness you seek, hmmm? It shant come to you easily. You have upset us for the very last time, Talastius. You must prove your worth once again. Will you accept and endure all I have in store for you?” Cielo raised an eyebrow at him.<br>
<br>
Talastius’s head nodded weakly in agreement, and Cielo removed her hand from his chin, letting his head drop to his chest and turned to Grogo.<br>
<br>
“Grogo, take this poor excuse for a teir’dal to his former chamber, please” Grogo immediately lifted the knight into his powerful arms. “Vyany and Fajon, please accompany Grogo to Talastius’s chamber. I will need you to heal him to full capacity. Brynvin, prepare the purification ritual as we have planned. It shall begin tomorrow morn.”<br>
<br>
With that everyone went to work preparing for the proceedings the following morning.<br>

The clerics had attended to him and left him be to rest for the oncoming ordeal. However, there was little rest to be had. The room was familiar only in memory. The books he had long collected were confiscated and sent off to the libraries. His desk and chairs gone, even the lamps had been taken away. All that was left behind was a hard cot, itself lacking pillow or linens.<br>
<br>
In truth, it was to be expected. Talastius was a guest of the house only in the sense that the Nightmare was never one to take prisoners. He sought redemption, and they sought to give it to him, but in the meantime he had to pay. All of his comforts were gone, and it would likely be a long time before he could again enjoy such things.<br>
<br>
Eventually exhaustion began to set in and sleep gripped the knight. <br>
<br>
Talastius found himself alone in a room of towering black walls that disappeared into the nighttime sky. The floor was covored in a few inches of perfectly still water, that aided by a soft light from some unknown source, offered an almost perfect reflection.<br>
<br>
As Talastius tried to get his bearings, he became aware of two entities behind him. Turning suddenly he gasped as he beheld them, the gods he served, towering silently over him. Dropping to his knees he bowed his head in humility. Slowly Innoruuk and Terris began to circle him, like sharks prepared to tear into some poor wayward water foul. Then the words came, slamming into his mind and threatening to drive him mad. The voice that carried them was so unnatural Talastius could not be certain which god spoke, or if it was somehow both of them. Clutching the sides of his head as the pain gripped him, Talastius took in the words of his gods.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have angered us wayward knight. You sought to corrupt, and failed and yourself became corrupted. You sinned against your bloodline and your flesh by bedding with the enemy of your people. Where we sought to give you everything, you sought to disgrace yourself. And for what? The affections of a Fier Dal that ran from you, wise enough to know that staying would bring only pain and torment? You threw out everything in a foolish game of emotion and gained nothing. And worse, you felt something. You weakened, lost your malicious way. And now you return, wishing to once again find yourself. Do you want it Talastius, do you want to return to what you were meant to be? Do you want all those things you dreamed? Are you willing to pay the price?'<br>
<br>
Talastius called out weakly, barely able to form words, &quot;I want to serve again. I want to be your knight.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice of the gods boomed back at him, &quot;We are unhappy Talastius, but we are going to let you have your little redemption. But you will pay for your transgressions. What your brethren now prepare, is but one tiny piece of your punishment. Behold yourself Talastius, behold the price of sinning against your flesh.&quot;<br>
<br>
With trepidation Talastius looked down into the refective waters, focusing on his image there. What he saw sent the dark elf screaming in terror.<br>
<br>
The guards assigned to stand duty outside the knight's chambers burst in quickly, weapons drawn. The first to see Talastius froze in terror a few moment's before running from the room, bellowing for a cleric. The second watched the screaming knight clawing at the bubbling blisters and boils on his face and vomited. <br>
<br>
By morning Talastius had been treated as well as he could be before the coming ritual. But the efforts of the clerics proved to little avail. His face was a conglomerate of flayed flesh and festering wounds. Those that had healed, left horrible disfiguring scars. Ashamed to show his face, Talastius held his head low, his hair drapping in front fo his features as he was led from his room and to the place of trials.<br>

He had done all he could for the damage to the tormented knight's face, it was not enough.  The scarring would be horrid...inside and out... the touch of an angry god was not soon forgotten.  <br>
<br>
    Fajon waited to be called and the ceremony to begin.  The hours dragged on, finally the Warpriest could bare his fallen friends suffering no longer and ordered the ogre guard to open the door.  Once inside he walked to the limp form of Talastius, his fingers twisting in a spell already.  A small boost of stamina, and his soul a bit pacified...yes that would help a little.  Yes that would do while he waited.  Fajon longed for the days ahead, once the inner healing could start at last.  The fallen one's breathing evened just a bit and with a furled brow Faj once again stepped into the shadow.  Quietly he sat beside his brother's side.  Tal had saved his life too many times to leave him now.<br>
<br>
Finally the call came and the Warpriest quickly went to his chamber to put on the robes he must wear.  He had just finished when Brynvin knocked on the door. <br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sounds of boots sternly tapping against the stone floor and the almost military sound of moving armor as well as swishing robes filled the torchlit hallway as the small procession snaked its way to the room where Talastius was being kept.  Grogo held a torch out before him to light their way, the hall barely large enough to contain the ogre's fearful frame.  Behind him, Cielo walked silently, the shadows were almost darker than the frown she wore on her smooth indigo face that even Vermelo, who walked softly by her side, had not been able to lighten. Behind them, in rows of two, were Brynvin and Vyany, and then Fajon and Cook.  The rest of the Nightmare waited in the bowels of Prime Keep, in the freshly refurbished chapel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There had never been need to use it since the Nightmare had come to the new Keep, and so Brynvin had made sure it was restored to a high enough standard of perfection to be worth the sleep she had lost to the preparations, even if the subject of the ritual was not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A guard at Talastius's door unlocked it, sending it open with a mournful creak.  Light poured in from the hallway onto the lowly inhabitant of the room who sat wearily up from his cot, a hand shielding his eyes and face.  There was something different about him...<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Bring him,&quot; Brynvin's voice cut through the silence like a cold steel blade.  Obediently, the two guards marched into the room and picked Talastius up, each gripping an arm and dragging him out into the hallway.  Hair that was once like freshly fallen snow now hung limply and filth-drenched in the errant Teir`Dal's shadowed face.  Slowly, Brynvin stepped forward and slipped a cool finger under Talastius's chin, lifting his face into the light, exposing his freshly marred features.  Her voice caught for a moment in her throat in surprise before a cruel grin spread across her crimson lips.  Softly, she stepped back and let his head droop forward again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, he needs a bath... to say the least.  Talastius, strip.  If you cannot, it will be done for you,&quot; she ordered sternly.  With a nod to the guards by Cielo, Talastius's arms were released and he did as he was bade, a meager pile of cloth armor at the floor beside him mere moments later.  Grogo carefully held up a simple black robe and then handed it out toward Talastius.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wear dis,&quot; the ogre instructed.  With a nod, Talastius took the robe and slipped it around his wrecked blue body.  As he began to tie it shut, Brynvin spoke up once again, her gaze locked on one item he had not taken off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> around your neck, remove it.&quot;  For the first time since his disfigurement, Talastius looked directly at someone, glaring at Brynvin, and then he spoke.  His voice was as cool and plain as his answer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No?&quot;  The priestess glanced back at Cielo for a moment and her eyes narrowed as she returned her gaze to him, burning with the same suspicion the others must have been feeling as well.  &quot;You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> remove it, or it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be removed for you.&quot;  With reluctance, Talastius reached up and untied the pouch that rested around his neck, gripping it tightly there for a moment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Grogo, give me your oath that this will be returned,&quot; he requested calmly as he slipped the pouch from his neck.  Somewhat unsure, Grogo looked between the elf and the group that had come to punish him.  Brynvin tried her best to suppress her outrage and rip the pouch from his hands; however, Cielo nodded to Grogo, giving her own silent permission for it to be returned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yoo hab me wurd dat it be gived back,&quot; the large shadowknight vowed as he held out a hand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I do not expect you to understand,&quot; Talastius's voice was low and menacing, meant for Brynvin alone to hear as he placed the pouch into the ogre's large, calloused palm, &quot;but I will not soon forget that.&quot;  Her jaw setting firmly in place at the mild threat, unwilling to pursue the matter futher just yet, Brynvin turned away from him and cleared her throat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, bath time for the wicked, and then we begin,&quot; she smiled to the rest of the group as she resumed her place in line next to Vyany.  &quot;Guards?&quot;  Talastius's arms were once again taken into their iron grips, and the procession began to move once more, Talastius being walked along side, following the dark pathway to the stairs at the end of the hall that would guide them down to the Temple of Prime Keep. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>+ B R Y N V I N + S I N E S T R E +</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Here it is. Thank you to Bryn for your input. It wouldn't have been a good story without you. *hugs*<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>~~~~The Ritual~~~~</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
The procession slowly made it's way down the ancient stone steps that spiraled deep into the bowels of Prime Keep. Eerie torchlight filled the narrow tunnel, their cloaked bodies throwing ominous shadows on the walls. Only footsteps could be heard echoing through the stairwell. When they reached the last step, the hall opened up into a large room. <br>
<br>
The alter, a chiseled stone slab set at a slight angle, had been erected in the center of the cavernous temple and now stood amidst tiers of glowing candles that created a luminous circle around it. Immediately to the right of the alter was an ornate table where the amassment of the items and tools to be used in the ritual had been laid out, a red silken cloth hiding them from sight. On two sides of the sacred alter, the balance of the Nightmare sat in sturdy pues crafted from the oldest, darkest trees of the Nektulos forest and there they waited.<br>
<br>
Brynvin entered first, closely followed by the two hulking guards and their condemned captive. With a nod to the guards, she motioned toward the alter. Promptly, the guards stepped forward and lead Talastius under the archway of towering candles to stand before the stone slab, facing away from it. The procession quietly spilled into the room behind them. Vyany and Fajon both took a place at Talastius's side as the guards moved away to stand outside the ring of candles, still keeping a stern and watchful eye on their charge. Cook, Grogo, Vermelo and Cielo moved to stand outside the the glowing barrier and observe, none of them yet allowed within the candlelit circle.<br>
<br>
Once assembled, Vyany and Fajon moved in unison, each taking hold of Talastius's robe and sliding it back from his shoulders until he stood bare before the assembly. Folding the robe neatly, Fajon turned and placed it on the table who's freshly exposed contents now gleamed and glimmered under the twinkling of candles. Brynvin removed three cloths from the table, handing one each to Vyany and Fajon and retaining one for herself. The trio then saturated their cloths with saltwater from a large marble bowl atop the table and wordlessly began to scrub away at the grimy indigo skin of the knight.<br>
<br>
When every inch of his body had been cleansed to the priests' satisfaction, they each stepped back from Talastius and pointed to the cold stone slab that awaited him. He showed no resistance to their wish for him to lie down. As he began to recline, moistened tangles of hair fell back from his face, revealing the wrecked features beneath to the onlookers. Cielo closed her eyes tightly and a deep sigh escaped her violet lips. Vermelo, seeing her distress, grasped her hand firmly, trying to comfort her as much as he could. Reluctantly, Cielo turned from the alter as Cook and Vermlo stepped into the circle. Not noticing her delicate hands clenching into rock hard fists, she stiffly headed to her seat in the front pue, where Frizzled and Spehk had been sitting in a reverent silence.<br>
<br>
The time of purification had arrived.<br>
<br>
Before taking their places around the alter each cleric took a ceremonial rune in hand and marked Talastius's body where the incisions would be made and then set them back upon the table, where both Vyany and Fajon each retrieved a  ceremonial dagger.<br>
<br>
Brynvin took her place at the head of the alter, spreading her arms up high above her, her palms angled toward the ceiling. Vyany stepped to the right side of the alter, Fajon to the left, and each, firmly gripping the hilt of their daggers in both hands, held them aloft with their gleaming points reaching toward the darkness above. Simultaneously, the three began chanting a prayer in Elder Teir`Dal.<br>
<br>
Vyany began her call to Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Father Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, hear me...<br>
<br>
Lend me your power this day,<br>
<br>
so I may cleanse this knight,<br>
<br>
making him worthy again to serve you as an instrument of hatred.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
As Vyany continued her chant, Fajon began his prayer to the Goddess Terris Thule. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lady Terris-Thule, Goddess of Nightmares. hear me...<br>
<br>
Lend me your power this day,<br>
<br>
so I may cleanse this knight,<br>
<br>
making him once again worthy to serve you with the creation of nightmares.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Vyany and Fajon continued their chants as Brynvin began her call to her own god.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ancient god, Spirit of Blood, hear me... <br>
<br>
Lend me your power this day,<br>
<br>
so I may clense and purify the blood of this weakened knight,<br>
<br>
making him once against worthy of his gods, House and race.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Their voices intermingled in a haunting chorus that filled the temple. As they chanted faster and faster, an intense energy could be felt by all within the room. Brynvin lowered her arms somewhat, stretching her palms out to meet the daggers of Vyany and Fajon that were slowly lowering as well. The two tips touched together just above Brynvin's open palms, creating a fierce explosion of light as the combined powers of their gods were channeled over him. A force, unseen, sprang from the apex of the energy and ripped through the knight's body, sending him into uncontrollable convulsions. The guards rushed forward into the circle to hold him down for the coming incisions.<br>
<br>
As they mutilated his battered body, his face contorted with a look of horrible pain. Tortured moans escaped his lips but he spoke no words. The blessed daggers were set back upon the table and Talastius's body was once again still. The guards releases their grip and stepped back from the alter. Blood flowed feely from the new wounds that were quickly cleaned with saltwater as his body had been. Talastius resolved not to wail, but the incredible pain in the already painful wounds was unbareable. His screams echoed in the temple, resonating in the ears of the onlookers. The bloody cloths were tossed back into the marble bowl, changing the water to a pale pink.<br>
<br>
Brynvin leaned down, her face near the fallen knight's right ear and spoke softly with contempt in her voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall we stop, Talastius? Do you wish this to end? Say aye, so I may have the pleasure of killing you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talastius gritted his teeth and narrowed his tear-filled eyes with resolve. <br>
<br>
&quot;I shall endure all that is in store for me. You shall have no such pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
An angered sigh escaped her lips as she stood back up to perform the blood purification.<br>
<br>
Cook stepped forward toward the alter and awaited Brynvin's cue. She slowly and carefully willed the blood out of the open wounds on Talastius's body into a large bowl. The knight felt the warmth leaving his body and his life fading away. The candles which once so brightly burned in his vision were now barely more than pinpricks of light, like the stars across a midnight sky. Before death could overtake him, though, she nodded to Cook, and with a touch of his hand, the powerful wizard had frozen the body of the knight to the point of suspended animation.<br>
<br>
With the power of her god coursing through her veins, the Blood Priestess set to purifying the very source of the outcast's life. She dipped her hands in the warm fluid contents of the bowl and filled her upturned palms. She closed her eyes, speaking a hushed incantation under her breath, and transferred the blood into another bowl. Again and again she took up fresh handfuls of his blood until there was not a single drop that she had not fortified. Casting a final spell on the basin of rejuvenated blood, filling the room with a brilliant scarlet glow, her words commanded the blood to rise up in streams from the bowl and back into the body through the same wounds from whence it had been drawn.<br>
<br>
When all of Talastius's blood was in his veins once again, Brynvin opened her eyes and again nodded to Cook. He touched the frigid body of the knight, this time with the heat of fire, and again the knight drew breath. With that, Cook stepped back from the alter to make way for Vermelo as the next step of purification arrived.<br>
<br>
It was time now for the purification of his mind. Vermelo stepped forward as Cook had and called upon the radiance of Innoruuk to help him in his task. He placed his hand on Talastius's forehead and the knight's eyes began to widen. The enchanter spoke a short incantation, to which a screech tore from Talastius's lip as he threw his head back, his mind shattered by Chaotic Feedback. In the next moment, Talastius stared blankly up toward the ceiling, a puddle of drool pooling near his head. His mind lay in a broken ruin, functioning only at the most basic level. It was up to the masterful enchanter to rebuild the mind of his kinsman. Lightly, he placed both hands on the knight's head. Vermelo closed his eyes tightly and began to chant, faster and faster as he went on. He imbued the knight's mind with hatred and a new order as his powers reconstructed the broken mind, finally giving him clarity of mind to bring his senses back to him. As Talastius became aware of his surroundings, Vermelo stepped back.<br>
<br>
Talastius looked about the room, confusion and terror upon his indigo face. Weakly, he looked down at the still open and bleeding wounds decorating his body and then vaguely understood why he was there. But the ritual was not quite over. Lastly, the scars were to be set. All of the knight's wounds, old and new, were packed with clay to keep the skin from repairing itself, leaving it permanently disfigured, to serve as a reminder of his shameful transgressions each time he looked upon himself. <br>
<br>
The end had come.<br>
<br>
As Brynvin methodically extinguished the candles to close the cermemony, Fajon and Vyany began to heal Talastius. Grogo approached the alter and stood next to his comrade, awaitng the cue to escort the kngiht to his chamber. When the healing was complete, Grogo placed his large right arm under the new knight's back and helped him to the floor. As Talastius was lead out, the procession reconvened and traveled back up the stairwell to the Keep.<br>

<br>
  Talastius knelt in his chambers before the small alter before him. The ritual of purification was over, and he was for all intents and purposes redeemed in the eyes of his people.<br>
  He knew the truth of course, redemption and forgiveness are by no means related, and some would never forget his crimes. With the physical trials complete, it was time to pray and meditate, and with the help of some potent teas, slip into the world of nightmares. There he would stand his final judgement before his gods, and only then would he truly be a knight again. He sat in silence for many hours, concentrating and freeing his mind. He sipped slowly from the ornate cup that held the brew. Finally the incense and tea took over and Talastius slumped and fell sideways, the cup slipping from his grip and crashing to the stone floor. <br>
<br>
  Outside the guards heard the breaking of glass, and the younger less experienced guard started for the door. His veteran companion grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back from the door.<br>
<br>
  &quot;No one goes in until he comes out. That is the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The younger guard nodded, accepting his mentors words and returned to his post.<br>
<br>
   <br>
&quot;why don't you deliver us from pain and evil <br>
  we stand in a quiver of our god and we will <br>
  follow his will as long as he will feed us <br>
  but we're not sure if he does really need us&quot; <br>
<br>
  ~ &quot;Deliverance&quot; Wumpscut<br>
<br>
<br>
  Talastius lay on a stone slab in an expanse of grey desolation. The light in the sky came from no sun or moon but from a ring of fire encircling the horizon, fading to the blackest nothingness as it climbed ever higher. His arms and legs were bound with writhing snakes that threatened to strike should he struggle too much. Venom like a thick black liquor dripped from their fangs. Their cold reptilian eyes spoke to Talastius all he needed to know:  this was his final chance. He could turn back now, forsake it all and surrender to death, or he could continue, and pray that his gods found him to once again be worthy.<br>
<br>
  Talastius stared coldly into the nothingness above him and spoke calmly, &quot;As I passed the test of my kin, so I shall pass this.&quot;<br>
<br>
  A voice thundered back at him, its volume and force threatening to implode his skull.<br>
<br>
  &quot;There are four you serve fallen knight. Name them and be redeemed, fail and the snakes shall strike. Are you prepared?&quot;<br>
<br>
  Talastius, grim and determined, called back to the voice that he was and the test began.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Who,&quot; thundered the wasteland around him, &quot;is your father, the one that made you?&quot;<br>
<br>
  Talastius called back without thinking, it was a simple answer, one every Tier'Dal knew  from birth, &quot;Innoruuk, God of Hatred.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The snake around his left arm loosened and dropped to the ground. As it writhed there, it grew and expanded, its shape changing until at last, the Hate God himself loomed above Talastius. Glaring down at his fallen knight, Innoruuk sneered and stepped back from the slab.<br>
<br>
  Again the voice called out.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Who is your queen, from whence all your desires are born.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Again Talastius found the answer easily, desires are but the product of dreams, and his dreams were the providence of Terris Thule. Upon answering the snake around his right arm loosened and dropped to the floor, growing as did the other until Terris towered above him. Silently she too stepped back from the slab.<br>
<br>
  The voice called out again, this time a tone of smugness could be detected.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Very good fallen knight. You have guessed with ease the two you knew you served, but what of those that bind your legs, what masters are those that you never knew you had? Tell me Talastius, who is your prophet, the one that inspires you?&quot;<br>
  His heart sunk and his throat seized. His inspiration? His prophet? He had never contemplated the thought, never considered the hand of another god in his life. And inspiration? Few would ever call him inspired, instead swinging more to deeming him...<br>
  That was it! It made sense, in a dark and terribly ironic way. They would call me mad he thought.<br>
<br>
  With the smugness of pride he shouted back, &quot;Vazaelle, the Mad God.&quot; <br>
<br>
  He felt the snake binding his left leg loosen and fall away, and in moments Vazaelle stood next to him, smiling in joy as tears of blood flowed from sorrowful eyes. She danced and whirled around the slab, in step with some rhythmless cacophony that he could not hear.<br>
<br>
  This time the voice thundered louder and harsher, obviously agitated.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Very well knight, now your final test. Who is your lover, Talastius? Who is the one that gives you pleasure?&quot;<br>
<br>
  Inside his own mind the knight growled in contempt. The voice wanted him to fail, and herein it saved its final, harshest question for last. Pleasure and love, the two very notions that had landed Talastius in this mess in the first place. It was a trap, he was certain, there could be no answer, no way to speak without incurring a fatal wrath.<br>
  Finally, resolved to his fate he yelled defiantly into the nothingness above.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What I would love, is to bring upon you a millennia of suffering, to make you watch your children bleed and whither into nothingness before I made you eat your own tongue!&quot;<br>
<br>
  For an eternity of moments there was silence, even Vazaelle stopped in her dance to glance at the knight, now waiting to die. Finally the three gods nodded in unspoken unison and the final snake loosened its grip and fell to the floor growing as the others had.<br>
<br>
  Talastius did not understand. He had not answered, had failed in the test. And then he saw the goddess before him and understood.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Saryn...&quot;<br>
<br>
  The goddess of pain came to him on that slab and before those assembled loved him with hooks and knives, teaching him to moan in the ecstasy of pain and scream in the torment of pleasure. She taught him so many things, and when she was done with him, she whispered in his ear, certain he was just conscious enough to hear her words.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Your flesh is mine and mine alone to play with.&quot;<br>
<br>
  <br>
&quot;In every dance no steps are placed, and on every path mistakes are made, and if every path leads but to the grave, let us dance upon our way.&quot;<br>
  ~ &quot;Scars Flown Proud&quot; Faith and the Muse<br>
<br>
<br>
  The guards outside Talastius' chamber snapped to attention as the door creaked open slowly. Talastius stumbled out and fell weakly to his knees, his palms on the ground. With great effort he spoke.<br>
<br>
  &quot;It is done.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The younger guard reached out to place a comforting hand on Talastius' shoulder and help him to his feet. As the guards palm touched his exposed shoulder, searing pain ripped through Talastius' body. The words of Saryn rang in his ears. Rising to his feet he snarled, pools of hatred filling his eyes. Lunging out he grabbed the guard by the throat, the contact almost too much to bear.<br>
<br>
  &quot;No one,&quot; Talastius snarled, &quot;is to ever touch me again.&quot; <br>
<br>
  Suddenly, instinctively the energies flowed through him and out his palm. The guard's eyes widened for a second as the harm touch struck him, and then Talastius dropped the limp corpse to the ground. Turning to the other guard, a demonic grin flashed across the knight's tattered face.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Take that to the clerics. See if they can revive him. If so, bring me my armor and weapons, I am out of practice, and as long as he can scream, he will make a fine practice dummy.&quot;<br>
<br>
  As he stepped toward his door, realization struck him and Talastius turned to give one ore order to the guard struggling with the still warm corpse.<br>
<br>
  &quot;And send some silver smiths and artisans to my chamber, I want a mask made.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The guard watched as Talastius walked, with more strength and confidence back into the all consuming darkness of his chamber. Carefully he worked his arms under the young recruit he was meant to train and drug the body down the hall toward the infirmary, stopping only to pass word to another hall guard.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Tell Lady Infierno, the knight is back.&quot;<br>
