Our debt increased rapidly in the 80s and early 90s.  The devaluation of our dollar did not help either, making it costlier to pay back the part of our debt owed to foreign investors.<br>
<br>
It had severe effects on canadians.<br>
Lots of social programs had to be cut.  It's no longer true to say we have an universal and free health care system.  Teachers salaries went down.  Our military is going through difficult times.  Standard of living went down for every canadian.<br>
Today, I think for each dollar paid in taxes, 25 to 30 cents goes to pay back interest.  Not the debt, just the interest on the debt.  That money could be spent on other things if we had no debt.<br>

Don't get me started on his morality blah blah blah.  Put simply, 95% of the past presidents were scoundrels and flawed men in their own way (exept maybe Jimmy Carter, who was nice guy but just wasn't good prez)  Our past presidents were Alcoholics (list goes on), adulterers (reagan, kennedy, clinton, johnson, etc...etc..etc..etc.), pot smokers (bush, clinton), slave owners (pre-civil war prez), cocaine users (bush), etc...etc.  <br>
<br>
As for the economy, deficits suck because a) it impacts consumer confidence, b) effects terms of deals we get with other countries, and c) forces govt. services to be cut in order to balance the budget.<br>
<br>
Put simply, consumers and investors hate the word &quot;deficit&quot;.  When they hear it, they don't invest, don't buy things, don't travel.  This on a whole has devastating effects on the economy.  Investors and consumers are like sheep.  They get nervous easy, and run for the hills at the sign of trouble.  Deficits are a sign of trouble.  During the Clinton years this country saw amazing amounts of consumer spending and investing.  One reason for this was a balanced budget, as consumers were happy that the U.S. had a balanced budget.<br>
<br>
Deficits also effects the U.S. credit rating I believe.  Therefore large international deals hinge on the deficits.  International goods and services become even more expensive when the U.S. has a high deficit.<br>
<br>
Finally, deficits mean slashed govt. services.  Now republicans like this, that is why most republicans don't care about deficits.  Republicans main strategy is to rack up huge deficits, and then say &quot;oh well..time to cut social security, medicare, legal services, and other services to balance the budget!&quot;.  What republicans don't realize is that their slash and burn tactics, coupled with &quot;vodoo economics&quot; i.e., trickle down economics, i.e., tax breaks for rich, just shatters consumer confidence.  Shattered consumer confidence = recession.<br>

<br>
Short term: No significant harm is done directly. It's an economical indicator though, when companies report losses or lower revenues the trust in them lowers (and more important there shares). An administration ending with a deficit lowers trust and can cause some unrest among stock markets and bad influence on the countries currency.<br>
<br>
Long term: as stated above, more interest paying lowers the actuall money to work with. It's like having the bad effect of raising taxes on the economy and having the downside of lowering taxes on your income in the same deal. The actual problem of deficits will be for the next problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=simanmistrunner>SimanMistrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 462<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/18/03 9:44:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clinton Speaks</span><hr size=1> We need to make sure we keep two terms separate for this discussion as folks are getting the two confused.  Deficits is the difference between what the Government spends in a given year versus what it brings in for a given year.  To fund deficits, the government needs to issue debt to investors.  The national debt is the aggregate amount of deficits that we have incurred over the years.  We pay interest on the national debt--the recipients of these interest payments are the holders of U.S. treasuries and other debt instruments.<br>
<br>
The national debt of a country should never be looked at in a vacuum--you need to compare it against the size of the overall economy.  The ratio of debt to gdp in the United States is not that high at all, much less than in countries such as Japan.<br>
<br>
While there are costs to debt, you have to weigh the costs against the benefits of incurring more debt.  WIth respect to Bush's tax cuts, I have hard time convincing myself that the benefits derived from the tax cuts outweigh the costs of incurring additional debt to finance those tax cuts.  While I agree that some tax cuts would be helpful, a scaling down of the Bush tax cuts would not get my opposition.<br>
<br>
What are the costs of increased national debt?<br>
<br>
1.  Higher interest coverage--we pay interest on the national debt out of each year's fiscal budget.  The more debt there is, the higher interest payments will be.  That right there is less money than can be spent elsewhere.<br>
<br>
2.  Crowds out private borrowing--there is a dispute among economists to the degree.  The argument goes that as the government issues more debt to investors, that reduces the amount of debt that investors will seek from companies.seeking access to liquidity.<br>
<br>
In many senses, it is a question of what we want to pass onto our children as all debt comes due at some point.  I would rather do everything in our power to limit the growth in our national debt, or even reduce the national debt, as best as we can.  I have no debt in my personal life and it is very freeing.<br>
<br>
This partisan bickering is silly.  Neither party cares about deficit reduction.  There are individuals in each party that do but they are in the minority of their respective parties.  Who are we trying to kid.  Debt reduction is not a priority among Republican or Democratic leadership.<br>

You said the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;Deficits also effects the U.S. credit rating I believe. Therefore large international deals hinge on the deficits. International goods and services become even more expensive when the U.S. has a high deficit.&quot;<br>
<br>
That statement only makes sense if our national debt were high enough to trigger a credit downgrade.  It ain't even close.  The U.S. has the highest credit rating possible for sovereign governments.  We are nowhere near getting downgraded.  Your statement that large international deals hinge on deficits makes even less sense.  What international deals?  The credit ratings that are important in any commercial transaction are the corporate credit ratings of the parties involved.  Unless it is a rare transaction where the government is guaranteeing obligations of one of the parties, the credit rating of the government is irrelevant; what matters is the credit rating of the commercial entities.  International goods and services become even more expensive when the U.S. has a high deficit?  The only external factor that affects the prices of international goods and services is the exchange rate.  To the extent that a higher deficit moves the exchange rate, that would be true.<br>

However, the U.S. govt. is a &quot;consumer&quot; in that the U.S. purchases goods and services from other countries, whether those are military goods, transportation infrastructure goods, etc., etc.  The U.S. govt alone is probably the #1 purchaser of international goods and services.  Therefore when the U.S. govt. finances purchases from other countries, the deficit, impacts the terms of those deals. Higher interest rates = wasted money.  <br>
<br>
Deficits are primarily the result of both tax cuts and govt. spending.  Clinton spent a lot, but he was responsible with taxes.  Dubya on the other hand is spend spend spend..and cut cut cut (for the rich), which IMHO is just downright idiotic.  Even his own party is revolting, as they say his massive tax cut for the rich is just plain irresponsible.<br>

Will have to be paid off in the future. And most of the funds will go to interest.<br>
<br>
We find that deficits do not affect international buying power as the US already has the highest rating of any country, does not affect consumer confidence because there is absolutely no history showing that.<br>
<br>
What could hurt us is if the deficit gets to high.<br>
<br>
The best way to decrease and keep the deficit low is to have a robust economy and keep spending down.<br>
<br>
How can we have a robust economy? Well the best way is to have people investing and purchasing. What do people use to invest and purchase? They use the capital they feel they can afford to live with out at that moment. Who has the greatest potential to have and invest large amounts of capital that improves the economy? High income earners. Who is hit the most by taxes? High income earners.<br>
<br>
This is for Blood, that &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot; mantra is so bogus. Do you have any idea of what it means or are you just mouthing the words? The &quot;rich&quot; are not affected by taxes because most of their wealth is in assets not income. The poor are not affected by taxes because they don't pay taxes. The only ones that are affected are the ones who pay most (by a large margin) of the taxes, the high income earners. The high income earners are not hard hit by a poor economy and high taxes they don't starve or fail to make house and medical payments. They just don't have as much capital to invest and spend. What is hurt by a poor economy is the poor and the Deficit. What is the best way to help the poor and the Deficit? Make sure that the people who do the investing and high end purchasing get to keep more of their own money so they can invest and buy.<br>
<br>
So if you actually gave a poop about the poor and the Deficit you would get off your class envy, mantra spouting, political agenda pony and agree the best thing we can do is give tax cuts to the people who pay the most taxes and decrease federal spending. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nakath>Nakath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/19/03 11:34:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clinton Speaks</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Neither party cares about deficit reduction<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ummm WHAT?  Where do you come up with stuff? Just make it up?  All sides agree that about 90% of the tax cuts proposed by bush benefit the top 1% of the wage earners in this country.  That my friend, is the rich.  Call them &quot;high income owners&quot; or whatever, but that is the rich as I define it.  The largest tax cuts go for stock dividends, i.e., huge wall street types.  Saying the &quot;rich&quot; aren't affected by tax cuts is so preposterous, its like saying the sky isn't blue ROFL.<br>

????.  Um, last I checked, the person who works at McDonalds still has federal taxes withdrawn from his check.  Granted at the end of the year he might get a refund, but he is paying tax on his income.  Also, unless I am missing something, poor people pay sales taxes, gas tax, etc. etc.  In WA, with a fairly large sales tax, you can't go into a store and say &quot;I'm poor - so I don't pay sales tax&quot;.  In sum, poor people do pay taxes *boggle*<br>

You believe in this Voodoo economics crap??  Has this ever worked? Never.  I have to give the republican spin team credit as it looks like you are a true believer.  They think increasing the benefits for the rich, increasing the disparity between the rich and poor, helps us all out.  Bunch of bologna.  Last time this happened (in the 80s), the amount of poor people in this country increased to obscene levels; crack cocaine spread like fire, and ghettos were springing up everywhere.  That was the result of &quot;voodoo economics&quot; as Bush Sr. so aptly noted.  It tooks years to repair the damage, and now you wanted to go back to the &quot;good 'ol days&quot;.<br>

On the cover they had a Gap floor saleslam. Probably makes about 25K/year. *cough* He used to make 300,000/year.  That my friend, is a high income earner who is hit hard by an economy.  The story was absolutely shocking as it showed &quot;high income&quot; earners who were jobless, working at low paying jobs, and shattered savings.  Sounds like  the bad economy affected them.<br>
<br>
Siffo - you can champion the cause of the rich, wealthy, high income owners, or whatever you call it. By all means do.  But please, your voodoo economics aren't gong to pursuade me.  Talk that crazy somewhere else.<br>

Oh you mean like retires and 401K investors drawing on their investments? Or the fact that dividends are taxed twice, once as company profit and then again as income by the retirees. The &quot;rich&quot; don't have to take out their dividends to live they can just let them roll over and or invest them in other avenues that will not be affected by dividend taxes. So their funds aren't taxed to the same extent as those that need that money to live. Who pays 90% of the taxes? And it is not the &quot;rich&quot; it is the &quot;WORKING&quot; wage earners which we all have the opportunity to become even if we aren't born with a silver spoon in our mouths.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>????. Um, last I checked, the person who works at McDonalds still has federal taxes withdrawn from his check.

You answered your self. As far as federal taxes they get it all back, as a matter of fact with the earned income tax credit they get back more than they pay. And trying twist and obfuscate the issue by throwing state and sales tax in to bolster your point is ludicrous.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Voodoo economics<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There you go again spouting some catch phrase mantra like it has meaning. You would like us to believe that it is tax cuts that cause the poor to be poor and take up crack addiction rather than a poor economy. The best part is how you point at one moment in time and say &quot;Oh look the economy is piss poor and they are giving tax cuts, how does that help the Poor?&quot; rather than take the moment to think that the tax cuts affect the future so the economy improves, rather than taxing during the poor economy and getting less because there is less and the poor will continue to suffer.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The U.S. I live in is seeing lots of &quot;high income&quot; owners getting slammed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again you look at the little picture and want to use it to bolster your point. Look at the numbers. Is it more high income earners or low and moderate income earners that loose their jobs and have nothing to fall back on? Pointing to a few unfortunates and using that as you world model is a fine recipe for disaster.<br>
<br>
The problem with basing your economic philosophy on a political agenda and thumb nail views that support your bias is its wrong and it will not be beneficial or functional. If you spout off catch phrases as if they have meaning you may convince your self and a others that want believe the same as you but you will not convince reality. Stop hating people because they are successful, wanting to punish then, wanting to take away from them what they may have accomplished or have and start thinking about how to benefit every one. Hating others is no way to live your life or base a political belief.<br>

Siffo - economics is inherently political, because those on the different side of the political spectrum have different views of economic theory. <br>
<br>
You simply saying, &quot;I'm objective..therefore I'm right&quot; is just hilarous.  You are the one who has not added one iota of evidence of how your economic theories help.  Simply saying - tax cuts for wealthy = healthy economy does not make it so ROFL.  The last time this country saw the tax proposals you are suggesting, was during the reagan years, where the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and as a result, this country spiraled into a recession and class bitterness.  That's a fact.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Vodoo economics and my &quot;hatin&quot; as you calls it bothers you.  But I'm just sick of conservative idealogues like yourself go around saying you know what you are talking about, when in fact, you don't.  So sue me!<br>

Everyone is so against these tax cuts.  They say they're for the &quot;rich&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Well.  Yeah.  Who do you think creates jobs in this country for those poor and middle class workers?<br>
<br>
GIve more money to the capital investors, the company owners, and they're not going to take that money and run.  They're going to invest it by expanding and creating MORE JOBS.<br>
<br>
That means that the poor can get a job.  That means that those in the middle class can move up in the job market as more jobs open up to them.<br>
<br>
And here you go with your 80's voodoo economics theory.  Here's what I've learned.<br>
<br>
Check the records for the OMB and the CBO at any library.  These are matters of public record and are non-partisan.  They PROVE...PROVE NOW...that the tax cuts originally set up by Regan created the greatest increase in US revenues in history.  Interest rates plummeted from 18-23% down to 8%, making homebuying and college possible.  Inflation was terrible...tax cuts changed that.  HOWEVER...congressional spending tripled.  Now, who controlled congress during the Regan years?  Let me clue you in.  Democrats.  You know, those guys that love to keep all your money and spend it on all sorts of pet projects?  <br>
<br>
Don't tell me tax cuts didn't help.  I know better.  Also, check back to Kennedy.  JFK proposed tax cuts that were progressive just like Regan's, and they had the same effect.  INCREASED REVENUE.  Revenue was maintained even when we went into the Vietnam War.  <br>
<br>
Also, the capital gains tax cuts that the Democrats love to pass off as a cut for the rich...well, they're wrong.  The rich have myriad ways to hide their capital gains.  But the middle class, people who sell homes, etc...they're hit INCREDIBLY hard by capital gains.  My grandmother sold her ranch.  The capital gains tax took 70%!!! of it.  My mother sold her house last year.  Capital gains took 50%!!! of the profit.  <br>
<br>
And Clinton's lovely little tuition breaks...don't even apply to us.  Even though we're middle class, and she's been a wage earner for 25 years.  She also has the check stubs where Clinton's tax increases went into effect (biggest tax hike in the HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES) where her income went down by 42%...her taxes increased from 15% to 28% in one pay period.  And her wages didn't increase.  At the time she was making $42000 yearly.  Yeah, we love Clinton in this house.  He really benefited us.<br>
<br>
So...Blood...go read up on it.  Then come back and try to shovel this @#%$ about tax cuts don't aid anyone except the rich. <p><center><B><u>Kerridwynn Spellbender</b></u><BR><i>~*Vicar of Innoruuk*~<br>~*Mistress of the Scythe*~</i><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~<BR><i>Something wicked this way comes...</i><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208851>Garb of the Priestess</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cogadhfv>CogadhFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ogre Gigalo</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/19/03 5:46:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clinton Speaks</span><hr size=1> Tax Brackets-2002 Taxable Income<br>

307,050 and up     307,050 and up       38.6<br>
<br>
So by looking at the magical chart The more you make the more you pay. So if you give a tax cut to the rich (what ever that is, for the sake of this we will say those that make over 307,050) they are still going to pay more taxes then someone who makes 10,000 Even if thier tax rate was reduced to the same 15% rate they would still be paying more in taxes. I would suggest that Blood needs to go back to school and learn basic math.<br>
<br>
As for the state sale tax, well since I lived in Washington for a number of years if I remember correctly everyone pays the same sales tax no matter what there income, and necessities like food and such are not taxed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Voodoo Economics&quot; I remember the RR Era they where good times. And before you say that the Economy was better during the Clinton Years, well your right atleast for the first  part of his term, why is that..uhmm because the economy was still growing from the RR era. What happened to the economy towards the end of his term? It started going to hell in a handbasket and its still sitting there.<br>
<br>
So Blood, are you one of those who are against a flat Tax rate across the board? If so I would like to know why? Why should I have to pay a larger portion of my income to the federal Gov't then Joe who flips burgers at McD's?<br>

<br>
RR prosperity (which is wasn't), was smokes, mirrors, and good PR.  High defense spending (remember star wars) helped the large military corporate structure, but once the defense spedning dried up (read fall of communism), we were back at square 1.  During the so called &quot;boom years&quot; the rich got richer, and the poor got poorer - and there were more poor people in this country living under the poverty line then anytime in history, before or after the reagen years.  By the time Bush Sr. was in office, the economy was on its way  to being in shambles, and he lost the election as a result of it.<br>
<br>
Hey, if you folks want to champion the cause of flat taxes, no tax on stock dividends, disbandment of the luxury taxes, etc., etc - by all means do.  Hoping the rich and wealthy in their infinite generousity pass a doggy a bone is fine - but it makes much more sense to give the middle class the breaks, so they can buy goods and services...not Enron corporate CEOs *shrugs*<br>

I was there as a working adult during the Reagan and Bush 41 years, I know what was happening because I was there while it happened. Your concept of poor is so out of whack you haven't a clue. Americas poor can live better than most every one else in the world the only ones that don't are the ones that choose not to.<br>
<br>
a) Tax cuts that help get and keep the economy going are responsible. That means those that pay 90% of the taxes who happen to also be the people who invest in the future so there are more jobs for the rest of us.<br>
<br>
b) WTF &quot;aimed at helping those that need it most&quot; we already know that the Poor don't pay any federal income tax and the middle class are also getting a tax cut of a higher percentage than the &quot;rich&quot; so your whole supposition is out of whack. As to people against the tax cuts, well as long as there are mouth breather constituents out there that will running around spouting mantra catch phrases that have no basis in reality then they will be forced to do stupid things to placate them.<br>
<br>
With you the problem isn't that things aren't fair or taxes are applied properly you just hate it that there are wealthy people in the world and your not.<br>

Who pays the vast majority of taxes?  The rich!  If they pay the most taxes, then they SHOULD gain the most benefit from tax breaks.<br>
<br>
Kerridwyn hit the nail on the head.  When Reagan was president, he inspired confidence.  People spent money.  As a result, people earned more money.  As a result of that, the government brought in more revenue.<br>
<br>
But in Congress, where real fiscal policy is made, the increase in spending outpaced the increase in revenue.  This caused an even bigger deficit, which in turn increased the national debt.<br>
<br>
In order to get rid of deficit, revenue must increase, and spending must decrease.  No one ever disputes the first condition.  It is merely the how that is debated.  Liberals, as a whole, believe an increase in taxes is the way to go.<br>
<br>
However, conservatives, as a whole, believe cutting taxes can accomplish this even better.  The theory is that by letting the taxpayers keep more of THEIR money that THEY earned, then more money will filter around the economy.  People will buy more, etc.<br>
<br>
It works.  But the problem comes when that second condition is not met.  Spending must be controlled.  If it grows, then we are in the same boat as before.  And if it grows too much in relation to revenue, then we are worse off than before.<br>
<br>
Our economy's health comes when money changes hands.  Increasing taxes causes people to hoard money.  Lowering taxes allows people to spend more, increasing cash flow, and the health of our consumer-driven economy.<br>
