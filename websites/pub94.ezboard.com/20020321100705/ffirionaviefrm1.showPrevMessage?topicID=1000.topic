The prefered healer for this by far is a shaman -- slow spell and regen spell mean you don't need to do a lot of &quot;hot&quot; healing, but can focus on one screen at a time.  Druids and clerics work, too, though.  BTW, the reason I say shaman is that of the wars that had access to all three (druid, cleric, shaman), they all chose shaman.<br><br>Warriors are about the most group dependent class there is.  If you manage to struggle through it to the higher levels, you can be assured of being in high demand, especially here on FV with the low population.

The best example of how well this works was a personal experience I had as a 47 cleric in Karnor. I grouped with four folks levels 59 or 60 (two were 60, to were 59). They killed stuff that was blue to red to me, in quantity, and quickly, and I was done with 47, five orange bubs, in around two hours. They didn't do this to powerlevel me (though they knew it would do so), they just needed someone who could cast complete heal and while I didn't do a whole lot else, I could at least do that for them.<br><br>This contrasts with 'the old days' when higher levels in group took a disproportionately huge amount of experience. That hasn't been the case for some time, since class penalties were abolished and group experience was changed to be divided linearly based on level. Now it is the lower levels who take a disproportionately large share. Note that this doesn't mean you should never group with those lower level than you (that'd make for a boring game). However, understanding this, you can use this knowledge to affect your experience flow: group with lower level friends to help them catch up, group with higher level friends to catch up to them.<br><br>In any case, if you hadn't considered this, or hadn't understood how the linear experience division change has altered group experience dynamics, I figured I'd mention it.<br><br>Coriolis of Erudin, Firiona Vie, Illusionist<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 6:25:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=992.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aside from blatant power leveling</span><hr size=1> Aye, Coriolis, thanks for pointing this out again.<br><br>In my opinion, this helps to close the balance in leveling speed between classes that solo well and those that don't.  This point has some glaring exceptions, but often those classes that can't solo well find their way into higher level groups because they contribute well on a group level.  Clerics are a good example, Bards another, and Enchanters, like myself.  Even if I can't land much on a creature we are fighting, I can always debuff magic resistance and lend considerable buffing to the group I am with.  And mezz stuff that happens to add, if it's lower level.  Often, people are quite content with that.<br><br>Just an observation, for those finding it difficult to group with people of your exact level.  This low population world means a greater degree of flexibility is in order.<br><br>Valquiss <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=992.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=992.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=992.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=992.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=992.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=992.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
