<br>
I met this guy at work. Who is also married. We got along famously, right off the bat. So we all started to hang out, as couples, going to parties, camping and what not. No biggie, it was cool. A new friend.<br>
<br>
Then the flirting started. First in e-mail, then in person. And he was everything that I kinda was missing in my married life. Yes, the passion had died some after 5 years, and it was nice to feel desired again by a very intelligent, smooth, witty..and let's face it, downright sexy man...and not the usual stupid bar-type a-hole. And come on! Flirting is fun! It's a nice witty banter...who can play the best game. <br>
<br>
So it got to the point where we both said to each other 'listen, this is all in fun, right? I mean, we're both happily married, and cannot go anywhere.' Which was fine and good. Boundaries were drawn, let the games continue.<br>
<br>
And my husband would go away for a weekend, and my new friend and I would go out to coffee or a party and just hang out. Often to witness the sun come up as we talked about Marx and Engles, art, religion, whatnot. I ADORE those nights. My husband and I never really did that...he conks out usually by 1 or so. <br>
<br>
So I went into work yesterday, and he wasn't there. And it bothered me. I felt...empty.<br>
<br>
Today we had an e-mail session of how much we enjoy each others company...<br>
<br>
So I went home and sat there and thought. And here is my conclusion. When I wake up in the morning, I can't wait to get to work to see him. When I get there, I can't wait to get to my Outlook. When he looks at me, I melt. I feel like I'm being torn in two, like I'm suffocating. When he sits across from me and talks, i feel like i'll die if he doesn't reach over and touch me, my leg, my arm, toussle my hair, whatever...<br>
<br>
I'm dying over here. I love my husband to death...I meant all the vows I said and promises whispered and my heart breaks to think of hurting him. But my Friend makes me feel so alive...so vibrant...so sexy and wanted and smart and interesting. I tell myself that I have a crush, and that it'll pass....<br>
<br>
I don't know what to do. Helllllllp! And thanks.... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/266009/Katriani.jpg" style="height:289;width:225;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3662<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/9/03 7:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1906.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, So I need advice...(long)</span><hr size=1> If you do still love your husband... why not be honest with him?<br>
<br>
Tell him that you're not getting everything that you need out of your marriage and if things continue the way they are there's the possibility you won't be around in the long run.<br>
<br>
Ask him if he'd be willing to set aside some time to go out on dates w/ you, and treat them as actual dates.<br>
<br>
All the time you're spending out with this guy wishing your home life was like that could just as easily be spent with your husband making your home life like that.<br>
<br>
But yeah, anyways, definately go out on dates.  You won't reconnect like that in front of the TV with dirty dishes waitin.  Pretend company is in town and you have to think up some fun things to do, and then go do them.  The zoo, botanical gardens, just wander around downtown, whatever.<br>
<br>
If your husband loves you back I imagine he'd make the time available.<br>

I would add that you consider distancing yourself from your friend (as difficult as that may be) especially if you are going to attempt to rejuvenate your marriage.  Unfortunately, you can’t have your cake and eat it too – you’ll have to decide if you love your husband enough to put “Mr. Ooh-la-la” on the back burner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.knology.net/~ahnmei/savepoint.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm an Asshat lady. <br>

How does he treat her? Does he give you more attention than her? I can't help but wonder if he's giving you the spotlight and neglecting his own wife. Red flag. <br>
<br>
Flirting is fun and can be a monsterous turn on, but I agree with Syll...be honest with your husband and let him know you're not satisfied. I also agree that you should distance yourself a bit from your friend before you find yourself having an affair. I only say that because you seem eager for his affection.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.knology.net/~ahnmei/savepoint.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/9/03 8:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurley>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1125<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/9/03 9:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1906.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, So I need advice...(long)</span><hr size=1> Syll's advice is very on the money.<br>
<br>
There is a VERY common misconception about love, namely that it is this feeling that should constantly tickle your senses and fill your stomach with butterflies.<br>
<br>
Love is a choice, not merely a feeling.<br>
<br>
When your child does something annoying or frustrating, the emotion(s) of anger and/or frustration might surge up and overwhelm the &quot;emotional&quot; feeling of love.  That is where you must choose to love your child and conduct yourself appropriately.<br>
<br>
This is the same for a spouse/partner.  After &quot;a while&quot;, everyone becomes human and &quot;less fascinating&quot;.  Likewise the level of comfort that develops between people over time diminishes the necessity for &quot;finding something interesting to talk about&quot; or trying to impress someone.  Accordingly, you will almost always find someone who is &quot;more attractive&quot; or &quot;more interesting&quot; or &quot;more stimulating&quot; than your spouse.  Always.  That's just the way human brains work.  The mythological state of being where you &quot;only have eyes for your spouse&quot; is exactly that, a myth.  <br>
<br>
People interact and in the process of interacting there are a number of fairly predictable responses, and feeling attraction to another person is merely part of that process.  However feeling attraction and conciously acting upon it are two entirely different things.<br>
<br>
While there are physiological and neurological unconcious behaviors associated with &quot;love&quot;, the most important are the concious behaviors that true love requires.  It is difficult to accept this truth about love, because it requires work and requires a person to suppress desires that might feel &quot;right&quot; or &quot;natural&quot;.  However if you follow those desires to their most likely conclusion, pursuing those feelings with someone who is not your spouse, is an act of choosing not to love your spouse.<br>
<br>
Now, you can either accept or object my arguement above, however the simplest way of understanding how this behavior is a clear act of choosing not to love someone who you've pledged vows to, is to consider how you would feel if you came to know that your husband has had feelings for, and pursued these feelings with, another woman.<br>
<br>
So in short, choose to love your spouse and talk with him about what you feel is missing.  Anything less is a disservice to your husband, yourself, and the concept of marriage.<br>

It's not how he treats you, it's how he treats his wife.  Face it, relationships are always intense, fun, and romantic in the beginning.  I'd assume that your own relationship with your current husband was much the same.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with you for wanting some of that back.  But take a look at yourself.  I'd also wager that you have stopped doing many things that made him initially so attracted to you in the first place.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am out of line by saying that, but it is what I observe in most other relationships.  <br>
<br>
I hope you will take the fact that this new guy is sexy completely out of the equation though.<br>
<br>
Ok, so.  My advice.  I second that you need to stop seeing this man outside of work.  To say that any human is immune to temptation is folly.  People can be subject to temptation, and be partially innocent for their ensuing actions.  HOWEVER.  You have COMPLETE control over whether or not the situations conductive to that temptation ever occur.  Bad things are happening with this guy, get away from him.  If you both love your respective spouse, and continue to see eachother, you'll end up hurting 4 people.<br>

My &quot;friend&quot; would sleep with anyone if given half a chance and I still don't know why his wife hasn't divorced him yet. Are you sure this isn't the same kind of thing here? <br>
<br>
Flirting is fun. It helps build confidence in both people...but it's also dangerous. Most married people no longer flirt with each other, because they don't need to. People spend most of their single adult life looking for a partner and flirting is a way to let someone else know you are interested. If it's gone on this long and you feel this way, your marriage is probably already over. The only thing left is the small details and they will rip your heart apart. <br>
<br>
Get marriage counseling, now. If your husband doesn't want to go, go alone. Anyone who has ever gone through a divorce can tell you how hard it can be. It rips your own self-identity apart because after awhile your identity is entwined with that of your partner. If you think you can handle the emotional pain and being alone, then by all means, continue with what you are doing. Just realize that if he's flirting with you, he's probably flirting with someone else and the way he's treating his wife, will be the same way he'll treat you.<br>
<br>
I guess my advice is that you're makeing a big mistake!<br>

<br>
If you want this for your relationship .. your marriage, I can tell you you need to look for it in your own home.. your own relationship.  Dont look outside to try and fix your marriage excitment issues, work on them with your spouse.  <br>
<br>
Dont be overly pushy yet dont just let it go either.  You both have needs, and I can almost guarentee that if you feel this way he probably does also to some degree.  <br>
<br>
Work on your relationship and yes you can have excitment in your relationship even after many years.  <br>
<br>
It took a very tramatic experience for me to see this, but let me tell you after 13 years with my wife, It is feeling like our first few years again, it takes some work but it is definatly worth it.  Esp if you love your husband.<br>
<br>
talk with the other guy and let him know how you feel and that you would like to stop the *innocent fun* because it is making you feel uncomfortable.  Dont just stop seeing and talking to him otherwise he may double his efforts to get your attention.  If after explaining your situation to him if he keeps up with the flirting and stuff then you know exactly what it is he is after, then it becomes sexual harassment.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you some.  <br>

<br>
I dunno about you, but some men feel that a married woman is the best kind of woman to have an affair with because there's no danger of it runining their own marriage because you're both married.<br>
<br>
Guy should be focusing the attention he focuses on you, on his wife -- and you need to get some marriage counsling with your hubby if you want to rejuvinate your marriage.<br>
<br>
Put as much distance between you and the fellow as possible.<br>

<br>
Many of them are right.  I have been married for almost 8 years...got 3 kids...  The Honeymoon was over a while ago...but we still love each other.  Not like when we first met which is that 'mythical&quot; time.  But actually a deeper and more meaningful type of love.  It takes work.  It isnt always perfect.  For example...I started writing red hearts on the calander...lol...those are &quot;No EQ...No kids... No Excuses ulness your sick&quot; nights of Romance...and I put an exclamation mark on 1 night a week which is the &quot;Do something extra <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot; night....<br>
<br>
Everyone is right who is pointing at your hubby to focus your efforts on...<br>
<br>
But there is one other point...<br>
<br>
NEVER....EVER.... poop in your own backyard.<br>
<br>
Never date someone from work...never start up a relationship like this.  For this situation to move to something meaningful and wonderful would take so many catastrophic and wonderful things to occur for it all to work out well....the odds are against it.  You leave your hubby....he leaves his wife....are there kids?  what would your boss say?  the coorporate rules? your family...your hubbies fam....this guys fam...all your friends....etcetc...<br>
<br>
and when it doesnt work out.... eegads...what have you left... <br>
<br>
he is still there....people talking...scandle...irritated boss...etcetc...<br>
<br>
Bad idea.  All around.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

<br>
It might be that this guy-friend feels exactly the same as you do at this point about your relationship with him versus his relationship with his wife.  You said that you'd talked in the past about how this should just be a friendship and not mess up your marriages, and set boundaries.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's simply time for another talk, to redraw those boundaries to be a little more strict.  That would be the sane first option to me.  I honestly feel that unless the temptation is very great, trying to avoid this person - who's a friend of yours and your husbands, and I'm assuming you're also friendly with his spouse as well - will make matters more strained.<br>
<br>
Besides, if you try to turn your energies back into your own marriage and away from the fun flirting, the issue might take care of itself.  As someone who's still in a &quot;dating&quot; relationship (we're long term, but long distance also, which makes it very much like dating all the time) I'm blessed/cursed with a relationship that's exciting almost all the time we're physically together (limited as it is) because we're always thinking in terms of doing things with one another rather than doing the dishes - those get done in tears after the other has left.<br>
<br>
But the general idea still applies to your interactions with your husband.  Pick a night and do something fun - it doesn't have to expensive, nor does it have to be cheesy.  It could just be going for a drive, going window shopping, walking around town or your neighborhood.  That doesn't necessarily bring you closer together by itself...but it's not a bad start.<br>

So I'll put it like this...<br>
<br>
No-one ever got burned if they stayed away from the fire. The warmth is really great, but the burning hurts. this advice is too late for now, but save it for the future. It is so easy to get caught up and it's so natural to crave what you don't have.<br>
<br>
So seldom does the lure pay off with the pleasure that it's not worth considering.<br>
<br>
You know what you have already is better than the promise. Remind yourself daily. Tell that to your 'friend'. If he is a friend, he will respect your desires beyond his own.<br>
<br>
How honest can you be with your husband? My wife and I can talk about our weaknesses and help each other out.<br>
<br>
Close your eyes. Picture your husband as you first dated him. Now open your eyes and treat him like you first treated him. Betcha He'll respond in kind.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>
