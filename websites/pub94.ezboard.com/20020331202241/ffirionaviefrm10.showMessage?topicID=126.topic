  “Lunge, parry, thrust, kick, parry, lunge, parry, kick, thrust, parry.”<br>
<br>
  The drill sergeant’s voice rang out, loudly, clearly, and exactly in time with his rough barking was the clang of metal on metal.  The drill sergeant wheeled around just in time to see a young dwarf hit the ground.<br>
<br>
  “Up maggot!” The voice boomed over the chuckles.  The dwarf was smaller and younger than the rest, starting the school early because he showed promise.  Quickly advanced, he was now in a room full of much older recruits, and the physical tests were getting more and more vigorous.  He wondered how much his young body could take; he definitely wasn’t as strong as the others.  In sparring he got away with it due to his quickness, but in drills that was no help to him.  Sighing softly he got back up and resumed the battle position.  <br>
<br>
  The sergeant smiled softly under his helm, ‘this one certainly shows much promise, and determination.  He will go on to do great things.  It’s too bad that my job requires me to try and break him.’<br>
<br>
  Wheeling around again, the sergeant hollered, “Kordaaf, to the front.”  The young dwarf quickly hurried to the front of the training room.  “Prepare yourself.”  They touched weapons as the sergeant’s assistant began to call out the orders.  The young dwarf struggled against the veteran’s power, but he stood his ground.  Blood, sweat, tears, pain; nothing could quell his desire for greatness.<br>
<br>
  “Lunge, kick, parry, thrust, lunge, lunge, parry, kick, parry.”<br>

They’d both had a couple drinks earlier, and weakened minds led to loosened tongues.  They laid there in bed, just talking, for hours.  They talked of relationships, shared drinking stories, and pondered the universe, all the while in each other’s arms.  <br>
<br>
        They both knew she was already in a relationship, and she knew he wouldn’t do anything to endanger it.  So they just laid there, talking, and holding each other.  All in all it was a good night, until she turned to him, looked into his eyes and whispered, “If I hadn’t of met the love of my life, we’d be together.”  A flash of light seared his brain as he heard those words. “Thanks,” was his simple response, but his mind ached, over and over again, ‘Why did she tell me that?  She knows I really like her.’  That small, simple word echoed over and over again in his head, “Why, why, why?  Is she trying to send me a signal, trying to tell me something?  Why did she say that? Why, why?”  They spend the night in each other’s arms, bodies wrapped around each other, but they’re lips never met.<br>
<br>
        They stayed up and watched the sunrise, and the snow gently fall.  They talked about everything imaginable, and things felt more right than they ever had before.  She had things to attend to, so she left for a while, but plans were made to get together at another point soon.  They randomly passed each other in the city sometimes, and would stop and chat for a little while, and they often corresponded with notes when they other couldn’t be found, but things needed to be said.<br>
<br>
        The last of these notes is one of particular interest, as it would define what would come to be between the two of them.  The argument went back and forth; as he tried to get her to admit to the feelings for him that he knew she had.  But it was not to be, even if she had those feelings, she was refusing to act on them.  He asked her if she thought there was anything better out there, someone else who could make her happier.  Her response finally made him give up.  “What’s it matter if I’m happy with what I have now? Sure there may be something better out there, but I’m happy with what I have now.”<br>
<br>
        He felt the emotions start to flow, and thoughts shot through his head like arrows from all directions.  Then everything simply stopped, and he felt like there was an empty place inside his soul.  Sadness overcame him, and he cried himself to sleep.<br>
<br>
        He woke up late in the evening the day after that.  He was still soaking with sadness, and things looked even worse than they had before.  He spent many hours that day thinking about her, and everything that happened, and why she wouldn’t take the chance.  Just before he went to bed that night, he simply gave up, and said to himself that somehow he would move on, he had to.  There was nothing left to do that could possibly change this situation.  He would move on, there would be another, some time down the road.  And this night, he went to sleep with a smile.<br>

Hurt, betrayed, vulnerable, open, distraught, painful, alone.  It had been a long time, finally things looked like they were turning around, taking a different path, the potential was overwhelming, and things looked so promising.  Where did it all go wrong?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stayed over again last night.  After the infamous note, she didn’t consider the conversation ended, and thought there was more to be done and said before it was finished.  Naturally, he acquiesced, seeing this as a second chance, that maybe she’d thought about what he had said, and come to accept that there was something between the two, and that there was nothing to be afraid about, and that it would be amazing.  So much for that…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again, we had some drinks, but this only helped the conversation.  For once the liquor starts to flow, she becomes very open, and he became brutally honest, the perfect qualities for a conversation of that magnitude.  Again the talked for hours, but this time it was different, they focused on the two of them this time.  And they tried to figure out what was going on, and what could be done.  Looking back, things never really were in his favor since the very beginning, such a tragedy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At one point, they were sitting there together, just looking into each other’s eyes, and she asked him what he was thinking.  He took his time, wanting the answer to not be misinterpreted in any way.  And then, after maybe a minute or two, he looked back into her eyes, and said “I know you have a boyfriend, and things in life are really difficult for you right now, but, I just…I,” and he paused as nervousness overcame him, but there was a softness, a gentle glow in her eyes, and he knew it would all be ok.  “I really, really want to kiss you right now.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She sat for a second, before she responded, “Please don’t.”  And again, that haunting dreadful word, “Why not?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Cause, it’ll only make things really complicated.  And it will hurt my boyfriend, which will hurt me.”  And at that point she pulled him close to her, maybe cause she needed someone to hold, or maybe to make sure he couldn’t kiss her, he never understood women and why they did things, so he had no idea.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You didn’t say that you didn’t want me to though, do you?”  Silence.  She pulled him tighter, and he felt her head moving back and forth.  “Is that a no?”  And she simply shook her head again.  They held each other like that for a while.  And then slowly, they pulled away, and starting talking about other things, but the biggest revelations were yet to come that night.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Later on, lying in bed, they were talking about since she’d come here, the majority of her beliefs, and morals, and ideas, had been severely challenged.  He wanted to help her with that, and told her that he could only help her as much as she would let him, and the closer she let him get, the more he could help her through all of this.  But, she thought the only difference between friend and relationship, was a different level of trust, and that was why she considered this to an unorthodox friendship, cause everything between them was on the relationship level, but they were still friends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And finally, for the first time in his life, he spoke up at this point.  “You know, that’s not really fair to me.  You have a boyfriend back home, and you have me here, where you get all the benefits of being in a relationship, without actually having a relationship.  And that’s not fair to me, not at all.”  And she agreed with him, and then he held her while she cried.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She spent the night again.  And in the morning, he got up and went to church with her, because that was an important part of who she was, and he wanted to learn everything possible.  Then they went their separate ways, and another set of notes showed up that evening.  How this could not be the last ones, he did not know.<br>

It wasn’t until he put the glass down that he saw the note.  He sighed, and knew it was from her, but he had no idea what or how to feel at that time, it could say so many things, the spectrum ranged fully.  No use just staring at it, only one way to figure out what it said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It could be recounted everything that was felt as each reply arrived fresh and new, but for brevity sake, the entire contents of the note shall be divulged at this time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You don’t ever stop thinking do you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, never, especially when it comes to something as important as you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You shouldn’t….”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It’s not my fault, it’s who I am.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And you’re not going to win, that’s who I am.  Remember we went over this last night.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know, believe me I’m aware of both of those facts.  But when I stop trying is when I believe it will never happen, and just thinking that hurts.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m sorry.  I hate hurting you.  I’m trying to make this as painless as possible, but I’m also trying to get my point across.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It can’t be painless, my feelings for you guarantee that.  I’m also trying to get a point across, one that I’m not sure how open you are to accepting.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Accepting that I’m “wrong” hell most people aren’t open to that.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m not trying to say that, and if it’s coming across that way I apologize.    I'm trying to say that there's a lot of the world out there that you haven't experienced yet, and maybe once you do, your thoughts about some things will change”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I know that, I did that, I learned my lesson and I'm happy right now”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, if that's what you think, I don't suppose there's much of a point of me even trying anymore”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That's what I've trying to say since I was flat out with you in the first place.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, then you got your point across, it's over, I give up, you win. Congratulations.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He simply ripped up the next response.  He’d had it, why couldn’t she simply see?  She thought about life with him, she liked him, she trusted him as if they were going out.  ‘Why couldn’t she simply see that’s the way it should be?  Why couldn’t she?  Why?  Why?  Why?’  No matter now, he was done with her, he was tired of her games, tired of being led around, tired of her lying to herself, tired of “playing boyfriend,” tired of all of it.  No more, no more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That night he went to bed, and everything was different.  The bed was colder, and for some reason it felt empty, lonely there by himself.  He took up his quill and ink, and for the first time in years, the poetry flowed from him.  He wrote of feelings, of thoughts, of love, of want, of need, of her.  The final product amazed him, he read through it again, and not a word needed changing.  Even during the times when he wrote daily, nothing matched this.  He signed his name across the bottom, and waited until the next time he would see her.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>

All happy and cheery, said he had a message for me.  I told him that I frankly didn't want it, unless she had the strength to come and say to my face what she wanted me to hear, I didn't want to hear it at all.  But the bard was adamant, and simply started to read the letter aloud, and once he heard his name, he couldn’t help but listen.<br>
<br>
Kordaaf,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hate feeling like an asshole.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I understand completely everything you’ve said.  I can sympathize with all of it.  I’ve been in your situation before, actually not too long ago.  I understand that at times it seems like the only thing you can think about, and it’s depressing because you can’t do anything about it.  I know what it’s like to be powerless over a situation.  It’s confusing and it hurts like hell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That’s why I hate to be doing this to you.  I value your friendship and I specifically hoped, and prayed, that it wouldn’t get to where it is.  I didn’t want to be a source of pain for you.  And I’m sorry that’s what I’ve become.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But it doesn’t change my feelings toward my situation right now.  I’ve found everything I’m looking for, and by your definition that makes it perfect.  Yes, I understand that there are other things out there.  I understand that there’s the good and the bad to deal with.  I understand that my decisions earlier led me to the bad.  I understand that you’re trying to lead me to the good.  I know all this.  I get it, but it doesn’t change anything because I’m not looking for anything other than what I have.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I love you as a friend.  You’re one of the very few people I’ve let get close to me.  It doesn’t happen often.  I understand you’re quite unhappy with me at the moment and will likely be unhappy with me for a long time.  I’m willing to accept that.  But, I’m not going to treat you any differently than I do now.  I wan this friendship t last, even if it has to take a little hiatus.  The ball is in your court now.  I’ve said my piece and you know where I stand.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still love you,<br>

He read it over and over, thought about what it meant, what she was trying to say, and how he could possibly respond.  It was truly over.  Nothing more could be said or done to change that, it was over.<br>
He ran across her at random points, mostly just exchanging a smile, or waving hi.  He didn’t speak to her anymore, cause he simply didn’t know what to say.  He still wanted to be friends with her, she was amazing, and he enjoyed spending time with her more than he liked doing anything else.  But it was so hard to spend time with her, wanting it to be more than what it was.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day she cornered him, and forced him into a conversation.  And they talked about a lot of stuff, the normal chitchat conversation starters that everyone does so as to make the conversation more comfortable.  Slowly, the topic wound its way to be about them, and the way things were between them.  He sensed a chance here, there could be an opportunity to resurrect everything, and to bring about the relationship that should be.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You know,” he casually mentioned, “we’ll always have questions about the two of us and what could have been.  There’s one way to answer those questions right here and right now.  A simple kiss would solve all the problems.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve been down that route before,” she turned and answered. “And it didn’t work out prettily.  Besides, I don’t have any questions, and I don’t wonder anymore.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He reeled from that last statement, and felt his heart drop out of him.  Not even a week ago, she had questioned everything she knew, wondered if what she had was as great as she thought, and dreamt about life with him.  How could that have changed so quickly?  How?  It just wasn’t possible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I love you, as deeply as one person can love another, but strictly in a plutonic way.  I don’t think about life with you anymore.  I don’t know why it stopped, but it did.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The world was going dizzy, everything was spinning, and he couldn’t breathe.  Why did she affect him like this?  Could it be possible?  He had never been with her, admittedly they’d shared a bed, twice now, but nothing more than cuddling had ever happened.  They had talked a lot, and shared small pieces of their soul, and the more he learned, the more engrossed with her he became, and wanted to know every and anything about her.  Could it be?  Could he be falling in love with this girl, and not even realizing it?  He truly hoped not, another heartbreak like that would destroy him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day she wasn’t in the market, but a flame from his past was.  She quickly recognized him and ran up to him, hugging him, and kissing his cheek.  She pulled back, and he looked in her eyes, and saw comfort, saw love, saw home.  They went to a local tavern and drank and talked about the old days until early in the morning, when she went home with him.  In the morning, she got up early and left.  When he awoke, she had just returned, and moved her stuff back in.  Once again they were together, and he smiled, pulled her over to him, and fell back asleep.  Comfortable, safe, and happy in her arms.<br>
