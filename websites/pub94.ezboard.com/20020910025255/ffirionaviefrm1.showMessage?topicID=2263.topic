My latest character has reached level 7, and I've grown slightly attached... <br>
<br>
But I upgraded to Luclin, and now I can play Vah Shir. And beastlords. And I've wanted to play one forever. <br>
<br>
I have the feeling I'll really enjoy the class -- I like hybrids, and adore pet classes. <br>
<br>
How is the Vah Shir population on this server? Is there a glut of Vah Shir beastlords, because of the same reasons I want to play one? <br>
<br>
(much apologies if there was a &quot;how is the kitty culture&quot; thread previously -- I didn't spot it, but I gots bad eyes.)<br>

The population of the Shar Vahl/Shadeweaver's Thicket area is low, with an average of about 15 during primetime in the thicket to around 8 or 10 in the city. The quests for newbie cats are very good too. The biggest drawback that I found was a decent cash supply. I just never could acumulate any! LOL  Granted as a Dar Khura, I had to buy spells every 5 levels or so, and that does take quite a dent out of any nest egg. <br>
<br>
The experience is great up in that area too. Once you reach a level that you can enter Paludial Caverns, you will zoom through levels especially as a BL. <br>
<br>
I only return now to collect spells and visit friends up there, but it's a great place to start out. <br>

He will go solo with our kitten all the time.  They tend to get the best xp that way.  Our kitten also kicks some major tush.  I can hardly wait until our kitten is older, I have promised her a pet wolf.  <br>
<br>
The one pet peeve I have about first time Vah Shir is... those that don't read a damned thing about the zones they will be in or the quests they will be doing.  There are also the people that try to con me into taking them from Luclin to Norrath because they &quot;don't like Luclin&quot;.  Well... if you don't like it don't make the character.  *shrug*  <br>
<br>
I really like my Shaman Vah Shir.  It is a less populated area until you get to Paludal and higher.  That's when other people have direct access to the areas from the Nexus, but sometimes it's nicer to have less people than the ton and a half of Gfay and so on.<br>
<br>
I like my Vah Shir so much I've neglected all the characters I have on other servers.  Helps that I was the first Shaman in the Guild and therefor became the General over Shamen.<br>
<br>
Only other real problem with Luclin... can't port to different Luclin zones... *shrugs* but I guess that's because we can't be druids or mages.  Oh well.  <br>

<br>
The biggest thing that folks don't get is that the balance on those zones is different. Greater Faydark is a &quot;hunt and get stuff to sell and buy what you need&quot; newbie zone. Shar Vahl and Shadeweaver's Thicket are a &quot;hunt and get things for quests&quot; zone. You can fully equip yourself VERY nicely off quests there.<br>
<br>
Plan on doing the quests. Not just your guild quest - all of them. There are a huge number of lowbie quests that get you vital stuff, and if you aren't doing them you are gonna be broke because you won't have the cash to afford to buy the same stuff. You can have a nearly full set of armor by level 4 or 5, along with magic weapons and shields and jewelry and containers - just from simple quests.<br>
<br>
Alot of the quest stuff is probably TLC'd here, but everything on the regular servers is no-drop - so hopefully it all balances out.<br>

The last one is broken (you get an enchanter spell, instead of the one you are supposed to get), but the rest of the quest is working.<br>
<br>
Questing for cash hints:<br>
<br>
The whiptail scorpion gland quest gets you a piece of padded armor (worth a couple of gold each) for each gland. The runtling tongue and worm meat quests get you occasional random items (practice weapons and tattered armor) worth a gold or two, also.<br>
<br>
Out in the thicket, the shaded hopperhide sells well, once you make a set for yourself, of course. There are plenty of assorted hopperhides to make armor and bags with (for self and sale) from the hoppers, and if you just eat all the chunks of meat you are gonna get, you won't need much food. The loda kai drop chain armor that sells for a couple of plat each. Gor taku drop alot of backpacks.<br>
<br>
You can also collect ground-spawn fruit, get them turned into nectar, and sell the nectar - if you just need a bit of emergency cash. And don't forget fishing - the best darn hobby for every newbie (especially one that needs to eat a heck of alot).<br>

<br>
Shar Vahl is lovely, even if it took me ten minutes to find my way out of the castle. Safe fall is a riot -- I jumped off of every balcony I could find. Love that first quest for citizenship -- do a quest, gain a level! <br>
<br>
Luclin is ungodly dark, though, isn't it? Thankfully a passing grizzly bear cast ultravision on me while I got my bearings... (no pun intended...)<br>
<br>
Question though -- maybe specifically to Ellywig, for reasons that will be obvious: <br>
<br>
Because Shar Vahl is so isolated, and allows for such independence for a character because of quests (love the quests!), and because the beastlord with pet is rather independent as well, would I be better off saving my beastlord for Test server (which I've been meaning to try out as well) and sticking to more populated areas for FV? I've just got a ton of character ideas pingponging around in my head and I'm being a committophobe... <br>
<br>
Thanks all for your replies!<br>

Bastus<br>

&quot;Bastus, when first met, appears to be a mute -- he stares, licks his fangs, paces, says nothing. He is actually very well read and spent his early years debating philosophy with Vah Shir fifty years his senior... it has been suggested, in fact, that Bastus spoke so much as a youngster that he has become disenchanted, even infuriated, with language itself. But if you scratch that spot behind his year, he'll regail you with poetry worthy of a bard...&quot; <br>

<br>
Now, I imagine beastlord is still probably the most popular class among new Vah Shir, but there shouldn't be the abundance of them that there once was.<br>
<br>
Also, I made a lot of my early spell money by picking the ground spawn mushrooms in Paludal. They sell for several gold apiece and are pretty fast spawns, about 10 minutes if memory serves. (These might be nodrop on regular servers, I don't know)<br>
