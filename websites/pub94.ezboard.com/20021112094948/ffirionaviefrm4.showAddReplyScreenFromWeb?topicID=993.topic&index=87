To bully or be malicous you have to have intent on a personal level. Asouls barely aknowledge the existance of reputable players, so I doubt there was any personal attack here. It was just a greedy and unacceptable refusal to wait thier turn. The same shoolyard trash they're used to in real life no doubt. It is not the norm here on FV, and condoning this behaviour is a complete sell out. I can't speak for everyone, but personally I'm not at a risk for ulcers simply by observing these creeps and standing up to be counted as one who will not polute this server like that.  <p><CENTER>

But, I have a hunch confrontation is something he enjoys and is partly why he makes such outlandishly stupid remarks.<br>
<br>
As for AS(S), there is nothing here which makes what they did right, morally.  Legal? Sure, but there are tons of legal things people do which are not moral.  Plain and simple, they have no morals or respect with regards to the FV community.<br>

<br>
Folks, lets lay off Awakened Souls. I am not argueing that what they did was questionable. But lets step back and take a deep breath.<br>
<br>
Awakened Souls should have gotten the message by now. Xar, the guild leader really does not like the drama surrounding his guild on these boards and really wants to just get along with everyone. That way he and his guild can go about enjoying this game just like the rest of us.<br>
<br>
These guys in Awakened Souls have levelled pretty quick and pretty much kept to themselves. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that if thats how they want to play. But because of that they may not be completely aware of FV's social environement. They could have thought that FV was just like all the other servers and reacted accordingly.<br>
<br>
Lets wait and see what happens next time? Our guild zoned into ToV and found AS already there hunting. We exchanged some friendly shouts, a conversation broke out in, um, dutch I think (might have been german) and both guilds were there for a bit and everyone was just ducky. Instead of constantly attacking these guys, lets try encouraging them to become part of FV's community. I know Xar or someone in AS posted that they didnt want to be part of the FV community, but I think that might be because they think FV is &quot;just another blue server&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyways, all I am really trying to say here is if we keep flaming them and /rude'ing them everytime we see them we shouldn't expect them to react any differently. If we make an effort to include them in our community and encourage them to take on the practices of similar guilds on our server then perhaps they will. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

But as I understand it, player of Sydia used to be player of Tori, who was a cleric on this server long before their guild was formed, even belonged to a role-playing guild which she left.  There are members of the guild who used to be in a variety of RP guilds on this server.   Jaxy was a member of the Intrepidity guild that merged with AS, though she subsequently left it.<br>
<br>
Discussions I had with members of AS in their first days on this server indicated that they know exactly what server they're on, that a core of them came here from another server to exploit low server population and the non no-drop items, and they have enough folks who were here long enough to understand the rest of this server and its population.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming at you, I just question whether they even have a basic desire to work with or get along with anyone that they don't need something from, particularly anyone who isn't as strong as themselves as a guild.<br>
<br>
Controversy regarding ASs has reared its ugly head within the past 48 hours, over an issue which I'm still gathering data about.  Next time has already happened.<br>
<br>
I've personally had my own direct experiences with camp encroaching, general rudeness from a variety of ASs' members, training, not respecting areas they're passing through, . . . a whole list, from my personal experience, nevermind the stories from people I know and trust.<br>
<br>
I don't intend to fight fire with fire, I don't intend to become like them in order to cope with them, I don't want to be dragged down to their level of behavior in order to be successful on this server.  On the other hand, I don't intend to help them, ask help from them, and I won't buy/sell/trade with them (actually effective for a couple of weeks now).<br>
<br>
I've tried talking to a few of them a couple of times, trying to find the right words or concepts to express my opinion on the golden rule, but it's been like talking to a wall.  The leadership doesn't listen or seem to care, and the general members say that it's guild politics and policies and go talk to the leadership if there's a problem.  At some point, people have to take responsibility for their actions and the actions of the group which they're a part of.<br>
<br>
You have a point about people behaving like what you expect them to, and compassion is always one of the noblest of virtues.  But what do you do, when you keep trying to express positive attitudes and putting energy into something and folks don't respond, or continue to respond negatively?  How much investment in my time, your time, everyone's time, do we need to put forth in hopes that one day it will let up?   There is tolerance and compassion yes, but there comes a time when you have to say &quot;bad behavior won't be tolerated&quot;.<br>
<br>
Enough for now.<br>

If the situation were reversed and another party was there first but was waiting on the last reinforcements, Blayze is the kind of person that would have ceded them an amount of time to get those reinforcements together and kill ragefire.  After this incident, he would be a fool to extend that same courtesy now to AS(S).<br>
<br>
Not to rain on your parade Kzan but just because Awakened Souls got along with you guys ok in Temple of Veeshan doesn't prove much to me with respect to them fitting in the EQ community.  <br>
<br>
Based on what I have seen of their actions and posts on these boards, I would disagree with your premise that they are acting this way because they feel it might just be another blue server.  Judging by their original posts introducing the guild and their actions, I would posit that a big motivating factor for them is the fact that this a relatively unspoilt server at the high-end and that they see themselves capable of being a &quot;big dog&quot; if you wil on this server.  It sounds as if many of them came to Firiona Vie for the very reason that a role-play preferred server would have less competition for them amongst powergamers.  In fact, I get the clear impression that they want to bring the &quot;blue server mentality&quot; if you will to Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
I just see it as odd in that I keep hearing that they do not want to a part of the FV community and want to play and enjoy the game in peace.  That is fine and dandy except every player's peace and enjoyment of the game depends on the actions of other players.  If you have no disregard for other players and will use every means available to achieve something so long as it is &quot;legal&quot; under Verant's rules, you are going to step on a lot of toes.  I don't care how self-sufficient you think your guild is, if you are known as the pariah guild that is going to have repurcussions--on your interactions with other guilds (some of whom are more powerful than you) and on your recruiting in general.<br>
<br>
My final point.  Like any bully, Awakened Souls will not step on the toes of the bigger kids (in our example, Fire and Fury and Resolution) until they grow in size that they can appropriately challenge that bigger kid.  Kzan, as a member of a guild currently more powerful than Awakened Souls, you will likely a see a different side from them than members of smaller guilds will.  You mention that things seemed fine and dandy in ToV when you were both there in the same zone.  What are they going to do?  Insult you guys and get you upset at them?  Of course not.  Right now, they don't have the firepower to challenge you guys and any dispute with FnF would turn out ugly for them.<br>
<br>
Just wait a couple months.  When their ranks are swelled with more ebayers and powergamers and are able to challenge you more directly, see if they extend that same courtesy to you.  I am pretty sure that thought has come across members of both FnF and Resolution but I have no way of verifying.<br>

<br>
Are they really trying to bring the blue server mentality here? Or are they just practicing the blue server mentality here because they don't realize there is an alternative?<br>
<br>
If they came to this server thinking they can get to the top quick and take advantage of the no drop rule well, they might be in for some surprises for some of the high end encounters. I have said before and I'll say again the ruleset on FV does not make the high end game easier, infact in some cases it makes it much harder.<br>
<br>
There are alot of open raids on this server and DS is doing alot of stuff these days too.I have no doubt that AS and Reso will start crossing paths very shorty too, competing for the same mobs. There is going to be alot of time for AS to show some good faith on this server. We just have to let them.<br>
<br>
Yes I am saying we should hold out an olive branch, we gotta have some faith in people folks. And besides, if they don't take the olive branch you can always beat them with it... <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

I certainly recall the insulting guild recruiting posts (long since edited) where they expressed their disdain for 'drama queens' and roleplaying in general.<br>
<br>
They've had the benefit of the doubt for quite a while. They have also blatantly posted that they don't want to be part of the FV community. (And then ludicrously told the community that we should be glad their cleric got an epic, since we'd benefit.) They don't seem to mind stepping on toes, and I don't see much indication that there has been a massive change in their us-first-and-damn-the-torpedos outlook. I, personally, plan on taking them at their word and treating them like the social pariahs that they keep telling us they want to be.<br>

Post here, and I'll go on my way and see how it turns out.<br>
<br>
As it is, there's been one response basically saying &quot;we played by Verant's rules, tough luck to you&quot; .. nothing about &quot;we'll give you a chance next time&quot; or &quot;sorry, want our help next time?&quot;<br>
<br>
There's so many things one can do as the leadership to make a guild look a heck of a lot better. Apparently FnF actually puts out a policy to its members saying &quot;help the community, make us look good&quot; ... It works.  i happen to have a lot of respect for FnF and its the first &quot;strongest&quot; guild I can say this about. (Thanks)<br>
<br>
AS has its chance to do the same. But at what point will FnF and Resolution take their strength and fight fire with fire. Yes, it's not diplomatically all that nice, but thing is, that may be the only language AS understands?<br>
<br>
Their REAL solution is to do the right thing. Accept that this is the purple server, and go with the flow.... <br>

<br>
AS(S) knows what server they are on. They know what sort of community we are. Don't fool yourself.  Individual actions notwithstanding, as a guild they have shown themselves to be rude and inconsiderate, blatantly ignoring the spirit of the server they are on.<br>
<br>
There is a positive side to this. As more idiots gain levels, you will likely see them inflating the ranks of AS(S). Expect to see folks like Whosyourdaddy in AS(S). After a while, all of the real idiots and jerks will be in one guild! Much easier to spot that way.<br>
<br>
And I wish there were some way I could stop treating them like renegades, but the fact is that they have put that hat on with no help from me. They have publicly stated that they are not, and have no wish to be, part of the community, and their actions have shown a complete disregard for any other players on this server.<br>
<br>
Kzan, I respect you very much, and think that your posts are almost always well thought. You seem to me to be a thinker, and a good one at that. Open your eyes--AS(S) is kissing the big boys' asses until they don't have to anymore. FnF and Reso are a part of the community that AS(S) has so publicly scorned. Give someone the olive branch aye, give them a chance to redeem themselves, but not after they have made it so abundantly clear that they aren't even going to try.<br>
<br>
They'd better be pretty self-sufficient, because they just lost the goodwill of most of the population of this server. Doesn't seem very &quot;Awakened&quot; to me...<br>
<br>
But then, the name &quot;R00d D00dz&quot; was probably already taken.<br>

When it is within the power of the guild leadership to remove &quot;bad apples&quot;, to show tolerance or acceptance of bad behavior is to bring yourself to that level, regardless of whether you act that way yourself or not.  There are multiple individuals like this in AS, and though some of the good people may say &quot;oh well, yeh they are bad but I can't do anything about it&quot;, it does not excuse the behavior.  AS will always be a guild that is not worthy of respect or decency, because they will always be a guild that walks the line of what is barely tolerable and acceptable but still within the rules, so long as it is of advantage to them.  I really have to wonder how AS would feel if a more powerful guild jumped them every time they were ready to do a major fight, so that they were stuck killing lesser things all the time.   Somehow I doubt FCFS would be such a great thing then, in their minds.  But, after all, &quot;its the rules&quot;. <p><br>Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith, 56th Enforcer of Innoruuk's Word
