She's the embodiment of everything I find attractive about other people: smart, funny, awesome to be around ... and she's not even remotely vain. She's got similar interests, at least as far as I can tell. Plus, she's prettier to me than any celebrity sex symbol could ever be.<br>
<br>
She inspires in me feelings of what I can only imagine to be love. I find myself thinking about her all the time, wondering what she's doing, wondering if she -- unlikely as it may be -- thinks of me too. I lose sleep over it, and what little I do get is filled with memories of the last time I saw her.<br>
<br>
So what is stopping me from putting on my manly charms?<br>
<br>
She's dating a casual friend of mine.<br>
<br>
I am filled with a gnawing agony I couldn't describe even if I knew every single word in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Webster's</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> forward and back. Even if it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>were</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> an option for me and her to become boyfriend / girlfriend, would I even want to? And if I still did, what kind of friend would I be? Not much of one.<br>
<br>
And everytime I glance over and see them making out or with a hand in the other's pants, I want to cry, because it's as if (to borrow from Reznor) God himself is reaching his fucking arm through just to push me down. And everyday when I go home I feel a little more dead inside than I did that morning.<br>
<br>
(Other) friends are noticing my depression, and I can only say &quot;Nothing, I'm fine&quot; so many times before it's not good enough anymore. I'm starting to write letters to her ... well, really, the same letter over and over, each draft ending up in my wastebasket shortly after my pen touches the paper ... but I doubt that's going anywhere good.<br>
<br>
I know it's emotional tripe, and I'll probably get taunted for it, but I don't really have anyone else to talk to, so ... anything you can advise would be appreciated.<br>
<br>

Take up a hobby or sport that has other girls involved, or alternativly go out every friday/saturday night and get sloshed.<br>

Let something grow from normal interactions with an available girl.<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, I think you are going to have to stay away from them as much as possible, because when you see them together, you are going to get angry and jealous. If you see her alone, you are going to just watch her and fall deeper in love.  If you see *him* alone you're probably going to just look at him and smoulder.<br>
<br>
The only thing I think you can do is stay away from them .. I'm sorry to hear that it's affecting you this way .. there's not much to say. I've had my share of crushes and none of them have ever worked out ... <br>
<br>
I know I had a crush on a friend of a friend and it really hurt when I saw him, at any time, because I knew it wouldn't work out - even though I wanted it to.<br>
<br>
I don't know, in your situation, if it could work out ... but I hope it does for you ... in the mean time, don't pine for her too much, even though I know it will be difficult .. I think I still have a picture of the guy I had the crush on when I was in school...<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Love is a powerful thing, that makes us do many strange things. It's hard to hold back your feelings, like I once did. I still regret not telling her. though I never see her, I still remember. You should say something, perhaps this isn't the best of advice, but maybe you should tell her how you feel.<br>
 Have to look at both sides of it though don't ya? Maybe you will ruin things for your friend making it better for you. Maybe you'll ruin things for yourself by losing both. But to have that feeling inside really sucks... if I had the chance to go back, I'm sure I would have told her. If only I had the courage :/<br>

One thing that struck me from your description though, you said she has low self confidence.  My experience has always been that people will low self confidence are Bad News to date.  So, even though it doesn't seem like it now, maybe it's best in the long run.  I strongly believe that you can't truly love another, until you first love yourself - and you can't do that with low self confidence.<br>
<br>
There WILL be another, hard as it seems to believe.<br>

Ok seriously.. this happens a lot. Not to me, because I am the one always chased after (... riight).. but I've seen it happen. They are right. You have to move on. The way I look at it is: If you break them up and she dumps him for you.. whos to say someone else won't come along and she dumps you for him. See what I'm saying? Maybe its a crappy outlook on people, but if she is fiercely loyal to this jaggoff (let's all assume he's the enemy.. because he is) then if things don't work out then maybe if you two start going out she will be as fiercely loyal as you will be.<br>

<br>
First of all change the way you look, make some drastic change like cutting off your long hair into a clean and good cut. Something along those lines, Im sure you can think of something<br>
<br>
Second make sure she sees you in your best element everyonce in a while. Such as before you go out when your looking your absolute best. <br>
<br>
Basically anything that will make her look at you twice is good. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~Gatsu Bloodbourne, Mercenary in the service of Clan Twisted.</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

Stay away from the couple, respect your friend, respect her and learn from the experience.<br>
<br>
If they are having a good time interfering would not only be a selfish move but very disrespectful to the couple and judging from your post you appreciate BOTH of them.<br>

Hope this helps.<br>

3)  Meet them in clubs, supermarkets, malls (malls always fun), book clubs, classes if in school.  Just deal with them as persons, not as targets, and be honest.<br>

I got married when I was 30, to a woman I picked up in an Irish bar her 2nd week in the US.  :-)  We now have 4 kids, and I am still allowed Flirt Level 1.  However, when I was single, it was sacriligeous for me to date only one girl at a time.  That would imply the &quot;C-word&quot;.<br>

Life is supposed to be fun, and challenging.  Don't anguish over a woman or two.<br>

I can definately say I've been on two if not all 3 sides of this type of situation quite a few times if I look back far enough.  The more recent of the situations has an incredably painful anniversary coming up at the end of this week for me.  That for me is a version of the situation going very wrong where the person that it seems was pining after me tried to break up my fiancee and I.  It did end up breaking us up, but more for the fact that my fiancee decided to show his true colours.  Finding out what that person did made him end up on my shit list.<br>
<br>
There's one person that still tugs painfully at my heart strings, but that's part of because he was the unattainable person and I had unfortunately written the letters you spoke about and actually sent them.  That ended up in a good deal of hurt until I decided that he was indeed unattainable and moved on.  It hurt.  It hurt for a very long time, but that's because I let it hurt me.  I held on to it because I didn't want to believe that there was no possible way to acquire this person that I found to be almost exactly what I wanted.<br>
<br>
If you are meant to acquire the girl, I would personally say to back off and let fate do it's job.  It hurts, I know it, but who knows... fate could bring you someone else that is better when you least expect it.  It only hurts you to continue with the torture you are putting yourself through being around them together.  <br>
<br>
Like another person said up there previously, if you need someone to talk to send me a /tell or a ;tell if I'm not in game as I have EQIM on while I'm doing work.  I've had about 4 years of training in just listening and I know how helpful it can be to have someone to just spill everything to like your post is doing.<br>

It will be hard but most people need a motivation to break up with someone. Either no love, like someone else, not fulfilling or whatever. If you are a strong friend and she sees you for what you are, if there is some attraction there it will eventually come out. A big deal is made about being the &quot;rebound guy&quot;, but that's BS and if it ends up that way, well at least you found out what it was like to date that person.<br>
<br>
Trying to talk to them about it or break them up will just make them both hate you. If you don't mind, it might be something to get it out of your system, but if you ever want to associate with either of them again, I wouldn't recommed it.<br>
<br>
What about sending her some flowers as an annonymous gift? Just say they are from someone who cares for her but not the one she is dating. If things start to go downhill in their relationship, she will already have the knowledge that there is someone else out there for her - hence motivation to break up. <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>

<br>
The best thing to do that I've found is to stay occupied with other things.  Stay away from your friend &amp; the girl...  Meet other people, do other things &amp; make different friends.  Keep yourself occupied.<br>
<br>
After you have given yourself some time away from them, you will be able to view this from a distance &amp; without most of the emotions tied up into it.  It will allow you to logically view it instead of emotionally.<br>
<br>
By staying near them, you are just hurting yourself.  If you try to do anything about it, then you will just be hurting them, &amp; from which the way you sound will just cause you hurt all over again.<br>
<br>
Good luck my friend. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kaldesh &amp; Scorch<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

You need to talk to her, To tell her the way you feel, Or If you do move on you are always gona look back on the situation and say &quot; I wish I would have at least said something to her&quot;.<br>
<br>
You have to say something to her in how you feel, If your friend is a really good friend and you dont want to interfere maybe its best just to say &quot; I think you are really cool, and I like you alot as a person&quot; and if nothing romanticly can come of it, and she is as good person you say she is, then maybe just having her as a friend will be enough to make you feel comfortable enough to move on to search for another. If you arent able just to be friends with her, then take the others advice and seperate yourself from the situation until you can get it out your mind. Time and Pain heals. If you seperate yourself you will be able to recover. But you have to at least say something or it will forever haunt you in one way or the other.<br>
<br>
Not saying anything will eat you up inside, if you dont tell her the whole story, tell her something, or you will regret it for the rest of your life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azindar>azindar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/azindar/sign.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 3:33:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /comfort</span><hr size=1> *comfort*<br>

Overall, just chill out and be patient.  I've been after Allison for over a year, and I don't regret a day of it really.  There are a lot of days where I just feel like throwing in the towel and giving up, but she is just too cool.  Plus, she keeps me sane.<br>
<br>
Can't help you on being friends with the current boyfriend part though.  I hate Allisons current boyfriend, she's always telling me about how much of an asshole he is. I want to severely injure him.  Womens is crazy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=921.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=921.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=921.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=921.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=921.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=921.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
