Our Teir`Dal guards are killed on a regular basis by just about anyone.. i think its rather un-fair that the high elven guards are so buffed up. <br><br>For instance, there are two Felwithe guards at the entrance to Felwithe. And they hit me for 174 and the other one around twenty points lower. They are extreemly magic resistant, and the whole Greater Feydark is a bug waiting to happen, for instance the two guards warped to my point (was useing Journeyman boots to outrun them) and i get stuned and instantly slaughtered.<br><br>Well, we were hunting Felwithe payback style and some of the Elven Blades guilds were protesting. That is fine.. i honour there stance... but then this person called 'Oakmist' turns up and all chaos breaks loose.<br><br>From the Elven Blades guild somone, i am not sure who decides its fun if they 'tag' the paladin guild leader Tinkale? (sp) and run him to us, well the guild leader slays one or two people, but all of our dark elven brothers and siters were dubiouse to him. (so no deaths there).<br><br>All is fine, until.. this i the killer... we have to move back ground, have a few people who died on the last one due to zone re-pop and agro's. Fine we didnt have to many deaths, the people who are able to zone out while a lot of our fighters slowly make it back to the boarded... this is when oakmist strikes, by tagging the two entrance guards to felwithe he trains them to the zoneline (these two are Kill on sight to all of our raide, around lv50'ish and hit for 174's on me and i have fairly good armour... so people with extreemly low hp's, casters etc instantly die and we loose a lot of people.<br><br>Well the zone into Felwithe to get past the guards... when Oakmist strikes again by training the rest of the Felwithe guards to the other side of the zone! (two simultaneouse trains to the zone, anyone who lived is now dead and back at bind point, people who manaed to zone again...were in a real state.)<br><br>To stop him trying it again, i attacked the two inside greater few and run them around Gretery feydark until i came to a spot in the zone where the guards teleported onto me and i instant died, they then camped my corpse (they were back at spawn but because of bad zone pathing they could see me from there spawn point despite me being just shy past the orc hill) and the guards attacked a fwe times, so i looted all i could and ran like the wind.. so no res for me.<br><br>After we decided to call it quits, as oakmist was still makeing trouble and everyone at this point was rather miffed, i decided to petition and speek to a GM about the matter.<br><br>GM's discust me!!!! as soon as i mentioned we were hunting Fewlithe guards he ignred me, he would not answer one of my tells... this is deliberate training for experience loss, both sides of the zone! come on... if it was dark elves training dark elf guards on people the played would be banned instantly!! yet because it was 'high elf' guards... we deserved all we got?<br><br>So, it gets even better i try to speek to oakmist, who is contend to just spam me with insults i cannot understand. (10-30 spam messages useing emotes, wich i could not understand, i can understand the others with him, but he instisted on useing a language i couldnt understand)<br><br>So i offered to dual him, i agree he is a ranger and weeker than i am in LV, but he accepted and stood right between the two high elf guards.... i took my time feared him past the guards, but once fear wears off he kept porting back to felwithe entrance.. shame, last time i just feared and harm touched, it slowed him enough for me to finish him.... took me 4 try's though, each time he was sitting right next to the high elf guards so they would assist and kill me... so he didnt even follow his convictions and do something to stop us.. other than repeat train the raid.<br><br>After that around 5 or so Elven blades decided to follow us around and spew harrasment... if one of my guild trained dark elf guards on people both sides of zone i would be discusted, its not something we would do.. yet NOT only does elven blades condone training of this nature, they embrace it and like to harras people as well.<br><br>My conclusion is that i now dislike Elven blades to even allow this, to allow this and play on it, milk it for all its work is just cruel, no amount of roleplaying can convice me that 'Oakmist' is just a jerk.. personally i think you should be Guild disbanded and shunned.<br><br>Brallar - Knight of innoruuk<br>House Sel`Quar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 8:29:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elven Blades - I had thought so much of you until....</span><hr size=1> Oh wow looks like some idiots escaped from Rallos Zek.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucutierogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cutierogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 8:37:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elven Blades - I had thought so much of you until....</span><hr size=1> ooc:  I was there too.  I saw your guild attacking felwithe and I have to say that it took a lot of guts!  I have never seen this done before.  Yes, of course the elves were &quot;angry&quot; at you but is it fair to do that to someone?  Heck no!!  I only joked about pulling a guard to you (but i would never do it) but I walked away and did my thing.  When i came back, I saw your hunting party was quickly taken out.  That was horrible that someone would actually DO that!  I mean, woodelves do kill ogres, trolls and dark elves.  Why cant you do the same to us?  Now that i know what happened, I have lost a lot of respect myself.

It is not considered Roleplay by Verant nor is it considered acceptable behavior on all but a couple PvP servers.<br><br>I don't know the specifics of your &quot;tells&quot; to a GM. But.... STANDARD policy for GM and Guide staff is to NOT answer direct tells, unless the staff initiated the contact. Simply put, they would never be able to handle the petition quey or do their required buisness if every time they went public  (or got tells because people know their names)  they got spammed with tells. <br><br>Petitions are answered in order they are recieved, and must first be viewed by a Guide if one is available. GM's only go directly to the petition Quey when there are no Guides or a need is identified. There are exceptions to the quey rule, but someone has to read the petition first and that wont happen quickly unless there are few petitions or lots of Guides.<br><br>The person that trained you should still be petitioned. Maybe a Guide or GM will take the time to review logs. Deliberate training of NPC's on other players is a BIG NO on all but a couple PvP servers<br><br>As for the 2 guards in front of Felewith..... well back before the release of Kunark (or shortly after) enough people whined about dead &quot;newbie&quot; guards that Verant made the so called &quot;newbie&quot; Guards into what I refer to as GOD killers. Massive damage dealers, almost completely resistant to spells and major regen capability tied in with tons of Hit Points. This is True of ALL &quot;newbie&quot; guards.<br><br>In Nektolus that would be the Two Guards (or 3) in Front of Neriak. Not sure how many of the woodelf Guards got labeled as &quot;newbie&quot; but it is a bad bet to mess with them because I can imagine every lift is classed as &quot;newbie&quot;. <br><br>There is ZERO justification to training NPC Guards on anyone. NONE. Verant is CLEAR on this.  NO excuse will justify the willful, deliberate training of any NPC on other players. EVER.<br><br>The only exception is Sullon Zek and maybe Rallos Zek.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 441<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 9:04:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Well, if it's a guide .. </span><hr size=1> .. and not a GM, you can re-petition with &quot;I have a conduct problem with Guide xxxx supporting trainers, may I speak to a Verant GM?&quot;  I've never had to do that one, but I've heard it works for guides that trash valid petitions based on personal whim.

They are instructed to IGNORE direct tells with people they have not initiated contact with.<br><br>If a Guide or a GM answered a petition and ignored them, that is different. This is a CLEAR case of disruption, it is not a grey area. Verant has stated more than once on numerous forums that training NPC's on other players deliberatly is a punishable offense. They even used the example of a player claiming to roleplay and thus training Guards on people killing  other Guards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 1:15:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elven Blades - I had thought so much of you until....</span><hr size=1> Braellar... didn't you forget an e in your name?<br><br>As we are allied with the Elven Blades with multiple other guilds, I have brought it up to the attention of the guild leaders and hope to see this person dealt with in an appropriate manner, we do not condone this kind of action. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A> at: 2/13/02 1:23:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 2:21:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elven Blades - I had thought so much of you until....</span><hr size=1> If a /petition is done and the GM's catch a player doing this I guarantee you some sort of action will take place.

EVER. It is nothing more than disruption of play and griefing to Verant.<br><br>Such action opens a MAJOR can of worms.<br><br>There are many &quot;roleplay&quot; things that simply are not allowed or tolerated by Verant. And in this case with good cause. To intentially cause the loss of experience to another player on all but 2 servers is flatly not permitted, no exceptions. You cant block doors or prevent access to areas in other ways deliberately either (well you can, but get caught and pay the price)<br><br>You cant roleplay an exploit in game either. A set of rules exsist and for a reason.<br><br>The only reason that Sullon Zek is exempted (and Rallos Zek to a lesser extent) is that Verant has stated that a person CAN find recourse to such actions in that particular PvP environment, AND they state such in the rule set, for all to read.<br><br>You have zero recourse to a griefer that trains NPC's on you on a non PvP server. You have restricted recourse on most PvP servers also (level limits imposed on PvP). Sullon has only one restriction on PvP, 5 and under can not be PvPed (an exception or two exsists). <br><br>Only recourse outside calling the staff on someone blocking a passage or training NPC's is to ALSO engage in that practice. Can we say Griefer paradise? The rules are clear and have a very clearly defined reason for exsisting.<br><br>So to answer the question about is it roleplaying to train Guards on other players..... NO, Verant has said that it is not, and they own, run and control the game. At least in Norrath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=121&stop=122>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=361.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=361.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=361.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=361.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=361.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
