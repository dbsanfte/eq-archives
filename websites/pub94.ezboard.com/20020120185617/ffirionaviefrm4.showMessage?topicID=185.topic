Our brothers in Rivervale believe they deserve every copy of the Holy Canon of the Gods, the Testament of Vanear.  They have forgotten that it is a holy text to all of us, not merely to the faithful of the Rainkeeper.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am fearful that a rot may have set in in the heart of the great oak that are our brothers in Rivervale, and they must be once again taught that all things must be restored to the proper balance.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They, of all people, should know that if the rains collect only in one place, the rest of the continent parches, and that the region in which the rain collects festers.  In order for there to be growth, the rain must come to all places.&quot;<br><br>&quot;To this end, I urge all persons to act against their hoarding of the Holy Canon for themselves, and I call upon the faithful of the Rainkeeper to recognize that their actions are out of balance.&quot;<br><br>&lt;ooc&gt;<br><br>I think, at this point, it is difficult to doubt that the Order of the Oaken is farming the Testament of Vanear.  They may justify their actions because of the Trivial Loot Code, but the effect is the same: they're denying access to this item to other people who wish to acquire it fairly so that they may get as many copies as they need.  This needs to stop.<br><br>To that end, I urge people to engage in an old-fashioned 1960s &quot;sit-in&quot; at Dyllin's spawn site tomorrow, Saturday, December 22nd.  Come, sit an hour or two, and chat with others.<br><br>Rules for this sit-in:<br><br>1) Be polite to everyone there.  Do not be rude to anyone, including those who've been farming this item.<br>2) Because they've been 'farming' the Testament of Vanear and denying its access to anyone else, any rights the Order of the Oaken might claim to this camp should justifiably be ignored by any person or persons who could use this item for themselves and could acquire it for themselves.  Members of the Order of the Oaken get to go to the end of the line to wait for this item.<br>3) If Dyllin does show up during the course of the sit-in, and there are multiple people who could use Page 30 who don't already have Testaments of their own, work out equitably and fairly who it should go to ahead of time.<br>4) Don't kill-steal from anyone, including those who've been farming this item for the past couple days.<br><br>I'll be there for an hour or so.  If you agree that farming this item to the exclusion of others is outrageous, please join me in Highpass Hold tomorrow.<br><br>&lt;/ooc&gt;<br><br>Lasgalen, Sixteenth Autumn Initiate of Tunare<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A> at: 12/21/01 11:48:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/21/01 3:05:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Highpass Hold Sit-In: 12-22-01</span><hr size=1> KS by lag ! <br>make sure  to bring lots of AE spells<br>and we need bards.<br><br>next stop Hadden !<br>we will sit and watch folks wait hours and hours to get an item because it's fun.....<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uquillionthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quillion the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/21/01 4:39:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Highpass Hold Sit-In: 12-22-01</span><hr size=1> Why not ask them nicely?

Other people have helped out, sitting in with me or while I was away.  Thank you to them.  Even more know about the event.<br><br>I also helped a human Cleric from another guild acquire his Testament of Vanear.  The smugglers got him at first, and then he couldn't find Dyllin Starshin.  We looked all over, and he thought Dyllin despawned.  He was very disheartened.  I kept looking.  Finally, I dove in the water, and there he was, under the dock at the Tiger's Roar.  I told the Cleric, and he got the page.  He was ecstatic and very grateful.  Yay!<br><br>I'm about to return to my vigil; if other honest folks come for Dyllin, I'll let them know when he's expected to return.<br><br>My /inspect information currently reads: &quot;I am not here for Dyllin Starshin, but to make sure that everyone has a fair chance at him.  The Order of the Oaken has been monopolizing him for the past few days.  If you disagree with 'farming', please sit with me a spell.&quot;  That way, people know I'm not there for Dyllin, but just keeping a watchful eye.  That's how the forementioned Cleric knew that I wasn't in line and that he could go ahead.<br><br>Lasgalen, Seventeenth Autumn Initiate of Tunare <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A> at: 12/22/01 6:20:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kendrikfv>kendrik fv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/22/01 6:45:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   weak links</span><hr size=1> Kimmz, there may be an idiot posting in this thread, but it is not Lasgalen... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/22/01 8:17:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: weak links</span><hr size=1> Somehow, after reading his post, I fully agree, if there is an idiot here, it doesn't appear to be Lasgalen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/23/01 2:57:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Highpass Hold Sit-In: 12-22-01</span><hr size=1> not having a testament is not = to not being able to level to get something better. testament is only effectively plus 50 mana for a level 20 character. <br><br>its nice but not essential. while you spend time camping this item and getting mad wasting time with arguing about the spawn you are missing out on becomming 30ish and grouping for a cgs for example.<br><br>come on, add them to your &quot;i'm not happy with this person&quot; list and get some levels so you are past all of this.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/23/01 4:22:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=185.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Highpass Hold Sit-In: 12-22-01</span><hr size=1> Well said, Heagan.

I took a cleric to 52, a druid to 58 (tho not a healer per say), and have a 15 cleric on this server and have no plans at all at getting a ToV. Its jsut not that big of a deal.  Hell, get a charred guard shield. looks heckuva lot cooler anyways.  !0 wisdom at level 50 is only 53.6 mana. uhh big deal.  And ever had to do a CR while naked? Wisdom is overrated anyways.<br><br>Not only is my big cleric (on mith marr), a non ToV cleric, it is also a gnome! One of the lowest wisdom starters. Don't think I've ever been out of mana and had group die. May have died at 60 mana several times, but different story.<br><br>Hate to sound self riteous, but you guys need to calm down, give up on this book (ending is very lame anyways, the butler did it), and consintrat on the finer parts of being a healer.

It is a group of people you associate with, who uphold (or bring down) your reputation as you affect theirs in return.  I am not about to shun or berate members of the Order as I meet them only because of this issue, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't remember it.  I don't think I am being unfair at all, I think I'm just being open about human nature.  Almost everyone acts on the same impulse, and it's entirely fair.<br><br>If you believe some members of your guild are not acting honorably and are damaging the reputation of your guild, get your officers and guild leader on the matter, accept the collateral damage to your own reputation, or find a new guild.  Those are your options.  I'm not trying to attack you, I'm just trying to help.
