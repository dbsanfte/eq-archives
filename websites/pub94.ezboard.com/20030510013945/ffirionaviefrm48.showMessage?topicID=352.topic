Silver radiance glittering from the marble alter where life was breathed into her again. The sensual rustle and rattle of chain mail accompanied her movements this time, replacing the former robes of Necromancy. <br>
<br>
Her daughter, Abysinthe stood by her side. Her wicked, always handsome Xaizael looming - his features pensive and distraught.<br>
<br>
Hunger was unleashed in a whirlwind; sated the beast slept. <br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Morning sounds roused the slumbering leagues within the dark city. Bustling along the hallways and passages that she'd always known. Chain gloved fingers crawled over a passing wall as she started down the passage towards third gate. Nobles at her heels and nipping, calling out praises to her. It only irritated her, and she'd suffer it. A hand shot upwards to hault their stammering and questioning.<br>
<br>
The library..the Tavern..<br>
<br>
She headed into the small tavern where the troll stood and eyed all the occupants within, those who followed her made to stand without, save her Daughter and Xaizael. Gloves were slid from her fingers with firm plucking movements. Silvers crawled over faces and figures that lounged, only startled by the high booted kick of a heel to the door in a gust like slam.<br>

She was so beautiful. There was something about her cruel little mouth. She had the straightest pearly white teeth and generous lips that twitched upwards into a twisted Cupid’s bow smile. Fear and horror radiated in the depths of her crimson eyes as she watched her own child, and the Mother cowered for the first time in her entire life. Ciennaa was made to come into her own power, made her Mother watch and understand.<br>
<br>
Siena’way was a disturbed, self-indulgent woman and I as her chosen mate had long given in to her fits of fury and small tirades, and sadistic pleasures. But this time she had gone too far. Recklessness would not be allowed. But I get ahead of myself; let me go back to the night of the wickedness.<br>
<br>
We often had visitors from other Qu’ellars. Those who came to see Siena’ways infamous beauty, her court and the iron fisted manner in which she dealt with all of it. Saeler had come on this night with Qu’ellar Renor’Verin. He was the Jabbuk of his House. I understood he was a wealthy male and had power almost as righteous as any female. He thought himself above reproof. He’d been wrong.<br>
<br>
Trestle tables numbering three were gleaming in ebon splendor in the main room of Qu’ellar Olath’Veldrin. Even the shadows were denied this night as elegantly dressed Yathrin were paraded through the halls in prayers to Innoruuk and following the procession was her Majesty. Long flowing gown of blood red and her long white hair had been braided, intertwined was a slender ribbon of the same blood red. The circlet holding the black satin mantle about her tresses was purest gold and gleamed in the roaring firelight of the main room. The entire court hushed as she was introduced, and the shuffle of feet and chairs as she was seated and then they were allowed to be, was deafening.<br>
<br>
Tray upon tray of food was carefully presented to her first, before put upon the tables before her guests. I, of course, was seated to her right and our Daughter was left to defend herself as always, at the end of the main table that faced a beautifully polished performance floor. Here, there would often be dancers of beauty, comical skits, beatings of slaves, and when there was no feasting she would hear the smaller holds and dwelling masters complaints. But tonight it was filled with dancers brought in her honor. <br>
<br>
She was always detached and noticed barely anything but what she wished to notice. She was intent upon her death wine; her lips lingering against the rim in a fashion that made me stiffen, while she watched the dancing. Their slender, graceful bodies writhed to the dark, dramatic music that flowed down from the sinister assembly of Master musicians. She looked beautiful even in her boredom. As I took my fill of the rich foods served, I noted that Saeler stared at her; he could hardly stand to take his eyes off of her. It did not surprise me; it was a common happenstance. <br>
<br>
He was dressed in the very finest clothing I had ever seen on a man, that which she would appreciate if only she’d notice him. And he was about to make certain that she did. The dancers finished and the clapping was a thunderous noise rolling across the echoing Qu’ellar; nearly deafening. She glanced upward now, slender brows of white sliding together in confusion at who would so high-handedly dismiss the activity of her own Noble House. It was him; Saeler. I thought she would have him killed, but was instead was placated by his elegant bow before her and our table. I only snorted at his courtly mannerisms. But of course it did settle her ire and she flicked a hand imperiously at him so that he might continue.<br>
<br>
And then he did. A screaming rothe was drug into the middle of floor in chains. In her own way, she was beautiful. Long, streaming golden hair that billowed around her pale face and cuspidate ears that poked through the golden masses that proclaimed her our enemy. She was cruelly tossed to the center floor to the delight of our Court, many laughing at her obvious peril. <br>
<br>
To this scene was added another rothe, only this one was male. He stood proud even in the dangling chains that were strung between his wrists and feet marking him a condemned man. His armor gleamed in the roar of the fire and the court calmed to get a good look at the noble Paladin before them. Saeler flourished a hand in his direction and turned to announce to the courts. “Here we have a husband and wife, who claim to be of the light and to stand for love.” He drew a wickedly carved sword from the sheath at his side. The glow was faintly blue, obviously magically enhanced. <br>
<br>
“For love and honor!” He laughed, and the entirety of the Court laughed with him. He turned towards the servants that had brought the man inwards and nodded his head. The paladin was shoved rudely forwards and stood stiff, staring down at the trembling, sobbing woman who sat with her head down, her glorious crown of golden blonde hair hiding her tears. I glanced to Siena’way, who was faintly amused by this court jester, and obviously found him handsome. Her eyes devoured him from head to toe. From his gleaming white hair and grinning ebon features right down to the pointed toe of his boots. She would have him too. I felt that familiar pang of jealousy and then let it go. She was a ruler, and I was but honored to share her life. I was in no position to rail at her for her lovers. It was expected of an Ilharess, a Matron of her possessions.<br>
<br>
The Paladin had been unchained, to his startle, and given a fairly decent sized sword. One that he’d tested before moving to stand quickly next to his lady. Perhaps she was his lady wife? The storytellers only deigned to explain that they were caught too close to the borders, trying to lure our people to the light with false hopes and silly offerings. That Hate was not the way of our people. They were fools. Even if they believed these things to their core they would never, ever fail. Not in Siena’ways districts. They were hopelessly in love with their Matron and knew the power that hate and it’s path held for them.<br>
<br>
“Defend her,” It was hollered to the Paladin, as Saeler wielded his blade with a deadly precision “with your honor and love! Surely it will save you both.” The deal had been struck, then. If he mortally or otherwise wounded Saeler they would both be free to go. But the Paladin knew this was a fight to his death, no matter what. “And I will fight you with Hate!”<br>
<br>
I wanted Ciennaa to be dismissed from these games, and started to rise from my chair. As if my mate could guess my intentions, she stayed me with the halting lift of a hand and let her gaze roam to our beautiful child. She was so much like her Mother, in so many ways. But had yet to gain the cruelty to the edge of her features. Siena’way motioned for Ciennaa to be brought to the main tables and seated to her right as a Yathrin excused herself to make a place.<br>
<br>
The clashing of metal was already loud, blue sparks flying across the well-polished wood as Ciennaa hurried to her Mothers call. The child would have bled herself for but a small word of love or cherish from her Mother. Never had it transpired, and I understood even if the child did not, it never would. Siena’way saw her more as a burden then a beloved child. All of seven years old; a year before she would be passed into the realm below for Innoruuk’s greater plans; she was forced to watch this macabre show. <br>
<br>
The woman’s screams and sobs got louder, as she watched now, her Husband or lover find himself in peril from the slashing wail of Saeler’s blade. Cutting deep into the Paladin’s weakened armor like a knife through butter. His life’s blood trickled and then poured to slick the hand pressed there to try and stanch it. It was hopeless. Staggering forwards, he tried desperately to swing at Saeler’s head. The Tier’dal had an advantage that the Fier’dal could not hope to. Small, agile and graceful he turned and the sword was swung. The pale elfs head went rolling nearly to the edge of our table and stopped. The woman’s torment only increased as she shot to a stand and screamed a siren’s wail in anguish and horror that I might never forget and wished I did not have to recall now. Would I ever feel that, should Siena’way be subjected to such a fate? Or would she cry if I fell to the blade in her honor? <br>
<br>
The blonde elf teetered, and was captured in her chains and shoved cruelly forwards to the delight of the court. Their laughter and clapping again was deafening as they shot to their feet and clapped while Saeler took a “humble” bow and grinned to Siena’way. My mate rose as elegantly and graceful as always and peered at him with an undeniable longing. <br>
<br>
“The woman is now rothe and I gift her to dos, Lady Siena’way.” There were gasps of horror sprinkled into whispers at the fate of this man and his bold tongue. Her title was ALWAYS to be used. How dare he! But Siena’way found his arrogance pleasing; it was a shock to all of us.<br>
<br>
I watched as the procession of servants ambled into the room to clean the blood and mess from the floor for other games to come. Only to be stopped short as a small child crouched in the pooling mess of blood, almost seemingly mesmerized. Her small hand was covered in the crimson vitae and she brought it to beneath her nose, while I rose slowly to watch. She groaned softly and her small tongue darted out to lap a kittenish lick across her palm. The shudder that ran her spine was undeniable. Some of the Court had gone on to the food, festivities and quiet talking about the feat preformed. Others watched my Daughter with raised brows and wide eyes.<br>
<br>
“Come, dalharil..come to dossta Ilharn.” Her gaze lifted and locked onto me, I could almost see the haze of pleasure and confusion in her young features as she rose slowly. The servants backed away from her as she moved forwards, watching her as if she were a huge creature to be feared. It amused me, and I could not help the small curve to the corner of my lips. Xas, I am proud of my Daughter. She is special; let us just say that. I know that Innoruuk has chosen a fate and path for her unlike any others in our Qu’ellar. <br>
<br>
But this story is about her Mother, and I digress.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Matron’s chamber was low lit as the slave in chains was brought into her rooms, gagged and screaming in terror beneath the leather bit. Slaves and servants hurried to remove Saeler’s bloodied armor and clean his sword and clothing. A black silk wrap was slid around him as they washed his hands and feet of the blood with soft, quick cloths.<br>
<br>
Siena’way entered from her side chamber, near the hidden panel from which I always watched such happenings. If she found me, or ever found out about such things, I would surely be put to death.<br>
<br>
“Dos are a most magnificent male, Saeler Verin.” Her voice was husky, in pleasure it would be. The blonde woman was drug to the end of the bed and chained there, helpless and naked like an animal. <br>
<br>
“And dos are a most beautiful, vital and evil woman, Siena’way.” He spoke with a familiarity that surprised me. Obviously, they were familiar. The House servants were waved away. And when the door close, Saeler boldly drug Siena’way into his arms and kissed her firmly. They were intimate and kissed for long moments before the squealing and frightened slave was drug down to her hands and knee’s and made to kneel submissively at Siena’ways feet. The shuffling and creaking open of the door to the room drew my hidden gaze in a shot. The small figure silhouetted in the frame of the massive woodwork made my heart pound. Ciennaa! This was too much. Why did they draw the girl from her sleep to this rendezvous and tryst? I was furious, and had to remember that I was hidden for my own good. Calming my pumping heart and fists, I crouched again and watched as Saeler swept her up into his arms and pointed down to the slave at his feet and explained something too quiet for me to hear.<br>
<br>
I was pleased, and surprised that Ciennaa treated this male visitor with disdain and immediate dislike. She seemed like she was completely cold and distant even though he tried, obviously, to get her to be comforted. She growled and even swiped out at his face with a clawed hand, squirming in his arms. Much to the amusement of my Mate, who only settled upon the huge bed and lounged there to watch the scene. Her lips twitched in high humor, and her crimson eyes danced. Disgusted, and muttering uncomplimentary names about Ciennaa under his breath, he gripped the child’s hair hard and shoved her towards the squirming slave. Her own small scream of displeasure and writhing couldn’t hope to be saved under the strong mans grip…or could it? I smiled to myself. Her Mother chuckled, but my heart leapt to my throat. <br>
“Dossta daughter is as feisty as dos, ssins.” Siena’way chuckled and shrugged a shoulder, murmuring in response. “She is naut mine, she is Miett’s.” My name was said from her like a curse, rather than a loving caress. I growled low in my throat. I was no small male either, and could probably easily take this Saeler with my bare hands. I am a proud warrior, with the warrior’s codes. And this scene before me was trying my patience.<br>
<br>
“Feed.” Saeler commanded it of Ciennaa, to the child’s shrieking disfavor. He gripped her head and forced her mouth open, and all my mate could do was laugh cruelly. So she had told Saeler about our Daughters disfiguring secret? The white spikes gleamed sharply in the dim firelight and candlelight of the room. “Make her do it ssins, I need to see it.”<br>
<br>
Siena’way growled out a warning to Ciennaa and the child snapped her a look that made even her Mother uncomfortable. It was no secret, you see, that Ciennaa held little love for her Matron as well. Snarling, and with the strength impossible in a child her size, her small hand reached out for the woman’s blonde hair. Her crying increased as Ciennaa jerked her chin upwards and stroked a hand over the swanlike curve of her throat, murmuring words unheard to me, but calming to the Elvin woman.<br>
<br>
And then, she crouched and sank her sharp teeth into the womans neck. The slender elf writhed and then slumped slowly in her grip. The crimson of her blood seemed to red, to hot against her pale skin, which was becoming paler by the moment. She growled as the woman slumped, as if she were unsated. And as she turned on the male from Qu’ellar Renor’Verin, even if it was only apparent to me, she advanced as if she were not finished. Siena’way scrambled back slightly on the bed as Ciennaa spoke to him in the ancient tongue with a sirens allure. One that was meant only for his ears that he fought desperately but could not seem to win. Ciennaa smiled a cold smile, one I had never seen her smile before, but I was proud of her next when she spoke to him. “Dos are the lowest dog I have seen this elg’caress in heat bring to this House yet. And dos command me as if I were the lowest of dogs here? I think naut Male..dos will know my power? Dos wish to see me feed? Then kneel.”<br>
<br>
And as if he had no choice, to my keen eyes pleasure, he knelt before the child, trembling and fighting his own tendencies. Ciennaa only smiled to him as if he were a recalcitrant child and even smoothed his white hair backwards before leaning close to kiss his cheek and whispered against the skin, though how I could hear was beyond me. “Aluve, et’vedaust, Warrior.” And then she turned her head directly at the panel to which I hid behind, and winked. The little terror! Even though my heart leapt and pounded in fear for her a moment ago, she was controlling this entire situation! Siena’way was screaming at her now, and Ciennaa shot her a scathing look and murmured words that had my Mate scrambling backwards again, eyes of crimson wide in fear. Tugging the whimpering male’s head to the side, she sunk her small teeth into his flesh and began to drink. Even to his jerks and his moans and pleading, she began to drain his huge body as if she would never stop.<br>
<br>
She did not stop.<br>
<br>
However my Mate decided to handle the mess and the disaster of a missing Male noble from another Qu’ellar, was left to her. It was her fault and her carelessness and recklessness that had caused the death in the first place. She had meant to exploit my beloved child for the amusement of her lovers?<br>
<br>
Ciennaa was where I could almost always find her. In the center of the vast library and<br>
Lying before the statuette of Innoruuk with his outstretched and upturned hands. She was curled into a small ball at the feet of the works and whimpering at the fullness of her stomach, cramped and hot with the overfeeding. I crouched before her, and scooped her up into my arms, holding her tight against me and whispering words of caring, love and concern. She almost immediately nestled against me and sighed; a child’s sigh of relief and pleasure. <br>
<br>
She slept soundly in my arms as I went to my own chambers.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was not long after that I had spoken to the High Council not even fourteen hours later. She was not safe here now. She must be sent to Neriak to learn her way as most young Tier’dal did. Though she was born into Noble blood and would have anything her heart desired, she would be safer living a modest life within the place of our beginning, our hearts.<br>
<br>
Neriak – where you would learn to grow strong in your hate or succumb to whatever fate finds you.<br>
