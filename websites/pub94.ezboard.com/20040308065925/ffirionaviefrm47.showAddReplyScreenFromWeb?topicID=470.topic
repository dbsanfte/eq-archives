To be honest, I do not really have the answers to such questions and I would not try to make up any answers because I would just be writting something that you, the reader, would want to see and agree with. Instead, I can only tell you why I am not in a guild and thinking of starting my own.<br>
<br>
The primary reason I want to start my own guild is due to the fact that I feel, if I do join a guild, no matter what guild it might be, I would be the new person and that I would get lost in the shuffle and fell unimportant. Sure, feeling important is not what the whole expirence is about, but niehter is getting lost in the shuffle. I am not saying that most guilds do not care about their members and that they get lost in the shuffle but from what I have seen and heard, there is always a feeling that it might happen and essentially that is not what I would want happened to me. What I propose is simple, I play this game to have fun, not to ride on my so called high horse and play favoritism with this person and that person. The reason we all play this game is to have fun and that is a fact that I will always remember. I do not degrade people for their actions and act as the all holy role playing police, each person playing this game is a vital and crucial emmber of a community build around myself in order to enjoy my game time and all members will be treated as such.<br>
<br>
Secondly, what I do not like or enjoy about any group be it in this game or elsewhere is poltics. In fighting, favoritism, and childish behavior are uselss and pointless and shall not be tolerated what so ever. Just because someone is an officer and a senior member does not give that person, nor any person that right to pass judgement before all the facts are known. Heresay, corruption, backstabbing and so forth are cancers that must and should be eliminated at all costs. Again, as stated, any group I am a part of or that I form or attempt to form shall be devoid of any such action. If you are in this guild then you are in this guild because you want to be and you want to have fun, end of story.<br>
<br>
I, DeathWatch, and my hunting partner Ebag also wish to form a guild because we have come to the realization that something is in fact missing from our gaming expirence, we are tired of being mercenaries for hire, going on raids and not reaping any of the benefits of being in a guild. Who is going to give the loot to the mercenary...lol....just doesn't happen that way. We are both one level away from 50 and feel that the time is right to put our leadership qualities to the test and brach out forming a family that want to have fun and are willing to have fun. Part of the way to achieve the highest form of entertainment is through role playing. I want to make it known at this point I am seeking to form a role playing guild, something I have found to be lacking as of late. Yes I know there are plenty out there, I just have not seen that many is all.<br>
<br>
The rules and so forth, I could at this point list but are nothing out of the ordinary from most other guilds. No kill stealing, no abusive behavior ect. I think we all know what it is that we are looking for and no matter what I do list, the ultimate judge of the rules and guidleines are the people and the attitudes that they bring to any such effort, make it fun and it will be fun, corrupt and it shall be corrupt.<br>
<br>
The structure is not yet fully layed out but shall eb along the lines of as follows.<br>
<br>
Founder: Death Watch<br>
2nd in command: Ebag<br>
Officers:<br>
Council members:<br>
Ambassadors:<br>
Other titles:<br>
Members:<br>
<br>
If you are interested in any such effort then by all means: please contact DeathWatch at aodablaze@hotmail.com leaving any contact information possible as well as what you see and are looking for in a guild and if it is origional and interesting it will be included.<br>
<br>
The following would the the working story line behind the guild, whose name I am thinkign will be Keepers of the Seven Keys. Please note that this story is based on lore from music bands Helloween and Gammaray.<br>
<br>
It is a seemingly innocent tale of a young man participating in the rituals set in a distant land. He knows his fun will be short-lived, for many years now his village and all his land have been cast in darkness, despair, and disease. <br>
As he wander the streets of his village, he begins to hear his name being called in the wind. Frightened, he returns to his home where in the instant he closes the door behind him, there is a knock. Trembling, he opens the door and is immediately thrust into a void of total darkness. The young man begins questioning where he is, when suddenly he sees a light coming near him, glowing in brightness and intensity. <br>
Revealed in the light is the Seer of Visions, how shows him the true evil power behind this land's destruction. The Seer then tells the young man that he is the only one who can save his land and his people from doom. <br>
The young man is then tempted by evil, with promises of power and wrath. The young man turns his back to evil and prays for the strength to deliver mankind from this evil. <br>
The young man is given the seven keys by the Seer of Visions, which will enable him to complete his quest. <br>
The young man is sent home to prepare for this journey. You can almost see him walking with his head held high as the chimes of doom strike nearer to the hour of his quest. <br>
The young man returns to his village to prepare for his journey. There has been advance word, and his village has already learned of his mission. <br>
The villagers gather around the young man and proclaim his to be their savior. They begin to sing songs of upcoming battles, and they sing of sure victory. The young man gets caught up in the excitement and confidently ensures his victory. <br>
As the young man is leaving his village, he pauses to bid a farewell to his village and friends hi is leaving behind. Memories come flooding into his mind of his youth in the village. Doubt then begins to seep into his thoughts. He doubts the mission and whether he will ever return. <br>
A village assures him that he is the one to return to his land of freedom and light. Drawing strength from the villagers' words, the young man once again finds hope and then confidence in his quest and his safe return. He then bids a final farewell and starts his journey. <br>
The Seer of Visions prepares and sends the young man on his quest. From the beginning, his quest is besieged by evil spells and evil doers, but the spirit of the now blind Seer guides and protects the young man. <br>
After a long and difficult journey, the young man reaches the first sea. He must throw one of his keys into each sea to lock away the evils pertaining to that sea. The first sea he reaches is the sea of hate, where he is almost overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of hatred awaiting him from the sea. Despite this, he throws the first key, which locks the sea of hatred. <br>
The young man visits the next five seas in turn, each filled with its own hazards and torments, but he succeeds in locking each sea. <br>
Finally, he reaches the shores of the seventh sea, where he finds the lord of evil waiting for him. The demon immediately casts a sickening spell on the young man. Brimming with confidence, degrades and threatens the young man to the point where the young man begins to waver. <br>
Suddenly, the young man hears and feels the spirit of the Seer, who urges him to throw the seventh and final key. With his last ounce of strength, the young man hurls the key towards the sea. <br>
The key reaches its mark, landing in the seventh sea, and immediately causes eruptions and earthquakes. The demon, whose reign of terror on the land is over, is swallowed by the earth and cast into his eternal abyss. The young man is victorious, saving mankind from demons and their dreaded diseases. <br>

If this doesn't work, at least you can say you tried.  Bump it up every now and again, and try replying to some of these folks who say that they are looking for a guild.  Maybe they will share your vision, too. <br>
