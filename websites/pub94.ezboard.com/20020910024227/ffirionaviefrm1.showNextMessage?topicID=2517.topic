I recall the leader of my past guild telling me about one of our more inept guildmates, &quot;ya know, if he wasn't so damn much fun to have around, no one would group with him&quot;.  This was right after the guy in question had wiped us out (again).  The thing was, no one really minded because that comment was true.  He was a blast to have around despite his sometimes rather foolish antics.<br>
<br>
Anyway, 51 levels is a pretty fair bit to just throw out.  You must like playing a BL or you'd not have played up that high.  There are few classes that are just snapped right up for raids (clerics, rogues, wizards), but for the most part, it takes some effort to make the social connections to raid regularly (or at all) when unguilded or part of a small non-raiding guild.<br>
<br>
I'd advise you to think about it pretty hard.  Ignore anyone that tells you what to like or not like about your class and all the other classes and decide for yourself if BL fits your desires most or if another class does.  For instance, I may be a bit down on the BL class for raids, but they're awesome solo or grouped and I definitely have a lot of respect for anyone that plays a class just because they love the class and finds all the ways to contribute that they can. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

<br>
Why do this?  Most of the members of the House of Carnage are getting up there in age where they can go on raids.  Are they not going on raids?  If they aren't, I would suggest at finding another guild that does go on raids.  I never got the impression you didn't like being a BL, and as previously mentioned, to play a character to level 51 means that you are relatively happy with that character.  I wouldn't throw the time away.  Sure you might not be the first choice of &quot;wanted&quot; character for an open raid, but what does it matter if your guild is sponsoring the raid.  Again, I would suggest keeping the BL, and looking at the HoC.  If they have no plans to become a raiding guild as which you profess you like to do then leave the HoC under amicable circumstances and find yourself a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
Before going off of someone elses suggestion as what to play, I would take suggestions and go to another server start a character(s) or buy a basic EQ game for 10 bucks (play on FV for the free 30 days) and then make a decision to reroll the BL to the character you like to play not what is one of the &quot;Hot&quot; classes needed for every raid.<br>
<br>
I would re-guild to a raiding guild before re-rolling.<br>

I for one am having a blast with my beastlord.  The funnest class I have played in my 3 years of EQ.  He is not one of the main raiding classes obviously, but he has good base skills, and some nice spells.<br>
<br>
- sow, slow, haste, invis, hp regen, mana regen, hp buffs<br>
- decent pet with procs, can heal pet for 1250hp per heal<br>
- dual wield, block, dodge, riposte, kick<br>

<br>
After seeing your pet pretty much solo the Taskmaster a few days ago (I didn't know BL pets were that good), I am convinced of your feirceness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I have been told the entire time I have played Cielo that I would be useless in the high-end game. I honestly spent the whole time concerned with it, and even though I LOVE my mage, wondered if I should reroll, because I was interested in raiding and such. <br>
<br>
When I told one wise, sadistic, mage admin of my concerns, he offered these words:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Perhaps many raid leaders are nieve to the value of a mage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And how! I have been on quite a few raids now, and have really been happy and surprised that I was able to contribute the amount that I did. Sure, I'm not a tank, or the strongest nuker, but I am able to support and enhance the whole team. From the list that Zokof posted above, it seems that you have some useful skills to bring to the raid party, as well. Maybe you just need to educate raid leaders on your usefulness, as Apep had pointed out to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

<br>
That's about the only difficulty, though.  Beasties get access to some wicked fierce hand to hand weapons, their epic is extremely nice (similar to a ranger epic, but BLs can't double attack so they get lesser damage for the same ratio), they have a huge range of very nice spells (chloro, alacrity, mini-focus, talisman, etc).  Spiritual Purity and Savagery are also nice spells.<br>

<br>
Also as someone pointed out, Beastlords are still being worked on.  Give it time.  Also, on this server, once you have the basics people for the raids (warriors, clerics and a few wizards, shamans, rogues and monks), it becomes a numbers game.  If people like you and it appears they do, you should have no problem.<br>

<br>
A few examples:<br>
<br>
The worst tradeskill before May 8th:  Pottery.  Brewing was easy and good for parties, Baking had slight uses but was very easy, pottery above 188 was EXTREAMLY hard, expensive, and totally pointless.<br>
<br>
Now it makes items useful in the endgame.<br>
<br>
The worst class in the beginning:  Rogue.  No evade, backstab did much more agro, no sneak hide... and now look at us, a &quot;cornerstone&quot; class.<br>
<br>
If you are useless in raids now, you can expect some great stuff coming, I would guess in the form of attack buffs for other melees that stack with all others, and such like that.<br>
