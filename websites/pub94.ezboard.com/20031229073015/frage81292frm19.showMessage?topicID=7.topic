<br>
Even getting there was amusingly daring, and Lolodory sprinted across the Grey just holding her breath.  I myself ran around the canyons of Mons Letalis nearly twice, searching for the tunnel to the Grey and angering several creatures of that rocky wasteland.<br>
<br>
Once into the Temple, we reassembled and proceeded making our way through the ornate halls of marble and granite.  Our team was myself, Ramel, Uliamarath, Nexifer, Ellu, and Lolodory.  We fought well against this nearly forgotten remmant of the Shissar culture, adding notches to our kill-sticks.  Eventually we proceeded up one of the strange spiral tubes, and found ourselves in a pitched battle with three who waited for us at the top, ready to stop any intruders.<br>
<br>
We slew them all without casuality, and continued to explore the halls. <br>
<br>
We were doing quite well I thought, when suddenly one of the creatures began to gate in the midst of our combat.  Immersed in the intensity of the fighting, I only noticed that someone was yelling to evacuate to the zoneline of the temple after the fact.<br>
<br>
The creature vanished from in front of me, then I found myself next to it again and resumed fighting.  My head was momentarily disoriented and I realized that we were not in the same place *at all* where we had been, in fact, I was alone.<br>
<br>
I began to sweat, and continued fighting the creature.  At least I recognized where I was, this place was in the corner of the plaza next to the tube down.  As my blows rained down upon the hissing serpent, he gated *again*, and once more summoned me immediately to his side, though whether of his own choosing or because I was in such proximity to him, I am not sure, the magic of nexi being beyond my ken. <br>
<br>
I slew him in a last frenzied wrath and watched his butchered corpse collapse at my feet.  I stopped, panting, and looking around, I realized that I had no idea where I was.  I had been in the halls of this foul place several times, and had never seen this configuration of corridors and doors before.  At least I was *in* a corridor, and not a room with more of these foul smelly monsters. <br>
<br>
The bonds of the group held me still, and I was able to at least communicate easily with them.  They were all save at the entrance to the temple.  After some discussion, Ramel told me to stay where I was, and they would try to fight to me. <br>
<br>
My heart was frozen and my stomach was a hard knot.  None of them knew exactly where I was either, though Ramel thought he had a suspicion where I might be.  The minutes passed as I waited, nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  I tried moving down the corridor I was at the end of, and fortunately realized as I got to the first corner intersection that there were snakes in niches, it wasn't an intersection at all.  I saw one and retreated, somehow, safely, before it saw me.<br>
<br>
Uliamarath tried to keep our spirits up by giving us a play-by-play and a color commentary on another pitched battle raging through the other end of the great temple, and Lolodory was her usual entertaining self, cracking a couple of good jokes about my situation, but the fear in my spine was cold and wouldn't quite let go.  I even talked with Cuku via the oh so ever convenient telepathy we all seem to have, in hopes of finding a back-up method should it become necessary.  I would have contacted one of our professional mages, both Reynn and Enheduanna were in Fungus Grove, but the temple has magical wards that constrain summoning abilities, and that would be a last ditch effort indeed. <br>
<br>
Several times I worried as I felt their life energies falter, but Nexifer and Ellu kept them going and they were apparently proceeding steadily through the halls.<br>
<br>
I shook with relief when I saw them enter the far side of the corridor, but there were still monsters between us, four as verified by Ulia's giant eye, and I had to stand there and watch them fight without being able to rush to their aid, lest I bring them all upon them at one time.  Uliamarath was able to get within range of me during one of the fights and teleported me to my bind.  I went and took a shower until the shakes left me, double-checked to make sure they had reinforcements coming in to assist them in the continuing battles in that temple, and went to my bed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=7.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=7.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/rust/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="rage81292frm22">What we do<option value="rage81292frm1">General Discussion<option value="rage81292frm2">Guild Rules<option value="rage81292frm3">Applications<option value="rage81292frm19">Roleplay if ya wanna!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/brage81292>Fire and Fury</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19>Roleplay if ya wanna!</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.fnfguild.com">Fire and Fury </a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
