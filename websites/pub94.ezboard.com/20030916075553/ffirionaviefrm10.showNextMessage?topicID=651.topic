<br>
His blade returned the favor as he placed as many skillful slashes onto the Sprit of the Shissar as he could, his guildmates about him trying to bring the flying bastard down in a pool of its own blood. <br>
<br>
Shintou caused the Terror within that beast. He used that spell to take its attention.. he took the hits and rage from the beast as everyone attacked it. The beast was fast and strong, its claws sending pain throught the Noctivant breastplate like hes never felt..<br>
<br>
The leaving of Dvara put him in this position, being the one who took the brunt of the attack. High Knight Tallonar had to lure out the beast.. and Bloodbringer had leave the alter plane of Fear to meditate to the father with her husband. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Parry.. Parry.. Dodge.. Slice. Parry.. Parry.. Dodge.. Slice..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The train of thinking to get himself in a proper set to advoid the powerful blows did not save his flesh, for its claws were strong, and his Katana could not match that strenght..<br>
<br>
It was the bit of trust he has. The Trust in the Clergy. The priests would keep him alive.. but damn it..<br>
<br>
He loathed taking the hits from the monsters of Norrath. He enjoyed his place.. standing to the side and taking open skillful slashes to the beasts, allowing himself to cause death without being smacked about.<br>
<br>
But without Dvara.. those days were gone.. the words of High Knight Tallonar rang into his head..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;With Dvara gone, you shall find yourself in positions of being the one everyone assists in combat. You best be ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What Kind of Knight does not like to take the punishment!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Shintou felt his vitality running low.. his body had been beaten down by the Sprit of the Shissar, it smacking him about and casing a free stream of crimson from his lips.<br>
<br>
It was time for that trust.. That trust between the Cleric and the fighter to come throught.<br>
<br>
It did.<br>
<br>
Fully healed Shintou stood back up and called the beast back to him, sending a Spear of Plague into its back seems to have that effect. Then he unleashed upon him.<br>
<br>
&quot;My turn you flying bastard, try this, Shining Burning Katana Slash!&quot; He shouted as Harm Touch energy ripped throught his weapon, which he used to unleash a powerful arcing wave of Spritual Rage energy onto the beast, wounding it greatly.. but not slaying it.<br>
<br>
That kill belonged to another, Kyri and Aina, the Lightly Armored Warriors who Preffered to Strike from behind other wise known as those dirty stealin Rogues (;P) of the League took their weapons as the beast attacked Shintou and sent them to its backside.. Cryadus and his weighty polearm did their damage as well.. the Finger wiggling spell casters also did their part to bring the big bird down to its death. Even Lord Gray Smashed the Bird with the Hand of the Gods.. his Clerical Hammer attack.. probably calling the very hand of Innoruuk to strike into his opponets.<br>
<br>
The Ordeal was over. No more hits for him to take..<br>
Despa got what he saught.. the head of a Shissar.<br>
<br>
With that, they left the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
...As a Child, the blonde hair green eyed Child of 4 lived in the backwoods of Nektulos. His mother and father exhiled from Neriak and saught to be slaughtered for parenting a 'Bastard Child of Tunare'.  As a boy he was always scolded by his father, a Wizard of Innoruuk.. Raziel. He'd always run up, find some silly wolf and just play about with it. He was always getting bitten by the fierce black wolves that roam the forest. He was a lighthearted child, running about in circles singing about this that and the other thing. Raziel always blamed it upon his Heretage.. or the fact that his Mother, Isabella.. a ShadowKnight of the father.. shows him too much 'Motherly Love'. <br>
<br>
Two years later they would be slain.. caught by the Guards of the forest. The boy was taken away to Lavastorm where he was trained by a older Human Male.. a lost person, the last of a society of people who used to be Slaves to Dragonkind. A man named Yotoden<br>
<br>
Then the beatings. The tourture of Training. His master beat him repeadly throught the training sessions. Smacking him about with his wooden swords or his wacking staff..<br>
Destroying his left arm almost to the point of uselessness, and beating him deeper and deeper into the well of Insainty. This all had a purpose.<br>
<br>
This awakened the hate deep inside. Even now, he can hear the sound of the wood striking his flesh in his sleep.<br>
The crack of the staff against the back of his head.<br>
<br>
He saw those Images of himself as little Kenshin, being beat about as he stood at the point position for the League. The blows from the Amygaden Knights, the Glare Lords, and the other Minions of the Plane of Fear much like the beatings his sensi forced him to endure.  He hated it. He loathed it..<br>
But he had no choice. Without Dvara he would have to do this more. The beatings would have to be taken by someone. <br>
<br>
So no more would the words by High Knight Tallonar.. 'Tag, you're the Main Assist!' would no longer cause the fear that has been embedded in his phyche for so long weaken his resolve.<br>
<br>
For he'd be found in his room, slicing at his Wooden Training Dummy..<br>
<br>
&quot;Slice.. Parry.. Parry.. Dodge.. Slice. Slice.. Parry.. Dodge.. Slice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon that last slice, the dummy spun about, as it always did with its outsteched limbs of hardened wood, a high swing.. the parry came too late.. and it struck Shintou across the face, knocking him to the ground as a small pool of blood formed.<br>
<br>
Shintou forced himself back up, shaking the hit off as he whiped the blood from his lips.. He did not let the Guildhall ring freely with a loud rageful curse..<br>
<br>
He only went back to his Training Dummy... and begun again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Slice.. Parry.. Parry.. Dodge.. Slice... Riptose..&quot; <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://members.aol.com/leagueoshadow/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
