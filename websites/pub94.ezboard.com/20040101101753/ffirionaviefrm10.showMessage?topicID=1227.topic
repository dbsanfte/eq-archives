An earthy musk formed from the scents of fur, sweat, blood, and worse permeated every inch of the halls, and the dampness in the air caused by the underground stream did little to alleviate the stench.  Cold seeped through the fine cloth of her robe, causing a dull ache in her knees as she knelt on the stone floor, though the cleric thought little of it.  Eyes closed, she kept her breathing slow and calm as she meditated.  The last battle had been taxing, and with practiced patience she concentrated on slowly regaining her strength.  Hate was a spring that burned within her and fueled her magic, and like any spring overuse drained it, and thusly she waited for it to replenish enough to continue the hunt.<br>
<br>
As of late the days blurred into each other, each much the same as the one before, only the scenery changed.  Slow-witted orcs in the gloom of the forest, snarling gnolls in twisting tunnels of Blackburrow; one combat after another, countless enemies slain, a pile of corpses at her feet.  Though the process seemed monotonous, the cleric was pleased with the results.  Each day brought new strength, more wisdom, and the silent satisfaction of being one step closer to her ultimate goal…<br>
<br>
Absently she listened to the various sounds around her as she knelt in the secluded spot.  It had seemed an odd idea to seek safety within the rough hewn walls of the cell, but the kobolds rarely checked on their collection of prisoners, so it was unlikely that she would be disturbed.  Through the bars the cleric could hear the hushed whispers of the two Erudite prisoners across the hall, the scrape of claws on stone as patrolling kobolds passed, and the growls and barks of the beasts echoing through the warrens.  However, the loudest sound she could not help but notice came from beside her: the incessant pacing of her brother.  The cleric frowned; as always her twin had found the best way to annoy her.<br>
<br>
“Phuul dos xunor, dalninil?” he asked impatiently.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Are you done, sister?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Swallowing a sigh, Vildania refused to open her eyes, entertaining a pleasant image of picking up her mace and using it to crush one of those ever pacing plated boots.  Vildarn asked again, prompting her to glare at him through slitted violet eyes.<br>
<br>
“If you stop bothering me it won’t take as long,” she scowled.  “Don’t you have something to map somewhere?”  Mapping dungeons was the shadow knight’s newest hobby, already he had spent a great deal of time (too much in Vildania’s opinion) carefully sketching out the dimensions of the warrens.  She was highly tempted to “accidentally” hold his map too close to a torch one evening, but she knew he would insist on drawing the thing up again.<br>
<br>
“I’ve already done this room.  I think your blessings are fading, by the way.”<br>
<br>
Vildania cursed under her breath, suddenly noticing that the cool tingle of magic that swept over her skin was subsiding.  Rising to her feet she brushed the dirt from her robes.  “Would you kindly stand still for once?” she grumbled as she raised her hands to begin casting.  Vildarn stilled as a shower of sparkling pinpoints of light surrounded him, and he waited until his sister had finished.<br>
<br>
“Can we continue now?”<br>
<br>
“Fine, fine,” she nodded.  Smiling slightly he raised the cell’s barred door and the two Teir’dal slipped into the corridor.  They shared many of the same qualities, identical in height with the same cold violet eyes, fine white hair, and sharp facial features.  Also identical was the goal that relentlessly drove them: to regain that which they had lost.  Every battle won, every copper earned was another step upon the long road that stretched before them.<br>
<br>
“This way,” Vildarn whispered.  Automatically she followed him down the hallway, deeper into the warrens.  <br>
<br>
The next battle waited, another step on their journey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/5/03 9:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The First Steps of the Journey</span><hr size=1> Good work.

<br>
“Tlu venorik dalninil,” Vildarn warned, swallowing a smirk.  Beside him his sister continued to curse, sullenly rubbing the top of her head.<br>
<br>
“Be silent, he says.  I’ll show you be silent,” she muttered under her breath.  Pulling her hand away she scowled at the blood that stained her fingers; a small patch of darkness matted her short-cropped white hair.  For a moment Vildania glared at the rock that had tumbled down from the ceiling and struck her, and she considered picking it up and throwing it at her brother.  Of course, it probably wouldn’t do much to that winged cooking pot he called a helmet…  “Where are we going?”<br>
<br>
“This way.” The shadow knight pointed towards a bend in the corridor.<br>
<br>
Vildania sighed.  “Could you be more specific?”<br>
<br>
“We’re going to the gorge of King Xorbb.”<br>
<br>
“Really.  This looks like another dungeon to me,” Vildania remarked, wrinkling her nose at their surroundings.  Recently the two Teir’dal had hunted in a series of glorified caves infested with vile creatures and filled with indescribable stench and filth.  The cleric wasn’t thrilled at the thought of exploring another one, as this seemed little different and the day already had an inauspicious start.<br>
<br>
“It is another dungeon.”  He chuckled as she shot him a poisonous glare in response.  “Don’t worry, this is a shortcut, we’re not staying,” Vildarn assured her.  With another sigh she wiped the blood onto the skirt of her robe and motioned for him to lead on.  The trip didn’t take long, a few twists and turns with only a few pauses to take care of goblins that took offense to their citadel being invaded by a pair of young dark elves.  At one point the twins watched in awe as a giant bipedal mushroom meandered past, seemingly oblivious to their presence as it bounced by.<br>
<br>
Emerging outside, the cleric peered at the new surroundings.  Craning her neck she looked up at the sheer rock walls that stretched towards the sky, noticing dark clouds that promised heavy rain.  A narrow path split before them, and Vildarn led the way down the left fork as the first drops started to fall.  Silence hung eerily in the air, punctuated only by the sounds of their boots as they walked and the occasional rumbles of thunder.<br>
<br>
Turning to the left again, the knight finally paused halfway up a small incline.  “We wait here,” he instructed.  “Things should wander by.”<br>
<br>
“What sort of things?” Vildania asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“Muddites, minotaurs, evil eyes.  Don’t touch the evil eyes.”<br>
<br>
She nodded in reply; the cleric had no idea what an evil eye was, but it sounded unpleasant.  Muddites, she soon discovered as her brother lured one up the hill, sounded exactly as the name led her to expect.  The stocky, ambulatory glob of mud resembled an earth elemental, only gooey.  Bits of mud flew everywhere as the twins struck with sword and mace, neither prepared for the experience of fighting a creature that had neither flesh to pierce nor bones to crush.  Vildania sputtered and nearly dropped her weapon as a handful of mud hit her square in the eyes, blinding her momentarily.  Thankfully Vildarn finished off the creature quickly, and then left his sister alone for several minutes as she tried to divide her attention between meditating and blinking the dirt out of her eyes.<br>
<br>
The minotaurs were something of a shock, as they were easily twice the twins’ size.  In their hunts the pair had fought many monsters, yet none of them had towered over the Teir’dal quite like this.  It made each fight against the beasts that much more anxious, and each victory that much more exhilarating.  As the day continued it fell into the familiar hunting pattern, alternating periods of combat and rest.  The rain fell intermittently throughout the afternoon, the clouds keeping the annoying sunlight at bay.  <br>
<br>
Vildania futilely brushed at her mud spattered robe as she rested on the small hillside, but the garment was hopelessly damp from the constant rain.  Glancing up she watched her brother as he stood next to her, scanning the pathways for their next potential prey.  Few things seemed to bother the knight while he was hunting, while every minor detail seemed to irritate the priestess.<br>
<br>
“Dalninuk, I’ve been thinking,” she said, interrupting the silence.  Her brother snorted derisively at the comment and she sighed.  “I’m serious.  I think we should find some companions to hunt with, or a guild of some sort.”<br>
<br>
“Why?”<br>
<br>
“Many reasons.  It would be helpful to us—“<br>
<br>
“We don’t need any help,” he interrupted, scowling.  Vildarn was proud and set in his ways; she had expected this reaction.<br>
<br>
“Well, while I do enjoy your stimulating conversation I wouldn’t mind having others to talk to once in awhile.  And no, Nogarl doesn’t count, sentences of three monosyllabic words don’t qualify as conversation,” Vildania countered.  They had been aiding a young troll, Nogarl, acquire armor and learn the layout of the area outside Neriak, as the shaman had promise to one day be a valuable asset to them in hunting.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight seemed to not be paying attention to her, peering intently at the path through the gorge.  Suddenly he reached down and grabbed hold of his sister’s arm, roughly dragging her to her feet and hauling her up the hill with him.  Before Vildania could protest he shushed her, leading her further away and then finally pushing her behind him once he stopped.  Confused she peeked around him to see what her brother watched so fixedly.  It took her mind a moment to recognize the floating shape as that of an enormous eye, a blinking yellow orb almost the size of a boulder that hovered ponderously above the ground.<br>
<br>
“What is that?” she whispered with a shudder.<br>
<br>
“That,” he answered quietly, “Is an evil eye, and I’ve no intention of angering one.  They can bend your mind as surely as an enchanter.”  Bobbing slightly the eye rolled as it scanned its surroundings and the two Teir’dal slipped into the shadows, hiding as best they could in the rain.  Eventually the evil eye moved, heading back into the gorge’s mazelike pathways, and the twins breathed a simultaneous sigh of relief.  <br>
<br>
“We can continue your discussion later, dalninil.  Now we should start for home,” Vildarn suggested, and she nodded.  Later was better than no, she reasoned silently as she followed him.  Later had potential.  Vildania could be patient; likely her brother would put off the conversation as long as he possibly could, and she could use that time to investigate things.  Yes, later definitely had potential… <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tayana>Tayana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/03 5:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The First Steps of the Journey</span><hr size=1> No rain spoiled the comforting gloom of the afternoon in Nektulos forest.  Here there were no blinding sunbeams, no strange voices constantly shouting in foreign tongues, no jostling, crowded streets.  Useful though the Plane of Knowledge might be, traveling through it grated on the cleric’s nerves.  This moment of quiet would be fleeting of course, and rightly so.  More battles waited, a long, winding road lined with blood and death that must be traveled.  Yet for now she had only her own thoughts to battle, and a river full of fish.<br>
<br>
Slender legs folded beneath her, the young Teir’dal flipped through a thin journal as she lounged on the riverbank, a nearly forgotten fishing pole propped up at her side.  Line after line of precise, tidy writing filled the book’s pages, and pensive violet eyes skimmed the information.  Her research had been enlightening, if not terribly encouraging.  It seemed many guilds and houses sought only those with at least fifty seasons of training; Vildania mentally filed their names away for use in a few years.  Fifty felt very far away indeed…<br>
<br>
An insistent tug on the line of the fishing pole reminded the cleric of why she’d ventured into Nektulos this day, and dropping her journal she picked the pole up, concentrating on reeling the fish in.  A piranha swam close to the struggling fish, considering snatching the quick meal, but then it wisely continued on its way—the last piranha that had gotten greedy ended up flash fried in an explosion of magical sparkles.  With a triumphant grin the cleric yanked her prize free of the water and quickly went about adding it to her collection of previous victims.  The fish served two purposes: first it was necessary for the fish wine she had been attempting to brew (but refused to drink, as in her opinion fish should never be a beverage.)  Secondly, her brother wanted it for his latest cooking attempt.  This time Vildarn was intent on perfecting a soup of some sort.  Vildania wasn’t going to argue; at least he was no longer pestering her with his mysterious sandwiches containing meat of undisclosed origins.  Once she had been certain she spied a rat tail dangling from between the two pieces of bread and had nearly gotten ill on the spot.  <br>
<br>
Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Vildania baited the hook and cast her line once again.  Picking up her journal she reexamined her notes.  There were a few places she could apply to that might take her, one in particular that she often pondered.  More than once the cleric had considered approaching them and introducing herself, but always she felt too nervous.  Usually she let Vildarn do the talking, disastrous though it had been on occasion, but he still stubbornly held to the idea that they didn’t need help.  Setting the book aside she reached up and absently toyed with the ends of her short hair; when she had first acquired the robe her long locks had kept getting tangled in the high collar, and in a fit of annoyance Vildania had chopped them off.  Though she understood that the state of her hair in no way affected anything important, like her abilities as a priestess of Innoruuk, there was a tiny part of her that mourned that she looked like a boy.  It wasn’t helpful in overcoming her shyness, and she despised herself for that weakness.<br>
<br>
Vildania sighed.  Once she acquired a few more fish she would return home, there were enough for her to practice with and some leftover to distract Vildarn—she was anxious to avoid more sandwiches.  A cry of alarm from further down the river suddenly broke the quiet, followed by the sounds of desperate combat.  Leaping to her feet the cleric grabbed for her weapon and shield and rushed along the riverbank, heading towards the bridge.  As she neared Vildania knew that it was already too late; a figure in shining armor, long golden ponytail streaming behind, retreated along the road to the Commonlands astride a great white horse, a lone dragoon in pursuit.  With a sinking heart the cleric stepped onto the bridge, all too familiar with the sight that stretched before her.  Four guards, young warriors barely older than boys, lay scattered across the stone, their bodies battered and bloodied.  Kneeling next to the closest she checked for signs of life, knowing the gesture was futile; defending the bridge was near to a death sentence.<br>
<br>
Instantly the grief turned to anger.  How many times must she witness this scene?  Her kin being hunted for sport by wretched paleskins?  Vildania longed to return the favor, her hands ached to loose weapon and magic in revenge, to see them suffer as the Teir’dal suffered.  The hatred burned, a searing she gladly welcomed.  Soon, she promised herself silently.<br>
<br>
Glancing up she noted the dragoon’s return, his slumped shoulders indicating his defeat.  He looked to the cleric, still kneeling over one of his men, and she shook her head.  The dragoon sighed.<br>
<br>
“Koada’dal,” he explained simply.  Vildania scowled, unsurprised.<br>
<br>
“I’ll gather my things and return to Neriak to let them know what happened,” she offered.  Nodding his thanks, the dragoon turned away from her as Vildania stood, brushing herself off.  It never ended, she mused silently as she hurried back to her fishing spot.  Yet soon, Innoruuk willing, she and her brother would be able to better aid in the conflict, and that was a comforting thought indeed. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">Vildania, Priestess of Innoruuk</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tayana>Tayana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/03 6:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.ripway.com/2003-11/39539/fel_crouch.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The First Steps of the Journey</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Comedy of Errors;<br>

<br>
A slight wind whistled through the tunnel, hot and dry as the sands that waited on either end.  Thankfully the cavern that opened up off the passage was safe from the blistering desert heat and blinding sun; the dim light of torches and campfires almost made it reminiscent of Neriak, except for the motley assortment of races that milled about.  This was one of the camps of the Wayfarers Brotherhood, an organization that seemed to concentrate on the pursuit of adventure above all else.  It was a concept that Vildania, a Teir’dal priestess of Hate, found unsettling.<br>
<br>
Arms folded across her chest the cleric glanced around uneasily, eyeing the humans and high elves with silent suspicion.  While she saw them often enough in passing through the Plane of Knowledge, she had never lingered this closely.  As she turned she caught the gaze of an armored man watching her with an expression that was certainly inappropriate, and she frowned at him.  Noticing his sister’s disapproval Vildarn followed her glare and scowled at the human.  Stepping in front of Vildania he blocked her from sight, leaving the offender to shrug and ogle a passing wood elf instead.<br>
<br>
“I don’t like this,” Vildania said quietly.  Nervously she fidgeted with the ends of her hair as she glowered at her twin.  “Why should we work with these people?”<br>
<br>
“Because they have access to riches and magic we would not otherwise be able to acquire.  Do you want our enemies to alone have that advantage?”<br>
<br>
“No,” she admitted sullenly.<br>
<br>
“Then play along,” Vildarn advised.  “Here, Nogarl’s arrived.  I’ll go find if they’ve a task for us so we can be on our way.”  The shadow knight headed off to speak with one of the Wayfarers, and Vildania turned to the troll that ambled up and loomed over her.  Nogarl was always easily spotted, a hulking tower of menace and muscle wrapped in armor of a particularly lurid green shade.<br>
<br>
“He’s going to be smug the rest of the evening,” she warned the shaman.<br>
<br>
“This new?” Nogarl countered, tilting his head slightly.<br>
<br>
“True,” Vildania chuckled.  While they waited the pair began casting their blessings on each other; the cleric and shaman complimented each other well, their combined magic keeping the trio strong and, most importantly, alive.  Finally Vildarn returned, looking content.  “Well?” she impatiently prompted her brother.<br>
<br>
“They want us to go kill an orc.  One named Hoghul Xut.”<br>
<br>
“That’s it?  What’s the catch?” the cleric asked, raising an eyebrow.  Surely it couldn’t be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> simple.<br>
<br>
“That’s it.  It’s only an orc, how hard can it be?” Vildarn shrugged.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>One Hour Later…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Coughing, the cleric leaned against the pile of barrels and spat a mouthful of blood onto the floor.  A sharp ache spread throughout her torso; cracked ribs most likely, annoying yet not too dire.  This was unlike any lair they had previously encountered, and the orcs and goblins were very different than what they were used to.  Taller and more muscled, these foes were formidable; hitting one of these orcs was rather like hitting a tree or a brick wall and took great effort to fell.  The first few battles had come near to disastrous endings, due to the combination of an overzealous shadow knight and a handful of orc casters (said shadow knight ending up singed and eyebrowless as a result.)  Yet the trio pressed on, clearing room after room, hallway after hallway, adapting to these unfamiliar surroundings.<br>
<br>
“Crate moving,” Nogarl grunted.  The troll pointed to a wooden crate in the corner of the room that shook back and forth, creaking as it moved.  Raising an eyebrow Vildania turned to her brother, who was already advancing towards the crate.<br>
<br>
“Stand back, I’ll open it,” Vildarn ordered.  A few rooms before this they had opened a similar crate only to find a handful of stinging, biting insects, so the knight waited until his companions were out of harm’s way before prying open the lid in case a similar nasty surprise appeared.  As he tugged at the container it suddenly fell apart in his hands and a goblin leapt out.<br>
<br>
“You have saved me from that crate, I would have met an awful fate!  I was a slave but now I’m not, now I know I won’t get caught!  Please, oh please can I go with you?  I can help you make it through!  Tell me to follow and I will, fighting together will be a thrill!” the goblin exclaimed excitedly.  Confused, the three hunters peered at the escapee.<br>
<br>
“Alright, you can follow me,” Vildarn reluctantly instructed the creature.<br>
<br>
“Yay!  Hooray!  Today is the day we send those beasts away!” the slave cheered.  Vildania blinked incredulously at her brother.<br>
<br>
“Are you mad?  You can’t be serious, he’ll stab you in the back first chance he gets,” she protested.  “We ought to finish it off now before it gets us killed like one of your brainless skeleton pets.”<br>
<br>
The goblin whined piteously and shivered, and Vildarn shrugged.  “We can use it for bait.  If it dies, it dies.”  Sighing in defeat she waved at him to lead on, and they made their way into the next room.  The party continued as before, inching their way through the dungeon, leaving naught but corpses in their wake.  True to its word, the goblin slave fought as best it could in its weak, weaponless state and followed obediently as the shadow knight’s heels.  Finally it collapsed as they were making their way down a rough stone corridor, the goblin’s dying whisper barely audible over the worrisome wind that howled around the tunnel’s bend.<br>
<br>
“Fighting with you was so much fun, and now for me death has come…” the slave whined quietly.  Its eyes fell shut and it lay still, and after a few moments Nogarl poked it curiously with his spear.<br>
<br>
“Good,” the troll rumbled.  “Quiet now.”<br>
<br>
Vildarn chuckled, “I’d consider keeping some of these as slaves of our own, if there wasn’t that constant rhyming to put up with.”  He nudged the body to the side of the tunnel—no sense tripping over it later—and they resumed their hunt.  Immediately after rounding the bend they realized that this corridor was indeed different, ending not in another room or hall but opening out into something much larger.  With each step the howl of the wind grew louder, and now they could hear something else in it, an endless roar of some sort.  Vildarn cautiously scouted ahead while the other two hung back, waiting.  The party paused as they suddenly heard a distant shout carried on the wind.<br>
<br>
“We have received words of intruders!” a gruff voice barked.  “Stand your ground, men.  They’ll never cross the wind bridges alive!”<br>
<br>
“Wind bridges?” Vildania glanced up at Nogarl, who merely shrugged in reply.  Standing at the arch at the end of the hall, Vildarn motioned them forward.<br>
<br>
“Don’t look down,” he warned as they approached.  A pathway stretched out from the arch, wooden with ropes on either side, and off to the left, barely visible was the source of the roaring sound—a waterfall.<br>
<br>
“Why not?”  The cleric’s eyes reflexively fell as she asked and she immediately regretted it.  Her stomach spun as she spied the dizzying drop, a gloomy mist hiding the bottom, if there was one at all.  Wooden suspension bridges crisscrossed the nothing, linking together towers and other holes in the rock walls.  “No.  Absolutely not.  Nothing in this world is going to get me onto that,” Vildania warned, shaking her head and taking a few steadying steps backwards.<br>
<br>
“We have to keep going,” Vildarn insisted.<br>
<br>
“I am not trusting my life to some orc built bundle of sticks and thread!”<br>
<br>
“We’ll be fine.”<br>
<br>
“No!”<br>
<br>
With a sigh the shadow knight turned to Nogarl and raised an expectant eyebrow.  Before Vildania had a chance to react the troll picked her up and easily tossed her over his shoulder, as nonchalantly as though he were slinging his backpack.  “Much better,” Vildarn nodded.  He started across the bridge, both men ignoring the cleric’s colorful curses and threats and concentrating on their surroundings.  The view was quite spectacular, like nothing either had ever seen before, and both suspected that the end of their task must be near.<br>
<br>
Once the cursing had quieted Nogarl put Vildania down and she sullenly followed, glaring poisonously at her companions.  They encountered a few guards on the bridges but managed to quickly dispatch them, and finally they scrambled up one last bridge to stand in another stone archway.  A gloomy mist made it difficult to see into the room, but they were able to spot a large orc, more elaborately dressed than the others they had encountered.<br>
<br>
“That must be him, Hoghul Xut,” Vildarn whispered.  “I’ll get his attention.”<br>
<br>
“Wait, there may be others with him, we need a better view,” his sister protested.<br>
<br>
“We’ll be spotted and lose our surprise if we go any closer.”<br>
<br>
“It’s too dangerous.”<br>
<br>
“I’m willing to risk it,” he insisted.  Stepping forward he silenced any further arguments by casting a spell, seeking to engulf Hoghul in darkness.  Alerted to danger a horde of angry orcs suddenly spilled forth out of the mist and charged the trio of intruders.<br>
<br>
“RUN!” Nogarl shouted.<br>
<br>
They ran.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Even later…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
“You!”  The troll poked a gnarled finger across the table at the Teir’dal sulking on the other side.  “No more rush in, slay tings!”<br>
<br>
“Yes, you’ve lost your leading privileges,” Vildania agreed, wincing as she sipped her wine.  They had retreated to the Maiden’s Fancy to regroup and drown their sorrows.  Another drink or two and she wouldn’t feel the bruises anymore, something she greatly looked forward to.  Deciding not to reply, the shadow knight instead beckoned for another drink, and they sat in silence again.<br>
<br>
“It’ll be better next time,” he finally spoke up.  “At least now we’ve a better idea of what to expect.”<br>
<br>
“I suppose,” Vildania shrugged.  After all, she thought, it couldn’t get much worse, could it?<br>
<br>
Could it?<br>
<br>
Sighing, she took a long drink.  Somehow she had the feeling this was going to be the start of a very long and painful series of adventures… <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tayana>Tayana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/03 3:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.ripway.com/2003-11/39539/fel_crouch.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The First Steps of the Journey</span><hr size=1> Another restless night had driven the cleric out of bed, nervous energy preventing sleep once again.  The past several days had been damnably boring.  Nogarl had gone off on some sort of spiritual retreat; the twins still weren’t sure what it was that their hunting companion was doing, all they had been able to clearly understand were the words “shaman,” “think,” and “hot.”  …They were fairly certain a great deal was lost in translation.  Without the third member of their trio Vildarn and Vildania found themselves with a great deal of free time and very little to fill it with, which was partially responsible for the cleric’s insomnia.  Part, but not all…<br>
<br>
For a time Vildania wandered the streets of Neriak, winding her way through quiet shadows as she tried to walk off her anxiety.  Eventually the girl admitted to herself that she would find no peace this night, and after collecting her brewing materials she settled herself in the Blind Fish and worked on honing her skills.  Annoying though it was this free time had been very helpful in advancing her knowledge of the trade.<br>
<br>
Hours later Vildania returned home, arms laden with bottles of her latest batch of alcoholic experiments.  Slowly she pulled the door shut behind her, careful not to unbalance herself and send her burden crashing to the floor.  With a relieved sigh she set the bottles down on the table, and then took a moment to dust herself off before crossing to the door to the other room.  Vildania paused in the doorway, scowling at the sight before her.  Empty brandy bottles littered the floor, one tucked in the crook of her brother’s arm as he slept in a tangled sprawl.  Apparently he’d helped himself to the stock she kept for sampling and study.  Again.<br>
<br>
Where is that meat cleaver he calls a sword, I’m going to behead him this time… she thought sourly, glancing around the dark room.  Though her hands itched to take up the weapon Vildania took a deep, calming breath.  She couldn’t kill her twin.  At least not today.  The cleric had plans for him today.  Instead of reaching for the sword, Vildania picked up a pitcher of water and proceeded to pour it over her sleeping brother’s head.<br>
<br>
Sputtering curses Vildarn sat up and glared at his sister, who watched him expressionlessly.  “We’re leaving in ten minutes,” she informed him.<br>
<br>
“I’m not going anywhere.”  He scowled down at his soggy blanket and pillow.  Shaking his head he sent a spray of droplets flying from the ends of his hair, and then groggily stumbled across the room and helped himself to his sister’s bed.  Vildania rolled her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Yes you are.  It’s the least you can do since you stole my brandy.  From now on I’m going to start storing some of my failed attempts here too, and I won’t heal you if you go blind from drinking one.”<br>
<br>
Vildarn cursed under his breath.  “Fine.  This better be good.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, I promise you’ll thank me for this one,” she assured.<br>
<br>
<br>
Side by side the twin Teir’dal crouched in the shadow of a tall tree, two pairs of violet eyes scanning the shoreline.  They had traveled through the filthy streets of Freeport, something neither had done before, and had been transported to the small, sunny island.  Vildania led silently, offering no explanation as to where they were going or why, though her eagerness was evident in the spring in her steps.<br>
<br>
“What are we looking for?” he whispered.  The cleric held up a hand in warning, and then pointed up the hillside.<br>
<br>
“There,” she murmured.  Leisurely walking down the hill was a female wood elf, oblivious to their presence.  Dark hair floated around her shoulders, framing a face with delicate features and soft blue eyes.  The shapely elf was clad in armor that revealed more pale skin than it protected, and the halberd she carried looked a bit rusty from unuse.  Vildania smiled.<br>
<br>
“It’s a Feir’dal,” the shadow knight frowned, slightly confused.  Often they came across wood elves in their travels, the tree huggers seemed to infest the Plane of Knowledge along with their high elf brethren.  Why was this one special?  <br>
<br>
“A Sister of Erollisi,” Vildania corrected.  Grinning, she raised her hands and began casting a spell, suddenly rooting the startled wood elf into place.  Realizing his sister’s intentions the shadow knight raised his heavy two handed sword and advanced.  Determinedly the girl stood her ground and faced off against the dark elf, but quickly fell to her knees after two mighty swings nearly split her in half.  A blow from the cleric’s viciously spiked club tore jagged furrows in the elf’s lovely face, and then Vildania grabbed her brother’s arm, stopping him from making the killing blow.<br>
<br>
“Wait, dalninuk.  Let her suffer a bit first,” she advised.  Blue eyes looked pleadingly up at the two Tier’dal, wordlessly begging for mercy.  Head tilted to the side, the cleric of Innoruuk let her gaze travel over the broken body at her feet, noting the contrast of bright blood against pale skin, listening to the gurgle of wheezing, struggled breath.  Vildania was certain she had never seen anything so beautiful.<br>
<br>
“Th… the Sisterhood of Erollisi… and the Champions of Faydark… shall… avenge my… d… death!” the wood elf promised, her words interspersed with rattling coughs.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps,” Vildarn nodded, “But not today.”  With a final slash he permanently silenced the Feir’dal, a slight spray of blood raining over the twins.  After a moment he turned to Vildania.  “Are there more of them here?”<br>
<br>
“Yes,” she smiled, “Many more.”  Licking her lips the cleric savored the taste of her enemy’s blood.  “Many more indeed…”<br>
<br>
“You were right,” the shadow knight grinned.  “I will thank you for this.” <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Vildania D'Varr, Priestess of Innoruuk</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1227.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1227.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1227.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1227.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
