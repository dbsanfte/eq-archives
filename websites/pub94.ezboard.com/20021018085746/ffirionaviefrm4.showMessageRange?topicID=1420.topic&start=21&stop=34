I don't really think they should be discussed over market. If someone decides to, I won't snap at them, I will probably just not pay attention. Personally I don't feel the marketplace is a good forum for these discussions.<br>
<br>
What I am talking about is ALL game related OOC. We're talking about spawn times, weapon delay, damage ratio, haste caps, video/sound issues, zone bugs, crashes, questions on mobs, advice on where to hunt etc. All of these have to do with game mechanics and are not IC. This is the kind of stuff that I will respond to and discuss. Frankly I could care less what is going on with Pakistan, Jordan or Britney unless MJ just KSed Quillmane from you, Britney is wondering if a WS or a Lammy is better in your primary or Pakistan is about to wake the sleeper.<br>
<br>
BUT, if people want to talk about it on market, I probably won't flame them, I'll just let it go in one ear and out the other so-to-speak - it will scroll up pretty fast anyways, once so-and-so /auc WTB: Vindi BP for the 5th time in 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
ALL of my posts were about EQ related stuff. I don't talk about world events with the rest of the EQ community. I talk about world events with my coworkers at lunch or my girlfriend after work.<br>

But touching on what communication channels are IC. There is only say and distance-limited shout (which was made into zone wide, and thus very OOC). So that leaves only say.<br>
<br>
So now are those advocating default OOC speak in other channels saying that just because technology permits us in EQ to speak telepathically that we should automatically expect OOC speak in those modes? sigh...<br>

<br>
I fail to see your point.  Are you suggesting that these are IC modes?  And what do you mean by 'advocating default OOC speak in other channels?'  When you say things like default, or other channels, you should really specify what you mean.<br>
<br>
I think it is wrong to flame people just for not saying OOC WTS SCHW as opposed to WTS SCHW.  One argument was that we are lazy and inconsiderate in not typing an extra 4 characters before our market message.<br>
<br>
I don't get what you're arguing for though.  Are you saying that we should think of some way to incorporate being linked together in /chat channels as some form of roleplay? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueyston.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eyston</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 10:57:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   blah</span><hr size=1> Okay.<br>
<br>
So market channel is completely unable to be RP'ed?  In fact, you can't RP there because it does not fit in with a plausible RP origin?<br>
<br>
How does /tell fit in with RP?  Every single person is telepathic?  So now you can't RP in tells.<br>
<br>
How does /guild fit in with RP?  Every single person when they join a guild gets a special little chip inserted into their head?  So now you can't RP in /guild.<br>
<br>
So many things you take for granted in EQ do not make RP sense, but on this server, people ignore it and RP anyways.  Quit trying to play some trump card that RP isn't allowed here and deal with it.<br>

Given the barrage of telepathic modes available to us, we have the choice of making our conversations IC as well. It really is up to us to make every interaction we make as IC as possible. I can and will understand the need for OOC like some posters have discussed, but I do not think it right that these channels are automatically/by default thought of as OOC as opposed to SAY.<br>
<br>
I am not saying we should imagine some way of explaining why we are even conversing telepathically. I am saying why can't we converse in other channels in the same style as when we do in SAY?<br>

But a few bad apples had to get on it and use it for shouting matches and then when they are asked to stop they just started spamming the channel and flaming people. We tried to start a RPmarket channel, but when you split your market you have few people on the channel and then to make matters worse some of those same people joined the channel and stayed on long enough to become owners of the channel and then they pw protected the channel. So everyone just went back to market and hoped for the best.<br>
     Trying to say that everything but /say is automatically OOC on this server is just foolish when a large percentage of the people left 40 other OOC servers to come here. When I listen to the market channel it usually is not to bad since most of the people on my ignore list come from there. *giggle*<br>

Everyone defends the language restrictions and wishes they were more harsh (like they originally were), yet would have no problem using a chat channel for RP that circumvents these rules? Sounds like of a case of wanting the cake and eating it too.<br>

What about /chat tells? Those work on the same principle only they go to a specific person. Would you tell everyone they need to RP over /chat tells? What is the use of an actual /tell then?<br>

Hrmm, telepathic link huh? How do you explain no language barriers over this telepathic link, a hive mind? Singular conciousness?
