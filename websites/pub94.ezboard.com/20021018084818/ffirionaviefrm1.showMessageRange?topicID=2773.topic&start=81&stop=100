Waking the sleeper really doesn't slow down another guild that much really. People can still get primal and if you are willing to farm luclin encounters you can be successful while skipping ST all together. ST/primal/SODs do not make the same difference that they used to make and I am sure POP will make it even less so. <br>

After the change there will be ancient prismatic, which isn't quite as good, though it still has the proc which is of course the main point.<br>
<br>
None the less, it does screw over a zone which is tactically very important in a guild's raid progression.  Either by making it boring and requiring mind numbing farming to get primal, but still losing unique warder loot, as is currently what happens, or by making it harder, though about the same speed, getting a less perfect form of primal, and still losing the good warder loot items.  /cheer.<br>

<br>
Ya know, this probably wouldn't even have brough up if a lot of the current AS weren't in BoW on Torv(Woke the sleeper)<br>
<br>
But more importantly, a guild that use to push us around, now doesn't have the keys for 4th, and after it being made public that they would wake the sleeper as soon as their monks get their tunics.<br>
<br>
Reputations are so important in this game .. If Sleeper is awoken by Reso, don't even cry when you brought it amongst yourselves.  FnF's dirty laundry was aired, and we found it out .. AS has always showed true FFA, that they were willing to do whatever for the best of their guild(I respect that, mind you) .. But waking Sleeper on Torv is quite a reason to deny a guild here from ST.<br>
<br>
And before some of you go off half cocked saying this is the general census of Reso, understand that these are my opinions.. If I was running the shot, you woulda experinced some zone wide DT's on Saturday.  Hopefully something can be worked out, but the only people who merit to come here and bitch on these boards are folks in guilds such as Ebon Storm, Dreadstorm, Clan Werre, and some other rising guilds.  They're the ones that would get the complete shaft if it was awoken, and I hate to say it, but FnF and AS, ya'll asked for it if it does happen.<br>

<br>
I've only been once.  I thought 3 per warder was the norm.  Add in 1 from MotG, and then FA, and you have 11.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine only getting 1 or 2 primals clearing 3 warders, FA, and MotG, are you sure?<br>
<br>
The point wasn't so much about the number of primal you get as much as it was the force needed to get them.  The number you get is arbitrary to the point of my post.<br>
<br>
And I'd hate to be punished by Resolution because BoW awoke the sleeper on Torv.  How fair is that?<br>

<br>
I never said you should hide and be ashamed of it, that's an assumption.  However, when you sit back and say waking the sleeper is evil, etc, when your guild planned on doing it [hence dirty laundry], that person is a hypocrit.<br>
<br>

<br>
So we should sit back while we know one guild plans on waking it once they get what they want?  We should let our competition get what they want then allow them to wake it so nobody else can get it?  Please help me understand that logic.<br>

<br>
You want to fully understand, read Okane's thread.  That'll sum it up for you.  This is a heated topic, I know it.. The only reason I even responded is because of a few certain people in guilds in competition saying its so wrong, when they've either A) Planned on doing it already B) have done it already.  If people are going to come here and say they're so right for their thoughts when they're coming straight from hypocrits, you definately have some issues.<br>
<br>
I could really care less what happens, if the officers from the 3 guilds work something out, fine.. But I personally dont see that happening.<br>

I'd say wait until the new ST goes live.  Also, make sure all 4 warders are spawned before you start the wakeup.  Then, take out all 4 as quick as possible, hopefully under 72 minutes, which is often the magic spawn-trigger number for tougher rings and such.  So far, no other server has done the wake up like that with all 4 up and then killed within a short time frame.<br>
<br>
If you think about how a lot of the Luclin spawns work, doing the wakeup this way might have some nice effect other than starting a buggy zone-wide DT script in all the dragon zones.  The dev's have been wanting time to fix the wakeup script for ST since forever, too.

Even members from the highest guilds retire from the guild or quit the game and new members are brought in. If the highest guild has enough ST gear now, that doesn't mean they will 6 months from now.<br>
<br>
Waking the sleeper to set guilds back would only set T2 guilds back for a short period of time. There are still many places to equip that are equal to or better than ST. The main reason everyone wants ST to stay asleep I think is because of those couple cool items (I say cool because the Gnome Mask isn't exactly vital) and because it's easy to get good weapons and also because getting to ST is a rite of passage just like getting to the planes for the first time, VP, Vex Thal, HS, Seb etc.<br>
<br>
I think Reso has earned the right to wake the sleeper since they were there first, but I don't think they should. On the other hand, if they leave him up and some T2 guild gets in there, pharms the place then wakes him just to get the &quot;server first&quot; out from under Reso, it will create a shitstorm the likes of which this server has never seen.<br>

So, you think because a couple of members of AS were in a guild on another server that woke the sleeper gives you reason to deny the entire guild from ST?  Give me a break.  I'm glad you arent an officer of your guild because you obviously would not have valid reasoning for your actions.<br>

and I said before, I probably would have supported waking the sleeper to slow down competition at the time because I was short-sighted...MAYBE it slowed down Sacrosanct/Monolith by a month, if that... but now there are 5 or so guilds scavenging through the zone hoping to get ONE primal, 1h or 2h, a trip...in hindsight I don't think it was a good idea...and now Monolith (basically the guild that was trying to be slowed down) is about as far behind as they were when sleeper awoke, and they're done with sleeper's....<br>

 gee, what a freaking tragedy of Greek Epic proportion that SoDs, Primal et. al will actually be badges of the pioneers and won't be readily available on eBay and Bazaar by the incoming pharmers. Good I say. It's been a year fellas, is about time.

I wasn't in FnF when Fuvi posted about them wanting to wake the Sleeper.  Quite a few other people are in there now that weren't before and some of these people you are talking to ... Viren and Kzan are not in FnF at this moment.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't want the Sleeper awakened.  The &quot;ONLY&quot; time I was ever in favor of it was when FnF and Reso were fighting over it simply because I hate hearing my friends (either guild) bitch about my other friends (other guild).  Now that I am in one of them it's even moreso.  I'm glad that most of my friends in Reso are willing to not give a damn about guild politics when we hang out.<br>
<br>
If you wake the Sleeper for new loot then you are a little more justified in my own opinion but still realize you are denying a lot of people and yes I mean the Dreadstorms and AS's and people who haven't done a lot of farming in ST things they want.  If it's simply to keep them from getting it ... well then I guess you guys have become what everyone feared AS would be if they ever got enough people huh?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah to this day I have still never heard anything from Fire and Fury (looking through old posts and stuff could be deleted or what) since I have been in there indicating that we want to awaken the Sleeper.<br>

Anyone know exactly which servers still have a sleeping Sleeper besides FV?<br>

If the thought of an FnF monk in a shroud, or Lacus in a shroud, is enough to make you want to deny it to every other monk on the server .. then I think you have a vendetta.<br>
<br>
And Zsus, look harder.  Fuvi didn't make the post up.  If you do find the post, you'll see mine agreeing with waking it.  I was on the stupid side of the fence once, which is why I probably am trying to change everyones mind so much.<br>
