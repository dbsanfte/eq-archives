Rerollitis.  Perhaps this will be my final re-roll.  Perhaps not.  After trying out classes I've never played, I have returned to the class that I first fell in love with.  I am a druid again simply because, in a group or solo, it is the class I know and play best.  If you are of like mind and seeking a partner, group or just to RP, please look me up.  I look forward to becoming a respected member of the community.  It is such a refreshing change to play on a server where my roleplaying isn't greeted with strange looks and comments of &quot;rping loser, i owns yous, give me plats and ph4t l3wts, I'm l33t, kthxla~&quot;.  Anyway, I hope to meet many of you in game, and now, here is a bit of my story  /END OOC<br>
<br>
The forest was her home, and every tree, every path, every yard of it was known to her, instantly familiar.  On normal days, her feet would track through the Lessar Faydark silently, confidently.  All of her 19 years of life had been spent under the canopy of trees,in the perpetual darkness of the forest, years spent training, learning, living.<br>
<br>
Today however, her feet moved uncertainly.  The path indeed was known, but this journey was unwanted.  Selfishness pulled at her, drawing her deep into the forest, drawing her away from the path, but she stayed on course.  She would have preferred to stay  in the forest her whole life, living as she always had, yet she knew she could not.  The Mother had need of her.<br>
<br>
Sylvinea has memories of the past, not all pleasant, and the painful ones have disappeared.  She knows no birth parents.  The only Mother she has ever known has been the Great Mother, and to her she is eternally devoted.    Under the Moon and the forest she learned the ways of the wolf, and the way of the Fae.  Those that she calls family and friends are not elven.  And they have prepared her well for the trials that lie ahead.<br>
<br>
Yet even so prepared, leaving the Lessar Faydark, on route to Kelethin, is painful.  Everything she has ever known is to be left behind once she crosses to the otherside.  She remembers what Grsaraeg, alpha wolf of the forest taught her of the tricks and lies of the so called &quot;civilized&quot; peoples.  She recalls stories of wolves hunted not for hide nor meat, but for sport, not by the dark races, or even by the young humans, but by Tunare's own children.  She remembers the one frightful day when a hunting party had come to the tower, not for orcs or spiders, but for pixies and fairys alike.  She absent mindedly handles the pouch the Fae had given her before departing, clinking the shiny coins together inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remember Sylvinea, that while these coins will help you get started in your new life, there are those even in Kelethin that worship not Tunare, but rather Platinum trinkets like you now carry.  They can be of help, but there are those who would slit your throat for them.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words of the Fae Queen still echoed in her head.  The entrance to the Greater Faydark now lay before her, and fear and uncertainty tightened its grip.  She could turn back.  She could return to the Fae, to the wolves, and they would not think any less of her.  After all, here they all stayed.  Why should she leave the security of the forest, why should her life be forever changed , while they stayed behind.  Tears welled up in her eyes.  It wasn't fair.  <br>
<br>
As the first tear ran down her cheek, her vision and mind clouded.  She felt pain and fear suddenly grip at her, suffocating emotions stronger than any experienced before. She dropped to one knee, petrified, eyes burning,  She reached with one hand to attempt to clear them, to wipe the tears of fire away from her face, and she heard her name spoken softly, gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother....&quot; she stammered, looking up, seeing through the haze a figure of light, of beauty.  And with an unspoken exchange realized that the pain, the fear was but a small sample of that felt by her Mother, and the tears came more freely, from tears of loss to tears of shame, she buried her head in her hands.<br>
<br>
And her Mother came to her then, and picked her up to her feet.  Sylvinea fought back the tears , sniffled, and looked deep in to her Mothers eyes, and in those eyes she saw the reflection of the corruption, the evil that had taken root on Norrath, the evil that wounds and threatens, the evil that had upset the balance.  And in that instant, Sylvinea knew she could no longer stay in the forest, that her path had been laid out long before.  Her Mother bent slightly, and kissed her gently on the forehead.<br>
<br>
And then she was alone, standing at the entrance to the Greater Faydark once again, only this time without the doubt or selfishness that plagued her before.  And with a deep breath and a single look back, she stepped across the border, into the unknown.<br>
<br>
/OOC  Ok, not my best, but beginnings are always the most difficult for me.  Once I get some time played and more of an attachment the stories will get better, but it serves as an introduction.  Anyway, see you all in game. /OOC off<br>
