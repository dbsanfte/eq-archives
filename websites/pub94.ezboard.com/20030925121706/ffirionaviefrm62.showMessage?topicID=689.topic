<br>
Given a few weeks to mull it over, I've changed my mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think they used their position to essentially write new law into effect, not interpret existing law.<br>
<br>
While I wholly agree with the conclusions they came to (that government has no business whatsoever regulating what people do in their bedrooms or how they do it), I have to concede that their decision isn't based on an interpretation of existing constitutional law.  Just because I think something <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>should</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be constitutionally protected doesn't change the fact that it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>isn't</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and it's not the Supreme Court's job to put it in there.<br>
<br>
They pretty much come right out and say it, when they talk about changing attitudes of the public, blah blah blah, etc.  If public attitudes had changed that much the public would have modified the constitution itself (either protecting such behaviour on the national level, or prohibiting those kinds of laws on the local level).  Involving themselves in the politics of the case sets a bad precedent too, because it just invites more of the same not only on their level but at levels below them. <br>
<br>
So anyways, I'm changing my mind.  I thought that qualified as news, so there ya go.<br>

PS: What prompted the change was a little bit the discussion that went on in that thread, but also all the talk of late about the psychotically Right-wing judges Bush is trying to appoint to the court... which got me thinking about how bad it is that people are trying to short-cut the democratic process by letting a panel of 9 essentially create law through skewed &quot;interpretations&quot; of existing ones... which got me thinking about that case again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twotribes>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 1019<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/25/03 10:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I changed my mind...</span><hr size=1> Funny, every Judge nominated by Bush has the endorsement of the very body's of judges and lawyers that the Democrats claimed were essential.

The problem with that argument Hatter, is what in the constitution supports that?  Nothing I can see.  To me it looks like a chain Federal &gt; States &gt; People.<br>
<br>
The State HAS a law.  Nothing in the constitution describes that particular rights are reserved to each group.<br>
<br>
The way I read this clause is: Anything not governed by law is the right of the People.  If the fed/state/local governments create a new law, that represents the People giving up those rights to the regulation of the Government, by way of their duly elected representatives.  Should the People later reconsider, they would reclaim those rights by changing their representatives with those that reflected this new view.<br>

Actually, Legislatures CAN pass any law they want... that doesn't mean they are Constitutional or correct.  Presumably the Federal Courts would knock down such laws.  That follows my chain theory quite well actually.<br>

Ah...  But the clause you originally referenced talks about anything NOT delineated in the Constitution is reserved to the States and the People.  Virtually every law in the State you live in is not talked about in the Constitution, so how was it decided that it was the State's Right to regulate such things and not the People?  I still think my answer is best - the People through their Representatives in State Legislature, effectively decide for themselves.<br>
<br>
Your State Legislature may pass an entirely new Law tomorrow, effectively pulling yet one more Right from the 'People' column to the 'State' column...  I can only assume that is Constitutional because those laws are enacted via the due process of a democratic republic.<br>

While I agree with this statement, I ddon't think your application seems correct.  How can the Judiciary be expected to automatically know how to parcel &quot;everything else&quot; between State and People?  It can't.  All the Judiciary can do is examine a law to make sure it doesn't violate or contradict  law with greater precedence, qv The Constitution.<br>
<br>
However, rereading your quote of Amendment X I think I have a solution:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> &quot;Amendment X<br>
<br>
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Note the Key Word 'respectively.'  This Amendment talks about two classifications: <br>
<br>
1) Powers Not Delegated to the US<br>
2) Powers prohibited to the States<br>
<br>
The use of 'respectively' seems to imply that anything in #1, Powers Not Delegated to the US are reserved to the States, and anything in #2, Powers prohibited to the States, are reserved for the people.<br>
<br>
If that interpretation is accurate, then it would seem that all rights not claimed by the US revert to the States, EXCEPT for what has been specifically reserved to the People, ie the Bill of Rights.<br>
<br>
This does seem to follow logically that the States enact whatever Laws they wish as long as they don't contradict the Constitution.  By your interpretation anything a State tried to legislate would be constititionally shaky until a Federal Court decided if it was a State or People right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themadhatter106>The Mad Hatter 10 6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/03 12:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I changed my mind...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By your interpretation anything a State tried to legislate would be constititionally shaky until a Federal Court decided if it was a State or People right. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not true... everything a State tried to legislate would be totally legal, UNTIL someone takes enough grievance with the State to sue... THEN the Judiciary steps in, and only then.  The Judiciary refers to all courts... not Federal ones... any court can weigh the &quot;Constitutionality&quot; (is that a word, or did I just make that up?) of a Law... it is  up to either party to appeal if they do not like what the lower courts say.

The U.S. Supreme Court is the final stop in a LONG LONG road of legal wrestling, and they can decide if they even want to hear the case. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That has nothing to do with the point I am trying to make about your argument.  Let me try to explain what I am thinking...  It seems to me that your interpretation of Amendment 10 means that if a State wants to pass ANY LAW... Let's say, relating to Traffic...  &quot;All cars must stop at a Railroad Crossing and wait 30 seconds before proceeding&quot; that can be challenged as Unconstitutional, because under Amendment 10, we have NO idea whether that is a power reserved to the States or People until the Court decides.<br>
<br>
I think that view can't be right.  A challenge on Constitutional Grounds should specify exactly why it would violate the Constitution.<br>
<br>
You also haven't answered either of my interpretations with any retort as to why yours makes more sense.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themadhatter106>The Mad Hatter 10 6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/03 2:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I changed my mind...</span><hr size=1> It is obvious that neither of us is going to budge from their respective interperetation.  I can tell you I certainly will not be budging because I believe I am correct, just as much as you believe you are correct.  We should respect each others opinion and agree to disagree.  Now that being said, I will try to explain my view one more time... not take yours apart.<br>
<br>
I believe that the 10th ammendment established 3 levels of government, Federal, State, and Personal.  Each of these levels of government enact legislation or rules... The Federal Laws, State Laws, and your own moral sense of right and wrong. <br>
<br>
The Judiciary system exists to determine at which level certain laws should lay.  It does this through legal review when someone brings grievance before it.  In a since, the Judiciary sits on the Bench and says, &quot;No you can't do that... that law should be held at the State level, or that law is something that people can decide on their own.&quot;<br>
<br>
Each law case is special and treated as such... that is where the legal term &quot;presidence&quot; comes from.  It is the Court's job to establish precidence, it was set up this way because the Founding Fathers knew that society, people, and technology change, and with it, so does legal precidence.  That is why Roe vs. Wade made Abortion legal, but with another panel of Justices on another day of review if someone else sued... they could possibly make it illegal again.<br>
<br>
Now in the particular case that about Texas... I am glad that the Supreme Court struck the law down... but I do not agree with their legal brief if what Syll says is true (which I have no reason to disblieve).  Like I said... if I were a judge, I personally would voted to strike the law and based my determination on the 10th amendment.  <br>
<br>
I would say that the 10th ammendment establishes personal law, or law of the people,  and determining who a person can or cannot have sex with is certainly a decision that should belong to that person and that person alone.  A Statewide law that regluates sex between two mentally capable, legal adults should not be regulated by the State... it is definately something a person can decide for on their own, without state interference.<br>
<br>
Judges are paid to make such determinations, however the people are free to go up a level if they do not agree with that particular judge... hence the appeal system, and that is why Supreme Courts (State and Federal) are made of an odd number of Justices, so a majority can make the determination, with no chance of a stalemate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now... I am sorry that I have not been able to illistrate my belief for you... some things are just plain difficult to convey on a message board.  At any rate, I am exhuasted and ready for bed.  I might post more later.  Not sure if I have anything else to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1576<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/03 2:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I changed my mind...</span><hr size=1> I have no problem agreeing to disagree, which is what I shall do.  My final word on the matter is that I do not believe the Framers intended to set up Personal Morality/Beliefs as a 3rd tier of legal standing.  I believe the 10th Amendment was simply to underscore the idea that all persons have certain inalienable rights.  For example, the concept of people as Serfs is antithetical to the ideals of the US, but NOT necessarily unheard of in other places at the time.<br>
<br>
By stating that Powers not reserved to the Federal Government are the Province of the states, and Powers that the Federal Government and States are explicitly denied are reserved to the People is to underscore that those specific rights BELONG to the People.  We do not have Free Speech, or Freedom from Self-Incrimination simply out of the generosity of the State, who can choose to revoke it as they see fit.  Those ARE the Rights RESERVED to the People.<br>
<br>
It implies to me that the Bill of Rights is something that can not and should not be repealed.  In fact, I suppose if one were to take my interpretation to the extreme, it would be Unsonstitutional to even attempt to Repeal any of the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution, and in the event the US wished to do so, Amendment X would have to be repealed before 1-9 could be touched. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showPrevMessage?topicID=689.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showNextMessage?topicID=689.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=689.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.threadControl?topicID=689.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=689.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=689.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62>In the Real Life News</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
