Some random thoughts though:<br><br>1 Consider playing a class you already know and love.  There are enough differences on Firiona Vie to provide a &quot;fresh&quot; experience without having to play a class that you haven't played before.<br><br>2 You don't like to solo? Well, if you plan on playing exclusively when your friend is on, then you are fine.  Just make something that will be able to function reasonably well with just your friend.  Because it can be hard to find groups. That is just a fact.<br><br>3 I have always found wizards to be welcome in my groups, just for their fire power, and often just for the company!  It can get lonely at times on Firiona Vie....<br><br>Okay, let the flood response begin! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>((Oh, and Iksar ARE evil!

Glad ye decided to make the transition over!<br><br>Second off. Being &quot; cut out &quot; of the end game really shouldn't be a concern for you. One thing that I have noticed about this server that contrasts with blue servers I've played on is that you actually make close friends ( it looks like you're lucky and brought one with you already! Huzzah! ) Assuming that you're a nice person, who RPs and makes a general effort to be plesent, work well in a group etc ( iffin ye already have 4 50+ toons this should not be an issue ) then regardless of what class you play you'll be welcome.<br><br>From my experiance what happens is that as you go along through your life as a charachter you gain a reputation amongst your peers. This can be for good or for ill depending on your play style. When you form relationships with other people who view you as a worthy ally regardless of class, then you find yourself being invited to more groups. <br><br>I would not say that by any means are specific classes ousted from the grouping scene. Specific people are however, by this I mean, if you are a compleate goober ( or a d00d ) and do things to get your group killed simply because you don't like to listen to direction, or miss play your class in a horrifying manner, or just plain old don't care about your group mates, well of COURSE no one is goona wanna group with you! ( note, not insinuating that you would do any of these things, just giving examples )<br><br>So in short. Play what you wish. If you want to be a Wizard, be a wizard. If you wanna be a Beastlord, be a Beastlord, if your friend is a Mage, great! Mages can be awesome in a group!<br><br>And I agree with what Wraithbane said in his sig, Tis much better to have character than to have wealth, and that goes for any kind of wealth * nods * ( unless it's a wealth of character LOL ) <br><br>/waves at Wraithbane<br><br>So get out there, find somethin ye like and play! Best of luck to ye! And if you happen to need encouragement whilst about in the lands of Norrath, feel free to gimme a tell.
