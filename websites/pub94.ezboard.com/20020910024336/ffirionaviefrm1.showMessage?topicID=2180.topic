<br>
It's a lot more quiet than most the other servers. True since the rules changed there has been a bit more... action than my text bar likes in colors of green and red. But, there's alot more roleplayers (as opposed to d00ds on other servers). It's more of a &quot;homey&quot; environment, especially if you get into a guild and make good friends. I like it alot, this is why I haven't gone back to any of my PvP or regular servers, I just like it better here.<br>

And in my eyes, you have a very good chance of finding what you want - IF you are willing to go look for it.Before or after the rule changes, the main thing still is (imho) that you will people to rp back with you, if you approach them that way. If not, things can get lonely fast. I have not really reached the high end of it all, but it is true, the ranks are thinning - rerolls, people taking breaks, leaving. And no alts. Which means more oddball groups (hmm.. 4 necros, 2 sk's raiding orcs in the waste ?), and more often than not groups which wont give you the best 'xp per time' ratio. But then again - if you are true to the rp aspect, that shouldnt matter.<br>
<br>
One little note to alts.. The fact that you cant have any except with a second account is both blessing and curse. Blessing, cos most people you find will watch their reputation a little more than on 'blue' servers. Curse, because it can get boring, and some get infected with 'rerollitis'<br>
<br>
Still, i came over to FV, and all the time i peeked back, i turned around, thinking  no.. better a lone day on FV than this.<br>

I rerolled several times before finally settling on my current charcters.  I say characters because I play 2 accounts at the same time.<br>
<br>
On FV if you play a single account and are not self sufficient, it can be difficult.  Finding a group is harder because our server population is lower than most.  Until recently, shout was limited range and languages were a more difficult barrier.  If you were evil, you couldnt group with good aligned characters.  All of these things have been rermoved.  Granted, you don't start out with a common language as on other servers, but it isn't that difficult to learn now.<br>
<br>
As has been said, because of the character limit, your reputation tends to be more valuable on FV and is more closely guarded.  Twinking and PLing is somewhat rare since we lack the proliferation of alts.  I think this is a good thing.  <br>
<br>
Our economy is radically different than that of most servers.  Plat is harder to come by and prices tend to be lower.  Low end gear can still be sold on FV.<br>
<br>
There are only a few guilds that are planes capable on FV.  Even at the high end, turnover is more frequent.  Why?  Once you have gotten to the top, if you want to try another class/race combo, you have to reroll (delete your old character) or go to another server.<br>
<br>
So...before jumping into FV weigh these things carefully.  Begging is frowned upon.  Don't expect someone to walk up and twink you with some awesome item.  Ports are somewhat harder to come by and the money to pay for them is more difficult to obtain.   Groups are more difficult to form, but not impossible.  Having consideration for others and treating them as you would have them treat you is more important on FV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/02 7:47:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thoughts...</span><hr size=1> By the way, try to get to know some people who hang around these boards.

(I, and my character, have a very low idiot tolerance, as Enchanters tend to die horrible, painful deaths when even one member of the party &quot;goes rogue&quot; or is just a moron.)<br>

On the plus side, if you get a small group of friends together, the low population lets you literally go anywhere and do anything; you can even RP while doing it. <p>Illudin<br>

I've had so many friends leave up to now since I came that I basically have to refresh my friends list every month or two.<br>
<br>
Also find a guild where you fight at the same time they do... else you risk being stuck alone a LOT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 629<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/02 7:24:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2180.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thoughts on this server</span><hr size=1> Reputation is EVERYTHING.<br>
