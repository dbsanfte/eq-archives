~actually i really dislike Coin/Rollen, thought that was general knowledge, start paying more attention from now on, Jr.  I repeat i bashed you for being a snippy little brat, i don't give a shit what guild you're in.  But i remain that it's still fitting to see you so savvy after a few weeks.  <br>
<br>
My point is, just keep quiet and hit attack, lay hands, and kick like you were hired to do hon.  Leave the bragging and flaming to the guys with the credibility(or lack therein) who've been there for more than a minute, k hon?  and the arguement that there's some possibility you have x char on x server ~ bears no fucking relevance,  because you're a 59 paladin here, and anyone can say they've had others.....but i'm still willing to bet you didn't.  o i don't give a shit either way though $ people generally don't make paladins after playing several other classes to 60 ~ only person besides you who would proclaim that is Coinfist, but he's a moron in the first place so i'd believe him.  so you're the shit now, good for you paladin, good for you.  <br>

<br>
Last post = crit nuke in terms of &lt;---- AoW's % hps...64%!<br>
<br>
Work &gt; me this morning so I'll address two points:<br>
<br>
1 - Idol/AoW attempts.  We had the benefit of 2 AoW attempts because the statue was up.  On the first run, the Idol (unslowed) went down relatively smoothly and, although there was some concern that healer chat appeared to be a little laggy, we did not experience the spell refresh/ld problem at all.  It looked favorable.  <br>
<br>
Pulled the AoW and it was a nice clean engagement, but almost immediately, the lag and ld's set in.  Speaking for myself, I got off 3 heals (we were experimenting with a cleric and druid ch chain) and then my spell gems would not refresh for approximately 60 seconds.  I announced that I couldn't cast in the healer channel, as a couple of others did, and despite the attempts of the healers to adjust, the chaos made for an unsteady ch chain.  I honestly can't recall what the AoW % was on that attempt, as I was too busy cursing like Jimmy Planedefiler.  We were left with the feeling that we didn't have a fair attempt.<br>
<br>
Statue was up, so we chatted a bit, moved the heal channel to shout as some folks complained that the heal channel was laggy (there's some evidence to suggest that the new channels can contribute and/or are affected by lag), we removed myself and messner from the ch chain (as we both had chronic spell refresh problems) and even had people adjust datarate, graphics options etc...etc... to try to mitigate the lag.<br>
<br>
We pulled statue and idol (slowed and none of the listed problems) and then engaged the AoW again.  Things went nicely to about 85%.  This time around, I noticed a little bit of lag on my end, but nothing like the 60 secondish spell refresh bullshit.  The attempt had that steady, smooth &quot;I think we got it&quot; feeling.  And then other healers started getting fuxored by spell gem refresh -  I vividly recall Braxom (for one) announcing that his gems wouldn't refresh.  Add to that the general chaos of the chain not knowing who can heal and Nikka going LD and you know the end to this Agatha Christie novel. <br>
<br>
So Idol was in fact np unslowed, and as the thread I pointed you to on FoH, our ld and spell refresh problems occured when or shortly after the AoW showed up...yet the unsettling thing of course is that the problem seemed to move around.  Rollen expressed that he feels pulling the AoW to the common pinspot in the Arena contributes to the lag, and I haven't chatted with anyone at this point to know if they're AL and AoW kills last night were plagued with lag and/or lds.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I would rather be able to say that we didn't have a clean shot at a mob then have a ? in my mind because of some other factor - tank transitions do still need work however.<br>
<br>
There you have it, take it or leave it.<br>
<br>
As for Vindi - don't be assinine.  My point in mentioning it is that you can find challenges, where folks learn something new about themselves, in many places in this game.  We had a few folks who figured we couldn't do Vindi with those numbers, and in the end they learned something by being willing to try and die, rather than walk away.  The last part of the previous sentence is one of the many reasons that Reso is firmly number 1 and why the guild is aptly named. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaehunleifong>Jaehun Leifong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Of the Blue Duck Style

Oh and btw- some ppl on this server know who my 1 alt is.  Don't matter to me don't play him no more.  Started a Paladin well because FV is RP preferred and in the early days of me being here I strictly RP.  Then I realized that with the exception of a few notable guilds LOS/Saga there wasn't very much going on RP wise.  So now I rp with those who do so back with me.<br>
<br>
So syd continue sitting in the nexus....and trying to make friends by handing out KEI.........Bribery is the best way to make friends and try to get a good rep on this server isn't it?<br>

Thanks for being willing to check the AS Members posts, think Syd already covered the gist of it though.<br>
<br>
Posting on a massive flame thread and waving your penis at the same time, did you catch a fly in the chopsticks first try too?<br>
<br>
The info starts to trickle in but WHERE ARE MY FUCKING LOGS CATALINE.<br>
<br>
Coin, more hp does make it easier on the healers and transitions but does not add DPS, never claimed he hit for less but seems likely his hp have been reduced.  No worries he's still harder than Vindi, don't let Kurley get you down.<br>
<br>
Vague and misleading statements...<br>
<br>
Ah, Emmah was talking about this<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Asking someone's wife whether or not you can perfrom sexual favors on their spouse is rarely advisable honesty/full disclosure issue again.<br>
<br>
Having &lt;Edit - Personal Information&gt; been married I suppose you can take my opinion for what you want but that's what I posted, now Emmah who &lt;Edit - Personal Information&gt; married to &lt;Edit - Personal Information&gt; apparently thinks it's best for you to ask her/his spouse if you want to perform sexual favors on him/her partner.<br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing it up, although would be helpful if you followed the 4 posting rules, I can make shit up about what you meant to make it seem like you had a reason to post though.  Cause I'm only here to help.<br>
<br>
Y (the he)el r u K&lt;Edit - Personal Information&gt;<br>
<br>
Kurley, I'd keep an eye on the subject line, Rollen is gonna think you're cheating on him. :-/<br>
<br>
Yup, that's what I asked for, you have to state something as fact before we can discuss credibility, I've heard many things with the limbo bar of hp dropping as low as 20 percent for the recent attempts (I heard 3 because you rezzed and rushed him after fail 2 that day) coming to a public forum and laying out the sequence of events the IIAAP are willing to step outside their speciality and dissect was this a we can take down Idol lets do this or we think we can walk out of here with Waii being more than 2'6&quot; attempt.<br>
<br>
Sorry Kurley &lt;- a lie I don't feel bad but gotta work on my PR.<br>
<br>
You waved your penis so I slammed it in the door, I'm not fond of it like Rollen is.<br>
<br>
Jaehun, I'd try a non-competive game like the Sims if you want to all be friends.  Competition between the guilds is in fact an important element of the game, without having other guilds wanting to kill the mobs you do, without other guilds raising the bar about what can be killed, without people setting new standards for HP, DPS or how fast they can do an AA you lose a powerful motivational tool which is helpful to motivate a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Syd is flaming me just because I suicided to get across Tox, so much h8. :-(<br>
<br>
And it's Pour me another Tequila Sheila and lay down and love me again.  I mean everyone is familiar with the big Canadian political sex scandal right?  Simply calling him back to bed without the atleast implied promise of something is unlikely to garner results. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaehunleifong>Jaehun Leifong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Of the Blue Duck Style

I am curious why Sydia doesn't like me? I only remember calling her on the crap she spouted about earning our way into ST when she seemed to think that killing Vindi and Statue in addition to E-Bought toons was earning a guild's way in. Oh well no skin off my back.<br>
