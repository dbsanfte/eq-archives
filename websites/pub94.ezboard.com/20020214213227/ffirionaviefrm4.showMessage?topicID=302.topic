Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for the lively debate.  Believe it or not I found the whole thing quite stimulating, and even though it took me away from my work (I'm spending far too much time trolling this message board), it was actually quite refreshing to break away from the mind-numbing daily grind of my business to reflect and examine things that were said over the whole &quot;Shin Threads&quot; incident.<br>
<br>
Relatively speaking, the whole RP vs. Non-Rp saga was probably the most intense subject on this board to date, and in my opinion it was far from a mud-slinging-fest - which I hope says something about the people within the Firiona Vie community.<br>
<br>
Compared to the server my friends and I just came from - Luclin - the people here are far more civil.  Just check out the Flames and Rants section of that server's message board and you'll probably be appalled at what you read.<br>
<br>
Anyhew, cheers.<br>

Don't get me started on PK.  I played UO when it first came out and I was NOT a fan of player killing - especially since with all the bugs and exploits it was so unfair.<br>
<br>
I remember this time where this fellow and I were mining for ore in some caverns not too far from Britannia.  This fellow had invested his money into a few mules, which he had named individually.  I mean, here we were, the two of us, in a supposed fantasy game of high adventure, banging rocks...<br>
<br>
So anyhew, he loaded up his beloved mules with his ore (about 6 hours worth of ore) and started heading to Britiannia.  Out of nowhere these hoodlems pop out and using a wand that was bugged, insta kill him.  He begged for these creeps not to kill his mules, but of course they did...laughing all the way.  The guy was quite upset, not so much that the incident happened, but rather how unfair the game mechanism was - i.e. a stupid bug makes it so easy for a jerk to wipe out several days work.<br>
<br>
I'm not a PK fan AT ALL.  <br>

I mean, if you are travelling through enemy territory and you get taken down, that's one thing...but when exploiters use things to completely tip the balance in their favour, that is what ruins the PVP concept.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Star Wars Galaxies will address this.  From what I've read, if you become a notorious player killer, the bounty on your head becomes larger and larger and you have more people after you.  Pretty soon, you can't go to the local saloon without a line-up of Bob Fett's waiting to take your head over to the nearest Hutt warlord.<br>
<br>
What you say is very true though.  If you are a part-time player in a PVP type setting, you will assuredly get &quot;owned&quot; by someone who plays more and thus has more opportunity to upgrade gear and/or learn about bugs and exploits.<br>
<br>
My money is on Never Winter Nights...a system that you can run independently and select how you want the rules to run and who you want in your world.<br>

<br>
   That way miners who wanted to just mine in peace could do so, but those who braved the dangers of the wilderness could have more to show for it.<br>
<br>
   Risk-vs-reward, etc.  They never got that concept though, and the lowest risk areas (read Trammel) tended to cough up the greatest rewards.  The high risk areas usually coughed up 30 rogues stealing platemail off your back just before some ninja-mage-warrior came out of nowhere, hit you 5 times with a poisoned halberd, then incinerated your corpse.  <br>
<br>
   I really liked the low-restriction PvP they had when the game first came out, but thought they could've done a lot to both a) provide a safe area to tradeskill for those who had no interest in PvP, and b) provide an incentive to go into the PvP areas of the world by way of better wood / ore / fish / hides / etc.<br>

The way I see it is I log into to have some fun and play with folks I want to play with.... not have my evening disrupted by some grief player with nothing better to do than try and make life difficult for people. I get enough of that in real life, I dont want to deal with it during &quot;me&quot; time.<br>

She is WAY too competative and she had a bad experience at level 11 as we were running to Halas from freeport.<br>
<br>
Now this is a RP server too in a way and we had just zoned into Kith forest.  She ran right into an Ogre Warrior and an evil gnome necro.  They rooted her (wood elf bard) and beat the snot out of her before I could zone (14 barb warrior).   Right before she died the Ogre said &quot;Let that be a lesson to you elf bitch!  Dont ever try to come thru again you (insert profanity) elf!&quot;  I zoned and rezoned and ran like heck and made it.  Wife was SOOOOoooo mad.  Not because she died...thats part of the game.  But because this guy was a jerk.  That did it.  She wouldnt play there.<br>
<br>
I kept it up and did my share of Pking and just playing but something became very obvious.  There were a few real killers and a whole bunch of victims.  The people who ruled the land we mean.  I mean REALLY mean.  As in not nice at all.  It was too unrealistic even with the rule set.  It was not fun after a while.  I was in a good guild and we hunted people down who were low level to kill....does that sound like good??  I just tossed it aside.  I have a level 18 warrior there but I dont even log him on.<br>
<br>
But /dueling here is different.  More even.  More RP.  More fun when done correctly.  As long as each player knows its in fun and accepted that way.<br>

Oh well gotta run...work!<br>

I started on SZ, too, although not when it started.  I was playing a wood elf druid, much like the character I'm playing on FV, but at about level 15, I realized how &quot;bottled in&quot; Goods were and that I really had no shot at improving various trade skills (tailoring, specifically) without being killed every ten minutes.<br>
<br>
The rudeness of certain members of certain guilds bothered me.  So did the practice of jumping &quot;greens&quot;.  I mean, why bother?  Why slaughter a whole bunch of people who can't defend themselves?<br>

Some people are losers.  They can't handle the idea of a real challenge, so they try to compensate for their lack of self-respect and belief in their own abilities by beating up on something they KNOW they can win against.<br>
