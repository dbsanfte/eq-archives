We are all humans, all have the same basic needs and desires. Yet, we are unable to understand each other very well at all if the slightest difference is present. Religion, race, age, economic status, nationality, life outlook, marital status, language, etc are things that can make us totally unable to understand the other's point of view.<br><br>So in the world of make believe that is Norrath, we have not only each of the above mentioned things, but also the added difference of being different sentient life forms. <br><br>Since this is not Star Trek(c) (do not want to get sued) all races do not get along, all races do not like or understand each other. Some races are completly dedicated to wiping the other one out.<br><br>So given this set of circumstances, how the heck can anyone have the audacity, the sheer unmitigated hubris to pretend thye understand what THE correct for of RP is.<br><br>In my opinion, the best RPers are the ones that get beyond the kindergarten Aulde Englishe speak and the easy alignment/race RP and develop a unique way of life and play it. The more I have to work to try and figure out if it is the perosnaility of the person behind the toon; or a complex character that the person is playing out the more impresed I am. Life is complicated, too complicated to reduce to a series of dos and don'ts. Be creative, be unique.<br><br>Also, this is still the RP Preferred server not he RP required server.  Some of us came here because of the other unique aspects of this server. I like RP and try to always remember that many people came here only because of the RP situation, but I RP Police also have to understand that this is only ONE of the unique elements of our server. <br><br>Borm SteelWarrior of the 28th Season <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugozaro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gozaro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.trafficblast.com/lott/data/gozaro_head.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/14/01 2:16:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.trafficblast.com/im/data/gozar_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  You know what I'd like to see =)</span><hr size=1> I'd like to see a EQ RP guide.   maybe someone can direct me to one that exists.<br><br>Something outlining very basic history of each race on Norrath.

I use aye, nae, ye, milady and other terms mostly just to remind myself that the character I'm speaking for is not &quot;me&quot;.<br><br>Do I think that is &quot;The Proper Way&quot; for a human druid to speak? No. But it gets me into the character. It helps me remember to avoid saying phrases or slang that are obviously out of character. What do I think is &quot;obviously&quot; ooc? That's easy, referencing things that don't exist in Norrath. You know: cars, movies, guns, planes...any technology or events from the real world.<br><br>I don't care how people talk in-game, but sometimes adopting an accent different than your own helps you get &quot;into&quot; the character more.<br><br>One great roleplayer I met on Tallon Zek played a troll with a very exaggerated Louisiana bayou accent.<br><br>Another person I met was a dwarven paladin that spoke like John Wayne. Instead of saying &quot;let's zone&quot;, he'd say &quot;well pilgrim, I reckon we oughtta head fer yonder pass&quot;. Is that sort of silly? Yes, but it was also fun and gave the character personality.<br><br>Am I saying dwarves all need to talk like cowboys? Heck no. I'm saying give your character his/her own idiosyncracies and quirks. Think about his/her background and his/her viewpoints. Think about his/her motivation (instead of just looking towards the next Ding and the next piece of phat lewt).<br><br>Heck I've spent many hours thinking about Grimwyrd as a  person. Almost none of it comes out in my playing. But just the fact that I think of him as a person, instead of my avatar, makes him more real.<br><br>Roleplaying is all about your state of mind when you are playing. It all comes down to &quot;are you playing a role other than yourself&quot;? When I play Grimwyrd, I talk a bit different than myself, I act a bit different than myself, I think a lot different than myself. I play the role of a human druid of Karana, even if no one can tell it by looking at me or talking to me.<br><br><br>On RP-Police:<br><br>I think the people who are RP-Police have a hard time of separating themselves from others influence. They are playing their role, getting into thinking of themselves as a warrior or wizard. They have spent some mental energy forgetting about real life and losing themselves in the game. And they get mad when someone walks up to them and breaks the illusion they are enjoying.<br><br>You know what I mean by &quot;breaks the illusion&quot;. Sometimes it's blatant, like a couple newbies named Biggmacc and Quattapounder come up and say &quot;d3wd, we r new on this server, got ne spare gear and buffs&quot;. Suddenly, I'm not a human druid of karana fitghting the incursions of the gnolls anymore...I'm a 30-something computer gameplayer. The actions of others have broken th illusion provided by EverQuest. Grimwyrd tries to ignore these people as mentally deranged.<br><br>The hardest part about roleplaying in this medium is accepting the inevitable. For instance, terms like &quot;tanks&quot; and &quot;nukes&quot;. These terms have no business in Norrath. But people will use them, heck I even catch myself using them. I've given up. They are too prevalent to withstand.<br><br>But instead of letting them break my illusion, I've incorporated them into my illusion. Heck, when someone says &quot;nuke&quot; now, the first image to pop into my head is something being blown up by a direct damage spell (not a nuclear bomb). At some point, you need to incorporate some common terms and ideas into the world of Norrath in an effort to &quot;defend your illusion&quot;.<br><br>For instance, &quot;level&quot; is another concept that I now have simply incorporated into my worldview of Norrath. I consider the concept of levels to be just as in-character to Grimwyrd as &quot;grades&quot; were to me when I was in high school.<br><br>I consider levels to be a measure of status and accomplishment in Norrathian society and I've adopted to just ignoring it and going with the flow. When someone in Norrath says they are 27th level druid, it makes just as much sense to Grimwyrd as someone in real life telling me they are a VP in charge of marketing, or admin assistant at an insurance firm, a second term congressman from Georgia, or night shift manager at a Taco Bell.<br><br>In my opinion, that's the key to relaxing into roleplaying in EverQuest. You have to defend your illusion by armoring yourself from ubiquitous ooc concepts and terms.<br><br>Grimwyrd Storm<br>&lt;Lux Aeternam&gt;<br>27th Human Druid of Karana<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucasbenlightfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Casben Lightfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/01 4:37:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Buffs</span><hr size=1> Grimwyrd, along the lines of what you said about those crazy ogres...<br><br>I ran into an Erudite yesterday who simply asked me to &quot;buff&quot; him...

I know that feeling.<br><br>Everyone sees roleplay as something unique.  I doubt any two people see it as just the same thing.  Also every persons idea of what is roleplaying changes with time and enviroment.<br><br>Take myself for example:  After playing a text-based roleplaying enforced (not just &quot;encouraged&quot;) game called DragonRealms for years nothing in EverQuest even seemed remotely close to roleplay.   But after time (a couple years or so playing EverQuest on a &quot;normal&quot; server) you grow accustomed to the OOC terms and actions.  At one point I use to consider myself a fair roleplayer, now I find myself struggling.<br><br>Note:  And to the player of the character who heard one particular bad OOC outburst from me I appologize.

In fact, right now, I am participating in the most in depth and involved RP of my gaming life.

You can only enjoy these worlds once you accept that no-one else shares exactly your view of how things should work, and you RP around that. <p>Lord Regent <b>Gray Hateborn</b><br>League of Shadows</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> #2 cutie ranger</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 2:55:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplaying snobs</span><hr size=1> *nod* I'm also having some of the most in-depth RP of my life here, so much so that I' m having to sit back and really get to know Sarhea the character*Smile* And as for people who're of the mind, &quot;why can't you RP like we say?&quot; *shrug* Don't hang out with them.
