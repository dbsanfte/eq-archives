<br>
Consider this entire post ooc. Also please realize that nothing said here is an attack on anyone’s play style or enjoyment. I am a firm believer in the enjoyment of the game in how you choose to play it. * Politically correct disclaimer *<br>
<br>
When I logged tonight I had 6days 1 hour of play. That equates to 145 hours logged as Harmony with a birth date of Sep 9 of this year, giving me roughly 24 days IRL.<br>
<br>
That equates to 6 hours a day, which is more or less accurate, some days less some days more.<br>
<br>
I have played EQ since commercial release. My first character was heavily role-play, reaching level 35 and then due to the role-play going bad never being played again. Since then I played a cleric to 60 on a blue server and an enchanter to 60 on Vallon Zek. All of this does have relevance I promise.<br>
<br>
In the process of playing for that long I have learned the ins and outs of the game. Not a complete knowledge but basic strategies that work and a working knowledge of zones, their mobs and bonuses. Like anything anyone does for any amount of time I have become proficient.<br>
<br>
I have played Harmony as a complex personality with nuances and personality. I don’t claim to role-play any better or worse than anyone but I do role-play to the best of my abilities, with the stories, 100% in character interaction in game, and time taken for events in game that don’t benefit me in numerical advancement but in my characters story advancement. <br>
<br>
Last night as I played I got in a discussion with another player. Who isn’t significant. What was communicated to me was the impression that because I had reached level 40 in my amount of play time I was not playing *correctly* or had somehow not role-played well. Honestly this opinion upsets me. Admittedly some of my reaction is personal pride but some is what I hope is justified reaction. <br>
<br>
If you role play well and maintain the uniqueness and personality of your character does your level matter?<br>
<br>
A comment made to me during the discussion was something to this effect. The point of this sever is RP not to reach 60 as soon as possible. That is not an exact quote and I do not mean it as such but it is close and the idea is what was communicated to me.<br>
<br>
Now honestly I agree but I apply that view in reverse. If I role-play well and maintain my character and contribute to the community, which I feel I have to some extent, what does my level matter, or the rate at which I gain it?<br>
<br>
Is my ability to role-play somehow more valid if I am still level 5? I don’t mean to use an extreme example but I do believe it applies. I find it childish to say that because I level quickly I cannot role-play. Is that not the equivalent to saying that if you role-play you cannot understand the dynamics of the game or play well? Would that not be offensive? As someone who does role-play I would take it just as offensively.<br>
<br>
I am new to this server and was told this is a hot issue. I bring this up as a calm rational topic with no comments directed to anyone or any personal attacks made. I have found this to be a pleasant community and a wonderful group of players. I am simply looking for well spoken opinions that reflect what I may be misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
I find it sad to think that proficiency in the game would somehow ostracize me from other players who enjoy role play as I do.<br>

I have to wonder though if that is all that is involved. How much time are you actually spending with other players interacting and how much are you dedicating solely to the acheivement of gaining gaining gaining. Do you brush off the roleplay because you are busy gaining?<br>
<br>
You have to be your own judge of your character and if someone is offended by your rapid aging alone, then they have to be their own judge and be sure they are not doing so out of jealousy.<br>

I have spent the last few nights pulling all green mobs to level groups I have been in. Done quests with people that gained me no exp or items.<br>

Contributed to active roleplays and wrote 3 publically posted stories.<br>

I interact with Saga 100% in character. I believe, and as I stated before the judge of that would truly be my peers opnions, but I believe I have contributed and played my character fully, not blowing off things he would value and following his goals and ideals.<br>

I do not see how proficenency is contradictory to role-play. If  I understood your post Quea you agree with me as well.<br>

Borm, very wise words and I do agree in some senses. I posted more to get a feel for the community as a whole and its feelings as I am now part of it.You stated something I do strongly agree with, play as you choose and enjoy that.

<br>
I myself role play intensively but have found that in the month I have been on the FV, I have already made level 33. There have been days where I’ve sat in game for 10 hours straight doing nothing but RP in tells, many days I fought strictly low blue or green mobs, and days I have explored (and died in :P) zones I’d never seen before (quit EQ when Luclin was released). Still despite all my efforts to not level; I have flown to level 33. <br>
<br>
I do not question your Rping based upon how quickly you’ve made 40. As you said, your understanding (and your groupmates’) understanding of the game’s dynamics makes a huge difference in how difficult it is to advance and when there are zones such as Paludal (which I found accidentally), leveling slowly can be a near impossibility.<br>
<br>
I – like you – RP faithfully everyday. I am constantly holding sessions not only with the groups I am involved with but also with at least 3 – 4 people in tells. And still, I seem to fly through the levels.<br>
<br>
I would say don’t worry about the ones who would question your RP – though I know that is easier said than done. You, like me, came to the FV to be part of an RP community. It hurts to have your sincerity so quickly dismissed by some you had hoped would be your peers.<br>
<br>
Just play Harmony the way you always have and let those who meet you ‘face to face’ judge for themselves whether you are staying in character and developing a well rounded personality <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That's just silly. As you become familiar with the game, you die less. If you die less, you level faster. So, earning levels quickly does not necessarily = power gamer. Someone who is only level 20 with the same play time as you might very well be dying a lot more. Every case needs to be done on a case-by-case basis. <br>
<br>
You are one of the most in-character fellows I know, to the point of irritation (only because you play Harmony so true to form that even when a certain response might be detrimental to him, you do it anyway).  That's what makes him so very real and lovable to me. <br>

I know you roleplay. You know you roleplay. Mr./Mrs. Shallnotbenamed obviously hasn't taken the time to get to know you enough to learn that, so ignore him or her. <p><b>Pixxii's me name. Mischief's me game.<br>

I generally would have preferred a partner and would always be chatting with someone, but my exp was generally purely solo.  Soloing for 55 levels tends to get you the levels pretty friggin fast.  I do not see any correlation between how I know where I can hunt stuff for fast easy exp and roleplaying ability.  The fact that all my characters are evil and thus kill the stupid bards that hang out in the wrong zones such as Travis Two Tone in Nektulos.  I don't see how the fact I get a full blue bubble of exp off him when I pass through the area has much to do with my roleplaying ability.  I just cast 4 spells and wait for the nice yellow con enemy to die.  So what?  In my opinion roleplaying and how you get exp are two totally different things until your the druid that just killed your own god.<br>

PS: To pixxi's comment on &quot;as you get higher you die less&quot;  As I get higher in level I die more.

Humm, no matter what dungeon I go to I am guaranteed at least one death.  Ya, but when you stop taking exp seriously it really doesn't matter anyway.

You hit a nerve with your boasts and the fact you have all but blatantly mentioned PLing Pixxii.<br>
<br>
But... said in generalities and not just to you...<br>
<br>
RP, in my humble humble opinion, is not just writing a couple (or a hundred) stories offline (no matter if they are publically posted or not), using a single &quot;gimmick&quot; to excess to &quot;define&quot; your character, speaking in character most of the time across a chat channel or in tells, or other things that can be done either outside of game time or while you are in the middle of hunting far far away from anyone else.<br>
<br>
RP, in my humble humble opinion, can be acting in character in the presence of other characters, be in in a group setting or in the Bazaar or in Nexus or in a pub.  It can be seeking out others not necessarily for adventure or killing (and XPing), but to just spend time being.<br>
<br>
RPing does not preclude leveling, but... I can see how there would be a perception of leveling -fast- does indicate a lot of stuff done for the sake of that leveling and not necessarily because it would be IC.  Have you ever given a thought to -why- your character is in a location or doing what he is doing other than the fact you, the player, knows you will make fat XP or money there?<br>
<br>
I am not gainsaying the right of anyone to level fast, heck, I know some places I go strictly because I can level faster and raise skills (too bad those places have to change all the time), but I generally only go to them when I am not doing anything RP.<br>
<br>
Harmony, to bring this back to you, I think you were being asked what your priorities here are?  Is it to bed as many females as possible, to show yourself as a knight errant, to get to the &quot;end game&quot; and kill whatever beastie, to explore the depths of Harmony and even let him expand his character beyond always kneeling and saying &quot;my lord, my lady&quot;, or what?  I don't think it was intended, in the beginning, to be an accusation, but you might have gotten defensive (as you have in this post) and not wanted to see it as anything but an attack.<br>

You know, for some reason a lot of people lately have been peering into Harmony as a character, giving him undo attention and criticism for how he plays his character, and frankly, I'm sick of it.<br>
<br>
I was not there for the discussion last night, but it seems to me that nobody is even trying to find out *why* Harmony always kneels and calls people lord and lady. It isn't just because he suffers under the misconception that &quot;M'lord&quot; and &quot;M'lady&quot; is RP, it's because his roleplay history requires such behavior to be true to his character. Did anyone even bother to read it?<br>
<br>
As for powerleveling Pixxii----Harmony and I could not group for a few levels, and now we can. He willingly stopped leveling for me to level up, and I actually made most of the 2 levels alone with Raeny, not Harmony. Last night and the night before Harmony assisted me, but it was because our characters wanted to be together, and we were GROUPED. If he had been powerleveling me, why would we be killing light blues and blues (to me) and not something more challenging, so I could get faster exp, and why the hell would we be in SolA? We were killing somewhere where our characters could interact and be alone, and NOT in a &quot;leet&quot; experience zone. It just happens to be a less populated zone for two characters in a blossoming relationship to grow. <br>
<br>
I am not typically a player who involves my characters in heavy romance RP. My previous character had an NPC fiance specifically to avoid that. Now that I found someone whose RP style melds well with mine, forgive us if we want our characters to spend time together. <br>
<br>
I DELETED a level 52 cleric to create Pixxii, so quite clearly *I* am not an anti-RP powerleveling fool, nor would my character devote her attentions to one. But if that is how people are perceiving me or Harmony, then I'm thinking that they do not know our characters enough, and I'm offended that RP is being judged based on how fast we gain levels and not on our actual RP ability.<br>

I posted a entire story line to show how and why Harmony behaves as he does. I find some of the reactions here truly sad.<br>

My plan with Harmony was nothing more than to simply grow as Harmony and enjoy the game. <br>

Thank you for your defense of me Pixxii, you as well as a few others have actually taken some time to get to know Harmony and understand how he behaves and reacts.<br>

<br>
But... he had indicated to me, via tell, a while back, that he was helping you gain levels (not entirely a bad thing, for people who want to be together and are close... heck... I had a lot of incentive to raise my level because of Bippin... and only slightly increase my rate of doing so *laugh*.. went from 3 levels every two weeks to almost 1 level a week) and probably did so to others as well.  I thought nothing of it, actually, until he started getting more defensive and blatant about it.<br>
<br>
At least 90% of my conversations with Harmony have been via tell and about 60% of that has been him going to OOC.  Some of it, now, I have been going back through in my logs (I think nearly everyone in Saga logs because of the RP side of things... much easier to weave a story into the EQ stuff if you can recall, so easily, exact words) and putting together puzzling bits with other information to try to figure out a greater picture. As usual, I am trying to see both sides of an issue... <br>
<br>
I still don't think the quick rise in level is the central thing that caused the conversation.  I do know Harmony gets -very- defensive when asked any question, even if only something informational.  He has also been known to belabour a point, even when asked to take the elsewhere or elsewhen (i.e. &quot;ooc: can we take this to email&quot; &quot;okay&quot;... and then continue in tell as if that previous query/assent had not happened).  That -might- have been what happened to cause this posting.  <br>
<br>
Saying &quot;I am working to advance my lady love so we can be grouped togehter&quot; is a lot different than indicating you are PLing someone.  (And I really really hate the implication of PLing when it is for a level or two, vs going from 1-20 in a day or a weekend.  Those two things are -vastly- different in my mind.) <br>
<br>
Oh... and I was not the one who questioned him directly yestereve.  I'm not sure I really had conversation with him other than right as I was heading off to bed.<br>

I was the one who made the comment last night when he announced over the chat that he was level 40.<br>
<br>
I asked how he had managed that so fast. Since he had been 32 a few days before. I have never seen someone level so quickly on FV before, and was honestly stunned.<br>
<br>
It quickly turned to be getting berated and told my opinion was invalid, when my comment was honestly a &quot;holy smokes!&quot; kinda thing. He quickly proved what kind of person he was, to me, and I asked him to just drop it because he had obviously misconstrued my statement. And he refused. And berated me some more. So he is now on my /ignore. He's actually the soul resident on my /ignore now.<br>
<br>
And now I am attacking him and assorted other nice little comments.<br>
<br>
Cute.<br>

I love how fast people here judge others when they know nothing about the situation.<br>

The thing is, 6 days to 40 isn't all that hot for a power-leveler.  It's more like average for those that play normally and know what they're doing.  First-timers will take double or tripple that, but if you know what to do, it goes quick.
