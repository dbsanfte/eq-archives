<br>
The other night, someone was selling these bags, which were never intended to be sold I take it. They are awesome bags, and some people wanted to use this to make money.<br>
<br>
This upset some people that do have the ability to make the bags so they decided to make the bags and hand them out for free to anyone that wanted them.<br>
<br>
Some people were upset because they think that giving the bags away to anyone has runed the economy for people that want to sell them.<br>
<br>
Here is a quote from the other thread:<br>
~~<br>
To set the record straight, I was the one who initiated this 2.5 hour flooding of the masses with bags. I am Fhade, Quillestrae's husband. In /market this eve a poor buyer announced they received a bag similar to a tinkerer's bag in wt, stats, capacity and wt reduction for 300pp. Of course the entire channel corrected this person as there is no way such a bag would be found so cheap. After much debate the person was correct actually and to some folks had been the victim of a shady deal. The bags in question are quested. You summon a no rent bag (no drop on other servers) from a GM Trade Skill Trophy (also no drop elsewhere) then turn said free summoned bag into an NPC in bazaar named Jollum who in turn returns a LORE (no drop version on other servers) for the free bag. Now to myself and a few other Trophy holders this was just another of the ways to exploit the population for platinum for little or no work involved due to a No Drop loophole. <br>
<br>
My purpose in starting the mass flood of free bags upon the market was two fold. First, to prevent the unknowing from shelling out hard earned pp for an item thats effortless to get. Second to bring to light yet another loop hole in the NO DROP coding. Only a few fought this topic as not an issue, some (including myself) /petitioned /reported the issue, where far far more were just happy to get a nice item. There are a few No Drop loop holes folks have found but of those this was the only effortless one. The rest of them I can understand to a certain point due to factions, the length of travel time etc, but cannot accept them completely.<br>
<br>
The GM Trophy is a high trade skill item for those who don't know. We agree it takes much skill and much investment to attain such skills and thats what this and the lore bag were meant to reward. The fact that someone used a self only intended reward to further advance their pp stash for little effort outside of the trade skill is what set this whole thing off. Verant takes very little responsibility for what happens on FV. They never have the GM support nor the staffing to help fix many of the known No Drop issues let alone the dozens of other serious issues here. Tonight's issue was a big red flag to Verant since emails and petitions of one person do very little. Perhaps the flood got their attention. Just a note on our Trophy, we have one but neither of us could make it, we have no trade skills over 110. We got this in trades for other items. Its a commonly sold/traded thing here where other places its no drop. The whole &quot;You didn't deserve the trophy so you don't have the right to dictate how its used&quot; issue is garbage. I had at least 2 or 3 others with me who did earn their trophies in complete agreement with what I stood for and helped. /hugs to them. If they wish to join in the thread then I leave that to them.<br>
<br>
The only folks I see upset over this whole ordeal are ppl who didn't get a bag or who are mad at losing a free source of income. /rant off, to each his own I guess. I take full responsibility for my actions and any repercussions that follow but in my heart I did the right thing. Rarely does one have the opportunity, let alone the timing, to take actions for what they believe is honorable. I was truly humbled to see so many happy folks who understood why this was happening.<br>

I agree with the people that gave the bags away, and the next night i gave away over 60 bags myself to anyone that wanted one. <br>
<br>
The 60 some odd bags I gave away, they were gifts.<br>
<br>
I got a tell from someone tonight when I logged on, really mad at me, they were selling the bags for 1500pp each, and made over 9k so far. Funny thing is, this person didnt make the trophy himself through his tradeskill efforts, he bought the trophy for 15k.<br>
<br>
As of now, the Gnome is not there, I was told the gms removed him for now while its under investigation.<br>
I didnt realize this was a bug, just like many of the other no drop items on our server that make us unique.<br>
<br>
Thanks for hearing my 2 coppers,<br>

So what?  It won't ruin the economy, and the bags are still Lore so there will be a market still for other good bags.<br>
<br>
To &quot;Fix&quot; this now would require so much mucking about the cure might be worse that the problem.  But I do agree that charging for the bags, at least charging more than a nominal tip, is unreasonable.  50 platinum, as for a port or for a rezz from a cleric who happened to be standing right there, I can see.<br>
<br>
Just remember folks, it isn't usefullness along that determines value.  Value is determined by scarcity.  And when there are dozens and dozens (possibly hundreds) of bag-producing factories out there that can make them for the click of a button, they will be dirt-cheap.  Basic economics.<br>
<br>
Kudos to people who flooded the market, and special kudos to those who went to the trouble of explaining what was really happening and why.  Knowledge is Power.<br>

Rather, the person who implemented the hand-in &quot;quest&quot; neglected to consider the implication it would have on our server.   It was an oversight, and the most likely solution is that they will make the trophies, the satchel, and the carry-all no drop as they are on all other servers.  Problem solved.  I think the trophies should have been no drop anyhow, personally, as they are a way to prove you have achieved the pinacle of a tradeskill, and were never meant to be swapped around as a fancy piece of stat gear. <p><br>Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith, 56th Enforcer of Innoruuk's Word

<br>
Saying that getting those bags is effortless is like saying that getting a Chardok ring is effortless - well yes, after you put in a TON of faction work. But people are selling the rings, and I thought the general consensus was that if the market would support it, so be it. If the market supports people selling tinker bags Mark 2, then so be it. Consider it payment to a grandmaster tradeskiller for  what is to them a trivial combine.<br>

Its not like the tradeskill trophy is easy or cheap to make. Depending on the cost you get the gems at you might be spending 7kpp per attempt at one of these. Now if someone wants to sell them for 1500pp thats their business. Is the bag worth 1500pp? Not figuring supply and demand, I would have to say yes. So I don't see any problem with people selling them. If you are lucky enough to have a friend or guildmate that would do it for free you should be grateful.<br>
<br>
Not to take this off on a tangent but isnt this the same as selling buffs and rezzes? It doesnt cost the druid anything to port a person, or a cleric to rez a person. <br>

Not really supporting the sellers of the bags, just dont think they should be made out to be jerks.<br>

(I'm not saying people were obigated to give them away, I just think that's why the trend started *by itself*). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxyloxfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XyloxFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/23/02 10:13:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1262.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Petitioned bags</span><hr size=1> I do have a problem with people selling those bags for money.  The argument about all the the &quot;other&quot; stuff on FV that is no drop is NULL in my opinion.  The developers planned for planar armor to be droppable and sellable.  It was a part of what was to make FV special and unique.<br>
<br>
These bags are NOT a part of the plan.  They are an oversight.  It's verants' fault but it's still an oversight.  These bags were meant to be something that rewarded people for their efforts in the tradeskills.  Now, thanks to greed, that accomplishment seems yet again cheapened.<br>
<br>
I also gave as many bags away for free as I could.  Why?  Well it's simple.  I know almost every person on this server capable of actually making on of those trophies, and I'm fairly confident that none of them would ever try to sell those bags for profit.<br>
<br>
My two cents..<br>

  I don't think the merchant removal is permanent, it's just something Verant did until they can nerf things properly.<br>
<br>
   I'd be so pissed right now if I'd bought a bag, and then 15 minutes later someone was giving them away...<br>
<br>
   I got a free bag, thanks Jehryn. <p>Poppyseed McMuffin

<br>
Some races &amp; classes have advantages in this, I daresay it's easier for your j-random erudite to get their tradeskills up than your average ogre.  All part of the choices we make. <br>
<br>
Once you have the tradeskill, it's yours to do with as you please.  If you want to sell shade silk robes, go ahead.  If you want to make 40 of them for your friends, go ahead.   If you want to do free combines for folks who bring you things, fine.<br>
<br>
I have basically never paid anything for a combine in a tradeskill I didn't have.  I have bought some objects outright, including my 2 rebreathers for that part of my epic, as well as some lesser cost items.  I've also taken ingredients to folk who have done combines for me, and I give them whatever extras I can come up with.  I have done a few deals where I bring enough for 2-3 combines, and I get the first one. <br>
<br>
It's all a question of time, effort, convenience, fun, and who you know, and who you are.<br>
<br>
Sell, barter, give away, or help out partially -- all are viable choices.<br>
<br>
Mostly I see folks being nice to one another.  Clerics do rezzes, Jewelers do combines, Folks will buff you, etc.<br>
