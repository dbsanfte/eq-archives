Black, worn, leather gloves hols the cloak tightly closed as if warding off the cold fingers of a chill gale in the depths of winter, though it is yet far off.  The figure sits, huddled over the table...waiting.<br>
<br>
The comely barmaid comes over to service this reclusive customer.  Long white hairs dangle from out of the hood of the dark robes covered by the cloak.  The weak light shows only heavily wrinkled, yet clean shaven, skin around thin, tight lips.  Before she can speak to ask for an order the figure speaks in a rasping whisper uttering &quot;honey mead, warmed, and a dry piece of bread&quot;.  The voice of a man, long on his path, perhaps nearing the end she thinks.<br>
<br>
The figure sits still except for a slight turn of the hood here and there, looking over the many patrons as they relate their tales and share one another's company.  He nods to himself, wishing his life had not turned down at least some of the paths it had.  His thoughts then interrupted by the lass, still radiant in youth and unmarred yet by life, as she places a small sauces upon the table with his ordered bread.  As she begins to place the cup down his hands dart with the speed of a viper, wrenching it from her grasp, pulling it close to the cowl to breath deep of the fragrant vapours.  She can hear a deep rattle from within his chest as he exhales and inhales the steam several times before quickly gulping it down.<br>
<br>
A weak laugh escapes from within the hood as he places the cup back down, seeming to pull into the dark garments more closely.  The hood tilts back up to her revealing a mirthless smile.  &quot;More&quot; he says, nodding at the empty cup.  She begins to say something, perhaps an offer of an ear or assistance is some way, but he interrupts her as she opens her mouth, rasping &quot;more&quot;, but this time with a thinly veiled, and truly unexpected menace from such an obviously debilitated being.  The hood looks away, down to the table as a hand reaches out to grasp the dry piece of bread, slipping it beyond sight into the cowl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrixa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drixa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barmaid</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/10/01 8:26:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Beginning...</span><hr size=1> I've been around people long enough to recognize who will be drawn into conversation and who fosters a need for solitude.

Then, by telltale movements of the cowl, it seemed his neck craned and head tilt as if trying to hear something.  Slowly the figure leaned forward, placed the now empty mug upon the empty saucer and pushed them across the table.  The clatter of breaking glass or pottery from somewhere in the tavern did not seem to effect him in any way.  Again the barmaid came over to take the emptied items and he spoke softly, barely audible over the constant chatter in the bar, &quot;two more&quot;.  His arm raised and moved over the table, leaving a thick gold coin of strange denomination on the table.  He leaned back in his chair, huddled up closely once more, and waited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrixa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drixa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barmaid</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/11/01 11:30:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Beginning...</span><hr size=1> Drixa looked at the strange coin.  It's often wise not to wonder too much, but she couldn't help but be a bit intrigued.  It looked as if it would spend and perhaps she could talk to her friend about it later.  He had travelled all over Norrath, and often into dark, rarely seen places.  <br>
<br>
She put the coin into her pocket and tried to put it out of her mind as well as she hurried back to warm 2 more honey meads.<br>

On her way back, she saw Mugg and had an idea... <p>Drixa<BR>

Curiosity was a good thing and should be fostered; so had his master once told him.  He recalled many a life snuffed out by it though, however twas always worth the risk.  Deep in his robes, the feelings of dread and lonliness were being replaced by hope and a deep affection.  The simple-minded sentimentality of an old man long on the road he thought, but deep inside he knew it has always been this way.  <br>
<br>
Long ago he had forsaken the path of his forefathers and his ancient civilization...the path of absolute darkness.  Whilst he knew, as he had been taught so well, that what others called &quot;evil&quot; was simply a matter of subjective perceptions and cultural bigotries, he also knew true evil had a place. Twas fact that oftimes one had to pass within the darkness to find a way to the light.  The thought made him shiver once more as he knew well what lied within and what the truth of evil was.  Sometimes he thought he would have been better an ignorant fool, bathing in light, or the pawn of the ancient dynasties of his people.  Again the thoughts were chased away by the exhilaration of the coming meeting, and he only hoped the mead arrived in time... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrixa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drixa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barmaid</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/01 8:47:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Beginning...</span><hr size=1> Drixa rushed back from the kitchen with 2 warmed honey meads.  The man hiding in the corner is a strange one, indeed.  He barks at her and then smiles when he thinks she's distracted.<br>
<br>
Drixa had to juggle the tray for a moment when a customer stood up and almost knocked it over.  She stopped for half a second to gather herself and remind herself that it was none of her business.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Here you are, sir.  2 nicely warmed honey meads.&quot;<br>
<br>
She quickly set them on the table... it had been a bit disquieting when he snatched them from her earlier.<br>

Suddenly the heavily robed figure straightened and stood,  this was puncuated by a short scream and more than a few gasps followed by a silence descending on the bar.  The figure bowed in the direction of the tavern's door where stood a shocking sight, a figure with robes seeming to be afire, yet not burning.  <br>
<br>
This new addition to the tavern was as tall as any barbarian and perhaps as broad.  The hood was also drawn low over the face of this imposing figure and around the waist was a shining, almost glowing, silver belt with the golden likeness of a unicorn set upon it.  The tall figure moved towards the old man who remained bent in a bow, head nearly to the table.  The figure moved with the grace of the large cat, seeming to be at tune with its body and assured in its abilities.  As the figure drew closer the barmaid found herself feeling that this being had a presence that spoke of a knowledge as deep and vast as any ocean, and a air of command which could lead legions into pitched battle.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Elen sila lumenn omentilmo&quot; the aged man says, continuing his bow.  The tall figure takes his shoulders, sighing tenderly and laughing softly as he says &quot;cormamin lindua ele lle, stand my old friend&quot; in a light Elven accent.  The tall figure looks down at the barmaid and bows uttering &quot;you will excuse us dear lady, we have matters to discuss?&quot;  Straightening a warm smile can be seen from within the hooded robes allowing the barmaid time to recover from any shock she suffers... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrixa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drixa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barmaid</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/01 12:06:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Beginning...</span><hr size=1> &lt;recovers quickly as  not much surprises her after years tending  bar&gt;<br>

They commenced to eating.  The old man simply stuck to bread and water, whilst the larger man nearly engulfed all before him.  They neatly piled the empty bowls and plates in one portion of the table and began to speak in hushed whispers.  Occassionally one or the other would not or shake their head as the other spoke.  After a good time of this the taller figure arose, immediately motioning the older man to remain seated.  He laid down several thick, gold coins upon the table and slipped out of the tavern.
