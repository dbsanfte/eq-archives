I think there has been enough speculation/accusations/derogatory comments about Eldraed and Awakened Souls to last everyone a while.  I hope I can clarify the facts of the situation for those of you who are curious.  Yes, Eldraed allegedly sold his character to someone.  They immediately stripped all of his gear and probably made a hefty profit off of it too.  The vast majority of it was sold within a day or two.  (You can congratulate the ones who bought some of Eldraed's nice gear -- I don’t know who they are, but they do).  Sadly, this person had no intentions of actually playing the character.  Aye, it is sad, but I guess that’s the way some people pay the rent.<br>
<br>
By reading the threads and numerous posts by those of you who seem so vehemently opposed to the selling/transfer of retired players….I suppose you guys think that when someone retires from EQ, then their character should just be deleted so it will never be played again.  I for one disagree and think that would be a waste.  Eldraed is still a great character, even though he is unfortunately without the “uber gear” status he once had (courtesy of FnF).  I don’t ever like to see such good characters just go to waste, so this is why you will still see Eldraed around, trying to build back up.<br>
<br>
For those of you who question about the name change….even if I had something to hide, I don’t think it’s possible on this server.  The title “Emissary of War” might be removed upon a name change – I could care less, seeing as I wasn’t the one who earned it, so I really don’t deserve it anyhow.  The original Eldraed did and he doesn’t play anymore, and he will be missed.  But his legacy will live on.  Sure I could change the name if that would make everyone happy, but would it really make a difference?  People would know, either way.   The title “Duke” would still accompany him, and how many Duke DE Shadowknights are on FV?  Like I said, there’s really nowhere to hide here, even if you wanted to.  People will find out one way or another.  So just assume to still see his name as Eldraed.<br>
<br>
I understand those of you who are upset to see the original Eldraed go.  It’s only natural that when something like this happens, people want to blame someone.  Some may blame Eldraed for “selling out” if-you-will.  Not that I’m suggesting that -- I’ve chatted with him and he seems like a nice and respectable guy, although I don’t know the full RL story behind his quitting EQ altogether.  Some people will blame the person who takes over.  I can understand this as well, because more often than not, the new person has insufficient knowledge of EQ and is not ‘worthy’.  However let me set your minds at ease by telling you that this is not the case with Eldraed.  It’s far from it.  I’ve played EQ for 3 years and there are no character transfers to FV so options are limited.  I found this as an opportunity.<br>
Lastly, there are the people who tend to blame Awakened Souls.  This, I don’t understand at all.  I have friends in AS, just like a lot of you do – after spending a significant amount of time with them it’s easy to tell they are a great bunch.  But I see that a lot of people like to make them into a monster.  Everyone has their reasons, but please don’t take frustrations out on AS, as they had nothing to do with this.  Everyone has their opinions which they are entitled to, but I am hoping I have clarified this particular issue and people will realize things aren’t always as bad as you might think.  Be optimistic for a day, live and let live.  I’m not here to make enemies, only friends.<br>
<br>
I must admit, messageboards are not my style but when I heard of the commotion brewing here, I thought I’d try to set the record straight.  In all likelihood this will be the first and last thread you will see me post on.  Good luck to you all.<br>
<br>
Now pardon me while I go out and try to farm some better gear.  =)<br>

<br>
Yes, that is exactly what I think.  Congrats for summarizing it so neatly.  You...are...not...Eldraed.  How clear is that?  Some folks might seek your company for the sake of the power that toon carries, but whatever meaning was once attatched to the name is completely gone, and there is no right of accomplishment attatched to it anymore.  It's that simple.<br>

<br>
we are a guild like everyone else on this server, i would bet we dont do more or less roleplaying like FnF and Reso, fact is in a raiding guild the roleplay gets sooner or later in the way<br>
<br>
well i never know the &quot;orignal&quot; eldraed ive seen him a few times but thats all, the guy who plays eldraed now seems to be nice so far, i dont know him long now but i saw him helping a lot of people in the short time hes here now, and i never heared a bad word of him <br>
<br>
give him a chance and give us a chance, i stand behind 100% of the members of my guild and im sure all others in my guild do the same. <br>
just be patient and build your own meaning about us, group with us and try to talk with us, noone of us is more bad or good than anyone else on this server, all what i want you to ask to is to give us a fair chance not to believe every shit some people say who seems to be braindead (do drugs hurt?) to me <br>

the second problem is the original owner decideing they wantto play again and gettin the password reset. with the cd key they still possess.<br>

I guess I have a different perspective on this, but I come from cazic  where characters have changed hands to man times. play the game well all but the old players friends will forget, play the game like k rap no one will forget,<br>

He didn't want to throw away 3 years worth of playing by starting over at lvl 1.  He had friends(RL maybe don't know)on this server in AS and asked if he what do you think if I bought a character and came to play with you on the server.  His FRIEND gets all excited and says that be great I'd love to play with my friend.  WOW what a bunch of monsters.  I mean how terrible of them to help a FRIEND come play with them.  Yeah yeah I know your all going to say start at lvl 1 and they will PL him,help him etc.  But if this guy had a lvl 60 character on another server, and all he wanted was to come play with his friends, is it really that bad? Granted I don't agree with the buying and selling of characters, but sometimes we do have to remember that some of us are friends In RL and that takes precedence.  Ask yourselves if your brother/bestfriend etc said I want to come play with you, but they won't let me transfer my lvl 60 Gnome Necro what should I do?  Wouldn't it suck to have to get them all up 50 or 60 levels just so you can group with them?  This game is suppose to be about having fun and I think at times we all take it just a lil too serious.  Maybe they should do away with the transfer rule? And let ppl transfer here?  Then situations like this wouldn't occur. But we would have half of 7th hammer, Xegony etc running around here(i played on 7th Hammer for a while AVG lvl 60 there has about 60AA pts) do we really want to open that pandora's box?  I sure as hell hope not I love FV because I feel like everywhere I go I know someone, and have many friends in game.  And if every once in a blue moon we have to see someone get EBayed into our server because he wants to play with friends and VI doesn't let him transfer, /shrug well thats a hell of a lot better then seeing half of the other servers lvls60 running around here.<br>
Once again I don't agree with buying toons, far from it, but I do understand there are situations where RL takes precedence and hey if a couple of friends want to be able to spend some time together and play, well that fine with me.  <br>

As for this new Eld, he's a really nice guy from talking to him, in my opinion,  and though I don't think its fun at all personally to just get a 60 since the aforementioned addiction of my own, at least he gets to do things with his RL friends for the time being and he certainly isn't out to ruin anyones game for them. I don't consider it 'right' as I would never do it, but you know coming from Tarew Marr, I have seen how it can and could be a whole lot worse than it really is in this instance.<br>

You're not justified. Get over it and accept that you are as dirty as every EBayer out there.<br>

I don't care that AS has him. And you know what, I really don't care about all of this Ebaying crap.<br>

You do what you want with your characters.<br>
<br>
But you talk about how Ebaying is bad, how what you did is okay, you know what you did?<br>
<br>
You purchased a level 60 ShadowKnight. Why? because it was easier then leveling one to level 60 yourself. Don't come here talking that 'Oh, We're keeping the Legend of Eldraed alive'. Thats nonsence. In fact, its Bullshit.<br>

<br>
Verant has listened to the FV community before (see proposed rule changes).<br>
<br>
AS, be careful.  Ebaying is AGAINST Veran'ts clear policy.  That is the ONLY reason one needs to use to justify getting upset.  Rules are rules...and there appears to be a violation.  People keep saying....&quot;whine whine...what's the problem??&quot;. ITS AGAINST THE RULES ROFL.  It amazes me that we act like a bunch of lawyers and forget the one fact and try to &quot;justify&quot; the &quot;freedom&quot; people have in buying characters.  Mind boggling.<br>
<br>
This keeps up, AS will be reported, to Verant, with names and accounts, and my guess is Verant could disband the guild.<br>
<br>
It has happened before for far less transgressions...<br>

YES<br>
<br>
Do I think is acceptable that his/her gear is stripped to equip others before the character is shelved? Yes, THAT is reasonable.<br>
<br>
This is the roleplaying (preferred) server.  What is a character? An individual breathed into life by the person who has played him from the beginning, allowing him/her to develop a personality, a repuation, associations with friends, and more, all linked to the Player.  What is eBaying?  Aside from being a blatant EULA (you know, that thing you click to ACCEPT each and every time you play) violation, it is also stripping a character down to nothing, albsolutely nothing, but stats.  The is NO character transfer in the transfer of the stats.  This might be common or prevalent on a blue or red server where stats are ALL that matter, but here?  Even the worst non-roleplayer of Fire and F or Resolution still has a character they have imbued with some life on its own (and yes, I am aware they have taken knocks for the characters -they- have ebayed and has come to light) by building its reputation and interaction with the community.<br>
<br>
I know AS has proclaimed they are not roleplayers (so what the heck are they doing on a roleplay (preferrred) server?), but the characters in their midst who have gone from 1 to where they are now -have- developed reputations, friends, a particulat way of playing that could be said to be a personality.  No matter that you have a 60 on every other server, if you are ebayed you will not play a character the same as the original owner.<br>
<br>
I am, admittedly, becoming more an more adament about roleplay (but am not the RP police), so this saddens me greatly.<br>
<br>
AS allows their reputation to be stained again and again by things such as this.  When an ebay incident of the past was brought to light,  Fire and Fury and Resolution both decried its practice and worked t contain the damage to their reputations (&amp;, I believe, removed the ebayer from which ever guild he was in at the time).<br>
<br>
Eld, you may be a nice guy and a competant player, but that does not take away the fact you break the rules each time you fire up the account you bought and that you blatantly LIE each time you click accept to the EULA.<br>
<br>
The fact you try to say &quot;oh woe is me&quot; when you complain that you got a stripped character (&amp; even mention the ones who stripped him, which to me, is acceptable, gear is nothing, but I hope -they- didn't log him in, but had the original owner pass the stuff to them) in order get sympathy or to mitigate your won crime... that only drops you even further in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Sorry, to everyone else, for the lengthy rant, but this just pisses me off to no end.<br>

Read the posts above to see the reasons. <br>
<br>
AS accepts ebayed toons into their ranks, knowingly. Do I need to paint you a picture? Is AS actually TRYING to turn this into a blue server? Because that's what it seems to me, and I'll bet that's what it looks like to a lot of folks out there.<br>
<br>
Without a flame, let me try to put it in simple terms. FV is like a small town. AS is like a commune that sets up in the middle of the town and tells everyone who has lived there since the town was founded, &quot;We are not part of the community, don't expect us to contribute, or even deign to notice you folks. Blow me.&quot; Is it so hard to understand why more than half the population on this server hates your guts? It's not the individuals in the guild. I'm sure (well, I'm pretty sure anyway) that some of them are nice folks. But put yourself in the townies' shoes--how would YOU react? <br>
<br>
Here's a clue for you, AS, if you want a better rep. Drop the anti-RP stance and take an active interest in the server community. It won't work right away, but I'll bet it will work. Not willing to do this? Then get used to having a crap reputation on this server, because it's not going to change. <p>Jebbar Godsbane<BR>
