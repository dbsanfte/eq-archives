A quick survey shows that I am in a city, a little dirty but a city.  I found a small pile of cast away cloth and animal skin to make a bed in.<br>
<br>
Freeport.  I am in Freeport.  And if I am to survive, I best find something to weigh down my purse a bit.<br>
<br>
But that dream.  I had it again last night.  More vivid than before.  Perhaps it is some sort of message.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I am standing in the middle of a barren plain.  The vastness and emptiness of it is suffocating.  An overwhelming feeling of being lost and alone comes over me.  I run around aimlessly trying to find anything on this featureless landscape, but nothing yeilds it's presense.  I sit down and turn inward on myself, trying to shut out the world, when a shadow falls over me.<br>
<br>
I spring up in a start to find that I am not alone.  An old man stands over me, holding a staff to his side.  No, not a man, an elf, definately pure elf blood.  Yet he is featureless, and unlike any elf I've seen.  A sense of power, terribly destructive is about him.  Yet, something else, too.  A very warming feeling, such that I feel like I should know him, like he is the father I never knew.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I checked my pouch, and snacked sparingly on the bits of food in there.  If I could not get some coin, this would have to last awhile.  Taking a swig of ale, I returned to pondering the dream.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The elf put his hand on my head, and it was very comforting, chasing away my feelings of being alone, replacing it with a feeling of belonging, and a feeling of being important.  I started to look up, when a strong wind picked up, and I had to sheild my eyes from the dust and the rain.<br>
<br>
The rain, there is a storm in the direction the man had been, pouring torrential rains down in it's wake.  A river forms out of the storm.  Grass sprouts out of the ground, trees grow, and a few animal calls can be heard.  I walk into the storm, yet do not get wet.  The rain is heavy all around, yet beyond I can see the glow of the setting sun.  But the sun looks closer than the sunset I fell asleep to.<br>
<br>
Overhead I hear the fluttering of wings.  I look up in time to see a crow winging past.  It caws 3 times, or is it a caw?  I wake up to the sound of someone shouting nearby.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Returning the contents of the pouch to their place, I get ready to depart for the day.  What does the dream mean?  What could it be?  Perhaps I shall go to the scholars of Erudin to get insight, I hear some of them analyze dreams.<br>
<br>
So it is settled, I set out for the west today.  I guess I will have to take a few shortcuts to a few coin, where it will not be missed.  To the west... towards the setting sun?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mithlin>Mithlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/10/02 9:03:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chilling Battle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What a chill breeze in the air.  Something about the cold here just seems to bore straight through a person, more than just cold.  I am cold yet completely drenched in sweat.  I had the dream again, though somehow darker than before, like the evil I can feel in this place is oozing into my dreams.  But still, the further west I trudge, the stronger I feel the calling.  Surely, this dream was even more clear than the last.  It frustrates me to not know the meaning of the dream, yet I feel must follow it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There is blackness everywhere.  Utter blackness all around me.  My breath comes in shallow gasps, as I reach out, trying to feel anything.  There is nothing out there, yet I feel terribly afraid.  Frantic, I probe all around me with my hands, but there is nothing.  A feeling of terror comes over me, like I am being watched by unfriendly eyes.  My pulse races, and I am in complete panic.  There has not been even the slightest hint of danger.  The sense of some great evil about to strike comes suddenly in a rush, like a wave.  Panic gets the better of my sense and I run.  I do not know where I am running to, but I feel I must get away from where I am.  As fast as I can go, not looking back, not even thinking about what is back there.  I do not get more than a handful of paces, though it seems like years it took me to get there, when I lose my footing and fall.  Reaching out to regain my step, my hand runs into something.  No, not something, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> somebody</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I am completely overtaken by panic.<br>
<br>
Laying face down in a field of lush green grass, I look up.  The sky is a nice blue, with wispy clouds overhead.  Green grass extends on the smooth unbroken plains as far as the eye can see.  Off in the distance I hear thunder.  A light breeze teases at my hair.  Standing in front of me is the same old elf from my other dreams, and my hand is on his leg.  I feel silly with my hand on him, yet somehow the touch is comforting.  Not that I need any comforting right now, in such nice surroundings as this.  But the comfort is relaxing, and I am hesitant to pull away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The wind howls in the trees outside.  Or is it the wind?  I can't really tell.  Dawn is still an hour or two away, but I fear sleep shall not claim me again in this cursed woods.<br>
<br>
After making a few stops in Freeport, I traveled most of the day.  I got into Kithicor Forest as the sun was getting low, so I started looking for a place to stay.  Quite a few doors I came across were locked and barred, lending to the general feeling of unease of the place.  Finally I found an inn that would admit me, though the keeper only unbarred the door long enough to hastily get me inside, then barred it again.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Moving my hand, I stand up, the old elf smiles at me.  Suddenly, he doubles over as if in pain, and his features seem to be trying to shift.  For a moment, he seems almost to look like he has the dark skin of the fallen elven race.  The image does not stick, but rather constantly shifts between the warm caring old elf and a cruel grotesque dark elf.  I reach in to try and help, but as soon as I touch his skin, I am blast backward by a force of energy.<br>
<br>
I am dazed for a few seconds, just staring up at the clouds drifting by overhead.  Inside myself I can feel the same struggle going on nearby in the elf.  The feeling passes and I am able to stand up.  There is no sign that the elf, nor his internal struggle, had ever been nearby.  I look around at the nearby hills, trying to find some sign of life.  But the rolling fields of grass are unbroken, waving gently in the occasional gust of wind.<br>
<br>
The clouds pass overhead, driven by some unfelt wind.  The more I notice them pass the more I feel as if they are tugging on me, urging me to follow their progression through the sky.  Following the clouds, I seem to float over the fields of grass.  The distant hills do not ever seen to get closer, yet I feel as if I am going in the right direction.  I notice a black dot in the cloudy sky.  Straining against it, I discover it is a crow flying towards me.  The crow lands in a nearby tree and looks at me.  It caws three times, or is it a caw?  I wake up to the sound of an evil screech outside.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Huddling in my bedding, I sit fearing to hear that sound again that woke me from my dream.  It does not come again, but I do hear other chilling sounds around.<br>
<br>
This dark accursed forest does not give any comfort.  I doubt I shall ever stay here again.  Yet still, I feel the pulling west even stronger than before, and that eases my worries some.  I shall be glad when sunrise comes and the light chases the dark away.  The sooner I can get out of Kithicor Forest, the better.  I still do not know the meaning of my dream, but I am certain that something about this place has fouled tonight’s dream.  It is as if there are two warring forces.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Already the rain has lightened significantly from last night.  For the first time in days, I awake relaxed and calm.  This is something I could get used to, if I did not feel a calling, both a calling to travel and a calling to go west, to Erudin.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Noise and confusion.  The world is spinning around me, or am I spinning?  The ground is far below, yet I am not falling.  Fear, terrible fear, and hatred.  My hatred?  Plant, dirt, debris, fly around me, as if a tornado is ripping through the lands.  I try and run from it.  There is a house nearby, I can seek shelter in there.  Run towards the house, must escape.  As I arrive, the house is ripped to shreds.  I turn around and to horror see that the destructive winds have followed me.  I look down and the occupants of the house are running away screaming.  The destructive force has followed me.<br>
<br>
No, I am the tornado.  I have destroyed this quiet home, torn these kind people from their house.  What have I done?  I run off away from the house, plants, dirt and debris flinging aside where I run.  Those whom I have sought help from I have only hurt.  All that I touch is destroyed.  A terrible knot forms in my gut as I think about what I have done.  I can not help but crumple over myself and weep.  I am not a hurricane, I don’t destroy houses!  Do I?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I was glad when I was out of Kithicor onto the trail to the pass.  I was even more glad when I found the keep and was able to stop for a real meal, since I had skipped breaking my fast to get out of the forest as soon as the dread eased at dawn.  The guard at the pass is heavy, but I needed food.  I managed to find an unwary traveler and lightened their purse.  I think a guard saw me, but if they did, they did nothing.  Better fed, I was sure to depart immediately.<br>
<br>
Crossing the planes of Karana is always quite a task.  I only made it about half way before the sun was threatening to dip behind the mountains.  Clouds were rolling in from the east, and a small storm ensued.  Drenched, I plodded on, looking for some shelter.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The winds faded and gave way to a light rain over the lands.  The patter of drops around me unknots my stomach and I am able to regain myself.  All around me there is destruction.  My destruction.  I hate myself for what I have done.  Someone puts a reassuring hand on my shoulder.<br>
<br>
Behind me, the old elf comforts me, though his expression is one of anger.  Anger directed at someone else, not at me.  I start to confess that I caused the destruction, but he stops me before I start.  The rain comes down harder, yet we do not get wet.  A curtain of water hides the destruction from me.  I protest, I do not want to be shielded from what I have done.  The elf just continues to comfort me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shelter found me quickly.  A farmer shouted out to me nearby.  He asked if I had anywhere to stay the night and keep out of the rain.  I said no, and he offered me shelter and bed.  Not one to turn down the offer, I accept and follow him into his house.  He sits me down and gives me a small meal and sits me in front of the fire to eat.  I ate while he just waited quietly.  When I finished eating I thanked him for the shelter and meal.  I may be opportunistic, but I am still grateful for help.<br>
<br>
He told me that it came to him in a vision from Karana that I would be coming.  He doesn’t know who I am, or why I come, but he could not leave me out in the rain.  He told me of Karana, or the rainkeeper as some know him.  The rain is a blessing of Karana, he told me.  Karana is wise, bringing rain for the crops, and kind, for he stays his hand at the full fury of the storm.  A religious nut, but at least it is out of the rain.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The curtain of rain fades and all around me I see the rain has brought new life out of the destruction I caused.  The sorrow and heat in my heart is replaced by joy and celebration.  How can I fear and hate with all this glory around me.  I turn to embrace the old elf, but he is nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
Off in the distance there is a city, standing in glory, defying the destruction that came before.  A crow flaps by overhead, flying towards the city.  I chase after the crow, but it is faster than me.  It caws three times, then continues out of sight towards the city.  A sweet aroma comes from the city.  Or is it from the city?  I wake up to the scent of the farmer preparing a meal to break his fast.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I take a last bite of the morning meal the farmer offered me.  I have not had such a nice meal in a long time.  I will have to come repay this farmer his kindness some time.  Still, maybe I should listen to his rant.  All my dreams are about rain and storms.  Perhaps the old elf is not my father, but is Karana.  Could it too be a vision from the rainkeeper?  If so, to what purpose do I travel west?  Perhaps I should share my dream with him and see if he has any idea what it means.<br>
<br>
What am I thinking, he’s a nut, plain and simple.  But I cannot deny the calling I feel to travel west.  I cannot explain it, yet it is there.  Once I get to Erudin, I hope someone there can tell me what is happening.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

The weather cleared up nicely and was most welcoming to a traveler, though a light rain is starting to pick up now.  There is just one more leg of the journey, the boat ride from Qeynos to Erudin.  Finally I will be able to get my questions answered.  Maybe.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The gates of Qeynos are quite a welcome sight in the distance.  The sun is starting to approach the horizon, so I think I will stay the night in Qeynos before finishing my journey to Erudin.  I can now feel a sort of calling not just in my dreams, but in my waking moments, too.  Stopping to take a swallow from a flask of water, I note my provisions are getting low.  I will be arriving in Qeynos just in time.  Still, this is all I can afford with the meager money I have.<br>
<br>
The guard tower that watches the pass from Qeynos Hills to the plains of Karana looms overhead.  A pair of guards man it, both of their eyes fixed on me as I pass.  One of them is a muscular shapely figure with a hardened expression.  His hand rests on his sword, his whole body facing me, as if he is saying just give me a reason not to let you pass.  The other guard is a little bit plumper, and while he wears the same uniform, his is adorned in a few jewels here and there.  He is more relaxed, and is only casually watching me, going through the motions of guarding, but not really seeming to be present here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  The days events are all quite so confusing.  This afternoon while I was arriving in Qeynos, I felt sure that I needed to go to Erudin to get my question answered.  Now I’m not sure.  As soon as I arrived in Qeynos I had doubts about my plan.  Was my plan wrong to begin with, and I was supposed to go to Qeynos?  Whatever gods there may be, Karana or otherwise, seem to want me to stay.  I went to the dock to inquire about when the boat would be leaving for Odus.  There was a friendly gnome there who said he was from the Academy of Arcane Sciences.  Apparently the boats are having trouble, and he recommended I check back in the morning, and that they were working on getting some sort of transportation in place, whatever that means.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I pass through the gates under the watchful eyes of more guards.  There are a few gnolls about trying to break past defenses, so they are not paying quite as much attention to me.  Past the gates, I turn the corner and find a pub.  Now seems as good a time as any.  I glance up at the sign as I push open the door.  “…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  A crow caws three times</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->…”  Crows Pub and Casino.  Just inside the door is a painting of  crows playing poker.  Sitting at the bar, I order ale.  The bartender asks for payment in advance, so I glance around and find some unattended payment while his back is turned.  He sets down a napkin and places a glass of ale on it, giving me a dirty look as he picks up the coin to inspect it, before shoving it in his pocket.<br>
<br>
The grass is quickly drained and I pick up the napkin to wipe the foam off my face.  Just then I notice a message scribbled on the back: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  An unseen hand from the shadows beckons you into the darkness.  Hanns Krieghor has need of your skills.  Take this note to Hanns, and he shall instruct you further.  Go to Crow’s.  Your entryway into the unseen lies behind the painting.  Tread carefully, the obvious path is the wrong one.  Feel the walls for safe passage to the hideout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Glancing up, the bartender is busy wiping off glasses, not paying any attention to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Everything that has transpired this afternoon feel like puzzle pieces that have been falling into place.  The pub, the feeling, the boats.  And I’ve been thinking about what the farmer said about Karana the other day.  I’ve never really thought much about the gods.  Perhaps it is time I started thinking about more than just myself.  Or perhaps not.  But I am here for a reason, I am sure.  I just don’t know what yet.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The passage was dark and damp, lit only by a few torches.  Finding the entryway behind the painting was tricky, but fortunately it was in a private room so I had time to analyze it.  Following the path I almost mis-stepped,, falling into a hidden pit.  The obvious path is the wrong path indeed.  I backtracked a few steps and found a spot in the wall where the bricks could be moved just enough to slip through.  A false wall of sorts.  I went in and found a man standing there who must have been Hanns Krieghor.  He looked at me with an accusing glance, declaring “Lucky thing you weren’t followed, or you’d be breathing through holes in your back right now.”  Charming.<br>
<br>
I explained him about the bartender and showed him the napkin.  He explained that he’d gotten word of me when I passed through High Hold Keep.  He could use someone who could slip in and out of shadows as I could.  However, he said my skills were poor.  What flatter.  He offered to help train me in the ways of the Circle of the Unseen Hand.  He also called me a sewer crawled, again flattered I’m sure.<br>

There is an exceptionally large number of spiders about, but as usual they keep to themselves.  The desert is often quite empty, save for the bands of outcasts that make camp here.  It is with them my target lay, for I had a score to settle.  There is a voice, am I imagining it?  A booming voice calling out from across the dune.  I almost did not hear it in the wind, and thought the heat was getting to me.  But there it is again.  Following the voice to where it was coming from I find a little gnome standing on the platform the wizards use.<br>
<br>
Others followed the calls as well and are now gathered around.  Finally with the crowd about and curios, the gnome speaks.  He proclaims that he was working on the ultimate clockwork.  He was nearly done.  However he needs the chitin from the tarantulas that roams the dunes to complete it.  A few disperse, off scouting for the tarantulas at that point.  I will admit I am curious about the clockwork.  I had heard of the gnomes before but never seen their work up close.  But curiosity is not enough for me to go roaming across the desert after some overgrown spider.  The gnome offers to pay, however.  That is enough for me, and I set out, joining the others hunting down the spiders.<br>
<br>
The spiders had apparently scattered from all the commotion, but after some scouting I am able to find one.  Quickly dispatching it, I bring back part of it to the gnome, who offers payment in return.  The gnome says he still needs more and would buy all I could get.  So once again I set out, find some spiders and gathered their chitin.  However when I get back the gnome was gone.<br>
<br>
Others were also gathered around, their spider chitin ready to sell to the gnome.  The lousy footrest ran off and did not buy all the chitin he said he would.  I curse into the wind and prepare to once again set off after my mark, when I hear the same voice in the distance again, and some clanging metal.  More clanging, and some curses.  I try to find out where the voice is coming from, but the entire desert has gone silent.<br>
<br>
Then I see it.  A monstrous metal spider comes stomping through the desert, straight at the crowd of onlookers.  However it quickly becomes apparent it is not there for a show.  This thing wants destruction.  Of all the stories I have heard of gnomes, I had heard none of them being destructive like this.  Several fall to it’s attack, and then it turns towards me.  I try to stop it, but my blade is no match for the metal.  It is the best I can do just to not get hit too bad.<br>
<br>
I run off to get help, but I scarcely get a dune away when help arrives uncalled.  One more skilled than myself arrives and is able to take care of the spider.  However, no sign of the gnome to be found.<br>
<br>
Those gnomes are not to be trusted if they unleash such as this on the world.  Perhaps it is time for a trip to Ak’anon to try and track this gnome down and show him his mistake.<br>

Every joint in my body is sure, and it feels like I have quite a few bruises developing, if not a few broken bones.  I try to open my eyes, but manage only slits, viewing the world around me blurrily.  I can not remember where I am.  Straining I try to make out the world around me.  I am indoors, in a large room with unnatural lighting.  There are people moving around me, and some spells being cast.  And bodies, everywhere.  Of all races.  Human, elves good and evil, lizards, cats, halflings, and more.  Some of them are moving, some of them not, and fromt he sound of it some in as much pain as myself.  And something else; bent and torn metal of odd shapes.  Almost like...<br>
<br>
Clockwork.  I'm in Ak'anon.  I went to Ak'anon.  This must be the work of another crazy gnome's clockwork.  No, I think I remember now.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The road leading up to Ak'anon is twisty and can sometimes be dangerous, but I have almost arrived.  However, the steamfont mountains are somewhat quiet, in a disturbing way.  I round a hill and the entrance to Ak'anon is visible over the hells.  I start running through in my head the demands to make of the gnomes for the crazy tinkerer with the clockwork spider.<br>
<br>
Something is amiss.  There are normally guards posted at the entrance, yet none are now present.  Probably for the better, whatever their reason it just makes it easier for me.  I stroll in and try to remember the directions around the city I was given.  Lost in thought, I round a corner with less care than I should have, just in time to hear a scream.  Snapping out of my wandering thoughts, I duck into a shadow and freeze.  There is clanging of weapons and armor ahead.  Some battle commences forth, yet I do not know why.<br>
<br>
Skillfully I slink through the shadows into the city.  There I see the most horrid sight; gnomes slaughtered by the dozens, their clockwork in pieces among the bodies.  But not just gnomes, other races too.  This is clearly a city under attack, and with many allies here to defend the city.  Some evil force moves in here.  I have no love for gnomes, but the sight is disturbing.  These people live here, their very home is being invaded, giving them nowhere to turn to should they be run out.  My mission now completely forgotten, I must press on and find out more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I roll over and try to prop myself up on my hands, but a sharp pain in my left arm quickly ends that effort.  With a grunt I collapse back down onto the ground in pain.  Someone who was leaning over another limp figure turns at the sound and leans over me.  A female elf, pureblood it looks like.  She tells me, &quot;Relax, just lie there.  It is safe now, we will take care of you.&quot;  Her gentle touch and soothing voice calm me more than her words.  My head continues to throb with pain however.  The elf turns away and leaves my line of sight.  I decide I do not have the energy to turn and see where she went at the moment.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Carefuly to avoid detection, I sneak past the battle.  The further I go in, the more bodies I see, littering the halls and chambers of the city in the mountain of steam.  Slipping along the underside of a bridge over water, I make my way towards a central looking structure.  If my sources are correct, this should be the throne room.  Making my way swiftly and quietly inside, avoiding the bodies of the falled gnomes, I find the head of the offensive force.  There the king himself, and his guards, are battling to hold off what the rest of the city could not.  Dark elves battled the gnomes and the clockworks.  The king appears to be winning, but I feel uneasy, so withdraw as one of the dark elves falls.<br>
<br>
Back out the way I came, the shouts of triumph behind me warming my heart a little.  As I make my way back out of the chambers of the king, the sound of battle once again reaches my ears, and the sharp calls of the Iksar along with it.  Racing in the direction the sound comes from, I stop short of the door and peer in, carefully working to remain hidden.  Inside, a few of the force of attackers stands in defiance of all that would challenge them.  Repeatedly brave fighters approach, and repeatedly they fall.  As I watch in horror, defender after defender falls.<br>
<br>
I try my best to remain firm, but a tear creeps into my eye.  Past memories long forgotten are re-awoken.  There was a couple of humans I once called parents.  They lived in the slums of the city of Freeport.  They were not my real parents, but they treated me like they were.  That all came crashing down the day the so called militia raided our homes and slayed the humans, all in the name of justice and peace.  But peace is exactly what they robbed from me.<br>
<br>
And justice is what I shall now seek!  The memory sparked a fire, which now rages inside me.  This iksar here may not be the militia who robbed those that I cared about from me, but they are no better.  I don't care what it takes, I will step in and stop it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I close my eyes and start to fall asleep again, but a human male approaches me.  I make a motion to stop and protect myself, but he just stops and waits for me to calm down.  He speaks to me, &quot;Don't move, I am here to help.&quot;  His voice is rough, but his actions are as kind as the elfs.  Muttering a few words, a blue glow emanates from his hands and surrounds him and me.  I can feel my body being mended from the inside.  Cuts closing up, wounds healing over, and bones knitting themselves back together.  There is a brief sharp pain, then the human stops and the glow fades.  He tells me, &quot;Just rest for a bit, you will still be quite sore.&quot;  I start to protest, but he is gone before I get a chance.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The burning desire consumed me, and shocked by my own boldness I step out into the open.  Raising my voice above the clamor of battle, I declare, &quot;This is not my battle, nor do I particularly care for these gnomes.  But this bloodbath must be stopped.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Iksar turns to face me and raises his weapons.  His blade swings, and faster than I knew I could, I dodge.  I cease to think, and just react.  But the lizard is fast, and catches me with his blade on a stroke back.  Before I even have time to feel the pain, I am dazed by a blow to my body, then another right after.  I barely manage to dodge a kick and make an attempt to duck out of sight, so I can sneak in for a chance to bury my pick into his back.<br>
<br>
I have never seen anybody move so fast.  My attempt to duck out of sight fail horridly, and another blow knocks me off my feet.  I try to scramble back, but am met yet again by a blade carving deeply into my flesh as if I were wearing no armor at all.  Another blow and I am again dazed.  The iksar calls out in a rough accent, &quot;Now YOU die, Mithlin!&quot;  I completely panic and again try to find somewhere to hide, but a blade finds its mark in my arm.  Again and again I am pounded by the merciless beating.  I throw in all my effort to swinging my pick at the lizard, trying to fend off the next blow, but my hastily aimed swing goes wide, leaving my side exposed.  The iksar takes the oppertunity presented him and his blade meets my flesh.<br>
<br>
Everything goes dark.  The sounds of battle continue, as if off in the distance, in some dream.  It was all a dream, and now I rest.<br>
<br>
And nothing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  What a fool have I been.  I thought I would be the one to save these people from my fate.  But if anything I have just learned how little training I have.  And what little intellegence, too.  For if these healers were not here, surely I would not have a second chance.<br>
<br>
But I have a second chance.  I have a second chance at life, and a second chance to right what has gone wrong in the world.  I have been reborn anew, with a will I knew not I had.  What is the point of living if there is no point to life?  Not just my life, but all life.  I have been becoming leanred in the skills of battle, but my abilities are but a whisper of the storm they will be.<br>
<br>
No more will I sit idle while the world falls into destruction.  No more will I not see beyond my own well being.  This is not about a single crazy gnome, this is much bigger.  Forgetting all aches, I leap up and call out, &quot;Listen to the whisper now because the storm comes!  I am the storm!  I am Lussarrna!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>
