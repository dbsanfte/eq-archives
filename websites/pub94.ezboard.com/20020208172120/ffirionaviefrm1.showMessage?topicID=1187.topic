My wife and I have recently started playing on the Firiona Vie server and have been having a wonderful time.  My alter ego is Mahakala of Qeynos, a dedicated and good natured monk who is at best spiritually gullable.  I have no idea exactly what this means yet but I am sure he will grow into it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>My wife plays Kindell of Halas, a Barabarian shaman (I prefer &quot;witch doctor&quot;) from the cold Northern lands.  <br><br>We both have been playing EQ off and on since March of '99 (wow, has it really been that long!) on the Morell Thule and E'ci servers.  We wanted a break from all the twinking and powerleveling and think we have found it here on Firiona Vie.  I was thrilled to see the higher levels wearing Banded!  I still havent seen anyone in full plate yet that wasnt a NPC.  At last I thought, a place where I can re-gain a sense of self accomplishment in EQ.  I haven't felt that way since the first few months I played my necromancer on Morell Thule.  <br><br>I do have a question though.  Does the TLC ruleset and one character per player really seem to cut down on the twinking?  I guess what I am looking to regain is the sense of awe I had when Soulfire and characters in full plate did seem like heros of the land.  That lost time before everyone was lvl 50+ and in full planes gear.  Somehow the world seemed more &quot;natural&quot; then.  I hope my question makes sense since it is so subjective.  I would love to hear your takes on this.  So far it seems that most on this server would stop and socialize as often as hunt and I really like that.  I look forward to meeting you in my travels.  Thanks in advance from the bottom of my non &quot;Uber&quot; heart.<br><br>-Mahakala <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/24/02 5:24:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1187.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello, a friendly introduction and some observations</span><hr size=1> I haven't seen many twinks at all.

What type of quest you might wonder. Well as you should no we have tlc so high levels will sometimes bargin with lower level chars to get tlc loot for them. It works out for both players very well.  The other fun thing is that with no low level twinks you have to actually plan low level raids like runnyeye. No run in ther with 3 twinks and take out the whole place which makes it fun.

Problem is, most of it I worked darned hard to get.  Much of it was bought, and a lot of it is hand made.  I was accused once of being a twink, and I didn't bother arguing with the individual.  &quot;Nice Twink&quot; they said.  As if twinking were possible in the early days of this server.  Duh.<br><br>I've been gifted with a couple items, and I expect to hand off a good many items to others, but all the same I feel twinked.  Not a great feeling, but I know I don't need anything else until I'm 35 or so.<br><br>Appologies in advance to anyone who takes great offense at the fact that I haven't destroyed all my nice armor and set off to do battle buck naked.

(Maybe he forgot which server he is on, hmm?) I have been all over Norrath and have yet to see any serious twinking except amongst a few guilds. And those guilds level those characters up so fast they are off our radar before it becomes a problem. I was in Crushbone last nite, if I was going to see a twink it would have been there. What did I see, some people in pretty good armor that was mismatched, like a bronze breastplate but patchwork sleeves, dwarven ringmail tunic and leather etc.. This is stuff people can get at there levels. Twinking is by far the exception, not the rule.<br><br>Lexxi Ledenyetz<br>25 Prayer<br>Cleric of Brell<br>Ak'Anon<br>Officer and Heiress - Ledenyetz Troupe<br><br>PS.
