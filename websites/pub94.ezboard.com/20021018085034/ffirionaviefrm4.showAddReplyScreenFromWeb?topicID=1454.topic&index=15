FV</span><hr size=1> With the bazaar in place, I don't see why they don't restore /auc to city zones only.  It might even push people to purchase Luclin just so they can sell their wares; wow, VI would really like that I bet!  /shout's range limit was perfect.  You can /shout a train when and where it mattered, and people across the zone wouldn't have to hear it since it didn't pertain to them.  By leaving it as zone-wide, all they did was NOT encourage RP... I mean come on, if my character actually shouted for a group, I don't think that barbarian shaman 2 mountain ranges away would be able to hear him.  And, as far as alignment goes, why not just include BONUSES?  If a group is all together of similar alignments, they get an XP bonus... that way if two characters really had to group and were of different alignments, they can, but won't suffer a penalty for it.<br>

The population may have been small before May 8th, but at least it felt more like a roleplaying game and less like Diablo.<br>

The last thing I want when tending to the young adventurers in Unrest is for someone to set up camp at the zone line and /auction WTS Ghoul heart for ghoulbane quest!<br>

It would be simple to just make /auction work only in the same zones where soul binding works...<br>

There's a lot that's unrealistic about this game, and I think zonewide shouting is useful as a warning.

<br>
Roleplaying is about communication.  I personally don't think that changes that inhibit communication are that great for roleplay.  I do wish that they would have put some effort into explaining everyone's innate ability to communicate across the world, across huge geographical regions, and even with people on completely different planets, either through some commonly available magical artifact, spell, innate power or just about anything else... but this is Verant we're talking here.<br>
<br>
I doubt you are going to see any changes made to Firiona Vie that would decrease the server population.  As long as they are committing roughly the same amount of resources (in terms of computers, customer service staff, bandwidth, power, ect.) they aren't going to run a server that caters to an extremely small subset of players, unless maybe they are players who A) wouldn't otherwise play EQ, or B) are willing to pay extra.<br>
<br>
My own suggestion was to split Firiona Vie and reinstate the old ruleset, that way people who came in after the alignment grouping restrictions could still leave for a &quot;normal&quot; ruleset server if the new rules didn't suit them, but I know that isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about roleplaying and really want to get into it, best solution is to find another game to play. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

I came here because regular old EQ was pretty damn stagnant at that time.  It was fun as hell to join a group and just barely understand what all those elves and humans were jibbering about.  If they hadn't failed to code this server so that neutrals couldn't invite both goods and evils to their group and guild, if they hadn't removed the daunting task of learning foreign languages, if they hadn't removed the XP penalty for grouping with those incompatible with your character's philosophy, I wonder what sort of world we would have right now.<br>
<br>
I wish they could have viewed us as the &quot;tax write off&quot; server, the one place where they could monkey around with things, and not worry about FV's profit margin, and just gone ahead and gone even more nazi with their restrictions.  Instead, they bowed to the forces of capitalism, and removed a lot of what made us unique in order to turn a profit.  Would have been fun to be the market research joint, to see how many roleplayers EQ2 and SWG could really support.  I'd have been here until the bitter end, as long as my guild were also.<br>
<br>
Still, I am stuck in level 53, and have been here for a long time, because I, the player, refuse to join RAndom_XP_group_full_of_trolls_and_darkelves.  I don't mind that a bit.  I like that even if I have a full mana bar, and you are a dark elf that's going to die, that I can just sit there and watch it happen.  Certainly we could be friends on another server, and you might be the coolest person in the whole world, but I don't have to be guilted into healing you because it's the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  We could probably go wreck house somewhere, and I would be 60 with many AA points if I had gone that route, but I just won't do it.  I would have stayed on Veeshan if that was the game I was interested in playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uniyxqilarre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niyx QiLarre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/26/02 7:50:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1454.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FV</span><hr size=1> I think one problem there is is a lack of agreement about what constitutes 'roleplaying'. To my mind, roleplaying is about developing a solid character concept, with history and perhaps complex and evolving motivations. It involves characters having thier own take on what consitutes 'good' and 'evil', and making thier own descisions about who to group with and why. It involves characters who's alignment, religion and motivation may change as they evolve. Perhaps I'm spoiled by too much freeform storytelling style roleplaying, and not enough hack and slash, but in eq so often what seems to be called 'roleplaying' is 'me good, you evil' rubbish and fantasy cliches. Not that theres anything wrong with having fun playing a fantasy cliche, but that's not all there is to roleplaying! Otherwise, it's just like picking a football team, and just as dull! But there seem to be a lot of people who define 'roleplaying' as 'playing your alignment' rather than a character. <br>
<br>
Perhaps I am playing the wrong game and expecting too much, but I think the whole alignments thing is often distructive to actual roleplaying, unless you can change it every 10 levels as someone suggested, and restricting grouping based on alignment is crass.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the one thing they could do to add variety to the characters that are out there would be to allow people to change their religion. (Perhaps there are quests for this, but I havnt heared of any). Having characters with unusual religions and a good ic story to back them up would put a lot more colour into the game.<br>
