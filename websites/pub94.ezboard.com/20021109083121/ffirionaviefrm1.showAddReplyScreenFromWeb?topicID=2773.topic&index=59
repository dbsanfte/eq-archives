Talk to Coinfist if you want to try and work something out, BUT if I were to make a deal it would have to include first warder staying alive for the length of the deal. This because if Reso wanted to kill 4th again and another guild cleared 1 through 3 it would prevent Reso from getting 4th again. [If you clear warders and really had your heart set on a smolder from first for some reason then we could work out a deal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ] Any deal about this would have to be made in front of the whole server as well since people sometimes like to twist a deal before it is made public.<br>

I only posted that is because I am curious as a player of FV and not an officer of Resolution. If I put Resolution in my sig then it is more of an official statement, but if I just sign it Rollen then I am probably just posted as another player.<br>

Save me at least an SoD*grin* and let the server know ahead of time if you plan to so those of us who want to see it, can.<br>

I think that people who know damn well that they'll never see 60(Myself for example*snicker*), should bitch not about not getting the chance to farm ST.<br>
<br>
I think the fact that Rollen's here discussing this, rather than posting a kudos to Reso for waking his ass, should tell you naysayers that he's thinking about the server(when he doesn't really have to. We don't ask anyone else to ponder what they do in either RP or hunting before they do it)<br>
<br>
I do, rather agree with waiting till the new ST is put in, since so few servers will have any chance to see the changes prewaking.  After that, as long as I get the possibility of seeing what happens when he gets woke up, I don't really care.<br>

<br>
It is inevitable.  I only have 2 regrets.  One is that I likely will never get a Mask of Tinkering.  Even with the lottery there is little chance I will be 55 by then, as I am only 37-38 now.  It is extremely unlikely I will ever get the chance to get one myself, and only slightly less likely I will get a chance to participate in this proposed lottery.<br>
<br>
My second regret is that I will not be able to witness this dragon first hand on a killing spree, even if it is in a secondary location visited hoping the script works this time.  Whoever does it will most likely do it in secret, as nice as a serverwide announced event would be.  Announcing it ahead of time would please some, but cause a flame war the likes of which this board has never seen.  A flame war is inevitable, but people will be all the more charged if they think they have a chance of stopping it. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
EQ is a competitive game. You constantly compete with other guilds and you are constantly competing with yourself to improve your gear / AA etc. You can be civil about it. You can be nice to your competitors (thanks very much for the rezz and buffs in ToV that one day) but the bottomline is the less competition you have, the better it is for your guild.<br>
<br>
Why are you hesitating?<br>
<br>
Are you looking for permission to wake the sleeper? You will most definately NOT find it on these boards.  Four shrouds rock, I think thats enough for every monk in Reso isnt it? Are you waiting for other people to have an oppourtunity to see warders or the sleeper? Well you've given them plenty of time havent you? If folks really wanted to see warders / the sleeper they knew what it was gonna take and they should have worked towards that goal, not pissed around waiting for the oppourtunity to be handed to them.<br>
<br>
Their are only 4 servers with a sleeper still asleep. That does speak volumes. Its tactically wise to wake him so that the top guild can strengthen their position. Yes warders drop some great loot, but weigh the oppourtunity costs involved. What does the top guild GAIN by sacraficing the potential for those drops? Especially if they feel they have all they need. Does Reso need more SoD's? Do they need more Shoruds? Need other warder 4 drops?  If you can answer &quot;no we don't&quot; to these questions then the smart thing to do is wake him.<br>
<br>
It gives the top guild more chances at prime targets, and the ability to equip your people with better gear faster, so you can move on to even greater challenges.<br>
<br>
The only reasons NOT to wake the sleeper are:<br>
<br>
1. To avoid the whining you will get from players who didn't wake the sleeper.<br>
2. You don't feel the gain in competitive advantage is worth the potential gains for your guild in warder drops. That is, you still need loot from the warders. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

...<br>
<br>
That is the absolutely best motivation I have ever had not to level.  It seems that the high level EQ is a completely different EQ than I am playing now.<br>
<br>
Competitive you say?  To what goal?  Runners compete to get the best time.  Fishers compete to convince their friends they caught the biggest fish.  Hunters compete to get the biggest buck.  Basketball players compete to get the most points.<br>
<br>
What is the goal of EQ?  ...  Let me rephrase that.  What is the goal of EverQuest?  The goal is to have fun!  So by saying you are competing to have fun, you are implying that you are having more fun than others, and you will use tactics to lessen their fun to achieve your goal.  Is that it?  ...  Maybe the goal is to be the one guild for that one time encounter.  You want to wake the sleeper.  Then what?  No more sleepers to wake.  Maybe the goal is to be the first to a certain area.  There are only so many places to be first to.  And in most cases, the area does not change once you get there.  If your goal is just to get there, then you aren't even competing.<br>
<br>
Well I like to stick with the goal to have fun.  Only I find that I don't have to lessen others fun to make me have more fun.  I can work with them.  I can cooperate with them, even!  Guess what, cooperation is what groups and guilds and raids is all about.  If you want competition, then go to one of the zeks.  There at least the goal is clearly defined. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
Fun being relative. Fun for some is seeing the high end encounters. To reach that goal requires a level of determination that is not found in all players. But for those that do have that level of commitment then they find themsleves competing for resources.<br>
<br>
Resources being gear from targets that might be on a 8 hour, 24 hour or even weekly spawn cycle. Resources being other players, who typically migrate to the &quot;top&quot; guild if they are folks who also want to see the high end game. All the raiding guilds on any server (including ours) compete for these resources. If one guild can consistently &quot;farm&quot; a particular target without competition they can equip their guild with those resources much quicker which strenghtens their position even more.<br>

Perhaps I'm being foolish, but thats the way I am.  Reso already has a significant head start on anybody else.  If they want to stay ahead of the curve, they don't need to resort to backstabbing to do that.<br>
<br>
If that was really the goal, then if two guilds were competing for resources, it would make more sense for them to merge.  No more competition.  Similar goals and abilities for them to continue stepping on each others toes like that.  And the result is that much stronger of a guild.  It may take longer to outfit everyone, but it would take less effort collectively by the guild as a whole to get that gear.  And once a large enough subset is outfit, they could move on and get other stuff, while the lessers finish off their stuff and outfitting.<br>
<br>
But you won't see that for a number of reasons I won't get into here.  My point is if the only goal was seeing the high end encounters, it is better to work with others than work against them. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

Ya know, this probably wouldn't even have brough up if a lot of the current AS weren't in BoW on Torv(Woke the sleeper)<br>
<br>
But more importantly, a guild that use to push us around, now doesn't have the keys for 4th, and after it being made public that they would wake the sleeper as soon as their monks get their tunics.<br>
<br>
Reputations are so important in this game .. If Sleeper is awoken by Reso, don't even cry when you brought it amongst yourselves.  FnF's dirty laundry was aired, and we found it out .. AS has always showed true FFA, that they were willing to do whatever for the best of their guild(I respect that, mind you) .. But waking Sleeper on Torv is quite a reason to deny a guild here from ST.<br>
<br>
And before some of you go off half cocked saying this is the general census of Reso, understand that these are my opinions.. If I was running the shot, you woulda experinced some zone wide DT's on Saturday.  Hopefully something can be worked out, but the only people who merit to come here and bitch on these boards are folks in guilds such as Ebon Storm, Dreadstorm, Clan Werre, and some other rising guilds.  They're the ones that would get the complete shaft if it was awoken, and I hate to say it, but FnF and AS, ya'll asked for it if it does happen.<br>

Granted this was bad luck but 10? is very optimistic&quot;<br>
<br>
I've only been once.  I thought 3 per warder was the norm.  Add in 1 from MotG, and then FA, and you have 11.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine only getting 1 or 2 primals clearing 3 warders, FA, and MotG, are you sure?<br>
<br>
The point wasn't so much about the number of primal you get as much as it was the force needed to get them.  The number you get is arbitrary to the point of my post.<br>
<br>
And I'd hate to be punished by Resolution because BoW awoke the sleeper on Torv.  How fair is that?<br>
