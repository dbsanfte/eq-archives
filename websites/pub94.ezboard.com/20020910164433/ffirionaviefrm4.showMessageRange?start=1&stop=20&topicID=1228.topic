One had a High Elf, an Ogre, and a Dark Elf, among other group members, and the other was composed primarily of Wood Elven Rangers but also had a Dark Elven Shadowknight in the group.  (It actually turned out that the &quot;Dark Elf&quot; in the group with the  High Elf was actually a Gnomish Rogue using one of them mask thingies, but the one with the Wood Elven Rangers was not.)<br><br>I see High Elves and Wood Elves regularly grouped with Dark Elves in the Great Divide, as well, and I'm sure they all (the &quot;good&quot; characters and the &quot;evil&quot; characters alike) have really good &quot;roleplay&quot; reasons for their actions.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Over the past few weeks, I've gotten asked for Spirit of Wolf by random people either when I teleport into a Druid Ring somewhere, or when I was waiting for the Spires to send me to the Nexus.  When I would turn around (or, sometimes, cast See Invisibility), I'd discover that the person saying &quot;Bro, sow plz&quot; was a Dark Elf.  This has happened about once every three or four teleports I do, and has even happened when I'm on a corpse-recovery.

However, I am regularly in the company of a dark elf warrior... contradiction?  Depends on how you look at it.<br><br>Yes. - In the Yes, I'm a Stinkin' Hypocrite camp, what I'm doing is flaunting the change in the grouping rules.  Shame on me.  If you want to react that way, fine.  I understand your view and I'll make sure not to invite you.<br><br>No - Why roll eyes at RP reasons out of hand?  Is this not an RP server?  Granted, the vast majority of the reasons are flimsy at best, but some might just be valid.  The artificial construct of a rigid race/deity/alignment system can be a useful tool, but also can stifle a great deal of roleplaying freedom.<br><br>If a Dark Elf, at the time of character creation, has NO CHOICE but to be evil, is there no way to RP an exile?  A quick trip in Warslisk Wood can show that there exists a neverending supply of castoffs from a strictly evil society, yet there exists no way - due to the limitations of a preconstructed environment - to assume that role.<br><br>Except in the form of faction.<br><br>My rule of thumb is that if a member of an &quot;evil&quot; race has put forth the effort to repair their negative faction in my &quot;allied&quot; cities (Kelethin, Kaladim, Felwithe, Rivervale, Ak'Anon) then they are worth my consideration.  As a result, there are only two evils that I will work with - Cronadan and Siava, both of Twilight Bastion.<br><br>I'm busting my skinny elven butt to get into and out of Cabilis alive... I know the effort faction work takes.  If a player puts forth that kind of grind into making their character break the mold, then I'm not going to punish them for HAVING to choose neutral evil instead of neutral neutral.<br><br>That said, it'd take an act of sheer desperation to group with or accept aid from a necromancer or shadowknight.  That, to me, goes beyond a matter of alignment and into a far more cosmic matter of disrupting the Cycle.<br><br>But, again, as a neutral follower of Karana, I tend to assume most people are deserving of aid and shelter until they prove me wrong.  After that, they're SOL.<br><br>My 2cp only.

In a lot of cases, the &quot;work&quot; in raising a faction involves giving some NPC a ton of wine and/or bonechips, or setting off a few well placed AE spells in a newbie dungeon.  But as you said, I would respect a Dark elf outcast more, as an example, if not only did they raise their faction with the elves to acceptance, but trashed their dark elf reputation such that they could no longer enter Neriak.<br><br>Grobb and Oggok are probably the only places that make you really work to boost your faction there.  <br><br>In roleplaying, everyone likes to feel their character is unique.  Set against the backdrop of Norrath, it seems easiest to make your character stand out by going in a different direction than the NPC populace.  The psycopathic wood elf... the heroic dark elf... the law abiding halfing... the sexually repressed gnome... <br><br>The problem is so many people go that route, it almost seems more unusual to find characters staying true to the background of their race (ie: Paladins that want to clash with shadowknights -vs- just feeling pity on them, sadistic evil dark elves, etc).  The Iksar on the server are probably the only race that tends to stay true to their background, and a lot of that comes from internal censure (there's a lot of PC Iksar that will insult the hell out of you for associating with softskins).<br><br>That might be blowing the situation out of proportion, but the problems Lasgalen sees are definately there.  The &quot;Everyone's an outcast&quot; problem, that is.<br><br>I swear I would pay to see a Paladin say to someone &quot;I take no pleasure in this act, but for the greater good I must lay you to rest&quot; rather than &quot;I will not draw my blade for I pity you.

But there are a lot of really great stories and storylines that can be overlooked by a blanket eyeroll.<br><br>Swing by the Twilight Bastion boards and read some of the back story that goes on with Cronadan's flight from Neriak ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub59.ezboard.com/ftwilightbastionfrm11">pub59.ezboard.com/ftwilightbastionfrm11</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) or  Isharra's descent into slavery to the Iksar Empire ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ).  There are those black swans who put forth the effort and time to make a compelling story about and around their toon, and it's a shame that those few can be easily dismissed because a traditionally evil race is seen hunting ulthorks with a traditionally good one.<br><br>The tragedy in this is that those great efforts on this server are vastly outnumbered by the folks who just want a necro's damage-dealing or a troll's tanking ability in the party.<br><br>There's no excitement in a black and white world... all the good shit happens in the grey area.  Whether that takes the form of a &quot;black sheep&quot; friend, a hidden love affair, or inner conflict within the individual is up to the user.  Living up to archetype is hard work, too... just boring.<br><br>So, I largely agree with you, Lasgalen.  But we're going to differ on what I perceive to be snap judgement.  I wouldn't want to sift through the random crap most people slap together and call a backstory, either, and I don't blame you for not doing it.  However, I just find that the elite few who break the mold WELL give me enough of a lift to look beyond the power-levellers and lewt-hunters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 408<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:35:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1228.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Firiona Vie (Convenience Preferred)</span><hr size=1> Awww.... thanks for the compliment, Uinin! <p><br><imgsrc="http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/ISHARR6.jpg"><br><b><br><b>Property of Voskor Oth</b><br><b>Slave to the Iksar Empire</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 679<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:44:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1228.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Firiona Vie (Convenience Preferred)</span><hr size=1> First, I don't think living the archetype is boring.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Second, I included Cronadan in the intial post but edited him out before posting.

Better yet would be faction modifiers. Yes, it is concievable that an iksar would be tolerated (dubious) in Freeport through their actions. But it would take much longer for them to reach an aimiable state than say an erud.<br><br>There should also be a careful system of opposing factions as well. I don't think the Court of Pain in Cabilis would take to lightly to an iksar laughing and enjoying ales with the Silent Fist monks in Freeport. So as an iksar, you loose faction with the Court of Pain once you pass dubious with the Freeport monks. Something a bit more dynamic than the current static faction changes for kills and quests. Damn that would be a lot of work to match up all the factions though... heh. <p><TABLE ALIGN="center"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://www.clanrav.net/tatanka/everquest/images/kaissig1.jpg" WIDTH="433" HEIGHT="340" BORDER="0" ISMAP USEMAP="#kaisareas" ALT="Interactive clockwork tiger!
