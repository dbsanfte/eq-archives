No.  I have two friends in the guild and have done trades with a few others.  Do I have a grudge with FnF?  Nope, I have done deals witha  few of their members.  I have roleplayed with members of both guilds, when given a chance, but like 95% of the rest of the server I don't interact much with either group as they simply operate in different circles.<br><br>Aside from continuing a battle which has little, if any point, does your post have anything to do with the in game lives of us little people? <p>Lorec <br>Wandering Judge of the Tribunal <br>Excellent Tailor <br>Master Baker <br>Lousy Smith <br>Master Brewer <br>Master  Drunk <br>Aspiring Polyglot <br>Wannabe Alchemist <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/10/02 5:46:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=526.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The bad blood issue...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I care how this server evolves enough to say these creeps screw it up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>When you say &quot;this server&quot;, you do realize the vast majority of the server is not of sufficient level to even care what you two are fighting about, don't ya?<br><br>Honestly, do you really think any of us give something approximating half a poop whether you're taking out dragons through skill in tactics, or by throwing a lot of people at them?

Based on what I read here I'd have to agree that by far and away the vast majority of every high-end guild (or at least the ones that show up and contribute their &quot;observations&quot;) are, as Syll put it, complete Fucktards.<br><br>The reality is that when I actually speak to these people we manage to get along just fine.  I always shake my head in amazement.  If I posted here they would pull out the napalm and hold a barbarcue with anything I'd said, if they could possibly manage it, but in person we can interact, agree, and even hunt together.  Amazing.<br><br>People say these UberGuilders mostly can't role-play.  Bullshit.  Either they are doing the most amazing job I've ever seen of acting out being jerks here in the Soapbox, tangled up in their personal little dramas, or away from the Soapbox they do a phenomenal job of acting normal.  Either way, my hat is off.  I don't come to the soapbox much anymore, and my opinion of everyone concerned is far better for that.<br><br>Valquiss <p><img src=http://kanina.freeservers.com/EQSketches/Valquisssig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uqixxfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QixxFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thats not my tail</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/11/02 3:05:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=526.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/dsantos/babykick.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Resolution is...</span><hr size=1> You know what i hate.<br>When the delis put too much mayonaise on my sandwhich and it ends up being a soggy mess by the time i get it home. that and too much mustard.<br><br>&quot;As long as you make make a flame, i can derail it to make it silly&quot;<br>(very simliar to)<br>&quot;As long as you can stop that train, i can pull a bigger one that you cant stop&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=526.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=526.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=526.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=526.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=526.topic&start=101&stop=101>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=526.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=526.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=526.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=526.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=526.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=526.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
