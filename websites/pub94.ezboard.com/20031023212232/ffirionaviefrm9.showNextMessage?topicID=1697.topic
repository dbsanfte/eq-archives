It gets VERY boring, VERY repetitive, VERY quick...<br>
<br>
There are some really cool features, and I did have fun running around blasting things...  But it becomes a point of &quot;how many times can you blast a jawa and still have it be fun?&quot;<br>
<br>
I keep going back to EB Games to cancel the pre-order...  And then changing my mind at the last second, because I'm a huge Star Wars fan...<br>
<br>
I think it's going to be like Star Wars Episode One;  Leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth, but you'll buy and play it anyway cuz it's Star Wars...<br>

<br>
And it's not because they are afraid of people raving about how awesome the game is.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
7 of the 10 planets aren't beta tested yet.  Expect to NOT see all 10 at launch; they will come up with some half-assed &quot;we will open shuttles to more planets as the player universe expands&quot; crap to explain that lack of testing and development time away.<br>
<br>
All in all, take away the Star Wars license, and you have a game even more bland and terrible (lacking high end content, or middle end, for that matter) than Asheron's Call 2, or Dark Ages of Camelot even had at its launch.<br>
<br>
Do I want to be proven wrong?  Badly.  But unfortunately, unless they have a secret complete version that went to the gold master and we've been beta testing an old version for the past few months, I'm afraid that I'm going to be proven right.  WWII Online and Anarchy Online won't have ANYTHING on the overall poor quality of the SWG launch.<br>
<br>
****Edit:  furthermore, expect a big freaking patch download after you bring home the game from the store.  As long as the gaming public continues to buy incomplete online games at launch in droves, developers will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>continue to release incomplete games at launch</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>

They are deleteing all the negative post .<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
Before I get started saying things that arent positive I want to publicly thank the devs for allowing me to test this game, they really are trying to make this game good, at this point I dont think Q is sleeping and I doubt many of the other devs are either judging by the list of things being worked on. <br>
This is probably going to be beta_tester_review#_13252 but I know that people are truely interested in what SWG is and isnt. <br>
<br>
It isnt EQ<br>
It Isnt DAOC<br>
It isnt UO<br>
It isnt AO<br>
It isnt planetside<br>
It isnt jedi knight II <br>
<br>
I played all those games some for a very long time. When I was less than pleased in beta I referred to SWG as &quot;sims in space&quot;. For everyone that moaned about SWG becoming EQ in space, after about 5 months of trying to play SWG as SWG and not another game I began to wish there was even a little truth to that, but theres not. <br>
<br>
What is it? I started beta in November and tested ever since and I still cant tell you what the game has succeeded in being. It has never been &quot;fun&quot;. Why did I continue to play? It was a beta, I agreed to test it for them and the game wasnt supposed to be fun until a month or two ago. After the devs officially gave us permission to have fun (really..they made a post about this  ) I started to look at why I hadnt been having fun and came to the determination that the core design of the game just didnt work for me. <br>
<br>
It is a very pretty game, walking through bestine truely feels like being in starwars. There are areas of some of the planets that are simply stunning. <br>
<br>
I can tell you one thing, I canceled my preorder. <br>
<br>
One observation that I (and others) made over and over in beta, if you ever liked playing EQ or DAOC (even if you eventually burned out), you will probably not enjoy SWG. <br>
If you dont like combat, if dancing the night away in a cantina is your thing, SWG might be your game. <br>
<br>
If you like crafting..well I'll let someone more experienced in the crafting system fill you in on that. The outsite looking in view is &quot;broken&quot; but dont quote me on that I tested combat primarily. <br>
<br>
I wont bitch about stability, bugs, travel times,subscription charges, or even PVP those things dont worry me, my issues are much more to the core of the game. Things that looked ok when I was looking at what I thought was the framework of a game last year that never really were fleshed to make them fun for me. Mechanics so core to the game that no company would dare change them significantly after releasing a game. <br>
SWG does not offer a compelling game for the one thing I want to do in online games: combat. I am not interested in crafting or playing the role of a cantina resident. <br>
<br>
The combat system has been flavored by the basic design goals of making it accessible for players with no MMORPG experience and reducing the difference between the effectiveness and survivability of new characters vs ones who have been played 40 hours a week for 6 months. <br>
<br>
The result of these design goals is a combat system on training wheels and nearly no tangible reward for advancement. Almost counter that in fact. The more you have advanced up the skill trees the worse you tend to find you fight versus a single NPC of similar &quot;con&quot; or consider value, much less more than one of them. <br>
<br>
Allow me to explain a bit more. <br>
<br>
Root cause #1 the HAM system: <br>
Essentially you have 3 bars health, action, and mind. <br>
Each functions as hitpoints(and can be damaged in combat), if any one hit 0 you are incapacitated. <br>
Each bar also functions as stamina or mana would in other games, using skills (or special attacks) reduces one or more bars just as being hit by an enemy does.<br>
Each weapon type(rifle, carbine, pistol) has special attacks that target one pool. That means its most advantageous to use the weapon that targets your opponents smallest pool (vs another fighter thats most commonly mind).<br>
NPCs can target pools as well <br>
<br>
Root cause #2 Advancement <br>
<br>
XP is awarded based on useage i.e. kill a womp rat with a pistol get 100 pistol xp, after you have enough pistol XP you can train in the pistol tree of marksman.<br>
You dont gain additional pool (effectively hitpoints) as you advance up the tree, you do gain speed and accuracy in one or more weapons and the ability to use new weapons and armor. (nowheres near as cool as it sounds)<br>
Creatures do gain additional HAM (lots of it) as well as increased skills and damage output. <br>
This resulted in what could only have been balancing nightmare for the devs, but they never did get it right its always too easy or too hard. <br>
High level creatures have area affect attacks (and can 2 shot most players). <br>
After a point in the advancement trees if you cant kill them before they reach you as a ranged combatant, you will have difficulty beating even a relatively weak opponent (again thats only *1* at a time). <br>
<br>
root cause #3 Combat flow <br>
<br>
An average fight ranged is:<br>
- spot creature at 64m (regardless of weapon) <br>
- go prone/crouched, use a warning shot to scatter multiples(they will come after you eventually) otherwise use your most damaging special attack <br>
- repeat a large damage attack until they close the distance (or if it is a range creature just repeat) <br>
- if you are prone go crouched once the creature closes the distance(cant shoot prone within a certain range).<br>
- Now you have a choice, watch the game decide the fight for you<br>
or que up your favorite attack(the one that does the most damage) and watch the game decide the fight for you. <br>
If you DONT use a specific pool targetting attack damage will randomly distribute amongst your targets 3 pools (remember to win you have to drop 1 pool to 0% dropping all 3 to 1% doesnt count).<br>
There is no move chaining ala DAOC. <br>
<br>
root cause #4 downtime <br>
<br>
In addition to the time spent awaiting normal damage to regenerate as you have in other games, SWG introduces two new types on downtime that must be taken in either a town or a camp as well as equipment wear. <br>
Wounds and &quot;battle fatigue&quot;<br>
you will gain these in addition to taking normal damage, wounds will reduce the maximum size of your pools or their regen rates until the &quot;wounds&quot; are healed by a doctor/medic (a time consuming process and one the med type has to have supplies to do) <br>
Battle fatigue makes it harder to heal you and is removed by watching or listening to entertainers back in town. <br>
<br>
root cause #5 player based economy <br>
<br>
One of the selling points of the game!<br>
But combat classes are completely dependent on others to be around when they need them or they become ineffective in combat <br>
You need:<br>
- crafters to build and repair you armor and weapons(and other things like droids and houses) <br>
- medics AND entertainers to heal your &quot;wounds&quot; <br>
And you will be seeing the &quot;healers&quot; every few hours for a considerable amount of time each visit. <br>
<br>
root cause #6 Spawn system <br>
<br>
The spawns look like what they are, randomly created relatively static NPCs with no rhyme or reason for being there, you can run for 15 minutes and see nothing then run into a valley with 4-6 camps of different mobs all waiting for you to kill them. The world doesnt look alive. <br>
--- <br>
<br>
I think I would enjoy SWG if only a few of these had been changed in beta, but sadly (for me at least) they were not. <br>
Combat to me has always looked like an afterthought, almost like the design meeting went like this: <br>
<br>
dev1: ok so we have all these professions, what do all the combat professions do again? <br>
dev2: well they leave town, 2 hours later they come back with money and wounds. They use the money to buy things from the crafters and pay the medics to heal the wounds. <br>
dev1: but what do they do while theyre outside town? <br>
<br>
dev2: I dont know well slap together some NPCs put a few <br>
different skins on them and some particle effects and let them attack the players, theyll eat it right up. We cant spend much time on this interaction, we need to get the player based economy and the crafter/merchant/medic professions up and running. <br>
<br>
dev3: thats fine but I have the entertainer profession working but outside our roleplayers noone really has a reason to ever visit them or pay them to dance for them. <br>
dev2: hmm tell you what we can put another wound type on the combat classes and let only the entertainers heal it in town. <br>
dev3: thatll work.<br>
---- <br>
<br>
I know from the devs reactions on the beta boards that this is far from the truth, but its a testament to just how bizare the way combat was implemented. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is this, so much work was put into enhancing the social and explorer motivations in this game that &quot;achievement&quot; motivation players will find little reason to play. And I'm not entirely sure that all of the social and explorers are happy with the current state of the game either (lots of &quot;too much treadmilling&quot; comments recently on the beta boards). <br>
<br>
The most depressing thing on the beta boards now is how few names I recognize from the earlier stages. Too many veteran (and very dedicated) testers simply faded over the months including many who I would call community leaders.<br>
 <br>
These were good testers with alot of patience (millions of chance cubes died in the name of crafter testing) who wrote long, detailed and rational (and often positive) posts that many others would refer to for areas of improvement or mechanics that worked in a fun manner and could serve as templates for ones in need of improvement. <br>
<br>
These people were not lost from only one area of the game but from all of them. Their losss and the lack of changes that came from their efforts colors this release. <br>
<br>
SWG is not a game for everyone, if you like to explore or socialise you might really like it. <br>
<br>
If you like having something to look forward to achieving the next day or like feeling that every day you played you actually succeeded in doing something you might not.<br>

This doesn't surprise me in the least bit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I cannot emphasize enough how much I wanted to like this game.  I'm even the explorer type on the MUD personality test and SWG bores and frustrates me beyond imagining!<br>
<br>
I know that you're probably all growing tired of my negative posts, but I'm simply trying to provide a counterbalance to all the positive hype (not buzz, hype) that the media is putting out for gaming sites and store promotions.  I don't want people to buy this game without being prepared for the downsides, simply because Sony is doing a censorship campaign against negative opinions.<br>
<br>
What Sony wants is a hugely successful initial launch to win over their investors, create more hype, and hence lure more people into purchasing the game.  (&quot;Hey, it sold 1 million in the first week alone?  Must be good!&quot;)<br>
<br>
Don't believe me?  Anybody know of a certain big-name cross-platform game that was recently released and has sold 2.5 million copies despite barely average gameplay and depth?  Well, if you're one of those who were suckered into buying &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; then you're probably thinking &quot;that game shouldn't have sold 2.5 million copies... it may be ok but it isn't THAT good&quot;.<br>
<br>
I only rented it; I was quite certain it would be initially fun but not worth a full purchase.  I was right.<br>
<br>
Will some people like SWG?  Of course; it's not without some good qualities.  It's just that, by and large, most of the people who buy this game will either be online game veterans who grow disenfranchised with it quickly, or casual gamers that expect something even better than Jedi Knight II and find themselves disappointed.<br>
<br>
If, after weighing the positives and negatives, you still want SWG, then you probably will like it, and I envy you for it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Tobrin &lt;Crusaders of Thunder&gt;<br>

I want to play a smuggler.  I don't give a rat's ass about Jedi, bounty hunters, architects, whatever.  I want a smuggler.  So, the first thing I did upon installing the game was check out what I needed to become smuggler and started working on that.  I figured I'd help really test that profession and when it came time to actually play it, I'd have a great profession to RP with.<br>
<br>
Here's the problem: people started bitching that the smuggler wasn't &quot;smuggly&quot; enough.  But I could see where the developers were going with it.  Their smuggler was a person with business savvy who knew how to get out of tight spots.  After all, what's the difference between a delivery boy and a smuggler?  The smuggler knows how to get away if he's caught.<br>
<br>
At times I felt as if I were the only one who felt that we should test the smuggler before we criticize it.  Oh, that's right; I haven't mentioned that the smuggler trainer wasn't even working until two days ago.  That's nine days before release.  That's nine days of testing before release.<br>
<br>
NINE.<br>
<br>
But the thing is, they listened to those people eho said &quot;the smuggler shouldn't be this&quot; and &quot;the smuggler shouldn't do this&quot; and it turned out like a big pile of bantha dung.  They lost their vision.  As EQ players, we kid about The Vision, but, in reality, it's very important.  It defines what everything should be, how everything should work, and how everything fits together into a whole.<br>
<br>
The developers lost their vision of the smuggler.<br>
<br>
So, now we have one profession that hasn't been tested at all, and a number of others (bounty hunter, commando, droid engineer, etc.) that don't give benefits in relation to their skill costs.  Again, they lost the vision.<br>
<br>
There's not one huge thing that's keeping me from this game, but rather LOTS of little things.  I'll be watching the progress of the game as it goes on, especially with the space expansion.  I'll make a judgement later about whether or not I'll pay the $15 a month to play it.  Right now, it's not worth it.<br>
<br>
I LOVE Star Wars.  But, if some things don't change pretty quickly after release, this game will go the way of Force Commander. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

It's a lot easier to bitch than to type up praise. The game is not bad at all. My biggest gripe was lonelyness. But now people will be in it. <br>

<br>
It's not that SWG is a bad game. Far from it but that many of it's major selling points are the social aspects of the game and those won't really flourish until there is a sizable player base in place (catch 22?). The beta, as you'd expect was pretty empty and desolate at times.<br>
<br>
That said, I'm still sticking to my theory that SWG will appeal more to those who enjoyed UO (tradeskills, socialising, etc) than EQ achiever types.<br>
<br>
I think it could be pretty cool but I will most likely wait until the space expansion is out before I play it again. It just doesn't feel right without spaceships <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I did enjoy the detailed crafting in SWG but advancement was not difficulty based when I tried it which is a big problem (i.e. you could just make 10 million easy items to max out a trade).<br>

<br>
Right now, having played Beta for only a few weeks.... I really don't know what to think.  I have several criticisms of the game as it stands now (before release).  But I also see sooooo much potential in this game.  Let me start by pointing out the good things about this game....<br>
<br>
The RP potential of this game is HUGE... I mean really really HUGE.  This game allows you to build a home.  It allows players to combine their resources and create an entire city.  It also allows players to rise up in the ranks of Imperial or Rebel politics.  Allows players to become legendary traders and well known craftsmen.  Heck, this game even allows a pair of characters to become &quot;officially married&quot;  status!  This is very conducive to role playing.  This is something Everquest doesn't even do... there is NO such thing as ingame official married status for your EQ characters.  In SWG, engaging to be married is something 2 players can do via in-game mouse click commands.  And then it shows up on their character bio that they have Status: Married. <br>
<br>
Tiny little features like that gives this game a huge potential for RP.  Then again, if you're not an RPer, you really won't care about these little nuances anyways. <br>
<br>
And finally, there are nice little touches that are also conducive to role playing.... the Entertainer class (the musicians) can actually PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS and their music can ACTUALLY BE HEARD by all other players that choose to listen.  How cool is that!!??<br>
<br>
Hell, there is even a tip command, that easily allows me to give small monetary tips to fellow characters, for example a player who is an entertainer, a dancer, a musician, or someone who owns the bar or cantina.  I can easily tip them small change without the hassle of opening up a trade window.  Very very cool features that are often overlooked.  And also helps out with the role playing aspect.  <br>
<br>
/tip &lt;charactername&gt;<br>
<br>
And in the last patch I found out my character can now sit on chairs.  Yeah, my 3D character can sit on a couch, he can sit on a chair, he can even sit on a loveseat, or sit in a barstool in the local pub and sit besides his guildmates (PA team mates) or pals and just chill out.  The animations now make this possible. Very conducive to role playing. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here is 1 screenshot. I was grouped with Aurora the Twilek entertainer girl.  She is playing her sax for the rest of the group. While playing, we can actually hear her music (thru out computer speakers). And by listening to her music, it soothes and calms our characters and raises back our mindpool and willpower stats and lowers battle fatigue. <br>

Next post.... I will cover my rants and complaints about why this game was released a bit early. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

IMHO they should have delayed release of this game for another 1 or 2 months.  But corporate decisions being what they are.... it's too late to stop them.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) game is still not very stable, but that's the least of my worries. game stability is always something they try to fix and improve with every patch <br>
<br>
2) a few primary classes are BROKEN!!  they are gonna release the game knowing that important base classes like the medic (i.e. the healer class) is totally screwed up<br>
<br>
This is kinda like releasing a final version of Everquest II and then hearing that the cleric class is broken because their heal spells don't work well, and the reason they dont work is because all clerical heal spells require a rare gem component that can only be foraged by wood elves. Yeah this sounds stupid?  Well, that's exactly how screwed up the healer class (medics/doctors) is in SWG right now.  One week prior to retail release.<br>
<br>
Jaranna also noted that at least a couple of classes have not even been tested fully.  Ugh.  <br>
<br>
<br>
3)  Game physics is lame.  I mean lame-O lame.  That's Lame with a capital L. <br>
<br>
****  characters do not suffer damage from jumping extreme vertical heights.  WTF!!!  this means that if your SWG character jumps down a 2 story building, he will never suffer a single point of body injury.  This is a screwed up system.<br>
<br>
****  The JUMP feature does almost nothing.  There is like a 2 or 3 second enforced delay time from the moment you PRESS the &quot;jump&quot; key on your keyboard to the time you actually see your character leap up into the air.  Absolutely lame.  <br>
<br>
**** Characters do not really &quot;swim&quot;.  They just wade across bodies of  water.  Characters can never drown.  Characters can never sink underwater.  They are not even allowed to submerge their heads under the waterline.  They just enter the water and they are automagically dog paddling all the time.  Hence, bodies of water are merely 2-dimensional terrain.  They are not 3-dimensional terrain because you can never submerge or sink underwater.  This is lame lame physics. <br>
<br>
<br>
4) SWG game controls (keyboard and mousing) are disorienting.  Yeah, you eventually get used to them.  But still, they are very unintuitive compared to any other MMORPG.  Even the default keyboard commands on Everquest are 50 times more sensible. <br>
<br>
<br>
bah... I need a break, I cant continue.... too much to write LOL<br>

<br>
Ok, has anyone at all done stress testing on this? I have 6 wives, at last count.  Also, it would be very helpful to know if they are currently pissed off at me, or if I can come home through the front door.  I have never had a divorce, but surely some people might want that. It frees up more potential wives for me, you see.<br>
<br>
Does race make a difference to marriage in SWG? I am an open minded gnome, and don't want some silly rodent (mouse) to tell me who I can or can't marry.<br>
<br>
I also assume that the gnome population is alive and prospering in SWG. My cousins wrote me, they say all they have to do is wear these little robes, put on black face masks and make strange &quot;addebada addebada&quot; sounds, and people flock to buy from them. heh heh, and there is lots of people buying partially completed tinkered robots there. Sounds like a great place for a gnome to make some plat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maritzia>Maritzia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Uptight Cleric</span><br>  Posts: 924<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/03 8:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1680.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: And now, the bad points. </span><hr size=1> &lt;stands behind Trellium with her arms crossed and a flock of sister-wives around here&gt;<br>

But it doesn't work as it should.  Classes are broken.  Crafting isn't working fully yet.  Not even half the planets have even been tested AT ALL yet by the beta.<br>

<br>
I really hope that they've got a complete and functional game client hidden away in the warehouse and that's what's been sent to production, because then I'd eat my humble pie a very VERY happy man.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I don't believe that's the case.  I still hope to eat some serious humble pie and find out that the retail version of SWG isn't the bug-ridden incomplete mound of (pretty) drogmar excrement I've seen so far. <p>Tobrin &lt;Crusaders of Thunder&gt;<br>

I have had about 15 hours of time with the most recent beta patch.  I played many hours about a month ago, and the improvements over the last few weeks have been huge.<br>
<br>
My take on the state of SWG for launch is that it is a good design that will be a very good game... in about 3 months.<br>
<br>
The character design is absolutely wonderful. You can customize your character to an unprecedented degree; shape of the head, eyes, nose, chin, mouth, age, height, weight, muscularity, skin color, hairstyle, eye color, eye size, etc Even an upper torso slider for the women, so that you dont have to be so ..er.. heroic in proportions. The settings are specific for your gender and species, and it is entirely possible to look nothing like anyone else on your server.<br>
<br>
Mal is correct that they have given us a lot of tools for rp. There are a huge number of emotes (with animations) and character moods (angry, alert, tired, etc.). I have grown to like the chat bubbles, simply because I can still see the avatar I am talking to. No more just focusing on a chat window and never watching the avatar. The entertainer classes actually work in the game world. I have very much enjoyed going to a cantina and watching the dancers and musicians. Very social and a large band with a dance troupe is something worth making a special trip to go see.<br>
<br>
I mostly like the skill system as opposed to EQs class system. The way the skill trees and skill costs are organized makes SWG a pseudo-class based system with no restrictions based on species at all. Some species character stats are better suited to some professions than others, but the stats can be set by the player at character creation AND after playing in the world.<br>
<br>
Because you can also give up learned skills and change your stats (over time) there is really never a need to re-roll unless you want to change your species or your gender. Even your characters appearance can be completely changed by other characters skilled in image design. This is important because SWG is like Firiona Vie with a single character per server (SCS) limit. You can have up to 10 characters per account, they just have to be on different servers. Rerolli Marr will not have the same power there as she does here.<br>
<br>
The wilderness is vast and amazingly beautiful. I love just walking or sitting in the waving grass of the plains, watching the clouds chase the moons of Naboo across the sky. Little butterflies and bugs scatter from the flora as you walk by and the water ripples with the wind or a fish. Near to cities you can hear and see shuttles and other air cars flying overhead. A rainstorm sounds and feels like a rainstorm, and you can get lost in a dust storm on Tattoine if you are not watching your map.<br>
<br>
The world is definitely designed with personal vehicles in mind. The wilderness is huge, and I use the shuttle system exclusively to move between cities since personal vehicles will not be available for a while after launch. Walking in the wilds is beautiful, but I find myself spending too much time watching my radar for threats, and not enough being allowed to enjoy the walk. I am with Mal in that I WANT to be affected by the terrain. I should want to use mountain passes or avoid a swamp, and I dont like being able to walk up sheer cliffs or run down them with no concerns of damage. Right now I can just set my direction and turn on auto run, and only wildlife adds will keep me from reaching my destination. Ugh.<br>
<br>
I miss roads and paths outside of towns. The towns feel like they were air dropped down at one location and are not really part of the landscape. Many towns are almost medieval because just about everything resides inside of a set of town walls. The towns also suffer from a problem like what I saw in AO. Lots of buildings, but most do not have a reason for being there other than keeping me from walking directly to my destination. Because most people stick to the towns when not on a specific mission, they are also the most laggy places in the world. <br>
<br>
The crafting classes/skills/experience balance need a LOT of work. Many of the advanced crafting skills have basically not been tested to any degree much less balanced. This is made more worrisome because it will not take a huge amount of time to unlock those advanced skills. If it took 2 months for someone to become a novice weaponsmith, then I would be less worried because they will have a little time to work on these after launch. I believe as it stands now, I can solo get novice weaponsmith over the course of a long day (10 hours). Master weaponsmith might take me the rest of a week to finish. Even a small guild will be able to power train their crafting characters much quicker than that.<br>
<br>
There are no real tactics currently for combat. Solo combat is balanced ok, in that you will tend to get incapacitated by a white con mob (even) about 50% of the time, and the various special moves will allow you to do more than just whack-a-mole. The experience for groups though is much higher; too high in my opinion as in a group you can max out a marksman branch in an hour and be about half way to advanced mastership after a day. The maximum group size is 20, and with that many people you can take a bunch of total newbies and zerg just about anything on the starting worlds. No tactics, no strategy, and therefore not much fun for me. The combat power curve is just too shallow for my comfort right now. I do not get more hit points or become substantially more powerful as I attain higher skill levels, and therefore SWG can not ratchet up the mob power so that the newbie zerg group will properly get wiped.<br>
<br>
The economy is supposed to be largely player driven. Right now about 75% of all cash coming into the economy is from players doing missions, with most of the rest being dropped by humanoid NPCs. Unlike EQ quests these missions are quite simple; deliver a package from point A to point B, or go and destroy some lair not far outside of town. The global bazaar needs work before it will before it is even the equivalent of what EQ has in its bazaar. One bright point is that there are decent drains for cash as well. Using the shuttle costs credits, maintaining your house or harvesters takes credits, your gear will decay with use unless you get it repaired and/or buy new gear, and skill training can cost credits if you are not part of a guild.<br>
<br>
Well I have rambled long enough. I would sum up by saying that there is a LOT of potential to this game. I really wish they had allowed themselves time to get the details right. Because they are rushing it out now, I worry about the inertia that will build up behind the current flawed systems which will keep them from ever actually fixing things. Paying customers hate nerfs a hole lot more than beta testers, and customers are always much harder to say no to.<br>
<br>
I am going to give it a try but I am less excited than I was a few months ago. One nice thing is that there is already a good large RP community organized to effectively take over two of the servers (Starsider and Sunrunner), so if you decide to take a look please do drop in and say hello. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=perramas>Perramas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/21/03 1:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1680.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Loc of Jedi Temple</span><hr size=1> For those interested the  Jedi Temple is at 4154, 5254 on Dantooine <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1680.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=1680.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=1680.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1680.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=1680.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1680.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1680.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
