The sad thing is he is right. <br>
<br>
And honestly if you take into account the goals and objectives of FnF I don't blame them for censoring / editing / locking down shit on their board. <br>
<br>
FFS they will naturally attract all the competitive A-Types on the server. It's got to be hell to keep that guild together. There are some very nice people in FnF, there are also some people I would not enjoy spending time with. But because of their goals they mix together. Good for them for making it work. <br>
<br>
As for me, no thanks, getting to the end game isn't that important. I like grouping with people that I know and have fun with. And yes, I still get a thrill taking down Tarwo in UP, is that wrong?  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~mcjohnson/images/EQ/sig55.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I see posts saying how Fire and Fury ebays loot, Fire and Fury exploits this or that Fire and Fury this, Fire and Fury that?  Are we that fucking interesting to you guys?  I mean seriously get over your fucking fixation.<br>
<br>
As for the people who have been exploiting in Drunder, there have been a lot more than simply Fire and Fury or the people that were pointed out in the post by Yendys.  Sony hasn't done shit about it you know?  I don't blame anyone that does it, I do however think training other people is fucking low, and I have said as such.<br>
<br>
As for what the fuck this server thinks?  I used to give a damn.  I used to even consider myself part of this community.  But you know something, this server has some of the biggest fucking hypocrits there are.  <br>
<br>
I go out of my fucking way to help people.  You'd be hard pressed to find many people who don't like me (at least I think, if you don't like me most of you say it behind my back).  Fire and Fury and Resolution have always had issues about PR, because truthfully we need more players constantly.  We will always need more because with any raiding guild there is turnover, sometimes higher than others.<br>
<br>
As for PR, we've seen different types of PR.  In the past Fire and Fury has sponsored such rp events such as Tinkerfest, Resolution has led open raids on Plane of Mischief (back when it was hard to get there).  The community loves these guilds at these times, and then turns around and bitches about how &quot;uber&quot; they are and how they &quot;ruin&quot; this perfect little roleplaying community.  I'm tired of the bullshit and am willing to call the people on it.<br>
<br>
Half of the people &quot;bitching&quot; about ebay proudly wear their bazaar bought gear from zones they will never see, they happily accept rewards from things like Gore's old dueling competitions, or like the one I just held.<br>
<br>
Personally from this point on, I could give a rats ass what this &quot;community&quot; thinks of me.  I've been here since the beginning, given things of myself to it, and been given things out of it.<br>
<br>
The people that know me, know me.  The people who want to believe ANONYMOUS posters (and yes Cielo please redefine what the hell anonymous poster is, because right now its no better than allowing anonymous posters.  If you'd like an example of why that is so Ill do it for you).<br>
<br>
Oh for the record, Oafgau isn't in FnF anymore, and wasn't in Fire and Fury whenever he posted that, so for those saying that's the GUILD STANCE, please drive through. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Its not about being above criticism Irexes.  It's about the fact that such an obvious walk around to the rules is being used to beat a dead horse thread.  <br>
<br>
Its about our own guild drama being brought to the boards and inflating it by random people giving their comments about things that should be handled in guild.<br>
<br>
Its about random rper_01 talking or posting about how all those rumors about how bad FnF is must be true because we don't live up to their expectations.<br>
<br>
No one mentioned ebay, its just one of those topics that gets brought up over and over.  Ebay hurts us as a guild much more than it could possibly hurt the server, yet we have to listen to shit over it.<br>
<br>
Just as I said, I'm fucking tired of the hypocrisy of most of this community in their actions.  So I don't give a fuck anymore. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Sometimes shit happens and you make choices, I made one.  I have to live with it.  I'm lucky the friends that I hurt with that decision let me back in and forgave me, but then again its none of your fucking business is it?<br>

<br>
I haven't seen the collective of FnF stand up here and say: We approve.<br>
<br>
A few people in FNF think its ok. A few people do not. A few people are on the fence, a few people do not care.<br>
<br>
I have said it once, and I'll probably say it a thousand times. One person does not a guild make. Their actions may reflect on their guild, and if the guild takes no action against them, it may also reflect on them, but I think all of us know by now that FnF is merely a sum of all its parts. Some of them are good, honest, civil people who I call friend. Others of them are fucktard assholes who have no consideration for others. I'm not going to hold something against one or two people, the actions of a few others. The problem here is that some of these folks desperately (or not so desperately) want to go to the end of the game and kill Quarm. They want to be the first that do it on this server. The guild closest to that goal is FnF. Many of them feel if they left FnF it will never happen for them, thus -- this bug/exploit/griefing issue is a non-issue for them. They expressed their displeasure, but in the end, its: lets just forget about it and move on. That's their right to do it, certainly. Me, I'd be tempted to move out and start a new guild on my own to try to get to that content. But thing is, its been done before, and many of those offshoots have failed. Most folks would probably feel that to do so, to break things apart at this stage in the game, would ruin their chances to do and see what they want to do.<br>
<br>
I can understand that. I may not agree with it, but its not my place to agree or disagree with a person's motivations. I think Zsu is right to tell folks that its not any of our buisness how people react to this or to peruse the internal matters of their guild. The only thing that matters here folks, that folks have lost sight of , is that some individuals, who happen to be in, or officers in guilds that have more than just them in that guild, are using and abusing an exploit, and causing other people harm. There's no need to attack the entire guild for that. *shrug* If you have to attack someone, attack the people responsible for causing the grief.<br>

Obviously you do care or you wouldn't have bothered to help me out as much as you did the other day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There's a lot of FnF people that I do like - same goes for Reso - II - etc...<br>
<br>
I love the drama here (it's entertainment) and I said what I did about Nyno because Witherweaver was trying to do the old &quot;Nothing here folks - move on&quot; routine and no one was buying it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh and Witherweaver:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It shows what Nyno thinks. Why does that matter? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
then you say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This shows that Nyno is a sploiter. But that was already public knowledge. You could have obtained that information by zoning into tactics instead of looking into our forums.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's that second part that matters to people.  Most people, like myself, either won't zone into Drunder until they fix the exploit for fear of dying or can't because (my case) we haven't reached the plains/gotten keyed.  <br>
<br>
When I do reach that level (again) then I would hope that I could zone into Drunder with a group and not have to worry about being trained to death and once again enjoy the grouping in the pit or kite rooms and actually have a mob or two to kill every now and then.<br>
<br>
Nothing personal to you Witherweaver - I just don't see how you can sit there and say &quot; this doesn't show anything other than what particular people think about an issue &quot; when people in that thread admit they are exploiting which is against Sony's rules and not 1) Hound their asses until they stop making your guild look bad (if you cared) or 2) Petition them (which will most likely never happen in a guild like FnF that's in Time and needs everyone it can get).  <br>
<br>
It's all relative - somehow - somewhere - I think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
