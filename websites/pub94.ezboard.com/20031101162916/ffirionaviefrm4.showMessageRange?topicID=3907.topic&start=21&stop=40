I choose to play within the game mechanics. I play my Koada`Dal Paladin as orderly good, and my Teir`Dal Shadowknight as orderly evil. When I play as my Paladin, I will not group with evil races or classes. When I play my Shadowknight, I will group exclusively with evil races and classes. It's part of Duplicitas' history. She fell in love with a neutral character (Erudite Wizard), realised that she was in danger of losing her edge and straying from the path of Hate, and so she murdered him. Now she will have nothing to do with neutrals to prevent herself from making the same mistake again.<br>
<br>
IRL, I abhor racism. I am utterly disgusted by it. However, EQ is not RL. EQ is a fantasy medieval world in which there are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>supposed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be racial tensions and conflicts. In real life, we don't have races that are supposed to be evilly aligned, correct? <br>
<br>
Duplicitas does a great deal of things that do not appeal to me in real life. For instance, she has no interest in finding a mate, but she still has urges. She sleeps with prostitutes to avoid making an emotional connection to anyone. She won't allow anyone to have that sort of advantage over her. <br>
<br>
In real life, I can assure you that I don't go around picking up prostitutes, nor would I ever consider doing so. I am playing a character. I am acting a part in an online play. I find evil characters in movies interesting, usually more interesting than the hero. We all understand the hero's motivations, but there's something intriguing about the evil character, because I don't know exactly where they're coming from. There's more mystery surrounding them, and that's why I decided to play an evil character myself. I wanted to see if I could play her believably, and in playing her as a racist who does questionable things and lives by her own code of honour and morality, that's what I'm trying to do. She wouldn't be very convincing if she walked around holding hands with my Paladin, would she?<br>
<br>
My Paladin is a light reflection of Duplicitas. She is virtuous and pure, happily married to a Fier`Dal Druid, and yet, she is racist too. She will cheerfully kill anything of evil race or class. Even those annoying little &quot;good&quot; Teir`Dal. She doesn't care that you repented. You're the creation of an evil God, and that's enough for her.<br>
<br>
So, I play the purest good and the darkest evil. I enjoy playing as both of my characters a good deal, but that doesn't mean I carry the same attitudes as they do in the real world. <br>

I started calvin when server started, roleplayed occasionally (think I picked True Neutral for alignment back when /align worked)..<br>
theres not much to roleplaying an agnostic human monk<br>
<br>
I started Raijen when I got burned out on the lifestyle calvin was living..,  I was pure RP, very racist.. hated wood elves... but now more and more it seems when I rp with people they try to take it somewhere I dont want to go, and I just cant story in me hating another race (except goblins)<br>
<br>
/shrug, someone starts rp'ing with me I'll rp back til I'm unhappy with it, then I will stop talking or find some way to discontinue it nicely if possible.  call it selfish, call it whatever.. my rp experience is about making me happy<br>

Has it occured to you people that faction = racism??<br>
  <br>
If there was not racial tensions then we would just RP that we all hate the monsters? ...oh wait that makes us monster bigots...we better just hunt animals?...oh wait that makes us animal bogots.<br>
<br>
Simply put you cannot equate real life with roleplay, that is moronic.  The goals are so contrary that they cannot possibly share the same morals or ethics concerning racial tensions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">In real life the goal is peace, we prosper when we have no conflict.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">In fantasy roleplay (EQ, D&amp;D..etc...) we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> prosper through conflict</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  <br>
<br>
In Everquest we have to kill to grow strong, if you kill what another race of people like...you create what?<br>
<br>
RACIAL TENSIONS<br>
<br>
Not to mention if you kill the people themselves.  A good example on the continent of Velious...the entire freaking expansion revolves around racial tensions.<br>
<br>
So please...please...PLEASE people, give me a fucking break from your mouth running about how playing a racist in a game built around racial tensions is somehow wrong or makes me untrustworthy. ~rolls eyes~<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I think the core of the problem is that most people, even those who refer to themselves as old school or hardcore RPers don't have a clue what RP really is.<br>
<br>
RP is not you creating a character in an environment and playing as if it is you yourself in that environment.  That is just fantasy.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying is you creating an individual that is different from yourself and behaving as they would...not as you would.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is why I RP evil, if I played a heroic type character it would just be be fantasizing about how I would be given the abilities and environment.  As an evil I can actually walk in a different individuals shoes.<br>
<br>
I guess I could just say that RPing is not pretending your some<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>where</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> else, it is pretending that you are some<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>body</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> else.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know, I have a feeling I could explain it a thousand different ways and people just won't be able to see it, or perhaps won't be willing to.<br>

<br>
RP is the playing a role within a given axiom.<br>
<br>
The axiom we are given in EQ has different races who have their own goals, and some of those goals pit them against other races and peoples. The Orcs in Crushbone are trying to expand into the Greater Feydark. They are hostile to Elves because they are competing for that area. The People of Qeynos are in conflict with the Gnolls because the Gnolls are hostile towards them - which is because the Gnolls want the land the other people have settled in.<br>
<br>
There are hundreds of examples of such hostilities. Vah Shir v Grimmlings, the Grimmling/Sonic Wolf/Owlbear war in Hollowshade. The Velious affair. I'm not familiar with them all, but I keep tripping over examples as I wander from land to land!<br>
<br>
We take the roles of some of the people for some of the races. We can't be Orcs, Gnolls or Grimmlings, but we can be Elves, Dwarves, Vah Shir etc. and with that, we are starting out playing a race that is involved with hostilities with other races who are highly unlikely to listen to diplomacy (be interesting if you could, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
So we have conflict, and we are playing our characters with that in mind, and so we strive to survive, to better ourselves and... to help our allies against what ever evil (subjective evil, of cause) there is pitted against us.<br>
<br>
Trust?<br>
<br>
Not really - but try consent. When we log in, we consent to obey Sony's rules to play *their* game on *their* servers.<br>
<br>
Conflict RP is okay, so long as those involved are consenting to take part.  If people aren't comfortable with some aspect of a RP situation, then they can ask to be left out - and if they do, then you must stop as far as they are concerned. Not going into specifics, but rules of common sense should apply. To try forcing or inflicting some aspect of roleplaying on another that you like but they don't can lead to bigger problems and claims of harassment. That's something I think is best avoided. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dender>dender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/03 9:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3907.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why can't I have conflict Role-play?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The game is the setting, if you are playing eq for the mechanics you must be some sort of masochist.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Every time some one logs on to FV they see that it says RP preferred.  This of course does not mean required, or  mandatory, etc.  But if you don't want to at all <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHY</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are you here?  Don't give me the I pay so I play where I want crap.  Sure it is true, but if you aren't going to RP then leave those who want to alone.  In other words don't criticize or get pissy with the RP peeps.  All it ever takes is a simple OOC saying not a RPer.<br>
<br>
I guess that what I am bitching about is this is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> preferred RP server.  So people are going to naturally RP.  It just drives me nuts when people bitch about the way someone RPs on the RP server.  Duh, aren't we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>supposed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be here to RP? <br>
<br>
Ah well I am tired and probably not making since so I will shut up, but remember it is a game and no way should RP be taken to mean anything in RL.  Political correctness is bad enough in real life.  Please don't force it on us in a RP setting.<br>

I always try to RolePlay when the mood strikes or there is someone in group doing so, and I still respect the (ooc) convention.<br>
<br>
Here's my problem, I play 3 different tunes (59/51/50) on another server, I two box a Human Bard/Dwarf Cleric on FV.<br>
<br>
I used to have them argue with each on in group. But as you progress, your tunes got more difficult to play, you forget what dialect you are supposed to be in....its just too darn hard to keep up with.<br>
<br>
RP is fun, but its not my main reason for being on FV (ditto what the others have said)...so I drop it most times---hell bards can't chat most the time anyway, let along a two boxing bard..<br>
<br>
I'm a Veeshan Bard and had a chance to trade my Draconic Drums for Thunderous Drums of Karana and 4k....I considered the RP aspect for about 20 secs....then I went ahead and got the TDoK---but hey, I'm still wearing Draconic Pauldrons.....<br>
<br>
If you make a bard and Join Molto....remind me and I'll RP while we are in group... <p>Nesoohc 59 Bard, The Rathe

<br>
I love role play conflict. Dreyk and I would not be friends if we could not hate each other on the game.  Thank goodness Shintou exists to be an enemy... what fun would an alliance of light be with no juxtaposition of an evil city?<br>
<br>
In all the fiction I read, there is conflict, horrible situations, and stuff I would not want to ever have happen to any. But at around age 5 we learn to tell the difference between the story and the real world. I assume others are adults as I RP with them... and yes, if they ever told me I was disturbing them on any level I would immediately stop. But know that what I do, is as I love to weave a story, and never to offend.<br>

I have friends on the server who role play, others who do not, and I see no reason why we cannot share the world cheerfully.   <br>

I do, however, make sure that I let people know I am roleplaying (via tell), especially if it looks like the conflict is gonna get nasty.  But I have no tolerance for people that want to cry RL bigotry or racism at the first hint of conflict in the game.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, as long as I stay within the rules, when roleplaying, anything goes.  If I don't like the way something is going I will either a.) /tell the other player and try to work things out or b.) quit roleplaying with them.  Simple as that.  I expect no more or no less from anyone else.  And I'm not going to let some little hypersensitive crybaby spoil my fun.<br>

<br>
Exactly, Meledi. Too bad some of the people you cited can't agree to this. Its a shame that some people let RP interfere with other peoples enjoyment of the game.<br>
<br>
Caemus, you seem to be exactly the type of person whose RP I am trying to avoid on the server as much as possible. I do not want 'anything goes' RP with strangers, sorry. I don't think there's anything wrong with my attitude. If i get to know you, OOC, maybe I will RP with you. Until then, sorry, no dice (pun intended).<br>
<br>
I RP with a large group on a weekly basis in a tabletop game. I have gamed with some of these people for 15 to 18 years. I also run games at conventions from time-to-time. The kind of RP that I conduct in my home game is not even remotely close to convention RP. 'Anything goes' does not fly in many convention settings. I don't find it fun to have some other person's RP style inflicted on me. Nor do I feel that it is OK for me to do the reverse. I much prefer a stilted, polite RP style with strangers that while to many of you might seem vanilla seems to me to be the best.<br>
<br>
This being said the conflict between the Fellowship and the Necropolis is consensual and probably in the spirit of fun and is, IMO, part of what the server is here for. The Fellowship people and the Necropolis people mostly trust each other to not cross each other's lines. But, here is the clincher: I do not. I have seen OOC hurt inflicted by members of both groups on persons near to them in retribution for perceived IC problems. I really think that most people don't realize the kind of sick seriousness that some people regard their RP as.<br>
<br>
After numerous attempts at RP, I have had only a few positive experiences and innumerable negative experiences. Time and again it boils down to a big issue with 'Anything Goes.' For those of you who enjoy it, have fun.<br>
<br>
But I ask you this, roleplayers, please respect the boundaries of those of us who do not. We still will help you in the game and want to meet you but we are not willing to RP yet with you. We don't care that your Iksar monk considers us a food source, we are going to /em is not an RPer, please stop. We don't care that your Dwarf of Brell doesn't want us to kill the Dain for RP reasons. We don't want to be shunted to a suboridinate because your GL won't speak to elves when there is a conflict between your RP guild and our AntiRP guild over a spawn. We don't want your RP raid leader insulting a member of our raid until she cries (OOC I might add) because she happened to RP with him once. We are allowed to be out of character and we are entitled to OOC dealings as such. If you cannot respect these wishes, do not expect us to respect your RP.<br>
<br>
As far as the 'why are you here if you don't RP' people go, Calvin/Raijen said it best but I shall embellish. We came here for a virgin server. We tried to RP. Some of us tried a LOT. We got sick of the RP but our friends are here so here we remain. Many of you who are saying 'why are you here if you don't RP?' are people who many of us had huge problems with. We stopped RPing because we didn't like your RP.<br>
<br>
Maybe, just maybe, if you want the RP to thrive you should consider compromising instead of insistence that it is 'your way or the highway' to other RPers, new and old. Otherwise you, the RPers, will remain your own worst enemies. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

I think you may have missed my point.  I am not trying to &quot;force&quot; my style of RPing on anyone.  If someone doesn't want to RP with me, I am perfectly fine with that.  I will just go find someone that does want to.  So how is that interfering with someone else's enjoyment?  Surely you are not suggesting that, if someone doesn't want to RP with me, I *must* play OOC with them.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;anything goes,&quot; please note that I did qualify that by saying &quot;within the rules&quot; (i.e., the play nice policy).  I am not deliberately trying to shock or offend anyone.  I simply want to roleplay and not worry about offending someone's hypersensitivities.<br>
<br>
I think the root problem here is the failure among many to distinguish between IC and OOC.  Communtication (e.g., OOC tells) can solve some of this.  But there is also a significant element that just cannot effectively separate the two.  And it's those people who I would suggest should find a different server to play on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baelus>Baelus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/03 1:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3907.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re: Why can't I have conflict Role-Play?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We don't care that your Iksar monk considers us a food source, we are going to /em is not an RPer, please stop.

<br>
You are of course entitled to your OOC dealings in a game but I don't see how you can impose your OOC attitude upon RP'ers any more than RP'ers could impose their attitude upon you.  When I roleplay in this or any game I have no control over how others react to me.  I don't message them and say, &quot;I'm going to say this..you should say this in response...respond to me in RP style or I will not deal with you...&quot;<br>
<br>
You may not care about these things but what bearing does that have on how others feel or play?  None whatsoever actually...you only effect your own reactions and gameplay.  If I were in a group with someone that spoke elvish and I didn't want to respond to them for RP reasons then I won't.  That person may not be roleplaying but that doesn't mean I have to change my playstyle if I don't want to any more than they should have to either.  We can either deal with each other or one of us can leave.  Your statement really doesn't make a lot of sense.<br>
<br>
There is no way whatsoever that RP could interfere with another person's enjoyment of this game.  It's a big world and if you don't want to interact with another person then you absolutely don't have to.  There are in game mechanics like /ignore that can keep your chat window from being spammed with evil not-your-brand-RP (whatever that is).  If I want to emote about eating halfling flesh...how in the world would that possibly effect you?  If I were to RP something along those lines and you sent me a /tell saying you weren't an RPer and to please stop I would have some pretty good laughs actually because it would seem totally ridiculous that that would bother you at all.  Are you a halfling?  Has your family been plagued by cannibalistic Dark Elves?  You've established you aren't interested in RPing unless it's very strictly along your own personal lines so how would me RPing for fun along this vein effect you at all?<br>
<br>
If I am in an RP guild and my guildmaster refuses to speak to you because of your race how does that effect you at all?  If they don't want to break character to resolve your OOC dispute that's their decision.  If you feel slighted because you were relegated to a second class citizen in an RP environment for RP reasons so what?  Who is to say that someone should have to compromise their playstyle over yours?<br>
<br>
A member of your group wants to abstain from killing something for roleplay reasons then so what?  He gives his RP reasons, I assume you give your OOC reasons, you decide to kill it or not and then you will each react however...<br>
<br>
Point is, you're taking your OOC attitude a little overboard.  If someone is effecting your happiness with some in game/in character reactions and that imposes on your powergamer play style then the problem really lies there with you, not with some random RPer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't find it fun to have some other person's RP style inflicted on me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I guess it boils down to this statement.  In a game like EQ where PvP is consentual only it is absolutely impossible for someone to impose anything on you, let alone something as benign as RP style.  Even the most evil and hateful person in the entire game can be put on ignore...then *poof*, imposition of RP style eliminated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=antoinnolouj>AntoinNolouj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQ doesn't drain your brain, honest.</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/03 2:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3907.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   No.</span><hr size=1> The sad thing Nakath is that your little statements above here are not exactly what they are made out to be.

Anti RP?  not non-RP but anti.  Very nice Freudian slip? <br>
<br>
Throughout this thread and the ones like it I have seen roleplayers referred to in negative light.  Like we should not be so defensive of this server.  Well the fact of the matter is the a lot of the non-RPers here are in fact <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ANTI</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-RP.  Not all, but a lot.<br>
<br>
This is the only server for the RPers to go...unlike EVERY other server out there for everyone else.  So hell yes we are defensive of it...we are backed into a corner here.  At this point we pretty much have the same options here that we have on any of those servers...go RP with your people and don't try to create an RP environment.  WTF? That is why this server was created.<br>
<br>
So basically no I fucking won't turn my RP of because you can't trust people to hurt your feeling or some shit in RL.  If anything I do in RP somehow affects you so terribly in RL...you got real fucking issues...get some help.<br>
<br>
I am not responsible for people's inability to differentiate between fantasy and fiction.  I will leave that up to the psychologist that they are hopefully seeing.  <br>
<br>
I will RP with anyone I feel like in an effort to make it feel like the world around our character feels like roleplay friendly place.  I will say it again <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>That is why this server was created</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  <br>
<br>
All that said however I won't persist on someone who obviously doesn't want to play along, that is ridiculous.  On the same note though I won't turn off my RP either.  I will give an example.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Example:</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  I need someone to move from a doorway they are blocking.<br>

<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Now here is what is taking place.<br>
All Fajon wanted the person to do was move, he didn't ask them to RP with him, just to move.  <br>
Was Fajon polite? Nope, Fajon is not polite.<br>
Was the person roleplaying Fajon trying to somehow offend the player of non-rper001?  Nope, just maintaing his character.<br>
<br>
Would it really have been hard to just move?  Don't have to say anything...nothing...just move.  I go on my merry way and so do you.  That is compromise, me stopping to send you a tell and apologizing for offending your delicate sensibilities..that is not compromise.<br>
<br>
Now that is a very simplistic example sure, but it works to show how things go vs how they should go between those RPing and those not.  <br>

If for some other reason you just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to play on the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> RP server out of the what 40? other servers, would it be so much to ask that you not be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ANTI</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-RP?<br>

/sigh, I don't know why I bother posting this stuff.  The people who don't get it most likely never will.<br>

If negative RP interaction with someone that I am waiting for or that my activities depend on (critical raid members, friends, etc) causes  a) me to lose an opportunity b) others to lose an opportunity, or c) everyone to have a bad time because RP pissed someone off, then yes, it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>does</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> affect me.<br>

Not everyone, Antoin, but I do think that this is the case for you and a number of others. I think that the tone of your response does in fact bolster my argument that you are RPing being a prick because deep down you want to be a prick to everyone.<br>
<br>
I also think that anyone who enjoys playing a prick in an RPG on an extended basis might have serious issues that need professional attention. I am glad you say you have me on ignore, but I don't think it is true. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>
