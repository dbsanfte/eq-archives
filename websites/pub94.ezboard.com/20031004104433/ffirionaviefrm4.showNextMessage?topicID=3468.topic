Throughout this post the word camp shall mean the area where you sit down to meditate and pull to. As in setting up camp.<br>
<br>
Having gotten that out of the way how many people would come and set up camp right on top of another group who had set up camp in the same area? Not many I would imagine. Why is the same courtesy not extended to solo classes such as necromancers, magicians or beastlords?<br>
<br>
Here is my complaint. I have begun playing my beastlord again and have been spending most of my time soloing in Dawnshroud Peaks. I set up camp on the stairway which leads to Greig's End and kill tribal gatherers over there. The experience is good and acrylia drops occassionally. It is a fantastic area to hunt in and quite popular due to the fact that it is capable of supporting two full groups and a couple of soloing individuals.<br>
<br>
Now I tend to play there early in the morning because it is less crowded. When I log on I am the only person in that area. In the last three days I have had three different groups (composed mainly of about the same twelve players) come over and spoil my good time. How so? By setting up camp right on top of me. <br>
<br>
This is how it goes down. Our friendly ogre beastlord Tarnok is soloing some tribal gatherers without anyone around. A group of six wanders over and sets up camp right on top of his thick head. They commence to pull right on top of him as well. This is not such a huge problem where the tribals are concerned because they are rather pacifistic and tend to leave you alone if you are not bothering them, but throw a lightcrawler into the equation and watch it go after the guy sitting down every time. When Tarnok pulls to the same area these vulture proceed to swarm around him to see if he is going to survive or die and leave a half dead tribal in his wake (easy pouncing). When they see that I am going to win they commence to pull a small army of their own mobs to fight...right through my fight. Anyone know anything about tribals? Highly social creatures.<br>
<br>
So now I have like seven tribals on me while this group of ingrates attempts to pull them off of me. I end up having to zone which causes me to lose my kill to them. On top of that I now have to recall my warder and buff him up again. That takes a lot of mana for us dim witted ogres. <br>
<br>
When I zone back in I politely ask this little group if they could please attempt to maintain control of their pulls. No response. So the exact same thing happens during my next battle. <br>
<br>
Obviously this is not working out so I ask them if they could pick a side of the staircase to stay on and I would stay on the other side. To their credit they agree and take the right side leaving me the left. Now this sucks for me because the pathing in that area is all screwed up and the tribals will do their best to run towards the right side no matter where you are pulling them from or too. So now I have to double the amount of work I am doing to continue killing while trying to avoid pulling through them. All because they came and camped on top of me even though I was there first.<br>
<br>
So the next day the exact same thing happens. I log in and am there all by myself. This group comes along (with three or four members from the other group) and camp right on top of me. At this point I decide that I am just going to move before anything happens again so I immediately set up on the right side of the stairs. <br>
<br>
Do you think that this group showed me the same courtesy that I showed them in trying to maintain control of their pulls and not drag them right through my fights? Nope. So the train station opens up and every single fight I have I end up having these dolts pull like three or four extra mobs through me and of course they all jump in on my fight to help their buddy out. <br>
<br>
Do you know how infuriating this is? Certain classes are designed as solo classes. They do not need the assistance of a group. Beastlords fall into this class. I have soloed all the way up to a mighty level thirty five and I really do not see it getting any more difficult. The warder is just so powerful (and I do not even have the haste spell yet), I can heal him for too much and I am an ogre to boot so I can take a fair bit of damage. Playing a beastlord is a cakewalk (no offense to you other beastlords out there but after going through life with my monk and my warrior this really is easy with a beastlord).<br>
<br>
What am I getting at here? If you see a class designed to solo somewhere treat him or her as if he or she was a full group unto themselves. Do not set up camp on them. Do not pull through them. If you ask them to join your group and they decline leave them alone. When I play my warrior or my monk I am looking for a group (specifically with my warrior) because I need them to survive. I created a beastlord so I could solo when I got tired of dealing with idiots. Apparently the idiots are going to bother you anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daliondveldrin>Dalion DVeldrin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I put the inky in kinky</span><br>  Posts: 1238<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/20/03 2:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3702.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Dalionbunny.gif Width=196 Height=176></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My Little Beastlord Rant</span><hr size=1> *comforts LoganHex* I like this rant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=209679"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Dalion.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Bunny loving Bombardier of the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqpixelarmy.com/">EQPA</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Dread Lord of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientdarkness.org/">Ancient Darkness</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhatha>Rhatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Animist of Shar Vahl<br>Swiftclaw wants fish!<br></span><br>  Posts: 1289<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/20/03 2:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3702.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darklance.freewebspace.com/images/rhatha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My Little Beastlord Rant</span><hr size=1> You can always petition if they're intentionally and repeatedly causing adds on you, I'm sure.

Don't discount grouping though, we bring a lot to groups later on, and often it's better if you find competent, friendly people, xp wise and otherwise.  Besides, for the love of all that's holy, don't try to solo late 30s and late 40s if you have to, I still remember how annoying it was &gt;.&lt; <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438">Elder Rhatha Sha`Naya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and Swiftclaw<br>

How are you and Lerris doing?<br>

How is the Alliance?<br>

I do not really log on with Manesidus much anymore. Kind of burnt out on the character and as he was my first I kind of messed him up a bit (typical new player mistakes coming back to haunt me later in the game).<br>
<br>
I will log him in sometime this week specifically just to look for you. It would be nice to get a chance to see some old friends like you, Lerris, Coslin and Kashnis again.<br>

I don't care who or what the soloer is, if they decline to group (for whatever reason... could be they have to leave in 20 mins or at a moments notice or something else that precludes grouping), then the group should leave them the heck alone.  If someone (soloer or group) is camping where you want to, find a different spot completely.  <br>
<br>
About this being on a different server than here... the above is my opinion no matter where, but consideration, I discovered, is far less likely elsewhere and is even in scant evidence in some locations here.  Many times it is because of a perception of few places to hunt or because of some stupid perception that one is &quot;owed&quot; the game because of the monthly fee (completely ignoring the fact the other player pays that as well).<br>
<br>
A zone that is empty when one wakes matches the defination of &quot;less crowded&quot;.  The less likely to be crowded when others log on can be tough to reach which is why they don't have the flocks of people there.  While that does eliminate some problems of people stepping on you, it also penalises someone who isn't doing anything wrong (i.e. setting up camp where there is not only no one currently camped but no one at all in the zone).<br>
<br>
All that said.... there are times when, soloing my wizard here on FV, I have moved on to a different camping spot when a group moved in to where I had been, even for an hour or two previous, because I jsut did not want to deal with their crap.  Yeah, I let myself be pushed out.  (but I did discover -exactly- where the trigger is for the haunted chest in CS and how to fight it on the beach easily *smirk*). <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">

I did that once for a guy that was repeatedly KS'ing me back in Dalnir.  He wasn't around when guide arrived.  He came back later, but all I had to do was drop a tell.  Guide witnessed the entire KS and promptly summoned him out of the game to one of the CS cells for a GM to deal with him.  Later on, guide told me GM had planted a soul mark on the guy and suspended him for a week. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=splok>Splok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/21/03 7:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3702.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> I didn't read any of the above posts, but your title reminded me of my little beastlord rant (that i bring up whenever i have the chance):<br>

<br>
Heh. I suppose it is rather odd. As I mentioned before though I tend to keep off server rants generalized here. The situation I described above could have happened here just as easily as it did over on Tunare. It is the situation that I was blowing off steam about moreso than the players involved. I figure anyone can sympathize with situational rants such as this regardless of which server they play on. If I had wanted to mention the names of the players involved than I would have taken it to the Tunare board.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that I rarely play here anymore I still consider Firiona Vie to be my home and am most comfortable in these forums.<br>
<br>
&quot;That by ranting about stuff here...without saying its on another server...doesnt it kinda make it look like people here on FV are a bunch of jerks?&quot;<br>
<br>
I suppose it could. I will try to specify more in the future. For further reference if it does not involve my monk than it did not take place here =)<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyways it was a good rant....probably just should have clarified that for those of us who dont know ya.&quot;<br>
<br>
I will keep that in mind and try to clarify more =)<br>
<br>
&quot;Even a guide can give a warning to someone that is training you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well the reason I did not report it is that I really did not get the impression that they were training me intentionally. More like they were just being lazy with their pulls. While I found them to be extremely discourteous I would not quite categorize them as griefers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Course, you might have to wait a couple days for an answer from a GM or guide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which is why I would not have petitioned them even if they were doing it on purpose. If that had been the case I simply would have moved on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=3702.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=3702.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3702.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=3702.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3702.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3702.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
