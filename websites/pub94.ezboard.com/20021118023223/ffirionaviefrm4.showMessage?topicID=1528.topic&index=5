This whole thing was one carefully crafted ploy by Siffo/Brutin (Sutin if you will) and a carefully selected cast of Saga members to provide those of us sitting here bored as hell updating doc databases with suitable reading entertainment.<br>
<br>
You notice how Sutin never refers to actual events, they are always left unclear and nebulous, like some wrong committed in the past that everyone knows about so they don't really need to be mentioned? Notice how this argument has taken over EVERY DAMN THREAD IN THE SOAPBOX, like a puppy dog begging for attention? <br>
<br>
The gig is up Sutin, I see what you are doing, you and your carefully selected cast of Saga members and one or two non-Saga-members-who-are-in-on-the-fun.You may have fooled others, but you have not fooled me, Sutin.<br>

<br>
And they are in the fellowship, newly joined. The entire fellowship excludes quite a lot of things.  It's pretty tough for folks, cause &quot;oh but could use that iksar monk to pull&quot; or &quot;but that shadowknight ogre is good, really&quot; just doesn't work for us. <br>
<br>
I can say that any of the fellowship are good/neutral roleplayers. Now, I dont know what goes on in Saga's guildchat, but if they go ooc occasionally to say &quot;Uhm guys, my wife is going to beat me up if I dont log out' ... well I dont think that's a bad thing.  It's not 100% in character.. but it's not exactly the same as a discussion about last nights football game, is it?<br>
<br>
I know in the League of Honour, we are relaxed roleplay.  We roleplay, yes, and we stay away from ooc discussions...but if someoen falls into it, they aren't going to get persecuted.  Similiar in the fellowship chat channel, though it's been a while since I&quot;ve seen anything remotely resembling ooc in that channel. (Unless you call &quot;LFG!&quot; ooc?)<br>
<br>
I prefer Chocolate Chip RP.<br>
<br>
*shrugs* Brutin's got an interesting personality.  I think I wouldn't mind knowing him. I know I like Saga. To risk being lame, but... can't we all just get along? What's in the past is in the past, just bury it and move on. No guild stays the same forever.<br>

I am a member of Saga, not an officer, jsut me.  I haven't been in Saga since its inception, I was not in Starspun or even on the server when it was around.  And, again, I am jsut me.<br>
<br>
I think the whole &quot;dirty secret&quot; Brutin alludes to is that Saga has people in it.  Some of the people are RP 98% of the time, some of them RP 75% of the time, some even RP only 50% of the time and make concessions for game mechanics and might even try to build those mechanics into things consitant with how our characters might view the world, though that can be a a difficult thing as well.  I dunno, there might even be some of the people in Saga that RP 15% of the time, such as only when they are in /say and others are Rping to them.  <br>
<br>
Ditry secrets.. so incredibly vile.  <br>
<br>
Saga's people have even been known to talk in guild chat or channel chat (marked as ooc) about someone petitioning to get out from under the world or even trying to figure out ways to rescue the player from the mechanics gone bad and being stuck in a place for over 2 hours without even a shred of a comment from a guide let alone a GM.  Saga's people have been known to care about the people behind the characters.  Saga's people have been known have OOC conversations in the OOC part of their message board.  Saga's people have been known to see humor in a situation and not take -everything- so excpetionally incredibly serious.  Saga's people have been known to even joke around with each other in guild chat and their channel chat.  Saga's people have been known to support each other and encourage each other in RP and OOC situations.  <br>
<br>
Saga as a guild does not claim to be the server's authority on RP or even that it is a 110% of the time, no slacking, RP only guild.  Saga as a guild -does- foster and encourage RP both online and off.  Saga's people do particitpate in -some- of each other's stories but there is never a requirement for all members of the guild to be included in a storyline or that any storyline be opened up to include every member whether the writer wishes it or not and whether the other members wish it or not.<br>
<br>
What business does this have being on a public board?  None.  The only reason some of us are posting is defensively because it is very very hard listening to a bully shout and posture telling you how horrid you are and saying you must agree with him if you don't say anything.  To say something perpetuates the mud and filth.  Not to say anything... well.. the bully perpetuates is by running around saying &quot;I'm right, I'm right, neener neener.&quot;<br>
<br>
As I have said before in other places and maybe I need to say it more here... I am me, no more, no less, just me.  I do not seek to be more, I do not seek to be anything which I am not.  I am jsut and only me.  I am the world's greatest authority on nothing but me.  I am a member of an outstanding RP highly encouraged guild on the Firiona Vie server which is a RP preferred server of the Everquest game.  But I am still only me.  I have never said I am the world's greatest RPer or that my RP matches anyone else's RP, just that I RP Caillou the way -I- see Caillou (or she sees herself when she does a bit of taking over).  I don't stay IC 200% of the time on line and off whenever Caillou's name is mentioned.  I do converse in  OOC via tells and even group (when there is a limited number of us and it is not a pages long conversation when I can and have asked to take it to email or some other our of game medium) and have even made an occassional OOC comment on guildchat and channel chat, especially when appropriate (i.e. &quot;((are the boats broken?))&quot;).<br>
<br>
I am tired of Brutin.  I am tired of -anyone- being holier than thou and insisting only their method of RP is the proper method.<br>
<br>
I hope that now that the &quot;secret&quot; is out, this can go the way of the Dodo.<br>

<br>
Unless of course you just wanna jump right back in this.  ::chuckles:: Cuz ya just CAN&quot;T keep that mouth shut.  Gotta luv ya.<br>
<br>
Just about every damn thing you said here is an untruth that makes Saga look good but is false.  <br>
<br>
Why I am here and why I am doing what I am doing is because while it's okay for you to sit in guild areas and do whatever the hell you want to do, hell lie about it, it's okay with me.  You are only fooling yourself.<br>
<br>
But if Saga is gonna have a falsely built up reputation for things they don't do, and then allow mouthy people like you and others we have seen here attack other people who aren't in the guild, then I am gonna stop you.  <br>
<br>
First, I am gonna make you miserable for making someone else miserable.  And secondly, I am gonna break down Saga's reputation so that you can't hide behind it and act smug.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that you attack people, you act childishly towards them and you don't bother to listen to what they have to say.  <br>
<br>
Now I on the other hand am listening to what you have to say, I am devoting my time to you.  And each and every time you step out of line, I am gonna be here to make you miserable.<br>
<br>
Now here comes the hint, sit down and prepare yourself for this one, because this will end it.  Forever.  <br>
<br>
Don't attack people and then hide behind the good name of Saga. <br>
<br>
::gasp::<br>
<br>
I won't attack Saga, and I won't attack you.  (for the incredibly slow, please think back to points one and two previous).<br>
<br>
Now, we all understand why I am attacking you.  I shall explain why I attack Saga.  Just in case you didn't understand earlier in this present diatribe.<br>
<br>
I shall go slow for you.<br>
<br>
You attack people, the same people show up to do it, all younger Saga people who have gotten away with it in the past because it was allowed.  And as it devolves into a mess and Saga starts to come under fire, you finally hear from the older guildies about how upstanding Saga is.  But nothing is done to leash the curs.  Nothing.  They aren't admonished or stopped.<br>
<br>
So you have some people yap.  Fight ensues.  Then when the generalization of Saga people becomes noticed, Saga steps in to make themselves look good and the yappers of Saga basically end up getting away with murder.  <br>
<br>
That is why I will break down Saga.  Firstly, Saga will show up earlier, Secondly, Saga now knows that in fact, if a group of Saga people start flaming someone and they are supporting each other because they are Saga, then it is a Saga matter.  <br>
<br>
Thirdly, the lame excuse that Saga can't control another member of Saga, especially when it comes to doing something wrong is utterly stupid.  In fact as earlier pointed out to you, Saga gained by having a problem with one of Gore's people, there was NO hesitation by him whatsoever.  Can you say that Lust for Blood allows that kind of thing?  Hell no.  Fact.  Why cannot Saga say &quot;People, stop arguing, we don't do this?&quot;  Don't know, but it seems they have no problems showing up and talking about how good and just they are.<br>
<br>
Now, to the dirty part.  No specifics here mind you.<br>
<br>
I was inside Saga, and I know that what you tell people on the outside is a lie.  Lying is a lower moral character trait.  If you want to lie to yourself, so be it, but don't lie to others, if you are a Lemon and want to be an Orange, get over it (this alludes to a different post but speaks for itself on it's face). <br>
<br>
What Saga comes out here and says is the untruth, and it is said in such a way as to make themselves look better at a time of crisis, namely, when the shit talkers are out in force. <br>
<br>
This provides a brow beating to someone and then reinforced by a guild against them.  If someone in Saga has a problem with someone, go alone and fight it out.  But if you step up as as a guild then be prepared to be treated as such. <br>
<br>
Case in point, this little calling me out thing Siffo did.  <br>
<br>
It blew up in his face because believe it or not, I was nonconfrontational.  For me to show up here sticking my finger in his face must have been a real shock.  But Kul and you and Bridh and Quea just had to come over and help, you had to dig, hell you did poorCaillou at the very first appearance here, didn't you?  Did you not set that tone yourself?  And why were you here? Are you Siffo's lover? Sister? Mother?  Nope, You are Saga.  <br>
<br>
You were all here because you were Saga, and after you got pummelled and you realized I wasn't going away, there comes Valquiss, the old wizzened member who stepped it and Mixxied [sic] it up with Sarhea but tried to put the &quot;we are Saga&quot; information in, much as Fayd had done in the one that started this.  And then he proceeded to play the same games as you guys.  So despite my getting along with him I had to spank dat ass too.  Cuz that is what I said I would do.<br>
<br>
Notice of course that the good shit is ignored because of your attitude.  Katryna comes along and amist the thickest of the arguing and name calling she only wishes me good things.  Anyone remember that?  And Rorac who I think I know but he dropped his &quot;k&quot; somewhere felt compelled to defend himself.  That in itself is a shame and I apologize to them both, but my point is, if you had the energy to defend your guild from the outside, why couldn't you defend it on the inside?<br>
<br>
So that in a nutshell brings us up to just about what that was all about, Siffo and I have both been asked by different parties and I believe some of the same to let this matter lie.  And we both agreed.  And down the drain it was going.  <br>
<br>
Until you. <br>
<br>
Yeah, other people are posting, but they aren't Saga.  So that means I have to step in and possibly risk reigniting this thing.  <br>
<br>
Now, I have explained myself.<br>
<br>
Let Saga do what it wants to itself, if it chooses not to police itself, then so be it, that is there choice.  I am okay with that, but if you show publically and yap away something you are not, then I have to stop you, that is lying.  And you use that lying to hurt people other than me.  <br>
<br>
I love Saga still.  I have serious issues with some of the people you consider worthy of calling Saga.  But then, that is because I DID help form Saga, I was one of the main yappers back then that set it up.  I think I should know how it goes.  <br>
<br>
And as Valquiss said, guilds change.  I can agree with that, but realize, that what you change into doesn't give you the right to use your old reputation, if you turn OOC, then that is fine, no one argues that, but if you come out and pretend to be IC after that, there is a problem.  <br>
<br>
Everyone knows Saga from having been IC.  Now that you are turning OOC it is unfair to attack people on any board in any forum and then claim a right to the higher reputation IC priviledges give you.  That is chicken shit.  <br>
<br>
And that is why I am here.  <br>
<br>
If I find another guild doing it, I will lambaste them as well.  It's something that I think everyone can agree on that a RP server just doesn't need.  IC is the name of the game, and from what I can see of the Pofolk here in these threads, ain't but 3 out of 8 of you in Saga doing it.<br>
<br>
You may go now.<br>

<br>
i'm so happy you could handle this at a guild level i so wanted to hear that some folks in Saga only RP 50% of the time, *gasp*<br>
<br>
as to roleplay guilds House Sel`quar was the best one i've seen, it's got a plot it's not a mismash of generic evil, the problem well it's a bit hard to raid that way.<br>
<br>
Led's Troupe seems to fit that mold as well actually for goodies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meta-RP guilds have to many internal problem due to conflicted story lines example <br>
<br>
LoS ` great guild, i've got lots of friends there but the choatic warrior doesn't sleep well with the evil seducterous. this interal strike<br>
<br>
the same i'd assume happens with meta good, and neut guilds.<br>

since that lumps my post into it, I will from now on ignore your ramblings.<br>
<br>
And I kinda was getting to like the Brutin on the Coffee boards.. *shrugs*  As far as I can see, you started this shit. You are stirring up trouble why?  Something apparently happened a few months ago.  It wasn't resolved to your satisfaction. I haven't got a CLUE what it was.  But...   It happens. Every guild has problems.  If anyone here believes their guild will never have a problem, yeah right =P  If the guild continually has problems, they'll lose their reputation. (See Awakened Souls aka Souls Arisen)<br>
<br>
Oh well. You have said you dont like Saga's action. Me, myself, and I, will take it upon myself as a non-Saga player and say that I've seen nothing but the best from all their members.<br>
<br>
*shrugs* and I wont even attack you.<br>
<br>
(Unlike Brutin.  You keep attacking them.  In one breath, you say you do not attack Saga or it's players.. yet that's all you've done in every post here. And I dont even see the point of any of these posts.)<br>
<br>
My advice to every single Saga member reading these boards? (and everyoen else) ... dont answer this post anymore. Absolutely no point. None, zero, zip zilch. He's not gonna change his mind about you. And .. Saga's reputation will be designated by what Saga does in game. Not by what is done on these boards.<br>
