Basically, the greater the utility you have for the item, the more chance there is of it defaulting to you.  For example, runed circlet drops in a group of monk, druid, shaman.  The shaman has a better hat already.  So, it automatically goes to the druid.  If the shaman did not have a better, they'd /random on it or maybe one would defer to the other.  The monk isn't even considered for the item.  Need it to trade is considered greed, not need.  Need it for a secondary character is sometimes considered barely above need it to trade, but it's never enough to let you /random against a primary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxelenathebard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XelenaTheBard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 7:05:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the best way to devide loot?</span><hr size=1> Best way to do loot - there is a command in game that rolls a die. For smaller groups, it is best to do the following:<br><br>/random 1 100<br><br>Use the numbers to determin who gets it that item, or if it is something that repeatively drops, use them to determin the order.<br><br>For big raids, well, this is how the guild I go to raids with on Test do it like this. The roll for uber items is this:<br><br>&quot;Traditional and class specific loot will be randomed off at 1 to 1,000 with a 50-point bonus per level over 50. Traditional loot and class specific loot will follow a strict &quot;need before greed&quot; basis, if you can and will use you are entitled to roll. If you do win something, you will not be able to roll until everyone of the same class has won something. Please note that last piece rules will be in affect on all class specific pieces with the exception of uber loot, however merit will surpass last piece rules when it comes to breastplates and robes.&quot;<br><br>(So if you are a level 55 character, you would /random 1 1250 for loot.)<br><br>And for the uber loot on raids:<br><br>&quot;Uber loot, that which drops from mini-bosses, etc., will be done by randoming 1 to 1,000 with a 50-point bonus per level over 50 will occur. Winning uber loot will exempt you from traditional and class specific loot. Please do not hesitate to contact us prior to the raid concerning whether or not a particular mob is considered “uber”.&quot;<br><br>And a final added note for big raids:<br><br>&quot;Traditional or class specific loot that does not suit anyone’s “need before greed” situation will be regarded as a “free for all (FFA)” piece. FFA will be randomed at 1 to 1,000 with a 50-point bonus per level over 50. Unlike other loot, winning FFA loot will not exempt you from any category other than future FFA rolls. <br><br>Epic pieces will be done in the priority of a)progress b)level and c)merit.<br><br>Any and all non-nodrop loot, regardless of category will be handled after the raid. This includes gems as well. In the situation you did not win anything the entire raid, gems will be randomed at the end of the raid on a simple 1 to 1,000 basis.&quot;<br><br>Now, as complecated as this all may seem, the guild Silver Circle on Test has used it, and it works well. Depending upon the dungeon, the level 50 + bonus can be changed. Like for places like Unrest it can be set to every level over 20.<br><br>Those are the loot rules I am used to, but it's up to you on whether you like the system. When I get to higher levels, and I run raids, I will probably use this system as it is what I am used to.<br><br>Note: Everything in the &quot; &quot; marks was taken from the Silver Circle message boards last Hate raid post.<br><br> <p>-Xelena<br>Up and Coming Songstress<br>Near Master Fletcher<br>Firiona Vie Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uevangelinanife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evangelina Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm the princess, okay?</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 7:20:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the best way to devide loot?</span><hr size=1>    I prefer the everyone drinks as many short beers as possible, and then the first person to successfully click on the corpse whilst the screen is moving around wins <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 8:00:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's the best way to devide loot?</span><hr size=1> Xel that is a very cool system for open raids and even guild raids if they choose to go that way.<br><br>My old guild had a point system that weighed heavy on merit and NB4G.<br><br>Now as far as pick up groups I am very much a NB4G person but I am also realistic.

What is the justification for raising the cap above a certain level?  looking up from below that looks like nothing more than discrimination.  Is there a real reasonfor it?  Or did that add on just develop as a result of someone coming up with a clever way to give their high level friends a better chance at the best stuff?  That is what it looks like to me... Not really fair to those who have risked more in the raid (risked more because they ARE lower and therefore have a higher chance of dying).<br><br>At the lower levels I am at now, however, we don't need to get so complicated.  Usually it is either FFA (which I always loose out at because I am busy for the first 3 seconds after the battle with switching songs and instruments) of Alphabetically.  Alpha loot works out all right, especially if it is combined with /rand for important, less common stuff.  You just have to have one person who takes responsability to call out the turns so that everyone knows. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 371<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 10:48:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oh wow</span><hr size=1> I can't believe anyone but a fat warrior rolled for a shrink bracer or was permitted to roll.  Since I'm typically the puller &amp; group leader, this kind of problem usually doesn't come up in my groups.  If it was anothers', I'd walk -- no puller usually means no group.  I just can't tolerate that kind of greed.  What is he going to do?

Same for fungi-tunic -- default to monks, then other classes that would use (it's pretty much top chest in game for monks and only a twink or situational for others by that level).  Just because you're in an area that doesn't drop loot for your class is no excuse to put yourself into random for something you'd trade.  There are plenty of spots where it will be an item for you and not others; what goes around comes around.  Do a greed /random and you won't be able to get help on your camps.  Guess I was lucky on my old server.  There were enough of us that felt strongly about this that some would end up horribly shunned if they were greedy.  I recall one cleric that would sit in Karnor's LFG auc'ing for groups while groups would auc for a cleric.  No one would touch him.<br><br>BTW, a comment on the level issue Kisarin brought up.  At a raid that needs level 55-60 players, lower levels contribute very little to the effort.  If they die, it's small loss to the group.  You have to work to a lot harder keep them alive and to educate them.  Each level above 50 is similar in power to about 5-10 levels below 50.  Also, it's a simple way to gauge seniority when you don't know how much time everyone has put in helping out others (sort of a bonus for time-in-grade and a way to doge the whole &quot;but I'm more senior than you!&quot; issue). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ublakkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 11:28:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh wow</span><hr size=1> NBG works best in guild or friend groups.

Take Drolvag captain. Mostly warrior items... so you have to draw the line when you create the group or invite new people.. NBG in drolvag captain is on the verge of selfishness and explotiation of other class's.<br>Do you make a rule like: warriors nbg on the cobolt (warrior kunark class armour) and jade mace free for all, cloak ffa (cloak is'nt that great and it's so common everyone gets one after there first hunt in this spot)<br><br>Defining rules and inform people if you know what 'might' drop, so that they know what they are getting into, if you dont know and no one in group knows.. Nbg is good but evaluate what you get at the end of a night, as a puller and tank i put my life on the line a lot more than some of the other classes, risking my life on extreemly dangerouse splitting, then tanking or agro mangement.. sometimes i will end up with nothing from the night, i dont mind Ngb at all.. but sometimes i get royally screwed over, since i have melee and magic.. often items goto the 'pure' prime class before hybrids, so i have been completely screwed with Nbg before... a fair group and nbg is perfect, but dont go useing it as a means of exploitation, earns you a worse reputation imho! (greed to the extreem)<br><br>Port/split - great, but i have had evacers ld, come back then port without me, or hold items for me while i am pulling/splitting and not give them back.. had the same person litteraly take around 5 quest gems for veliouse armour that way.. but everyone says 'she's a great druid!' so rather than complain i stick up with it.. happens again. Now this is a occurence with one person i had on my last server... but it scares me when i do this with people i dont know, i have a fear of evacers looting now.. only use this with people you trust, it can be mis-used and people can get away with it.<br><br>ticket - ticket system is like a raffle, all roll /seed and one with highest picks from list... works perfect in places like the cypt in sebilis where you can come out with 2-3 class items, 2-4 misc items and a few gems.<br>Now i love this method, works best when you all know the value of an said item, some people are more interested in selling items so will pick the most expensive or 'easyest' item to sell, others will pick an item for a friend or an item they can use, while back i had option of picking a second bloodember bracer or one of the other nice items including heiro cloak. i chose the bracer (+16 ac) because i already had one, and i had a fairly nice cloak, not as nice.. but the others with me had worse cloaks so i picked bracer, i was happy with it, other guys were happy with it... where's the problem? there isnt one, i like this method, its more of a compromise of what you want and what others want, good when there are no items that can really be NBG.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 378<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/6/02 5:09:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1286.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Roll and pick ..</span><hr size=1> .. is really nice.  I think I recall using it once in old sebelis jail area (very rich drop area).  Most items people want aren't dropable by the time they reach the truly contested stage (planar/god/dragon loot), so you can't hold them for later roll/pick.  With the lack of no-drops on FV, it sounds like a truly great method for this server.<br><br>I'd probably modify it to include immediate rolls/defaults for things that people would put on and wear right away.
