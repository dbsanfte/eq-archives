It may only be a game, but a death can still represent a good amount of time invested by a player.<br><br>Some classic examples is zoning and then falling through the world for 10K damage. Now if you are clever and /report yourself right away you can capture the last ten lines of text for the GM to verify and they are obliged to rezz you. If you get spammed by guildchat, etc and miss your 10 line window a GM might not be able to help you at all. This is assuming of course, that a GM can get back to you within 3 hours. Hehe I still laugh over an incident on Tunare where a player died, GM was willing to rezz but the rezz timer had expired. Sucks to be you I guess.<br><br>I also wasn't to keen on deaths to that framerate bug. Alan Vancouvering keeps addressing it in his posts but there is no way for a GM to verify what has happened, thus, no rezz, so players have to eat a death even though they did nothing wrong.<br><br>I'm not bitching at GM's. I am very aware of the limitations placed on them. If anything I wish they had more access to player's information including /chatwindow, player x,y,z co-ordinates within a specific time period and other info. such as buffs/spell effects on and mob agro information. Ultimately verant does have access to all of this but its not recovered easily and I doubt GM's have access to any of this Info.  I wouldnt be worried about invasion of privacy. I would just change the policy so that by /petitioning a player gives the GM the right to view this info, which I believe Verant has already done anyway. I think all GM's have now is a keyboard and an account with special abilities. They aren't givin any sort of recent player history/transaction info. which could be a valuable tool for the GM's to use in assiting, educating and policing the player population.<br><br>I also think they need more GM's. We're lucky on this server because of the low population we get a very reasonable responce time. But I feel bad for a player who genuinely has an issue and has to wait 3 hours on a saturday for a guide to respond and tell the player, &quot;a GM has to deal with this... how does tuesday between 3pm and 9:30pm EST sound?&quot; (a real life example btw). If they can't get more GM's, perhaps empowering the guides might be a better solution.<br><br>What I would see as an &quot;ideal system&quot; is a system that would give GM's /guides more power (information) and make them more accessible. I would propose a heirarchy where all petitions come into a centralized location for each server and the petitions are delegated out to other GM's/guides. The person delegating could have a window up similar to a &quot;tracking window&quot;, a ready list if you will, that would let the delegator know which GM/guides are ready to deal with another  /petition. Once they are assigned a /petition they are removed from the &quot;tracking window&quot; (or ready list) and when they are done they send a signal back that would add them back on to the ready list.<br><br>This way the GM's aren't queue'd up with stuff guides can handle and guides aren't queue'd up with stuff that a GM has to deal with. The petitions are sorted by someone who has an idea of the issue and what resources are required to resolve it, not just the next petition in the queue. It might also provide verant an oppourtunity to track the amount of time /petition resolution takes and the types of /petitions that are coming in.<br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A> at: 1/18/02 1:55:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 5:36:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GMs Thank you for not always being there </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you get spammed by guildchat, etc and miss your 10 line window a GM might not be able to help you at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The /report command will send a &quot;picture&quot; of all the lines currently shown in your chat window -- not the &quot;last 10 lines&quot;.

If I play only 5 hours a week, then a stick like that, which may be a common drop off a rare spawn may be virtually impossible to replace, unlike a character who plays 80 hours a week.<br><br>Think of it this way. I'm level 11 now, I died in Upper Guk (I went Linkdead). My corpse is nowhere to be found. (I'm a little pissed off) I only play 5 hours a week. It took me about 3 weeks to get to level 11. So because I don't have any way of proving that I am not just whining to get a rez, that means I shouldn't get my characters rezzed?  <br><br>I can always just start a new character, sure, because in the eyes of the GMs a 11th level character only takes '2 days or so' to reach - but that doesn't mean that I want to waste another month or so of my time to build a character to that level, because I am a part-time player.<br><br>So, because I'm essentially an equipment-less troll warrior, in a class that requires equipment to survive, and I don't feel like spending another 2 weeks rebuilding myself so I can afford leather armour, I'm just going to stop playing now and start a new character. If I'm going to rebuild, I may as well start from scratch. <br><br>Thank you GMs for not being there, and not giving a damn. Thank you Verant for not being willing to pay me back the money I paid for a 3 month subscription. And mostly, thank myself, because I want to socialize with people, but every time I start to find friends, I end up getting bad karma like this happening, or they all level faster than me because I actually have a life and don't play all the time. <br><br>It's been fun. <br><br>Actually, it hasn't.<br><br>So long<br>Charlemaine.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthendara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thendara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 3:25:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GMs Thank you for not always being there </span><hr size=1> Charlemaine,<br><br>Send me a tell if I'm on at the same time as you are.

That is absolutely part of the game.  Corpse-recovery is one of the more onerous tasks in the game, but it's also just about the only task that can completely unite a server.  I've seen people that are at each others throats most of the time help each other out on CR, I saw this happen when a guy went LD at the Nagafen bind point and not able to log back in until after FGs were up again -- can you say death-loop?  This was when EQ was so new, FGs were considered a multi-guild raid objective.<br><br>So, the thing to do if you lost your bod due to LD, is ask people for help.  I don't know anyone so mean or so completely immersed in RP that he wouldn't help out on CR.
