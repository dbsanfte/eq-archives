If so, are you having any problems with it?  For a couple months now every so often, all comps would simultaneously go LD.  This *only* happens when two of my characters are in the same zone.  If they're not in the same zone or if only one char is online, they all can stay online forever.  It wouldn't happen often -- perhaps 3-6H of play and not every session.  Today it started happening every 10 minutes or so, pretty much making EQ unplayable.<br>
<br>
Inspection of the various router logs showed no issues on that end.  To be certain, I swapped in a completely different router -- entirely different routing software -- and the same precise problem happens there, too.  So, I'm begining to suspect there's a problem on the EQ server side.<br>
<br>
So, am I alone on this one?  Anyone dual-boxing with NAT have this problem? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rorac>rorac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 10:10:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dual box behind NAT bug?</span><hr size=1> same thing was happening to me <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bendardonthat>bendar donthat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 10:32:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dual box behind NAT bug?</span><hr size=1> No problems here.<br>

<br>
I run up to 4 different eq boxes + other computers on my network with NAT and never have ANY problems with it unless my DSL flickers, then of course, everything is going to go linkdead.<br>
<br>
I did a setup identical to mine for a friend and he had the problem you speak of - everyone going LD like WOW.  Turned out that his internet connection was on the fritz and his router was screwed up somewhere.  Fixed his internet connection and used a different router and it worked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you're wondering what hardware I use:<br>
Linksys 4 port Etherfast Router (yay for built in DHCP)<br>
2 or 3 different brand hubs, mostly a centrecom<br>
<br>
If you're running a hub off the router, ie only one port on the router, make sure that hub broadcasts - depending on the router, sometimes packets can get lost.  I did a network setup for someone else and they had a similar problem except it ended up being that packets were disappearing between the hub and router - we switched to a hub that broadcasts and everything was fine.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1746<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 12:37:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dual box behind NAT bug?</span><hr size=1> The connection to the ISP seems to be fine.  My non-EQ sessions all proceed normally during the EQ failure.  The fact that it happens with different routers and works fine for all but two EQ sessions in the same zone more or less eliminates router and configuration.  However, I have been worried about various forms of rate-limiting being applied upstream where I can't see it.<br>
<br>
I used to see another problem, but that went away on Saturday, too.  With that problem, EQ would be unable to login and would report that the login server could not be found until the system was reset after one of these hangs.  The odd part about this is that with a sniffer on the network, no packets at all were output from the EQ system trying to log in.  Obviously some maner of internal bug was causing EQ to think the server unavailable without even attempting a DNS query or TCP syn.  This was only EQ login.  The patch process and other sessions worked fine.<br>
<br>
Everything used to work perfectly (same exact configuration) a couple months ago and only yesterday became unbearably worse.  If it's EQ, my guess is that someone is trying to fix the serverfilter code and has forgotten to account for NAT.  If it's not EQ, my cable ISP has screwed up something with UDP.  Both of these are likely.  UDP by it's very nature just sings out &quot;OK to discard at any time&quot;.  If the ISP has noticed UDP traffic climbing up, the perfectly valid solution is to throttle it (this is why I detest developers too dumb to use TCP for internet games).<br>
<br>
As far as worst case scenarios, the ISP could have configured not only UDP packet drops, but could have attempted to cut back on UDP sessions in general by sending back ICMP unreachable messages.  That would explain the unable to login problem.  The PC on receiving that ICMP would think there's no point in trying to send to that address and fail all the packets that try it.<br>
<br>
BTW, by &quot;broadcasting hub&quot; do you mean a dumb hub versus a switch?  I'm using a dumb-hub.  Sounds like you had a buggy or misconfigured switch; they're usually more efficient in general and especially for LANs that have a mix of LAN/WAN traffic (eg. one comp is printing over LAN, another plays EQ, another accessing files on LAN).<br>
<br>
On the ISP issue, I'm using AT&amp;T broadband.  Is that what you're using, too, Rorac?  Silicon Valley area.  Ths really sad thing about this is that neither Sony nor AT&amp;T will help on this at all.  Other sessions work fine?  Obviously it's your special app (EQ).  Other dual boxers work fine?  Obviously it's your ISP.  Grrrr. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/15/02 12:44:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nehlurra>Nehlurra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 2:29:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cynnamin/eq/avalurra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dual box behind NAT bug?</span><hr size=1> I don't use a switch and never have to play EQ, my router is considered a switch, however, I don't have any pc's on the router for that very reason <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That's why I use a &quot;dumb hub&quot;, though I've never heard it called that.  Anytime I've ever tried to use a switch/switching router on a network to run any type of game, EQ, UT, Diablo, etc, I've always had huge packet loss problems.  TCP/IP is definately a good choice for gaming, as most ISPs seem to have issues with lots of UDP packets (as you said).  A few cable ISPs local to me have totally blocked any outgoing UDP traffic, believe it or not.<br>
<br>
I hope you get your issue solved.  I'd definately call the ISP and ask about limiting upstreams and the like.  I know that's fairly common practice with cable, as you could eat your entire neighborhood's bandwidth if they didn't put a handle on it *grin*<br>
<br>
Back to the other issue at hand - in regards to your EQ boxes just dumping and other internet activities being fine - that was also the same problem on the other networks I set up.  You could browse the web all day long, transfer/serve files with no problem but EQ would just boot boot boot.  You could try doing some firmware updates on your hardware, sometimes that will help.  I know there is one version of firmware that Linksys offers for their routers that is TOTALLY screwed up and they've not bothered to fix it or remove that version. Another thing that I would check, and this sounds really dumb, but I would make sure all of your cabling is firmly attached to the connectors and it's all the proper type, ie - no crossover where there should be patch-thru.  (Not tryin to make you out be dumb, I just know lots of folks who have network issues, especially weird stuff, and they have the wrong type of cabling!  It doesn't hurt to check because sometimes some things will function with the incorrect cabling, other things won't!)<br>
<br>
Good luck and let me know if you get it sorted out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I got entirely too irked at the dumping and gave up because I didn't have the time or patience to totally troubleshoot it out with extensive packet sniffing and the like.

BTW, can't be cabling -- works fine for single-session case or different zones (and even for other sessions that are live during the failure on the same PC).  Could indeed be software on the router having issues dealing with the same simultaneous destination IP's.  Odd that it happens with two different routers in the same manner, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taldaydarfv>Taldaydar FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 9:10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I think what I'm going to ..</span><hr size=1> I get that problem in a netgear router as well, every 4-6 hours both characters get DC'd, I thought it was an isp problem cause a rl friend who uses the same isp tends to have the problem at the same time and he doesnt use a router to duo.<br>

<br>
Are you running a Linksys?  I have the same problem behind my router/firewall/NAT box, and I've seen it referenced on a number of boards.  It all started about 2 months ago, and I almost never went LD before that.  There is a fix for it, but it involoves opening a rannge of ports, which is something I wasn't willing to do before, but just might start now...<br>

Maybe it will provide a hint.  About 2 months ago was when I started seeing all these problems.  I don't think it will help, though.  My trace shows that UDP packets for my EQ sessions are being dropped sometime after they leave my LAN, not by either of my routers.<br>
<br>
The sniffer trace shows that incoming packets from EQ stop, but outgoing packets keep being sent (the classic high burst output y'all have seen for years during an LD).  The sniffer is connected between router and internet, so it shows everything coming and going.  Router FW logs don't show any denied or dropped packets either, which matches the sniffer trace.<br>
<br>
I also had a ping running to the EQ server during all this.  The ping never wavered.  It went through every time.  There's nothing odd I can see in the trace either -- no weird ICMPs or other oddities.  Packets from the EQ server just stop.  Sooo, that implies that either there's an intermediate router being very specific about throttling just EQ traffic or it's a problem with the EQ server.  My bet is on the EQ server.  Session-specific throttle for UDP isn't done by any routers I know.  They tend to use variants on fair-queueing, which means that packets from bandwidth-pigs tend to be dropped more frequently than lighter uses -- not shut off completely.<br>
<br>
It's very easy to reproduce in game, too: just put two chars into the same zone, put one on auto-follow, and start the other running.  Make a few zig zags and the LD starts.  Sometimes it recovers, but not often.  If you're near a mean KOS see-invis critter, or you just started a pull, LD is assured.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grogofrogslaughter>Grogo Frogslaughter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Must...Kill...Froggies...</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 8:28:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ameritech.net/users/gwheeler/froggie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Not using a linksys, but I'd be VERY interested ..</span><hr size=1> Just a little more info: <br>
<br>
It is unbelievable how weird this LD issue is.  For example, Cielo and I will both be playing, and I will have a trader logged on in the bazaar.  All of the sudden, one of us goes completely LD.  No prior packet loss, no lag, nothing.  Just watch the bar tick up and the &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot;.  Same zones, different zones, any time of day.  And this was on a previously stable network, where I could go 4-5 days without having to log my trader off.<br>
<br>
The fix (still looking) involoves port triggers on certain ports.  I can not remember if you are opening traffic for UDP or not, although I believe that is the fix.  At the time I thought it was a temporary thing with my DSL, so I was hasitant to open a range of ports.  However now I am looking all over for the fix, because it is getting me killed all of the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Before every LD -- even single comp single session LDs, which are as common as the other type now that I've been trying to issolate the problem -- there is a bootp broadcast.  Normally, this wouldn't have crossed my mind as unusual, since older dhcp uses the same service port as bootp (and looks essentially the same).  However, looking closer, these bootp's are image reload requests.  Looks like my ISP is having some downed router problems and they're bootstrapping themselves back up a lot.  Traffic continues most likely due to their routers being on a UPS, but bootp also uses UDP and is a very heavy burst traffic.  Net effect is that even if the routers on the path to EQ aren't down, they're impacted by the reload requests.<br>
<br>
This makes even more sense when considering that the big storm started Saturday -- the same day I started seeing major problems and that power outages have been plaguing the area.  I'm on a UPS and the cable does stay live during an outage, but apparently it's only half-alive.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the storms are supposed to continue more or less until the end of the year.  Bad for EQ, but good for skiing.  Looks like it's time to box up EQ and hit the slopes!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/18/02 3:03:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nehlurra>Nehlurra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/02 4:17:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=946.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cynnamin/eq/avalurra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ah, I think I found the problem ..</span><hr size=1> *grins and refers back to her original post*<br>

Usually a single connection will survive for a goodly time, which is what makes it look like it's a weird dual-box'ing problem when it's really essentially identical to having an occasionally noisy modem connection.<br>

I still can't explain all the oddities I've been seeing with the reload bursts, though.  For instance, sometimes all the connections stay up, but I have about a 20-30s lag on all actions.  If it's just a burst, eventually, they should catch up and stabilize again, but this can go on for a very long time and is only fixed by relogging.<br>

I really wish Sony would fix /serverfilter.  That would help a ton, especially considering I use damage shields when fighting.

Sniffer shows that all the packets are coming from the EQ servers.  Relogging halts the flood for a little bit, but after a couple minutes it starts right back up again.<br>
