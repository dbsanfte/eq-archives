I do realise alot of people who check these boards do not know me well and thats fine I just need some helpful advice.<br>
<br>
Ok here it goes.. I was in a relationship with a guy for 5 years and had kids with him. Well we split up almost a year ago when he decided that drugs was more important to him then us having a place to live and food to eat. After I left him and moved back in with my dad to get my life in order he got himself cleaned up went to rehab and did really well. He wasnt into drugs for too long so he didnt have that much of a porblem with recovering. For his efforts I gave him alot of credit and I never once kept him from his kids. Well 4 months being out of rehab he got a job and a place to live. He was doing pretty good for himself and I was proud of him. I on the other hand was having a hard time trying to find a job because I couldnt afford daycare and wasnt able to recieve help from the state because my dad made too much money. I would never ask my dad for help with it because he was doing enough as is by allowing us to live there free. So when he called me to see the kids we made an agreement for him to take the little ones until I got a job and finished school. Im currently going for my GED since I was really young when I had them and was working full time to support us all. He agreed that he would take them until I was finished with my self improvement. Well it has now been 3 months and i havent heard from him but once or twice since I had given them to him. He has since moved from his house and has gone after me for child support. Which by the way I have no problem paying since it is my responisibilty. WHen I asked the case worker in the PaCS office they said that his address had been marked confidential. They since sent me a letter in the mail with his address saying that it was unfair that he held them from me and I was paying support for them. Turns out the address is a fake. There is no such address in my county. I called and told my case worker about it and she told me &quot; Sorry that is the address we have for him and there is nothing we can do. We see no reason to go any further.&quot; <br>
<br>
Is it me or am I being screwed here somehow? Any useful info on what my options are would be great. I have since contacted an attorney and had no luck there either. Please help! <br>

First, in most (if not all) states, it is rare that the father is given custody unless the mother can be shown to be unfit.  So, unless that applies, you could probably get the kids back if you want them and make him pay child support to you.  Secondly, it is illegal in most (if not all) states for a parent to deny access to the kids to the other parent unless there is a court order so ordering.  Furthermore, since he has a history of drug abuse, you probably have even greater leverage.<br>
<br>
You need to find a GOOD attorney.  I'm frankly quite surprised that your first attempt at working with an attorney yielded nothing.  Any half-decent attorney should be able to put the proper wheels in motion for you.  This all depends, of course, on your or your attorney's ability to track the guy and your kids down.  But if the guy has absconded across state lines with your kids, he could be prosecuted for child abduction as well.<br>
<br>
Bottom line... Get tough and get you a decent attorney! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caemus>Caemus</A> at: 8/9/03 6:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fvbeastlord>FVBeastLord</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of all the Wild</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/9/03 10:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1830.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maybe someone would know what to do....</span><hr size=1> Well i'll add my 2 cents in, but im no lawyer. But i do know that what he did is against the law. Abduction threw visitation is not only immoral but illegal, its time you get a Good Attorney and go after him, if he is working someone has used his SSI Number for tax purposes and you can track him based of Employment records or by Credit check. Also an attorney can get a subpeina to get info on him threw the courts. You need to protect yourself and your children and deal with him immediately.<br>

&quot; Well Miss (my last name) I see no problem other then a disgruntled father for some reason. However if you two had been married and one of you had court ordered custody then there would be a problem with him hiding from you. I would suggest you try and have the support order revoked.&quot; <br>
<br>
He is not working as of now that much I know. And he is still in my state. Well atleast I think so. I went through a referral for my attorney *sighs* I know that was a stupid thing to do but Im currently unemployed since I just came back from visiting my family in another state cus my aunt is dying. I cant afford a good attorney yet and its starting to scare me because the longer this goes on the less of a chance I have of seeing my babies again... Thanks for the advice guys..<br>

First and formost if you are paying child support you are entitled to visitation. If he denies you that he is in violation of state laws. If he has given a false address to the state it is Fraud and I would go to the police and file a complaint. Who ever that attorney you spoke to is a Complete Idiot and obviously knows nothing about custody cases.(Probally one of thsoe ambulance chasing creeps) Go to social services and have them document the fact that he has given a false address and refuses you visitation these will go a long way if/when you go to court. Keep records of any/every payment you make and all petitions, filings, police reports. Again if/when you go to court if you are well organized and he isn't it will go to your favor. Basically with you being the Mother you can probally file Kidnapping charges against him as well. As previously stated most courts are biased infavor of the mother unles she is a criminal or drug addict. Finally don't lose hope. <p>Celesta Windpetals<br>

<br>
I do know where my daughter is but there is other stuff going on . . . I find it strange some of what you are saying. There seems to be some stuff missing. Not sure what but some. I have heard the same that child support has an old address and &quot;doesn't have time at the moment to find 'them'&quot; but not that &quot;there is nothing they can do&quot; . . .<br>
<br>
I am not berating you miss - I often tend to pad things in my favor - actually do it most times heh. My suggestion -- If you know the P.O. Box that the check is going to -- get a friend to camp it (NOT YOU) and have them photograph your ex picking up the mail and then follow him to his address . . . and photograph his home - that way you have an address<br>
<br>
Then turn it into the childsupport folks -- you need to do some of the leg work -- the cops and CS people are so undermanned that all they can do is work on the abuse cases ie those they know are life-threatening to the children.<br>
<br>
Sorry to be a hardass - I know how it feels - my ex-wife didn't pay child support for nine months and I had to do some of the leg work . . . result?<br>
<br>
The court called her in and told her - pay back CS of 3k or go to jail right then . . . She sold a brand new truck - took out a loan and gave me 3k.<br>
<br>
Goodluck<br>
