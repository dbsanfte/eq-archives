AS had no interest in the FV community. This was publicly stated by their guild leader, and defended by their officers and members. While individual members may have been involved in the community, as a guild, their official stance was they didn't care about the server.<br>

I've never seen anything like that from either Reso or FnF.<br>

If you can't see the difference perhaps you too would be better served by a blue server.<br>
<br>
(Some may argue that Reso waking the sleeper is tantamount to the same thing. After the new content, the sleeper was already gone. They petitioned to have him put back in so they could wake him. Actually waking him may have changed some things, but he was already gone.)<br>

<br>
You say the individual members are a part of the community.  That is the same as Reso/FnF.  Reso/FnF doesn't order people to go to open events or help on CR's.  They do it because they want to.  If AS is doing the same thing, then who cares what Xarpolis said?  All you are using it for is a reason to hate AS despite their members actions.<br>

I never once saw anyone recieve satisfaction from AS's officers regarding a complaint about a member in their guild. I've never even heard of an AS officer offering to look into a complaint about a member in their guild. If anyone were to complain about an AS member, rather than a reasonable attitude of &quot;it will be looked into&quot;, AS simply closed rank and virulently defended any and every member of their guild.<br>
<br>
Lots of organizations are capable of that type of response, the KKK, the Hells Angels, The Bloods, The Crips, West Side Wilmas, do you expect those organizations to be loved, or even accepted by the communities they're in simply because their membership likes each other and supports one another?<br>
<br>
AS may have been a great close group of people who had a great time together, but so are the aforementioned groups.<br>

I'm asking this because I haven't observed his lack of skill first hand.  Now it's possible I may have seen the effects of it, but haven't observed sufficient evidence to say those observed effects are due explicitly to Kzan's lack of skill.<br>

Plane of xxxx, Chardok, Venril Sathir and then it's raids suited to a gimp who shouts, send me a tell again if you want haste, I have /rt hotkeyed.<br>
<br>
Ring of Slime is an encounter where the Enchanter returns to having a valued role and the opportunity to be the only Enc in that encounter should be something absolutely delightful.  If instead it's frightening and leads you to violate an old (not sure if it's current) guild rule on having to be an app to raid with the guild it's a good sign that you lack faith in your skills playing the game and if Kzan doesn't think he can play the game well I think that pretty much rules out other people thinking well of his skill.<br>
<br>
3 inc in CT, full mana, only one healer, lead with Rapture, nope, tried a different mez.  If only he would have used the appropriate spell for the lead mez maybe he wouldn't have torn into PoLyns RL.  Oops making excuses for what should be un-acceptable behavior, surely dying in a video game (with 96 rez even) can't be a reason to berate someone over RL issues.<br>
<br>
But for the most part my contempt for his skill comes from the fact in all the time I was guilded with him and all the times I raided with him, never once did I find myself thinking, good thing Kzan was here.<br>

<br>
AS/SA - They had a blatant disregard for other players on this server, were defiantly non-roleplay but toned down some after going from SA to AS but I think they like the &quot;bad boy&quot; image. Would fit right in on a blue server.<br>
<br>
Reso/FnF - Not really RP but have members that are. Tend to be quiet about what they are doing mostly. Would be basically invisible on a blue server. Being large they do tend to step on peoples toes occassionaly, but mostly because they don't watch where they are going.<br>
<br>
Being from a smaller guild RP guild, never had any run ins with Reso or FnF but did get crossways with AS/SA a couple of times.<br>

Then it seems Kzan plays the class just fine, at least I've never had a problem with him not KEI'ing me.<br>
<br>
What happened in Plane of xxxx, Chardok, VS, etc?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about the Ring of Slime comment, either I missed this or I just don't recall it.  Be more specific?<br>
<br>
I wasn't there in CT, so either you're correct or you're not, but either way that's out so anyone that was there can refute or agree with it as they wish.<br>

You're just making up bullshit to make AS look bad (why? I dunno, they're gone if you hadn't heard) or make Reso look better..<br>
<br>
we had..I think -EIGHT- keys at the time of disbanded, waking the sleeper wouldn't be possible for MONTHS.. and we already knew that Reso was waking him anyway.<br>
<br>
Again, I BEG any ex-AS member to verify his comments.<br>
<br>
Or assuming this is true, why did you rejoin Fuvi?<br>

give me a break ~ once again, finger pointing and name calling from rollen or coin (they're the same person so far as i can tell, that or they had the same instructor in English, for their abilities in communication are somewhat EXACTLY the same ~ deplorable)<br>
<br>
/agree Lacus.  we anticipated Reso waking the sleeper for a long while before ya'll did it, so get a grip ~ again<br>
<br>
/agree Lacus.  wtf is the point of flaming, trashing, and otherwise denouncing a disbanded guild?<br>
<br>
***CAN WE MOVE THIS TO THE DEAD HORSE FORUM YET?!***<br>
<br>
it's become Coin/Rollen vs. AS (a disbanded, non existent guild) for what reason i have no idea!<br>
<br>
move post please~<br>
