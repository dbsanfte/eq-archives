I can't absolutely promise this, but I'd even support providing a link to it here, so long as it was made clear it has nothing at all to do with the FV board here.<br>
<br>
This board was started, supported, and maintained by the enthusiasm, and the monetary contributions of serious board users who have made it quite clear in the past they want a degree of reason and maturity around here.  Yes, even in the Soapbox, and we've never pretended this isn't a moderated forum.  If you want a board where people say and do any damn thing they want, it is *very* easy to make one.<br>
<br>
Thing is, it isn't very fun ranting and frothing and cursing like a drunken sailor on a ffa board where everyone is doing the same thing.  Everyone wants to be the first and the only one pissing in the swimming pool, and everyone wants to bring their bile to an otherwise civil community. Now that, I won't have, and that's what moderation is all about.  I repeat.  Go ahead and make your own board if you want to.  No one is stopping you.<br>

The title was moderators.  Basically what I mean to say it was... lighten up.  Some of us have better senses of humor.  Yes, some threads get immature to most standards, but watching people really go at each other is half the fun of EQ.  <br>
<br>
I love watching flame wars and dont want to have to go all over the net to find them.  The whole reason to rant is so that you will be heard by your peers.  I dont have anything to rant about, but I am sure lots of FVers do.  <br>
<br>
Ranting and raving is bitching.  You try to make a distinction but there simply isnt one.  A rant is an incoherant stream of nonsensical consciousness with as much offensive material as can be squeezed in.  Dennis Miller does not discuss, debate, or reflect, he has his own HBO show for his tyrades.  Dont tell me there is not an audience for rants.<br>
<br>
If you dont want to see it, and if others dont want to see it, dont read it.  If you do chose to read it, lighten up and take it for whatever its worth (no matter how pointless).  I can relate to you though, I too, sometimes enjoy the power trip of locking threads and blocking people's opinions.  Censorship is the ultimate high when you are in control. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/14/02 5:15:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=369.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Moderators</span><hr size=1> What I do, when I'm in the mood to read really good rants, is go to Graffe's (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.graffe.com">www.graffe.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->).

<br>
NOTHING, aside from laziness and the reasons he laid out (to wit, that ranting and trolling isn't really fun unless there are people who are going to be offended) is stopping you from starting your own forum. With your own rules, or lack thereof. As such, your complaint is not especially valid. No one *owes* you the flame wars you consider to be entertainment. <br>
<br>
No one is being oppressed here. <br>
<br>
As for a power trip - come on, do you really think anyone besides an insecure teenager (Which Valquiss hardly strikes me as) would get a power trip from being a *message board moderator*? Give me a break. You really think there's much of a power trip involved in constantly getting whined at by people with too much time on their hands? Sounds like a major annoyance to me and definitely not a job I'd be lining up to volunteer for. And &quot;censorship&quot; definitely doesn't even make it to my top-ten list of 'ultimate highs'.<br>

Yes people have the right to go make their own boards, its free and not very hard to signup for one.  <br>
<br>
This board is moderated:  Live with it.  Just because Joe, George and Sally want to get all bulled up and curse at the monitor while typing about Dick, Andy and Jane being loot whores and board nazis and the dreaded Uberfools, that doesn't mean that its just a part of a message board ya know.<br>
<br>
I didn't foresee this board being la la land or anything where everyone is pollyanna, but I am a reasonably mature adult, I can make a post without cursing, blaming or purposefully infuriating others even when I want to make a point.  If I can do that, other people can too.  See when you grow a bit older, strife and proving your point at all costs (no matter how passionate of a person you are, and trust me I can be pretty passionate about some issues I believe in) isn't always the best way to handle things.<br>
<br>
Maturity on a message board isn't about age, its about understanding others, respecting their viewpoints EVEN if you don't agree with them, and being able to express yourself in a non aggressive, non violent way.<br>
<br>
I firmly believe there doens't have to be an overabundance of cursing, harrassment, aggressiveness and strife on a messageboard to make it an enjoyable place.  There are many many many people who don't use msg boards because they have to filter through the crap in order to find something they want to read.  I believe this board has a general population of people who enjoy not having a board full of testosterone (and sometimes estrogen *gulps*) filled Ego's pounding on their chest because they think they can spit the farthest.<br>

On the topic of making your own board or leaving your country.

Ok well first of all even with the advent of free speech in America and the 5th Amendment, there is no true free speech available.  There are laws pertaining to hate crimes, sexual harrassment laws, inappropriate words and inappropriate visualizations that aren't allowed in mainstream legal America.<br>
<br>
So don't use this American Freedom of Speech to rationalize that its ok to harrassment, condemn, aggravate and instigate others to aggressive reactions.  I tolerate cursing, I have nothing against cursing, I curse myself *egads*, but there is a difference of cursing because you stepped on a rusty nail and cursing to hurt someone.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something about &quot;catering and tolerate each and every one of the visitors&quot; to this board.  That is nice in print, but with each individual personality and individual likes and dislikes of aaaaallll the people who come here, that is just impossible.  You know the saying &quot;can't please everyone all the time&quot; and you know what?  Thats true.  Its impossible.  If everyone was happy the world sure the heck wouldn't be the way it is now.<br>
<br>
I am American, I was born in america, in fact I'm Native American, my ancestors were in north america long before the Europeans immigrated, that doens't give me the right to making accusatory statements, harrassing statements, tearing someone apart verbally or emotionally because I think they are wrong.<br>

As for discussing a bombing or terrorist attack, well there's a MILLION other boards out there dedicated to world events, slandering other religions, giving you a no holds bar forums among many other topics.  This board is mainly for the game Everquest and topics and discussions that revolve around that.  If an orderly and structured and respectful debate can be made in the OT/OOC forum without hate mongering, slander, real life intolerants, attacks on people's real life persona, sexual/verbal/emotional harrassment etc etc etc then fine please be my guest.

That is one reason I like it to be un-censored.  While you may have been the first to register and publish it on the web, this board still belongs to the people of Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I am a realist.  The pilgrims and others escaping oppression made up very little of our founding colonists.  The vast majority of Americans are descendants of debtors and criminals.  These people did not like laws and governing, and I carry the same view.<br>
<br>
We have anti-hate laws to protect people from physical and financial harm.  You can protest, say, write, and burn in effigy anything you wish.  <br>
<br>
I am not asking you to try to appease anyone.  On the contrary, I want you to try to please no one.  All I am asking for is apathy.  Its not hard to do, in fact the less you do, the better you are at it.  That way no one can blame you for doing your job. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=369.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=369.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=369.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=369.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=369.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=369.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
