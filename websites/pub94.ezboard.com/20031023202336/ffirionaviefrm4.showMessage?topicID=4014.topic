  Warrior gets battle ressed and we continue fighting without even a chance for warrior to get rid of his after effects, deduction: Cleric had mana, perhaps had let attention slip for a time, these things happen nothing to get upset about. <br>

The lower levels go by so fast these days, that money can become a problem. If you aren't a re-roll or have some other means of access to money, getting up to the level of equipment which, though a year or so ago it would have been considered good going, many now consider to be minimal isnt easy.<br>

My warrior was hired as a bodyguard for 10K, yet he often comes across others whose gear enables them to take aggro, and who snear at his stuff and wonder why he doesnt have better.<br>

Some people aren't uber or have great gear because it costs so durned much and maybe they loose a lot of rolls when good gear comes up for rolls.<br>
<br>
Not everyone can go solo their own armour like a druid can :P<br>
(hugs her elysian tunic)<br>
(yes, I still wear Elysian Tunic, Leggings, Boots and Armplate and a bellows cap from PoI at level 61)<br>
<br>
Not everyone is a cleric that can charge 100-200 per rez or more.<br>
<br>
Not everyone is good at farming for plat either.<br>
<br>
I'm so sick and tired of people making fun of others or dissing on them because they think that person has suck gear. It could be that its all the guy can afford.<br>
<br>
If he's guilded though, maybe he can ask his guildmates to help him out getting better gear so he can  be just as uber as you think he needs to be. (rolls her eyes)<br>
<br>
<br>
Khub, personally I reccomend getting a few close friends together and going out to farm for pp or gear. Or, research some gear and where it drops and getting groups together to go after it. I know if you were my friend I'd be more than willing to assist you in getting better gear for yourself so that you could benefit me as a better warrior.<br>
<br>
Moffin, maybe you shouldn't be using your hammer so much. That proc can steal agro like crazy. Its all I can do sometimes to lick a mob with flamelick like mad to keep agro from my sweetie, when agro kiting. Its not like a warrior has stuns like a Pally or dots like a SK to keep agro to themself. They got a few other things that probably aren't as good. You need to learn how to manage your own agro better. Don't blame him because you know your proc steals agro like crazy and you keep using it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not trying to bash you here, but if you were having agro problems with your hammer, wouldn't that be a clue to stop using it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In other servers, a poorly equipped warrior just has to group with his friends in UP entrance, and get some moktor drops. Here in FV such spots are perma camped by people that then sells the armor in the bazaar for several k pp.<br>
<br>
And incidentally, allowing into the bazaar armor sets such as moktor armor seriously affects the tradeskilled armor desirability.<br>
<br>
Also, warriors can't solo. I don't know about you, but most of my plat has come from soloing.<br>

We can assume as this was a LDoN group that the warrior was &gt;L47 and &lt;L61.  Still a wide range, but to be wielding a Centi Shortsword and wearing Custodus Armor that's pretty bad.  <br>
<br>
At level 47 a warrior could clear out Unrest of Fine Steel and in a couple of hours have enough cash to upgrade significantly from that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Everything I've ever seen from Moffie leads me to believe that they are an intelligent, good player.  All I have ever seen from Kublaikhan is a very very weak rant, and the fact that they picked a name out of a hat from the high school history textbook.<br>

can't blame Moffie for tanking in this situation, I'm sure she's about three times better of a tank than this very poorly underequipped warrior.  Just a tiny hint for you warriors, if you are losing melee aggro to the cleric?  Something is very very wrong, and it isn't the cleric's fault.  It's yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fvdaladian>FVDaladian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Too sexy for gnomes!</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 2:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4014.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Centi Short Sword and Custodus Armour?</span><hr size=1> ok Khub, get yourself a barnacle covered axe, 45pp right now, better ratio than the css, and a nice proc(100 hate, -50hp).<br>

Lucky Khub.  To even get Khub to post something in an irritated state, is a huge acheivement itself.  You ever think he wasn't able to keep aggro that well because of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>other</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people not doing their job correctly?  I was in OOTS with Khublaikhan for quite some time, and frankly, there are very few Warriors that I trust enough to have in a group with me, and he is one of them.  The only time he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lost aggro to me, in Kael raids, or whatver OOTS was doing, is when I wanted it, because I thought a CHeal might not land in time.

Custodus armor may not be good for a cleric. But a few pieces on a warrior or Paladen mixed with some Crustation armor and a bit of cuturial make for a well rounded exoskelliton. And can be bought for around 2k for a full kit.<br>

This is soooooo true!!<br>
<br>
Don't blame warrior for not getting enough agro; warriors have a maximum amount of agro they can generate, depending on equipment.<br>
<br>
It's up to you to make sure you don't generate too much agro. You can reduce your agro very easily. Just turn off attack.<br>
<br>
Centi longsword? Yep, I'd agree that would be far from ideal. Though it depends what his other weapon is. If he had centi longsword and SoD... =)<br>
<br>
If he had a centi longsword and a finesteel mace, you could be nasty about it. Or you could offer to help him select something more appropriate. You could even donate a little cash to his weapon replacement fund.<br>

Like for instance, I know better than to cast Breath of Ro too early into a fight before Suo's had a chance to hit, taunt and stun a few times. <br>

I don't care what anyone says here. Though in part it is the warrior/pally/sk/whoevertank's job to keep the agro, if you see that you're stealing it, its your job to reduce that chance -- because even the worst of us can steal agro and that CLERIC HAMMER PROC has some NICE agro/hate attached to it.<br>

You could still do that.  You obviously decided that your predjudice of under-equipped warriors was wrong .  His posting here because he was insulted doesn't change the fact.  So maybe /tell him your sorry and you might actually make a friend.<br>

She mistelled.  Technically he overheard a private conversation and then chose to splash it over the soapbox.  Granted, the post was about him, but still it was a private post gone bad, so to speak.  <br>
<br>
Whilst it must have been horribly embarrassing for her and humiliating for him, I cannot understand why he would choose to splash it over the soapbox.  Why??  <br>
<br>
And then to add into the post you insinuate that she must be a horrible person because she went LD and you thought she wasn't going to return and that the only reason she did was because she had loot!  *gasp* ... <br>
<br>
What did she actually do wrong here??<br>
<br>
She sent a mistell.  She went linkdead.  She returned and distributed loot.  This is a crime?<br>
<br>
So, she thought your gear sucked.  That's entirely her perogative.  The mistell was unfortunate, and I guess if she hadn't mistelled she wouldn't currently be having her reputation put through the wringer in the soapbox.  <br>
<br>
This should never have been brought to the soapbox.  If you had issue with her mistell you should have confronted her about it, but to bring it to the boards here is in really bad taste, in my opinion ....  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/pet0512/marbles.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Just say &quot;No&quot;...<br>
<br>
When I was just a young leaf, I remember going to several places to try to fight assorted critters, only to find that many places which would yield decent experience and the occasional nice piece of gear which I could render for some money, to be camped and farmed by very high level types who were cleaning out the critters before I could get a shot at them.  Made me very mad, because I could have really used the experience, and the money would have helped replace that leather and banded I was wearing.<br>
<br>
Rathe comes to mind, in particular.  As well as a couple of dozen other places.  It still makes me sick to run through that zone on my way to other places, and see the legion of 50+ people there farming platinum.  Get a job, for the love of mud!<br>
<br>
So I decided that, when I became one of those 50+ seasoned people, I would not farm Rathe, or any other place that so many people farm so they can &quot;kiloplat&quot; and &quot;uber&quot; themselves.  And I don't.  It's easy - just say &quot;No&quot;, and leave those areas to the people who can get a challege from the fight.<br>
<br>
So if Khub is not farming for platinum so he can &quot;uber&quot; his gear, like so many of you have suggested he do, then that puts him a couple of hundred points up on the rest of you farmers out there, just my feelings on the subject of &quot;farming&quot;.  If he's earning his armor the old fashioned way, then more power to him.  I have a lot more respect for someone who earned their gear, rather than farmed platinum for it.  If you're farming for platinum, then why not just do lowbies a favor and go buy it?  At least you won't be stealing mobs from those who could really use the experience.  I consider farming and buying platinum to be about the same - neither one are much of an effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
I happen to know Khublaikhan.  He is a very well respected Warrior, and every hunt I have ever been on with him has brought me back alive, and well funded.  One of the biggest things I've learned from him is aggro management - I can do a lot of damage, but if I gain the ire of the critter we're trying to kill, then the cleric/druid now has TWO people to heal, instead of one.  This is counterproductive.  So now, I wait to engage, and if I appear to start to draw aggro, I back my elven hiney off and let main tank regain it.  Pretty simple, if you ask me.  It also keeps me from picking up so many bruises...<br>
<br>
The only problems I've ever seen from hunting in pickup groups is that some people don't know their roles.  If you have a main tank that cannot keep aggro because you're stepping up and hitting with your &quot;uber&quot; weapon, then fine - YOU tank.  And ask him to back off.  I'm sure he'd be happy to let someone else tank, take the damage, and get killed, if they want to be stubborn about it.  If your main tank can't keep aggro, it's not because he's not doing his job - it's because YOU are not doing yours.<br>
<br>
I also know that Khublaikhan has endless patience, simply because he's hunted with me a few times, and you would not BELIEVE how much that can tax someone's patience.  My puns alone will run most people off a cliff...<br>
<br>
You may not want to hunt with Khublaikhan, and that's fine.  I'll hunt with him anytime, anywhere.  I've done so many times, and never died in one of his groups.  I also come back a much more experienced Ranger.  If you want to be a tanking cleric, fine - state that up front.  But don't start trashing someone because you, as a cleric, can hit harder than they can.<br>
<br>
