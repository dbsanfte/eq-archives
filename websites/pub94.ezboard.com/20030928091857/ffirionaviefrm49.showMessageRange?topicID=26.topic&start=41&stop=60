Blah blah blah....<br>
<br>
I hear what you say and its still just as out of place.  I agree with you on the point about me, yes, it's how you say it to people that counts.  But I am not going to spoon feed it to you anymore.  You had your chance when I was mister polite in Saga.  Screw you.<br>
<br>
Nothing has changed from before, making light of someone's problem is the height of stupidity.  If you hurt their feelings then you have gained an enemy.  That is what your Master's degree taught you? Ask for a refund.<br>
<br>
I could careless what kind of person PoKuladen is, just as much as you could probably care less what PoBrutin is like.  And I will say he doesn't espouse half the shit that I do.  <br>
<br>
But from the context of who we are and what we are doing, for good or ill, here it is.  <br>
<br>
Mr. Communications wasn't very verbal back in the Saga situation and was just as flapping as now as he was during the Siffo flamage.  So you have a history of stupidity.  It would perhaps be wise to keep your mouth shut out of things that don't concern you.  If they do, then pick your side and set to fighting.  <br>
<br>
I hear everything everyone says to me, otherwise I am just here to listen to myself speak.  But whether they listen to me back or not, I will speak and I don't get involved until damage has been done.<br>
<br>
And you have to remember, I said you if spout crap, I will track it down and set myself against you.  Don't do that here.  Start a new thread about how wonderful you are at being comic relief in stressful situations.  <br>
<br>
I will be your Moe if you can take the pain.<br>

<br>
Best I can piece together is (none of this is sarcastic or anything, just trying to figure this out) that Amae was Apep's slave.  Sarhea asked apep if she could borrow Amae.  Apep agreed.  Sarhea &amp; Inthul &amp; Amae went off and did something (dunno what).  Apep was displeased with what Amae did and gave her (OOC) some kind of ultimatum, for which one (or maybe all) of the final results were that Apep would kill Amae?<br>
<br>
Amae disagreed with all the choices and chose to ignore it, and so Apep cut her out of roleplay?<br>
<br>
And people are mad at Apep for not giving fair warning that he would get so pissed about whatever exactly was done, and also pissed that he puts higher priority on what he feels is good roleplay than Amae's friendship, and Amae is possibly taking the whole thing too much to heart (as teenagers are apt to do), but possibly justifiably hurt.  <br>

<br>
Yes, except that Apep chose to ignore the RP altogether instead of sort through the mess, stating to them, as if scolding that if he was to carry through with the RP their very guild wouldn't survive.  <br>
<br>
Pretty condesending if you ask me when just a couple of weeks ago the big deal was on how worthless a slave was.  <br>
<br>
But this cause to revert OOC right off the bat hurt Amae very deeply and PoAmae I am sure.  What happened in that morass of stupidity I do not know.<br>
<br>
And I will just repeat again, I don't know all the details, what I do know is that what Apep did was wrong, if Apep had a right to a reaction, which I believe he does have that right, he chose the wrong one.  <br>
<br>
And being responsible for that mistake doesn't mean you place the entire blame on anyone, regardless of age.<br>

I don't consider it a molehill if someone is forced away from a game because of an OOC reaction to an IC happening, I see that as a break down that we should all be concerned with.<br>

I didn't have much to do with the IC happening.  I only got involved when one of my officers told me that a guild leader was threatening to destroy my guild.  <br>
<br>
Interesting, I'm thinking to myself.  Just what is he trying to pull here?  As far as I know, relations are non-existant with guild or guild leader in question.  In fact, I've never heard a single word OOC or IC from him.  <br>
<br>
Oh, but wait.  There was that sentiment expressed to my officer...what was it?  Oh.  &quot;You guys will never pull this off&quot; or something to that extent.<br>
<br>
Gee thanks, Apep.  Glad to see you, who have never interacted with me overly much nor spoken to me ooc at all beyond the vague hellos expressed when one bumps into the other, have such a strong (and FOUNDED?) opinion of my leadership capabilities.  <br>
<br>
Warning.  Don't ever pull the threatening act with me where my guild is concerned again.  You stepped out of line, and you damn well know it.  You're just too stubborn to admit that you were in the wrong.<br>
<br>
You're not an RPer...you're a bully using RP as an excuse to push your way.  And you throw a tantrum like an enraged bull when things don't go according to your plans.<br>
<br>
Let me state this again...I don't know what happened between the people in question.  I only got involved when I was told there was a threat made to my guild.  A guild which had exactly JACK SHIT to do with the occurance.  <br>
<br>
I don't like threats, especially when they're leveled against something I have spent my very limited free time building.  So, Apep, there's my grievance.  I have yet to hear an apology from you, but trust me, I'm not holding my breath.<br>
<br>
From one guild leader to another...I want nothing to do with you.  You stay on your half of the lil room, and I'll stay on mine.

Sar, Keri, you both have known for some time how dark and twisted Apep's RP is . I remember being a toy for a short time, to become a slave to that type of environment ... hmmm perhaps it was a call for attention perhaps not I don't know Apep and I haven't spoken in a long time, do to things both of you are well aware of.<br>
<br>
If you play with fire you get burned.<br>
*shows her scar*<br>
<br>
What I will say is those that wish to play a slave role please understand what you are doing. Your character is for RP purposes nothing, a peice of property that is likely to be abused, your &quot;master&quot; isn't your friend s/he is your owner. That's why slavery is was abolished.<br>
<br>
Anyway if you like dark and twisted plots Apep will provide that, if you can't handle them. Then you've been warned. Will Apep change ? not likely there are those that like that roleplay. Will some who can't handle it have to back out ? Yes I know I did, and at that time pretty much gave up roleplaying Dalninil. Am I sorry that someone else got in over there heads Yes I am.<br>
<br>
Will it happen again ? most likely it will.<br>
<br>
Now as to the mellodrama ...<br>
Brutin ~ threats won't get you anywhere, some folks you can warn some, others need to learn the hard way.<br>
Apep ~ peace yo , you provide a unique blend of fun ,not for me though<br>
Bridh ~ lots of twisted mellow drama perhaps you aren't the center of the world ?<br>
Sar, and Keri ~ play with fire and get burned, doing it over and over with knowledge of what you're dealing with is ? masocistic ?<br>
<br>
Will this hurt ES ? Not likely i'm pretty sure that they're an Evil Guild<br>
<br>
Will this hurt Apep ? again not likely , look at his sig please, then look at his roleplay , did he  happen to mention he was Evil ?<br>
<br>
Damn I actually made a halfway coherent post in the Soapbox<br>
<br>
What is the world comeing to....<br>

Puff puff pass yo !<br>

<br>
Apep as an evil cocksucker is admirable, it is what Apep is here for.  But when Dickless makes OOC threats, starts powermoding and declaring what will and will not happen, to include those threats to other people outside of the Storyline.<br>
<br>
Fat fucking chance.<br>
<br>
Play with fire and get burned?<br>
<br>
Please tell me you are retarded and I won't be so harsh.<br>
<br>
Boy if I could solve all my problems with that little gem.<br>
<br>
Why do I want? Because the little asshole couldn't handle the RP and made threats. <br>
<br>
Is that not a common complaint from everyone here? Where the hell is your &quot;it's just a game&quot; speech? Or does it not apply to Apep because you think he is cool?<br>
<br>
Yeah, Amae the slave girl could get abused, and that is just what pissed Apep off, enough in fact for him to drop all pretense of RP.<br>
<br>
I hope you guys aren't a cross section of ES.  Because I not only have alot of respect for that guild but someone I care about is mixed up over there supposedly having the time of her life.  I would hate to think close minded sychopants were the total and complete makeup of ES.  <br>
<br>
God damn clueless boot lickers.<br>

Here are the OOC threats you are all hearing about<br>
<br>
after I found Amae had &quot;relations&quot; or whatever behind Apep's back I told APep wont be happy ect...<br>
<br>
<br>
ANd gave her soem choices on what we can do.<br>
<br>
1st choice is where the threat issue comes from<br>
<br>
Apep gets pissed/rage ect..Sar was directly involved so I said APep would go after the guild she was in forcing a guild war or trying to disgrace them IC for betraying Apep IC. Typical Apep fashion he would go after all her firends  then her last.<br>
No surprise there is how APep is..<br>
<br>
That is where &quot;threats are deriving from&quot;<br>
<br>
2nd option<br>
She asked if we can turn back time I sad no I dont do it that way. I told I will drop rp all together and discontinue rp with her and nto recongnize her in my eyes as a valid rper.<br>
<br>
<br>
So once again the threats are comign form what APep was goign to do IC, but yet the one who started the thread is going off hear say what he believes true and someone who had nothign to do with story line. He is on his self righteous crusdae to make me feel bad, or make me look bad or something. General part of the sever could give a shit less but apparently you haven't grasped that concept yet but go ahead on your crusade. Be sure to breathe inbetween your foaming at the mouth as you pound on the key board keys cussing me as you type. As for your friend ask her how much she has rp'd with me in last few weeks and choke on it<br>

Really, my world just couldn't continue without your great words of wisdom.<br>
<br>
Apparently now being concerned that people get hurt from time to time is insisting on being the center of attention.<br>

<br>
I had no idea this post had anything to do with me, and here I am, middle of computer class, trying to figure out how the hell to respond to this.  <br>
<br>
Okay.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Major</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> clarification.<br>
<br>
First off.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> What happened between Amae and Apep, PoAmae and PoApep, has <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>little</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to do with my leaving EQ.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Secondly.  I, as PoAmae, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> don't feel bad about what happened.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Yes, a few words were said that stung.  But no more than that.  My eyes are clear, I have NEVER taken this into IRL feelings.  I still like and respect PoApep as a friend, though I think because of this my chances of continuing that friendship has been completely thrown out the window.<br>
<br>
Whatever hurt I might have felt has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nothing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do with my age.  Pardon me for saying so, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> really does hurt.  I have prided myself on being mature, emotionally older than my age.  Would you have said the same thing if I were ten years older?  If I were one of the famous roleplayers such as Isharra, Didi, or Sarhea?  I doubt that.  Yes, I'm seventeen.  My age has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nothing</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do with my maturity.  <br>
<br>
If you're going to blame me for being a slave, that's your own choice.  Perhaps I'm reading into this too much, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>stop belittling me for my RP choices</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I chose to be a slave to Apep back in September.  RP-wise, that is probably the best thing that has happened to me in EQ.  It led to a LOT of really fun RP experiences, such as being trusted by the Dark folk and getting to know them.<br>
<br>
I left Saga for Ebon Storm.  Maybe that still hurts.  If so, I'm sorry, now <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>drop it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  That argument is dead and rotting.<br>
<br>
Stop with your insults on PoApep's manhood and spine.  He has both.  His threats were to the good of roleplaying, and I respect him for that.<br>
<br>
So.  Here's my big secret.  When PoApep and I talked about this, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> make a huge mistake.  I took his threats on Amae &amp; Co. too seriously.  I took his belief that he could destroy other guilds the way he did Tinker's Pride too seriously.  <br>
<br>
Because I felt that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> should be the one to pay for my transgression, I asked that he rewind in his RP forum, during a thread where he offered Amae her freedom, to change the &quot;No, I'll stay with you&quot; to &quot;Yes, set me free.&quot;  I had two justifications for this.  Firstly, the last post or conversation that had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to do with Amae's freedom was my saying that I'd stay as a slave.  Thus, it wouldn't affect the future which had been, at the time, unwritten.  <br>
<br>
Secondly.  I do NOT like screwing with people OOCly.  I knew there would be hurt ICly because of my leaving the Light side, and I was willing to take that.  Some people took it far too OOCly, and while that still frustrates me, it taught me something.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Never do anything so drastic that people will be cold to you OOCly because of what you did in-game.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  So, I asked that things be changed so that OTHERS would not be hurt by this.  I wanted the blame, I wanted the punishment <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for myself, as the transgressor, alone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  OOCly, yes, this was a punishment as well, as some of my best memories of EQ have been ones during my enslavement period.  My relationship to Apep and to PoApep was important to me, but not so much as my want <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not to hurt people OOCly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  My rule first and foremost, and screw what I think or I feel.<br>
<br>
That's my big secret.  That's what led PoApep to stop respecting me as a roleplayer.  You decide whether you think that's enough.  When he said that his respect for me was deteriorating because of that suggestion, I reconsidered.  Yes I owed more to the story than that.  I was willing to go through with it in the end.  PoApep, because you didn't want to &quot;waste your time&quot; following through with this - which can be understood either as you honestly didn't want to hurt me, because you're justifably too busy with guild and character to bother with the story of one little slave, or because you're tired of people being up your ass because yoyu're one of the few people on this server who dares to roleplay large-scale destruction - that is the only frustration I feel towards you.<br>
<br>
Everyone else.  Bottom line.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>My conversation and subsequent end of relationship to Apep has less to do with my leaving than the fact that I would log in and ask myself why I was doing so.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  EQ had stopped being fun in the blocks of three hours, twice a week, that I could devote to it.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Now please lock this thread.  It is rediculous, misinformed, and wrought with untruths.<br>
<br>
I had asked PoApep to drop the enslavement because I wanted to avoid scandal and OOC anger.<br>
<br>
A damn shame that that's exactly what happens when I leave. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Amaeliya/forestsig.JPG "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brutinvitellius>Brutin Vitellius </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/26/02 2:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hey Dickless</span><hr size=1> Apep,<br>
<br>
You have to be the most clueless Redneck on this board. <br>
<br>
You just confirmed each and every thing I was told not to mention validated my complaint.<br>
<br>
You will just ignore someone and call them a bad RPer? Fucking Waaaaa.<br>
<br>
Where is your baby bottle?<br>
<br>
Am I a bad RPer too because I flame your chicken shit ass?<br>
<br>
What I rail at, what I complain over is that you seem to have the same concept of RP as most of the Lamers that get flamed in this very same spot.  <br>
<br>
You have just admitted to us non-interested people that you are dictating how people will RP something out.  <br>
<br>
As you say:<br>
<br>
If you aren't allowed to track down and destroy the guild Sar is in for causing the unsightly mess she created with your slave, a slave that has no value and is a worthless object in other forums, then you will ignore the lot of them and further call them bad RPers.<br>
<br>
What the Fuck?<br>
<br>
Those are your words, not mine.  What the hell kind of flaming do I need to do to you when you seem intent on running ahead of me and beating yourself to death?<br>
<br>
Good God, the point of my flamage was to piss you off to make you think, you instead of gotten more stubborn and you are doing more damage to yourself than even I intended.<br>
<br>
Amazing that Dickless is actually making me feel sorry for him, and yet he is a dictating, mindless Powermoder who loves to lord over other PLAYERS instead of Characters.<br>
<br>
Way to go.<br>
