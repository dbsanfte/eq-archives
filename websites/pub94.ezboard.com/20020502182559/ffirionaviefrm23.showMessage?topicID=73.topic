He stirred in his sleep, a smile flickering across his jagged mouth. It was unusual for him to smell things within his dreams. But that one smell, the sweet, juicy scent of roasting elf meat, was unmistakable. Flathead, the scrawny dwarf slave he had taken on a recent trip to Ro, must have overcome his distaste for cooking Ogre cuisine. Well, thought Jens, thatÅfs what a few well placed smacks with a hammer will teach a dumb beardy.<br><br>Ah yes, in a moment he would doubtless wake to a fine meal and it was no less than he deserved. He was still young, but he worked tirelessly. He had been harvesting heads for Zek every day since he was strong enough to wield an axe and would continue doing so till the day he died in battle.<br><br>He felt the darkness falling away but the flickering light that appeared ahead of him was not that of the torches that lit his cave but larger flames that spread out on either side of him, filling his vision. Now the smell of burning flesh grew stronger and he could feel the heat of the flames. Above the roar of the fires he began to make out a high pitched keening. Ahh, the sound of elves in pain.  The smile returned again to his scarred face, perhaps he should have been surprised at finding himself in this situation but he had never been one to question the gifts the Gods granted him.<br><br>He moved forward towards the fires seeking the tortured elves whose dying voices rang sweetly in his ears. Strive as he might though he could get no closer to them, they remained twisted silhouettes, a background of broken bodies impaled upon a forest of spears. He snarled in frustration and reached for his axe but his belt was empty.<br><br>ÅgIt is a fine song is it not?Åh<br><br>The voice startled him and he turned to its owner, at last someone to kill. What dreams he had rarely went this long without violence.<br><br>The speaker was another Ogre a frail looking elder with a thick white beard. Probably one of those wastrel Shamen. He would learn soon enough not to intrude on a warriorÅfs dream.<br><br>ÅgWhat do you want here old man?Åh  Jens moved to stand in front of the smaller figure, raising his chin aggressively as his face curled into a sneer.<br><br>ÅgWhat would any true Ogre want here Jens Corda?Åh The old manÅfs face was lowered and Jens found himself looking a dark, narrowed eyes without a trace of light in them.<br><br>ÅgTo watch elves dyinÅf. To eat their meat anÅf then to kill some more.Åh<br><br>ÅgAh, you answer your own question fittingly my son.Åh <br><br>Jens wasnÅft sure what this old fool expected. He never understood the other Shamen and their nonsensical talk either but he was beginning to get tired of the way this dream was going. Too much talk and so far no fighting.<br><br>ÅgBe quiet old man. Make yourself useful. Bring me some elves to kill.Åh<br><br>The old manÅfs head dipped slightly and when he lifted it Jens could see a thin, sharp smile splitting the darkness of his face. <br><br>ÅgHehehe.Åh The old man took a step closer. ÅgYou would kill elves would you pup? Not even a true warrior yet and you seek to make threats upon those who have killed thousands of your kind.Åh<br><br>JenÅfs lips pulled in a snarl revealing his jagged yellow teeth. He too moved closer reaching out his hand toward the old manÅfs throat. But suddenly the flames around them flared rising upwards in a blast of heat and with them the old man too seemed to grow. Towering abruptly over the younger Ogre he swelled in size, great slabs of muscle bursting through the seams of the clothing he wore. His teeth lengthening to sharp tusks, his thin eyes burning red as the flames that surrounded them. <br><br>Now this, thought Jens, was more like it. This is what dreams are supposed to be like and this is what an Ogre in waking life should aspire to. Look for strength and challenge it. He grinned and dived at the hulking figure his hands hooking into claws that again sought the throat of his foe. <br><br>The massive figure laughed and reaching out one arm snagged Jens easily by the neck, hoisting him aloft with fearsome strength. Jens lashed out but his blows fell ineffectually upon the titanÅfs arms and shoulders. <br><br>ÅgYou are weak yet pup. But you have courage and in a warrior that is paramount. Seek out strength and challenge it. Yes, that is our creed. If you fall then deservedly so, if you overcome you grow stronger still.Åh<br><br>ÅgBut to fight and die is not enough. Our kind were once creatures of power, feared and obeyed throughout this world. Now we are hunted. Hounds become game. I say this shall not be!!Åh<br><br>The giantÅfs dark face burned now with an inner fire and JenÅfs felt his own rage slip away for once, held enrapt by the intensity of the flaming eyes.<br><br>ÅgThere is a war coming pup and in it our race will rise or fall. Death or glory Jens Corda, there can be no middle ground. I tell you now when the time comes our people must be read. Ready to take their place as master once again. Do what you can to prepare them. Seek out the weak ones first, the foolish races of the woodlands and valleys and temper your steel on their flesh and bones. When they are gone find stronger foes to hone your skills upon. Prepare our people for the coming war for at that time the strongest will meet and there will be a final reckoning.Åh<br><br>The dark giant lifted Jens even higher and drew back one massive arm. <br><br>ÅgDo no forget my message pup,Åh the figures armed smashed forward and Jens felt its braod fist punch deep into his chest. Ripping his hand free the figure raised it before JenÅfs face and spread the gore covered fingers wide, ÅgFor it is a message of blood.Åh<br><br><br>JenÅfs eyes opened and he drew in a deep breath. He was in his cave. The familiar shadows and smell of animal hide brought him to his senses immediately. The dream had not scared him but he had never experienced anything so intense. Certainly he had not understood everything the figure had said but the meaning was clear. It must have beenÅccould it? Had he been gifted with a vision of Zek himself? The words of the dream figure had touched him deeply but how much truth could be granted to a dream?<br><br>Moving from his pallet his feet touched a soft, damp bundle on the floor. He kicked it curiously and it rolled over revealing itself to be the bloody corpse of Flathead the dwarven slave. In his chest a gaping hole showed splinters of broken ribs. Looking to his own hand Jens saw it dripped with the crimson ichor of the dwarfÅfs innards.  <br><br>He smiled. Aye, there was truth in this vision. He kicked the wet corpse to one side. The weak would fall under their masterÅfs heels. His people had been too long denied their birthright. It was time they made Norrath fear them once again. In the name of their father, Rallos Zek of the Bloody Hand.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujenscorda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jens Corda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/27/02 11:13:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wrong thread</span><hr size=1> Hmm, this should probably be in Bard for a Day.

Each night I have the dream. The dream of blood. This night was different. Normally the dream began with the battle that could only be dreamed. Barbarians strong with steel and numbers sweep into Qeynos. The guards are stuck down with a mighty blow ! The clerics of  Rodnet Nife fall equally fast. They are not worthy of a warrior's blade. The battle is joined the Knights of Thunder and the barbarian horde clash. The city resounds with the clash of weapons and crys of the fallen. Onward we rush. Clearing the city of all the rot and smell of the other gods. The crys of Rallos come from all quarters of the city. In my minds eye I see the terrible head of Rallos Zek nod in agreement at our victory. I know this is only the first victory of a long and glorious war. Usually the dream ends at this point and I waken full of the glory of battle and ready to take on the world. This night is different. <br>     I feel the world fall away from me. I see Antonica laid out like prey ready for the killing. I see blood flow from the North heading to the South. The wave seems unstoppable. Then I see a second wave from the far south. It too seems unstoppable. They meet in the middle each having a half of the land. I see the second wave leap across the ocean to the faraway land. I see the name of Faydwer. Not the half-men of Antonica, but old and frail races of Elves. I see the second wave crush on the shore of this land. I see it reach deep into the interior, then it stops. I hear the voice of my lord Rallos Zek in my dream. Join with my children. Wipe away the curse and let them fulfill their destiny and your people will realize their destiny. This is my promise. <br>       I wake. My head is filled with images of war and dying. No victory this morning. I have a new sense of urgency. I must seek out the children of Rallos Zek. Perhaps with allies like these I can realize my dream of the new Combine Empire. Stronger and greater than before. This time it will not fall!<br><br>This I swear is true, may lord Rallos Zek take me if not true.<br><br>Lasonta Combine Barbarian Warrior of Rallos Zek<br>      <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uforgehammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Forgehammer</A> at: 3/27/02 2:11:47 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=73.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=73.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboardÆ</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
