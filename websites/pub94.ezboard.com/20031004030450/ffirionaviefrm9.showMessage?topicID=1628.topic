<br>
You can do a lot to help your computer by adding RAM, and thats likely the cheapest of your options.  Be sure to know what type of RAM your computer uses and how many open slots you have before spending money though.<br>
<br>
The other option would be a new processor.  Depending on what type of motherboard you have, you may be able to get a higher speed processor... or you might need a whole new mother board.<br>
<br>
If you want to go full out, p4 2.4ghz have come down a lot in prices recently, I got mine for very cheap when I upgraded.<br>

Alternatively, instead of paying for a new CPU right at this moment, you can try overclocking your old CPU, assuming your motherboard supports it. By this, you make your old CPU (and the rest of your system too) run faster than it was recommended to (because the recommended speed published by Intel/AMD is usually lower than what your CPU can really achieve anyway).<br>
<br>
There are really 2 speeds in a computer, the CPU speed and the bus speed. The CPU speed is merely a certain multiple of the bus speed. Essentially, the CPU has an in-built multiplication factor (say x12 for example) with which it multiples the bus speed by. The &quot;faster&quot; your CPU, the larger the multiplication factor usually. Hence, if your bus speed is 100Mhz, and your CPU has a multiplier of 12, then your CPU speed is 1200MHz (1.2Ghz). <br>
<br>
Increasing either the CPU speed or the bus speed will result in an overall increase in speed of your computer (though increasing bus speed will provide more increase generally). Increasing the multiplier only increases your CPU speed, increasing your bus speed increases both your bus speed and your CPU speed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How to increase CPU speed:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You can't do this easily anymore because Intel/AMD got smart and now do not allow people to change the multiplier of a CPU. (not without CPU surgery anyway)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How to increase bus speed:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You can only do this if your motherboard supports it. If you bought a good brand of motherboard (asus, gigabyte, aopen, tyan) then increasing your bus speed is an absolute piece of cake. Simply go into your CMOS setup (press DEL when computer is booting), find the right menu, and you should be able to select a new bus speed (higher of course). It would be best to go up in bus speed very gradually.<br>
<br>
Brief FAQ:<br>
Q: Will my computer/CPU blow up if I overclock my CPU too much:<br>
A: No. If you bump up your bus speed too high, your computer either won't even boot, or it will boot to windows and run normally, but will crash/freeze very often. If this happens, it means that you are asking too much of your system and you should lower your bus speed.<br>
<br>
Q: I managed to increase my bus by 80Mhz and my system is running stably. But I really want to have an extra 25Mhz so that I can say my system is running at 2.0Ghz. At 2.0Ghz however, my system freezes/crashes a lot. What can I do?<br>
A: Live with it, you just got an extra 80Mhz for free.<br>
<br>
Q: What happens if -somehow- I manage to blow up my CPU?<br>
A: Well, what better excuse to buy a faster CPU? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buvin>Buvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>the ever dying ranger</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/4/03 6:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1628.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  What can I do?</span><hr size=1> Depends on you computer knowledge.<br>
<br>
As mentioned in the first reply, check how much and of what type of memory you have. Most games will check and will not run if you have too little. If you can't identify the type on your own, get one of those nice sliver static bags, remove one stick of memory from your system and bring it to the store to show someone with some knowledge on the subject.<br>
<br>
Even when I had my slow processor, I don't think many games checked. Granted, the game may not work nice, but it tried. A faster processor on it's own is not too hard to install, but there are a few things to make sure you get right. 1.) Have a good fan on it. 2.) Don't use the stupid tapelike thermal compound they put on most heatsinks now. Go buy a tube of the goose poop looking silicon thermal heatsink compound(every radio shack will have it). Scrape the tapelike stuff off and smear the compound all over that surface before mounting the heatsink. 3.) Make sure the new CPU is compatible with your motherboard. Even a faster PIII may not be supported. (easy to find out if you have the model number on the motherboard, a bit harder if you don't. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~mcjohnson/images/EQ/sig52.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

If you can overclock, it would depend on your motherboard primarily.  You can do this using the BIOS settings on some board, jumpers or switches on some boards, and then some require good soldering iron.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I would not personally recommend the overclocking way though unless you are somewhat familiar with this or know someone that is.  You can run into some power problems, instability, ventilation issues(heat), etc.  I think I would recommend more RAM to start with if you have 256MB or less.  I run a P3-733 machine with 512MB and it does not run to bad.... even compared to my P4 2.4 machine.  Just have to turn off some of the graphics, tone down some detail in places like the bazaar(far clip plane to 0), and maybe not load all of the new models.  <br>
<br>
As far as seeing what kind of motherboard you have, there are some easy ways and some hard ones.  You could try checking all over the board for a logo matching a company name.  You can also sometimes see in the same POST screen you saw the multiplier on.  Sometimes in the BIOS when you hit the escape key at first start(sometimes DEL or F1 or F10 keys).  Some software programs can also tell you this while testing your system.  I recommended this program called SiSoft Sandra in another forum and it seemed to help them a good bit.  It is free and helps diagnose possible slow-down settings in your machine.  Worth a shot I say!  If not, it hleps you learn a lot and see comparisons of other components against your own!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You can post any questions on describing your motherboard here though and I will try to help you figure out which you have.  Also, something VERY nice if you see it is a number called &quot;FCC&quot; number.  It is usually in bad spots to find though but will lead you to the company that makes your board.<br>
<br>
They used to have a great overclocking guide on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com" target="top">Tom's Hardware</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> but it seems a bad link now.  Lots of other great info on that site though!<br>

If you see a setting where you can adjust numbers somewhere in the range of 66, 100, 133, and so on, that's probably the right setting. <br>
<br>
If you ONLY see the numbers 66, 100 and 133, then your motherboard probably does not support overclocking since you are already at your highest bus speed. If however, you see numbers with small increments (i.e. 66, 67, 68, 69, .....130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136+) then you are in luck. If you see the latter, simply bump up your bus speed by 1 (i.e. 133 to 134) and you've gained 6.5Mhz CPU speed. Reboot..and test. Worst that could happen is your computer doesn't boot.<br>
<br>
What the previous poster said about doing this at least if you have experience, or if you have someone around with experience, is probably a good idea. At the very least, do a quick search on the net for a walk through guide then find one morning of a weekend to play around with it. It can be quite addictive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buvin>Buvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>the ever dying ranger</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/4/03 11:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1628.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Here's what I mean by &quot;speed&quot;:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> It can be quite addictive.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What would happen if I upped my RAM to 512?  <br>
Would EQ2 work then, or would it just be really crappy?<br>
<br>

My CPU now runs at 913 MHz! </span><hr size=1> Increasing your memory is a very good idea, in fact majority of upgrades is usually just adding memory. But it all depends on the type of RAM you have.. if you have the old EDO ram its going to take a lot of wear and tear out of it to eek out all its muster... the newer RAM DDR, SDR, and RAMBUS are very good, and it also depends on the bus speed of your ram as well. Just be careful when you upgrade your memory because some may not be compatible with your system and could burn them out (though rarely, most of the time they just don't work). A good place to shop for memory which I have had great success is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.crucial.com" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Crucial.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Check them out, they have all the info you need about memory upgrades.<br>
<br>
As for what you might see... you might get jumpy framerates when the going gets tuff, to temporary screen pauses. But its hard to say for sure. But those are the likely candidates. Good luck!<br>

I also use <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.pricewatch.com" target="top">Pricewatch</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for a lot of good searches to find cheap goods.  Since I imagine you have SDRam 100-133, Adding more memory to 215MB would prolly help things with EQ1 a good bit, but with EQ2... still too early to know.  I initally think it would not be a great improvement on EQ2 based on what I have seen since ti will probably slam your processor pretty hard.<br>

My CPU now runs at 913 MHz! </span><hr size=1> Wow, nice Rhaxy! A 47Mhz increase in CPU speed and a 7Mhz increase in bus speed. Ok, still not enough for you to play EQ2 but it didn't cost you any money. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Grats!<br>
<br>
One thing to monitor now is your CPU temperature. If you motherboard was able to support overclocking, than there is a good chance that it also has an on-board hardware temperature monitor. Assuming that it does have one, you can probably find the temperature readings somewhere in CMOS. If you are lucky, you might even have received a Windows program when you bought your computer that reports your CPU temperature to you, which you can then run in windows and monitor while you do your normal computer stuff (like EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
Okay, assuming that you have been able to find out what your CPU's temperature is, it would be a good idea to keep an eye on this reading for a while just to make sure that your CPU is not running hotter than it should be (now that you have overclocked it to 913 Mhz). To find out what is a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; temperature for your CPU to be running at, this can be easily determined by going to the appropriate CPU manufacturer's website (Intel or AMD for example) and downloading the technical PDF file that they have for each CPU. In the technical PDF file they will tell you what the &quot;maximum operating temperature&quot; of your CPU should be. Make sure your CPU is not over this maximum operating temperature. (If you are NEAR the max operating temperature, you should probably be wary too.).<br>
<br>
(NB: The value of maximum operating temperature listed in the technical PDF is most likely the maximum operating temperature of your CPU when running at &quot;full load&quot;. i.e. your CPU is working at maximum capacity. You should hence also make your CPU run at &quot;full load&quot; before comparing temperatures. To make your CPU run at &quot;full load&quot; try downloading a program caled Seti@home and run that for an hour....and who knows, maybe be the first to detect extra-terrestial intelligence. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
If your CPU is within acceptable limits, and is running stably, then HUZZAH! Best to leave it alone now although there are other techniques for making it run even faster. *grin* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=1628.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=1628.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1628.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=1628.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1628.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1628.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
