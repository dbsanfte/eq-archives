Even heard a &quot;Twang!!! 26!!&quot; at one point, although I was happy to see there were no &quot;Grats, Gtatzzzz, or G R A T Zzzzz&quot; afterward.<br>
<br>
Assuming that the changes in FV have caused an influx of non-FV players to the server, how have the focused players met with these changes?  Turn shout and ooc off?  Also, is it considered proper to go about anon?  Not sure if I like it, but it does help in some circumstances to know who is out there and what lvl/class they are.<br>

Why anti-social?  Well, there are a couple ways to find people to group or raid with.  One way is the friends list and that works pretty well RP or not when you're just trying to find a group for yourself.  It's nice to be able to see where all your friends are, though.  You can easily recognize the ungrouped or maybe the group closest to you.  And, if someone has leveled, it's fun to send them a 'grats on leveling.  People like being noticed.<br>
<br>
The other side of the coin is if you're the leader type, you need to find people to put together a group.  This means you want to know: what classes are available, where they are, and who they are so you can send out your invites.  If you're a raiding guild, a non-anon non-role rule is absolutely essential.  The raid leader needs to be able to find out quickly how many clerics are online, any mages, any shaman, who are my available trackers to let me know what our potential targets are, etc. etc..  If people are hiding, the raid leader can't get answers to these questions and that means no raids.<br>
<br>
Notice how all off these reasons have absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the people in question role-play or not?  It's a side-issue that has no bearing on whether or not the person is an RP God or a d00d-weasel.  Non-/anon and non-/role is just a way to be honest and open with people, especially your friends and guildmates. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

OOC   always off.  if someone has something to tell me in OOC they can /tell me.<br>
<br>
Dings and Gratzies   In our Guild chat we do not discourage our comrades from letting us know when they attain another level.  Or from our members congratulating them on a job well done.  I never reply in shout form for a ding.  But it's kind of like a birthday.  If I have a birthday someone had better sing &quot;happy birthday to you, etc&quot;<br>

AUC   never use the stuff.   It's way to addicting.<br>

/role on  Those that know me know my strength and seek me out. Those that don't, don't need to be begging me for armor and weapons.<br>
<br>
/anon I don't like to see it in our guild, but the the guild has request that if someone is AFK trading in bazaar to please go /anon so that the actual playing memers will know who is available for the hunting party.<br>

I see being non-anon as like those people who just have to show off their new Mercedes, who cares? The people I know and care about know about what level I am anyway.<br>
     Mosushi, I think you are thinking about the ANON tag, if you are RP, you still show up in a /who all guild. And any good raid leader would know the capabilities of their guild members they would choose to go on a raid. <br>
     People who get into stupid zone wide shouting wars get on my ignore list pretty fast. I would much rather they did that in OOC than in shout, save the shouts for trains and zone wide quests like in Eastern Wastes and Greater Divide. Always funny when one of their friends ask my why I am ignoring his request for a rez.<br>
     Now I see nothing wrong with being non-anon, if that is what you want, but pointing out that you do not have to have the RP tag on to RP is just as silly as saying you do not have to have the non-anon tag on to be a d00d.<br>

<br>
/auction off<br>
/shout on <br>
<br>
Though there are days when I wonder why I have shout on... I don't even listen for trains most of the time since there is generally no indication of for which side of the zone they are headed.. and the shout spam is annoying and gets bad each time after a patch.  The /shout crap in GFay is worse now than the week after 8 May, probably because of all the newbie quests for elves.  Part of me almost wishes they would have left the elves for very last.<br>
<br>
/role on<br>
<br>
I, too, do not see the RP reason someone across the zone or in another part of the world altogether would have a clue what level of ability I am or where I am at (if not in the same zone).  You want to know?  Ask!  &quot;/tell Caillou Where are you today?&quot; &quot;/tell &lt;teller&gt; Oh I thought I'd hunt &lt;whatnot&gt; in &lt;where ever&gt;.

<br>
But I'm goofy that way *grin*.  I also see no problem with those that like the blue informational tag.  I RP with them just the same and ignore the information I might have gotten on a /who (player knowledge vs character knowledge).<br>
<br>
As for shouting your level gain... umm... to your friends and your guildmates, sure, but to a zone and expect them to say things to you as if it is your birthday... umm... no.  I could care less that anonymous_d00d_01 is now level 5 (or even 55).  Though I have included it as part of my signature since it, like my chosen last name and my guild tag, are things I am proud of, but I don't always include it, jsut because I don't feel like typing it *laugh*.<br>

there's a lot of ways folks can make their shouts in character.<br>
<br>
/shout LFG 26 pal<br>

/shout Paladin of the 26th season seeks a group<br>
<br>
/shout LF port 2 tox<br>

/shout I seek transportation to tox<br>
<br>
/shout The mets won! WOOOT<br>
can be<br>
Nevermind. Somethings cannot be fixed.  Just stick 'em on /ignore or if you are feeling nice, tell 'em first to please not talk about that on a public channel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, it requires more typing. But it's so much nicer on the eyes. <br>
<br>
I've found ignoring the folks works quite well to not have 'em repeat it again. It doesn't work on blue servers because inevitably someone will spout off a response, but here most folks either have shout off, or are like me and dont bother answering.  So I run with shout on and haven't seen too much garbage (mind ya, I haven't been to gfay much lately, either..)<br>

Verboten.  Doing /who all GUILD is a waste of time for a raid leader.  It does not sort, does not show everyone (it's only about 25 long), and then the raid leader has to manually count up every class or mentally run through a list (gee, who are my clerics again and are they online?).  If you don't show up on &quot;/ all GUILD cler&quot;, I'm going to assume you're hiding from the guild and not interested in either raiding or grouping.  In a serious raiding guild, I would deguild someone that did this habitually.  They're not helping raid, which is the goal of the guild.<br>
<br>
BTW, &quot;/ all GUILD&quot; will even show anon people, but you can't use the various race/class/level search parameters on it when folks are anon or role.  Some folks only come to raids that drop loot for them.  It's a great way to catch people trying to skip out and hide from raids.  Also, the leader could make up long lists of &quot;/ all foo&quot;,&quot;/ all bar&quot;,etc. and spread them across several macros to find all the people of a particular class.<br>
<br>
Using /role and /anon does indeed hide you from your guild when they're doing class-searches for a raid.  It might even hide you completely if you've been online a long time and not zoned recently; ie. off the end of the who list.  Permitting /role and /anon in a raiding guild is a pretty huge hassle just to support a few dishonest lurkers afraid to stand up and be counted. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

I was rather irritated the other day with people using shout as (ooc) by placing the &quot;-ooc&quot; at the end of their shouts asking about quest components and the like. So I shouted back &quot;I am so glad they disabled the OOC channel on this server.&quot;<br>

Surprisingly, I didnt hear another ooc shout for several hours in the zone. I expected to get rude tells and the like, but I didnt. Was a nice surprise.<br>

Doing &quot;/ all GUILD&quot; gives a general idea, but I really pitty the poor raid leader that has to manually scrounge up players.<br>
<br>
Then again, there's a difference between raid capable and raiding.  In the latter, you're doing 3-7 targets a day.  In the former, raids tend to be on the order of a few a week and scheduled in advance.  For multiple targets a day every day, you really don't want to burden the raid leader with lots of player idiosyncrasies that don't do anything but make his job harder.  For the family style guild that raids once in a while, well, everyone knows who is at a raid because the raid is a big deal.<br>

'Course some of my dislike for /role and /anon is purely emotional.  I view it as a form of hiding and indicative of an essentially dishonest character.  Also, I'm irked at VI for lumping two completely unrelated things together -- the purple that indicates an RP-prefered player and the hiding of class and level.  Frankly, I'd like a purple name AND to show my class and level.  Of the two, I count being open and honest as more important, so I don't use /role. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

     So I guess you started off on this server seeing the whole server as dishonest? I guess you did not have any friends until players could run non-anon. I would by far rather trust someone with the RP tag (unless they are an evil rogue) than some vain person who wants everyone to know what level they are.<br>
     As to guilds, some guilds require you to not be anon. If you are in one of those guilds and you are running anon, then you are being dishonest and secretive. Other raiding guilds only require you to be non-anon if you are available for raiding. <p>4 of 45<BR>

welcome to Firiona Vie!  home of the roleplayers, home of the uber players, home of the bickerers over gameplay, the sleeper that must-or-must-not be awoken, and every other issue under the sun (or is that moon?)!  <br>
<br>
do what you think is best here.  play the character that YOU are going to have fun with.  determine what your goals are here, even if that goal is to have no goals. <br>
<br>
do you like to roleplay?  then do so, regardless of whether or not someone comes up to you and says &quot;gimme plat plz, kk thanx la~&quot;.  do so regardless of which tag you have over your head.  if you want people to know about your level &amp; whereabouts, use the tag that suits you.  <br>
<br>
if you want people to know at a glance that you're going to respond to their &quot;sow plz&quot; requests with &quot;prithee, why do you ask a servant of our lord bertoxxulous for the blessings of a spirit that he has no congress with m'lady?&quot;  then use the roleplay tag.<br>
<br>
if you don't want to hear shouts, turn them off.  others are not going to always be so private about what they just had for dinner.  they want to SHARE, and sharing is supposedly a nice thing to do, or so we all learned in kindergarten.  but if you can't put up with this sharing, turn shouts off.  let's not dither over whether they SHOULD be using this channel to share such details with you.  truth is you cannot control their fingers typing on their keyboards in their homes halfway across the world.  so do what you can control to make the environment suitable for yourself.<br>
<br>
if you want to be an uber player, go ahead.  no one is stopping you, many guilds are welcoming you.  ignore those who would ridicule you.  you are paying for this game to have fun, YOUR fun dammit!  if that means raiding 35 hours per week and having an 80k horse then it's your game so be our guest.  just remember that you do have to share the world with the rest of us.  it isn't a single player game, after all.  <br>
<br>
if you want to be a rude, conniving basturd there are 40 other servers out there to do that with.  may i suggest one of the zeks, where that kind of behaviour is not only expected but encouraged. <br>
<br>
most of all, have FUN!  and have a nice day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In the same paragraph, you tell them to have their own fun regardless of what people say, and then in practically the next breath you say that they should keep in mind that this is not a single-player game, and that there are others around.<br>

<br>
you live your life for yourself, but you still have to roll with whatever punches come around.  there's so much out there that isn't in your control.<br>
<br>
you COULD very well go out and murder everyone who looked at you funny.  but the consequences from other people for those actions could also make that an undesireable activity for you, or put a stop to you altogether.  <br>
<br>
unfortunately, eq is online.  people seem to engage in behaviour online that they wouldn't dream of in a real public place due to the fact that there are seemingly no consequences.  mouth off here, and that 6' 7&quot; wrester-type guy isn't going to be able to backhand you across the room.<br>
<br>
i'm personally of the belief that just because you're able to act like a homicidal maniac or sexual pervert online, or just a rude asshole, you shouldn't.  basically your inner demons should stay just that.  also, the consequences may not be immediate.  no slaps here, but it will come back to you eventually in some form or other.<br>
<br>
so, my point was~play your game &amp; have fun, but remember that you're playing it with other folks who are also trying to have fun too.  a little consideration goes a long, loooong way.  and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Yes, not showing class and level hides you from the guild. Someone trying to put a group / raid together cannot easily check who is available, and then make plans. But on the other hand, checking that doesnt help you all that much, because all you see is if they are logged on. Not if they are available. With the coming of the bazaar, being logged on and being available are even less the same than before. And not all people set an /afk flag when they go into trader mode and then walk off to wash their dishes.<br>
<br>
So, even IF you can see who the clerics of your guild are (which you should already know if you know your guild), and then you still have to manually collect the players, asking if they are available or will come.<br>
<br>
Personally, i see exactly one reason for me to turn /role off. And that is - raid preparation in game. Interesting only for *huge* raids. Only then can you assume that the people you find with /who are really there for you.<br>
<br>
Of course, all that is seen from the 'non raiding' guild's view. I see little sense in a raiding guild on a rp server. Raiding and rp are two opposite ends of the game spectrum. There is little to no rp on most raids, or the raid will fail. A guild which spends most of its time raiding will therefore have little time for roleplaying.. and little use for people who rather roleplay than go out and hit target A with a raid. They simply are unavailable too often.<br>
<br>
As to the name color, well.. it doesnt matter to me. I just assume that those who come to play on a 'rp preferred' server should be rp-preferring or rp-willing players. And i approach them that way, wether they have /role on or off doesnt matter. Either they roleplay or not.<br>
<br>
The 'honesty' part does have me wondering, though. Would you see it the same way in real life.. if someone brought up a system where your age, profession and location is constantly displayed above your head and can be queried from a distance.. &quot;for honesty&quot; would get the same kind of view. I honestly doubt it.<br>
<br>
Honesty - that is answering the questions if asked... and truthfully.. not carrying a sign with the answers available for all to read.<br>
<br>
So, i enjoy not openly showing my class, level, and more so, location. And i keep /role on for that reason. But if people ask, i tell them. I dont have anything to hide after all.<br>
