Any other time I will more than likely be playing my monk which I will be able to help w/ pulling. I have pulled Hate quiet a few times on old server, So I can helo ya out on all the monkly stuff that needed to be covered...they are right about the pull monk not standing up though. How I always did it was run straight to the spot Gore had us at to begin the raid. w/ only 1 monk puling I would run near each of the buildings along that closest wall(not sure on directions can never remember, but will have them w/ me next time) and sit down to draw out the monsters then run them to that hall way where you were FDing at and switch views to watch a few things run away and let puller know when theres about 3 left so he can grab....If you do it this way you should get an auto pull, so everytime you stand up you should get a few on you and just repeat till that building is clear then proceed to next...but pulling monk does not fight much at all till we get into Maestro area. well thats about all I got time for trying to post something quick before I go to work...anyway I will give you whatever info you might need and or even pull for you next time if need be.

<br>
Regarding gems.. they are perfect to distribute as rewards ( leader, puller, porter ) and to those that didn't recieve anything else.  That was a LONG raid and some ( enchanters, iksars, wizards ) didn't have a chance to roll for anything.  Of course, you can't go to a raid and expect something.  But, you can come close to this if gems are always offered at the end.  <br>
<br>
I'd rather see this scenario than selling gems on the market or selling to raiders at reduced costs.  I realize you have to offset your costs - if requiring 150p from each raider makes this possible, maybe its a good idea.  <br>
<br>
On raids other than Hate i would think you can cover costs just with cash loots.  Raiders will not have to pay fees and after reward gems all others can be randomed at the end to those that didn't get anything.<br>

<br>
I'm still a bit young now (42) but I've started leveling up again, I should hit 46 within the next few weeks (yay rogue exp bonus!).  I was wondering how effective poisons might be up in Hate... I've never been.  <br>
<br>
What level are the mobs we'd be fightings?  Anyone know their poison resistances?  Also, what we be most helpful up there... hi damage dots?  Interupting light pushback nukes?  Snares?  Root with 50% slow?  Heck, if we're short shammies I could try out some Malo poisons... anyway I'd like to know what kind of stuff would be most useful up there.  Also, are they summoned, undead, or animals up there?<br>

<br>
regards gem drops i agree with holding them over and giving to any who didnt get loot where possible after covering raid costs etc...<br>
<br>
timewise, cant please everyone im affraid here but some of our guild myself included is on gmt, meaning 8 hours ahead of pst, 4.30pm pst is already past midnight here, i left halfway through the last raid as it was already 7am for me.<br>
<br>
In future i would like raids to be held on a weekend when the can begin in the am pst (sunday maybe?) so that time is a social daytime for all say 10 or 11am pst (6/7pm gmt)<br>
<br>
You can count on the support of League of Honour in these raids in the future <br>

April 10th</span><hr size=1> I think this was a great Idea. As far as funding the raids I like the Idea of selling off things like the Diamonds and Blue diamonds to those that attended to finance the raids or Having people bring gems with the rest going to those folks that were there.  Maybe keep a running record of whos been to the raids and what they have gotten would be a good Idea to so that no one can claim favortisim. I have no problem with you getting a chunk to cover your expenses without you this won't be possible. I had never been to planes before this and had a great time even dieing. Hevenlee I think said it best when she said I've never had this much fun dieing. As to FF and Reso comming on raids No porblem there as long as it stays under your over all control. As far as Times I work weekends and am off Thursday and Friday so If people want to alternate weekday and weekend I'm fine with that but only being on the weekend would make it harder for me to attend.

April 10th</span><hr size=1> My observations:<br>
<br>
Costs:  can be lowered by making sure we have a cleric camped up top.  Then again once we get the kinks out, there won't be wipeouts or evacs.   We wasted alot of coin on gems to teleport up.  I know that as far as the gems go, I would love to have the opportunity to either fund the raid with purchasing diamonds, or be able to to take one home as a prize.  Tinkering is expensive as it is, buying diamonds just makes it harder on me.<br>
<br>
Attitude: Everyone was very patient, happy to be there, and in great spirits... Deaths didn't phase anyone, and the attitude was FAR better than any collaborative raid I'd been on on other servers.  <br>
To those who say open/collaborative raids aren't gonna work here... I say they will be BETTER.  People here are better... the raids will be better.<br>
<br>
On leadership:  Jabbs/Chesnut you did great!  And you also had more than enough on your plate... I'm surprized you didn't snap from the pressure, good job.  Make sure you have folks to help you out and take some of the pressure on... Get some that can stay from start to finish if possible.  <br>
<br>
On Loot: There was the thing about the cleric who rolled twice, and mistakes with dishing out the armor.  Hopefully Jabbs' system will work better for future raids... if she doesn't have time or has to pull, someone who will assign numbers and roll should be appointed.  Having individual players roll is bad.  We didn't even have to roll on most things.<br>
<br>
My issue:  I wasn't really aware of the stats on the cleric armor for hate.  I chose to roll on the boots... and won them.  Only two of seven clerics present even rolled.  Then afterward, I was told to sit out till everyone got a piece.  Fair, but I ended up stuck with the &quot;booby prize&quot; cause nobody else rolled on it.... What if a helm appeared... something that would have gone right on my head, not to my backpack?  Perhaps I shouldn't have rolled at all.  but I wasn't going to delay the raid to ask stats... I just sent the tell.<br>
<br>
A solution to this that I'd pose... allow people to roll on each item for their class.  If they had won, and win again... they then get the choice of which item to keep.  This would have made me content.<br>
<br>
In the end I decided it wasn't worth it... that no looting system will be perfect.  I passed the boots back to Jabbs after the raid to give to a cleric who would use them, someone on the next raid.  Don't get me wrong... I would love to have a full set of the purple passion armor... But I would prefer the Helm, leggings and breastplate, I would wear those now.  Arms I would wear when resists and AC were needed.  As it stood, not one cleric there would have worn the boots.  The 4th set of armguards would have gone to me as I was the only cleric left without them, but knowing the problems with the double roll... Blayze deserves what he won.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I don't want my personal issue to overshadow what was an amazingly successfull raid.  I did point out my concerns, as a viable way to distribute loot:<br>
<br>
All players roll, and if they had won an item previously... take their pick of which to keep.  If we don't do it this way it's not going to kill me, we'll be going to hate weekly for a while it seems, I'm sure everyone that attends will end up with plenty of goodies. <p><b><i>Sabbik Silvertongue</i></b>, Leader of the <a href=http://www.tinkerspride.com>Tinker's Pride</a><br><i>There's nothing quite like an unexpected fireworks display... in a tinkers workshop!</i>

It was a great raid.  We did get wiped out a few times but thats not the point. It takes a lot to do somthing like this so i give my thanks to everyone who participated and the little muchkin that made it all happen, Also thanks to gore for helping us out.  It was a great experience.  I enjoyed fighting and dying with every one of you.  This server is set out from the others.  Firiona vie is more like a family that any other server i have ever played on.  I look forward to the next raid on hate and fighting with you all again and will be more than happy to kill and be slain with such a great group of people. I will learn to master my ablites as a shadowknight to do the best i can for the team.  Again thank you all for such a great raid.  I will do all i can and more  to make FV open raids the best i can.<br>
