Just making a point that that kind of attitude sucks; Helping should be reward enough in it's own...<br>
And no one should ever bitch about it, if the original intention was, in fact, simply to assist and accomplish, then there should be nothing to bitch about *shrugs*, as the raid was a success. <br>

You yourself confirm it.  I think that's crappy.  <br>
<br>
To those who say that raids aren't about loot, you're kidding yourself.  Raids are not about sightseeing after you've seen the place a few times.  To say that it's fun to take down a god is true, but after you've been to Fear a half dozen times or so, you keep coming back for loot, be it epic or upgrades.<br>
<br>
Raids are about teamwork and trust, especially Fear raids.  You have to trust someone to volunteer to be death touch ammo.  He has to trust the clerics.  Everyone has to trust the break-in group.  Everyone must work together.  When you have people join a fear raid from outside your guild, they trust you to distribute loot as you set out originally.<br>
<br>
Changing the loot rules during a raid upon realization that some quality loot might drop isn't fair to those who came hoping for a shot at an upgrade, and a lot of people come on these raids for that purpose.  If that was your plan all along, you should have communicated it clearly in the post and before the raid started, not in raid chat after the raid is formed, broken in, and clearing.  If that was an on-the-spot decision, it was needlessly unfair and not well-considered.<br>
<br>
I'm not impressed either by your conduct as reported, or by your responses here.  I'm also not impressed by those who claim that everyone should be happy tagging along with your guild, getting the scraps off the loot table that you don't want, and getting things dangled in front of their eyes only to find that you're keeping them for folks with your guild tag above their heads.  If you want to keep raid loot in guild, say so.  What you did lured people to your raid under false pretenses.  <br>

First, that's right - you weren't there which means one thing: You don't know shit about what was said or what happened.<br>
<br>
As for your hearing from several people:  Give me one name that you heard this from that's in the instant army.  Prove you aren't blowing hot air out your ass like I know you are.<br>
<br>
It was said several times that people wouldn't be allowed to roll on cazic's drops; if they can't read - that's not my problem.<br>
<br>
All you are Feroce is an instigator and don't know shit.  Fine, if this is how my raid is treated by the very people I was trying to help, never again - you go do your own raid and I'll keep mine closed from now on....<br>

Furthermore, several times she also specifically answered individual inquiries into the loot policies and repeated each time that only the members of the Instant Army would be rolling.<br>
<br>
In fact, when I sent her a tell asking her if she minded my coming along, she took the time to inform me that she had her basic people set up and that if I were to come I would just be tagging along and having fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, whether her attitude or decisions were or are right or wrong is NOT the issue here, the issue is that she specifically did mention several times how the loot was going to be handed out. Knowing that, I took the decision to stay and have fun. I could have left at any time if I was not happy but make no mistake about he fact she did state it, and several times on top of that.<br>
<br>
I for one was glad to have been there and I for one was also glad to have helped with a few key things that happened. I don't care about her loot policies or how she handled the raid or herself in the raid. Point is, it was HER raid, if people are not or were not happy then next time she has one simply don't attend, end of story. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.hostmysig.com/data/deathwatch1/dw.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ktokthrooks>Ktok ThRooks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/04 11:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=803.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear - Sunday, January 18th - 3pm PST (6pm EST)</span><hr size=1> Well said, DeathWatch.<br>
<br>
As stated before, I was not there for upgrades or loot. It’s nice that I happen to need a drop for my epic from Fear, but did I leave after the golems were dead? Of course not. I enjoy raids, I enjoy the raids I’ve been on with Sab, and I would definitely go again whether I needed anything from the zone or not.<br>
<br>
Sab, don’t let this stop you from helping the community by hosting these raids. I for one have learned a huge amount about raiding Sky and Fear from being there with you. I could lead my own raids to these places now, having seen you and the Instant Army lead yours. This, to me, is more important than any loot… and I’m sure I’m not alone in that sentiment.<br>

<br>
Sabrosia, do not let this stop you from doing the nice things you do  Period.  I know it sucks and I know when you are trying to organize an event with so many new folks it can be irritating.<br>
<br>
I know I screwed up some by continually mezzing the mob that was being attacked, making it look like folks were breaking mez in the break in group.  I finally settled down some as I got the feel for where I was needed as back up CC.  I think that was the only part in the whole raid where I actually contributed since the whole raid was plenty powerful enough.<br>
<br>
My whole understanding of the raid was to help get epic pieces.  CT was not the goal.  You did state in /rsay, if he was taken down, the drops went to Instant Army.<br>
<br>
If you ever need the help of this lowly bard, let me know.  I will be glad to help, though I doubt you would have much need.  *shrug*  I am glad I got to go. <p>Targraith Whispersong, Traveling bard <br>

Heck, a friend of mine got a tear from the Iksar Child (WOW!), I had the chance to learn some basic Plane of Fear strategies. And frankly, a paladin of 53 seasons like me hardly weighted on the outcome of the raid.<br>
<br>
Therefore I would like to bow before Sabrosia and the Instant Army and thank them for giving me a chance to join their assault on the Plane of Fear.<br>

I have yet to see anything that you, or anyone else has said, that would indicate that you did not change your loot policy whilst your raid was in-progress.  If that's how you like to run your raids, you might want to announce that before people clear their schedules and come to your raids, only to find out that they don't have a prayer of getting any significant loot.  <br>
<br>
If you wanted to reserve all loots for Instant Army members first, that would be cool; all you have to do to avoid this controversy in future is to announce a loot policy and stick with it.<br>

Go back and read, if you feel like it.  I posted a polite, constructive criticism because I thought you should know that a number of people were displeased with the way you handled things.  People were saying bad things about you, and I thought you should know.  Heck, I wasn't even mad about it, and I said so many times.<br>
<br>

<br>
IF you have a problem with how ANY raid leaders do their jobs, you can bring it to Anezkia's attention, my attention or Sirdo's attention and we will politely discuss it with you like adults..not like little 6th graders that want to shout at the walls.  There is no issue as of this point in time.  Final ruling is YOU and your guild are banned from our raids from this date forward.  If you have a problem with that discuss it with myself or anezkia.  I don't give a rats ass what you say on your own boards.   But when you bring your little tantrums to PC boards the way you did, wether you started it or not, you are earning a spot on the &quot;Don't even bother to show up to one of our events list&quot;.  <br>
<br>
If you feel you are being picked on or treated harshly....again, talk to myself and/or Anezkia and we'll discuss it like adults.  <br>
<br>
On this issue of PC loot rules.  If you have a question about them, you can do one of the following:<br>
<br>
1. go to our boards and read the rules and regulations.<br>
2. talk to any pc raidleadrer or councel member.<br>
3. read the raid  post closely.<br>
4. don't expect anything other than a good time and the   <br>
    experience of raiding with quality members and leaders.<br>
5. work on becoming a member like all the other members<br>
   and earn your epic/loot/thrills like the rest instead of trying <br>
   to be a scammer/user/griefer.<br>
<br>
Case closed.  End of discussion.  No PC members will post on this subject again.<br>

Perhaps a little of both, actually.  Also just because I can.  Your opinion on the matter no longer meant anything to me, and I didn't feel like  leaving it in my forum.<br>
<br>
The fact is, we need a private forum so we can complain say what is on our minds without winey gossipping little girls coming there to find dirt.  That is being fixed too.  It never occurred to me that someone would come snooping around to cause trouble before.  /sigh<br>

Go back and look at this thread.  That is exactly what I did.  It was only now, weeks later that someone came to my forum looking for dirt, and pronouced their ban.  That's where you folks kicked it up a notch.<br>
<br>
Once you banned me, I had some fun baiting you.  This was a resolved issue weeks ago, when Sabrosia finally admitted that it would have been better to have posted loot guidelines more thoroghly in the original post, than to do so during the raid.  I was done.<br>
