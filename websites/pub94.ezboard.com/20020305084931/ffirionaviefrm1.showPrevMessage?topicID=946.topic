I have a problem.  I see that the powers of good and neutrality have ammassed some power in their associations (i.e., guilds).  Guilds that seem to be off to a good start when you consider strenth, in terms of personal power and wealth, seem to be Fire and Fury, 1st Fist of Light, and Clan Werre.<br>
<br>
I seek something that those guilds can't offer.  I seek evil.  I seek wickedness.  I am looking for a guild that will not talk about nonsense that I have never heard of (words such as earth, computers, etc.).  Also, I seek a guild that has (ooc:end game) high aspirations.  I fully expect to obtain my ultimate goal, the famed blade of strategy and tactics, and thus I need evil brethren who lust for power as I.<br>
<br>
So, are there any guilds, associations, or gangs out there with evil intent and high aspirations.  I've seen a lot of great evil guilds, Indigo Void, Dark Crucible, etc., however, I would like something comparaple to the light/neutral associations mentioned above, except they roleplay, and are truly evil with hearts as black as night.<br>
<br>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br>

I plan on reaching the &quot;end game&quot; also, but it's not the primary focus of me, or my guild.  We will get there, but it's not a race for us.  We're taking a considerable amount of time off of hunting to have a guild war with the Order of the Oaken(if the cowards will ever fight us).   We are evil to the core, I duel most elves I see on general pricniple, but I have a personal issue with wanting to rp and set your sights on the end game.<br>
<br>
Fire and Fury is made up by a group of people (by their own admission) with lots of time on their hands!  They will see it sooner than the Void, because they play more, and are focused on attaining it.  All the FaF members I've come across were excellent roleplayers, but thats only from personal encounters.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm getting at , in all this late night rambeling, is that many guilds who are focused on RP are not focused on the end game.  The &quot;end game&quot; is mainly about Raiding and collecting fine gear.  That's alot of fun, but you can't RP with Vox.  She's not gonna stop to chat with you , she's just gonna kill you.  Our enimies are guilds we've met ingame and have issues with.  (RP only by the way, the Order of the Oaken seems like a great group of people.)<br>
<br>
I just don't think you can have it both ways at this time.  Give the Void 6months to a year and we may be just that.  But we haven't set a goal for our first dragonslaying, and it seem that's what you're after.<br>
<br>
I wish you luck in your search, and should you decide that the RP is more important than the end game, feel free to contact the Void<br>

Most people that make it to that level are spending an average of 8hrs a day playing, and that is nearly a requirement for the constant raiding that brings in the gear that is the only real reward at those levels. They are not casual players, and imo are less likely to be roleplayers. <br>
<br>
 I am thinking of playing EQ again and after having built characters on two servers into the &quot;end game&quot;  I will be very slow to do so again on FV.  The best times I have had are in small groups, and usually roleplay on regular blue servers drops off as you level up.  I know on FV that there will be a slower decline, but as has been mentioned... Vox won't likely roleplay with you.<br>
<br>
Don't take me wrong, I am not a RP nazi, but I do and always have roleplayed in my own way.  On my last server a majority of my guild did not understand why I woudln't fight in the plane of growth as a Barb Shaman.  The character was married to a Tunare following Elf.....  They just didnt get it.  <br>
<br>
I think the important thing is for everyone to enjoy the game in there own way, and having made the climb to upper levels twice before I have realized it really is the Journey and not the Destination that makes EQ fun for me.  The game is unfortunately geared to constantly improving your level, your equipment, etc, and that will always make Roleplayers more rare as you reach the higher and harder levels.<br>

<br>
I think People for the most part that are going to be on this server will make an effort to RP.  They will level a bit slower than other servers or the power gamers here.  I still think they will reach the end game.  I think it will be very interesting to have a raid of 30-40 RPers...all evil or neutral and learn how to deal with a few missing classes...ie pali's etc and be successful.  <br>
<br>
I welcome the eventual challange.  Right now I am just enjoying the low server population, RPing with everyone and killing good people.  /evil grin.<br>
<br>
I hope we can be RPers and End gamers at the same time.  I am gonna try anyways.  My days of playing 40 hours a week are over.  My days of all day raids are over.  My RL is much more important.  But I plan to be 60 on this server eventually.  So what if I never kill a dragon or Cazic or whatever.  I am still gonna have a lot of fun killin the rest of you /evil grin.<br>

Gear does not define you, skill does, work around what you dont have, heck i managed to fight fine without things like haste, the first haste item i got was the gloves from velks. But boy i had crappy armour, but i started getting a nice piece here, a nice piece there and soon i had more than most of the warriors i grouped with. <br>
<br>
Heck i could pop out any really bad wepon and solo ok, sure it wasnt as effective as i would like but i made do, thats what being an sk is about. We have many different styles available to us and can fit into about any group, learning how to fit in makes you good, not the uber wepon from velks you got twinked down.<br>
<br>
On a side note there are a few dark elf guilds.<br>
<br>
Morgrist has mentioned the evil aligned guild he is part of.<br>
<br>
Others range from Indigo Void, Dark crucible, Dark affliction, House Sel`Quar are the prominent evil aligned guilds i have encountered so far.<br>
<br>
Others like Blackened roses, i believe is a neutral/evil alignment, they have a wide range so i may be completely wrong here, but thats what i gathered from queit observation.<br>
<br>
me, i love to roleplay, but i dont like roleplay to stop my fun... wich is why i hate 'extreem' roleplayers... the last thing i want is a debate on who is more wise, innoruuk or cazic thule... seriously thats what a lot of people believe to be RP, debateing... i hate debating because everyone wants to win.. no one will admit defeat and that in my eyes makes it a large waste of my time, Roleplay any way with me you want just dont start an  hour long debate please. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrayhateborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gray Hateborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/20/01 12:33:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=919.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ahh</span><hr size=1> Well thanks for the mention Bako and Morgrist as ever.<br>

Of the evil only guilds I suspect that as it stands the League is going to reach the high end faster than others - simply by dint of size and the fact we got a running start here.<br>
<br>
Dark Affliction would be the other competitor in my mind.<br>

Blackened Roses is evil only -  however things are changing for them and their former leader and one officer and his companion have joined the League.<br>

Shintou is a fine man to have at your side in a fight and I tried to bring him into the League, but life drew him in another direction. <p>Lord Regent <b>Gray Hateborn</b><br>

But I'll be sayin that fer me,the &quot;high&quot; aspirations ain't all about &quot;what dragons can we slay today&quot;. Nah. It's things like &quot;what cities can we lay waste'. Kaladim. Felwithe. Ak'anon. Thurgardin. Ain't going ta be able t'build a mountain of skulls,but I ken build a pack fulla dwarf chops and gnome kabobs. An' feed da League Ogres fer a week!<br>

I'd pride myself on a suit of Royal Frosted Velium afore Umbral-cause I'd know it was built on a pile o' dead stinking earth pig dwarves.<br>

Plungin' the cities of light inta nightmares. That's what I'd love ta be doin when I'm a Reaver. Reaving.<br>
