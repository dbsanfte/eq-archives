the only noise was the sound of the young woman’s hum as she sat next to him. The druidess was lovely, a fitting representative of Tunare. Her long golden hair flowed down her back like silk and her eyes were as green as the forest. She looked up at her love, the man that had saved her from the humans that would have raped and most likely killed her. <br>
<br>
“Drae, what are you thinking about?” She asked him softly, leaning on his arm.<br>
<br>
“Hmm? Oh.” A soft smile crossed his lips as he watched her “I don’t know... “<br>
<br>
“You don’t know?”<br>
<br>
“No, I was just watching how the sun shines in your hair... its lovely”<br>
<br>
With a giggle common among girls her age she clung to his arm. The Teir’Dal could do no wrong in her eyes, he was as warm and pure as the forest it self. He was her savior and protector, her love.<br>
<br>
“Vera I need to get going soon. I need to work on my magic, and am quite sure your father is wondering where you are.” Draehan spoke with softness unnatural to him.<br>
<br>
“Will I see you again tomorrow?” <br>
<br>
“I would travel to the ends of the world just to see your beautiful eyes my dear.”<br>
<br>
                                  *                                     *                                          * <br>
<br>
“Did you see your “lover” today?” the necromancer spoke in a mocking voice, as she often did.<br>
<br>
Draehan walked irritably over to his desk, dropping his packs on the floor. <br>
<br>
“Yes, of course I did.”<br>
<br>
“Oh how cute, was your day in the forest enjoyable?” Romsca asked as she shot him a wide grin, knowing very well it annoyed the wizard.<br>
<br>
“It’s no matter... The longer she waits the more painful her death will be” He scowled, hating the game he was forced to play.<br>
<br>
“Her father has what I need, and the little whore will lead me right to him in time. I need to be patient or I could jeopardize everything” he hissed.<br>
<br>
Draehan sat down at his desk, happy to be free of the horrid forest. The guise was taxing on him, his time in the forest was torture and the druids love was poison. The only thought that could hold him strong was the pain the girl would feel for making him wait.<br>
<br>
“She will tell me, her worthless love will betray her and she will sacrifice her father to me... Love, such a pathetic emotion...” His mind ached as the thoughts crossed his mind.<br>
<br>
He did not know the length at which he would have to endure this self inflicted torture. He could only prey her love for him was strong enough to cloud her mind. <br>
<br>
“She will need her fathers consent to marry, she will lead me to him. She has to.”<br>
<br>
                          *                                              *                                        * <br>
<br>
The day in the deep forest was, as always, torture but today marked the end of Draehan's game. He had won; the girl had revealed the location of the small hut in the lesser faydark. Her father would not allow her to wed the Teir’Dal, she wanted him to meet her love so he could see for himself there love was real. He smiled and kissed her lightly before reading his gate.<br>
<br>
“Tonight my love ill meet you here. Don’t worry, we will be together, I promise you this.” He whispered to her.<br>
<br>
With a soft smile he pushed a strand of golden hair from her face. She beamed at him, kissing him once more before he could depart. Draehan backed away and finished the spell that would take him to New Tanaan and away from the horrid forest.<br>
<br>
He opened his eyes to the busy hustle and bustle of the plane, high elves and Trolls, Teir’Dal and humans in every direction. He hated this place, almost as much as the forests of Tunare, perhaps more. He would have rushed to free himself of the area had his mind not been elsewhere. Tonight he would get what he was looking forward to for weeks; he would hear the cries of his “love” as he betrayed her. Tonight would add another piece to the puzzle he hoped. The old ranger had dealings with his creator, what he did not know, but soon he would find out.<br>
<br>
                                        *                            *                       * <br>
“Are you ready?” The girl looked up at him nervously.<br>
<br>
“Of course I am. Come, let’s get going and get you home, it’s freezing out here.” <br>
<br>
The wizard offered his hand to her, barely containing his joy. Together they traveled to the little hut; the house was simple and easy to miss.  Crafted from wood the cabin was almost completely enshrouded in vines, nothing but a green mound in the forest. <br>
<br>
“Here is it. Do you want me to go in and warm him up first?” her voice wavered with nervousness.<br>
<br>
“No love, we will go in together.”<br>
<br>
The door opened easily, it was not locked. Draehan had to blink at the light form inside the cabin, his Teir’Dal eyes made for the darkness. He stepped in the small room behind the little druid.<br>
<br>
“Father? Are you home?” her voice seemed loud in the small room. <br>
<br>
“He is upstairs.” The human’s voice was easy to pick out, his accent thick.<br>
<br>
“Oh, I didn’t know you were here Arvane?” she spoke at him with a hint of disgust.<br>
<br>
“No I am here to pick up czome supplies for him.” <br>
<br>
The old ranger walked down the stairs hearing his daughter’s voice. His aged body not nearly as nimble as it once was. His eyes flared as he reached the bottom, just now having caught sight of the robed Teir’Dal standing in the doorway. <br>
<br>
“OUT!. I do NOT have Innoruuk scum in my house!” His voice was a twisted mixture of panic and anger.<br>
<br>
“Father! He is not like them, he is not of Innoruuk!” <br>
<br>
“I don’t care, he looks like one and I don’t want him here! Out scum!”<br>
<br>
Draehan watched him calmly, his panic only serving to reassure him of his success. This would be easer then he thought, it was obvious the old man was scared. Draehan closed the door behind him, placing a lock on the handle. <br>
<br>
“Your fathers right Vera, I should go.” His voice was dark as his intentions started to slip out.<br>
<br>
“What? You said you would talk to him!” She pleaded with him, her emotions clouding her mind when she should have seen the danger.<br>
<br>
“Who said I was going to leave?” He spoke in a hissing whisper, a grin forming on his face. “I have business to take care of before I go.”<br>
<br>
His hand shot out, grabbing her wrist fiercely pulling her only inches from his face. <br>
<br>
“You should have listened to daddy, little girl...” he snarled at her as his grip tightened painfully on her arm. <br>
<br>
The ranger instinctively lashed out at Draehan but his age had dulled his skill. The young wizard easily dodged the blow and with a short mumble of words fixed the old man to the floor. <br>
<br>
“Don’t even think about it. Your daughter was a fool; you must not have done a very good job raising her.” He taunted the helpless man. <br>
<br>
With a thrust he spun the Vera to face him. He pushed her back from him and swung his stave at her head like a bat, the hard wood crushing into her jaw. With a loud crunch she spun from the force of the blow, her jaw locked as blood dripped freely from the split in her lip. <br>
<br>
“We can’t have you gating away now can we little druid.” <br>
<br>
She tried to reply but no words would come, her mouth wouldn’t move, her jaw shattered. With a terrified muffle of a scream she crawled to the feet of the human. With wide eyes the human gazed at Draehan, this was new to him and he did not know how to react. Draehan turned his attention back to the ranger, who has since managed to free one foot, his face twisted in anger and hated for the vile Teir’Dal in his home. <br>
<br>
“You’ll die for this! By Tunare ill kill you!” His voice was reaching a scream.<br>
<br>
“No, you’ll die old man, and your daughter will see it happen.” Draehan spoke calmly.<br>
<br>
He fell to one knee at Draehan’s words; he knew he was too old, to out of practice. <br>
<br>
“Fine. You win. Please, take me. Leave my daughter alone, let her go. I’m begging you have mercy!” his voice was cracked with fear and loathing.<br>
<br>
“Oh, I’m not going to kill her old man. No, there are worse things then death in this realm.” <br>
<br>
The young girl was sobbing hysterically, her love was a fake, he used her and now she would pay. She curled up at the feet of Arvane, no where else to run, she was cornered. Draehan grabbed her by the arm harshly, dragging her to her feet and forcing her in a close by chair. He grinned at her wickedly, the terror and fear in her eyes only feeding his want to make her suffer.<br>
<br>
“Such pathetic creatures you are. Where is your Tunare now whore? Where is your goddess of life and love?” <br>
<br>
He pulled a long line of rope from one of his packs, binding her wrists and ankles and pushing the chair to the center of the room facing her still trapped father. <br>
<br>
“Now you shall see exactly why little girls should listen to here daddies... but first.”<br>
<br>
The young human backed away a step, as Draehan turned his gaze to him, he knew he was next. It only took one spell to send the unskilled man to his knees, the pain of the blast was immense. He screamed out in pain, the blast of lightning numbed his every limb making them useless to him as he crumpled to the floor. Draehan, once satisfied that any interruption was taken care of returned to the old man. <br>
<br>
“What shall I do to him first Vera? Should I cut out his tongue? Remove the flesh from his arms? Perhaps... “He trailed off has he pulled the stave back, a fierce swing.<br>
<br>
The blow landed on the side of the old mans knee, the kneecap shattering with a lout pop as the man crumpled to the floor in pain. Draehan was not done, not even close. He pulled the ranger back to his feet, forcing him to stand before him. The man whimpered in pain, the very touch of the wizard like a hot iron on his skin. He staggered a moment but managed to use his good leg to stand before the tormentor. <br>
<br>
“Well ranger, now we play a little game you and I. It goes like this, I ask you a question and you answer me. If you don’t answer I burn your lovely daughter, if you lie I burn your daughter, and if you try anything foolish, I’ll make you wish she were dead to escape the pain. Do you understand?” <br>
<br>
The man could not answer; fear had long since taken his voice. He nodded weakly, his eyes fixed on his only child. <br>
<br>
“ I-ill tell you what ever you want to know, by Tunare please leave her alone.” The old mans voice was soft and broken, all he could do to force back tears.<br>
<br>
“Good. Now tell me what you know of a man named Malories. “ <br>
<br>
“He...” he stuttered, he had not seen the man in many years. “ He was a customer, nothing more I swear it.” <br>
<br>
“A customer for what?”<br>
<br>
“I – I work with a rogue, we smuggled goods from the Faydark to Freeport... H-he wanted some rare stones. I sold them to him, that’s all.”<br>
<br>
“I see, and who is this rogue?” <br>
<br>
“He is dead; he died for years ago from sickness. T-that’s his son over there on the floor”<br>
<br>
“I see... This is all you know?!”<br>
<br>
“Yes I swear! The old wizard kept to himself, I never even saw him it was Helix that delivered the shipment!” <br>
 <br>
“And Helix is your former partner I take it.”<br>
<br>
“Y-yes please leave us alone, I swear it’s all I know...”<br>
<br>
“That’s a shame, it really is... I’m sorry old man, I can’t let you live. You see I was all set to find out more information then this and your just a worthless light elven smuggler.” He grins wickedly “well no, no I'm not sorry... this is going to be most injoyable...”<br>
<br>
Draehan turns from the ranger, running a hand over the girl’s cheek. She looked up at him, hoping there truly was a glimmer of love in his cold heart, that he may show her mercy. She tried to speak, tried to tell him how much she loved him in a desperate attempt to pull Tunare into his heart. She had always been taught love would prevail, it was stronger then all the hatred and fear and pain in the world. It was the last of such thoughts would cross her mind, Draehan backed up a pace. He lifted his hand, an orb of fire forming in his palm.<br>
<br>
“We shall see how lovely Tunare's creatures look after they are kissed by Fennin's flames.”<br>
<br>
The blast was off centered, it was meant to be. The searing heat made her skin blister and crack, the red muscle underneath showing though as blood seeped from the places the skin has retreated from her face and scalp. The sweet smell of burnt flesh and hair filled the room. The right side of the girls face was practically gone, only patches of hair remained on the left side of her scalp, her right eye had not survived the blast, the vitreous humor running down what remained of her cheek like a milky tear.<br>
<br>
