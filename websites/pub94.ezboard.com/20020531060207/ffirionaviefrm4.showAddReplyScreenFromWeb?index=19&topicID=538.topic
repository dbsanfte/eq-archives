he is in violation of PNP<br>
<br>
solution 2. go to the 1 of the 2 other orc camps that are withing 2 minutes of there.<br>
<br>
Personally I wipe out these camps every single time i run by them, as well as the new lego camp in neriak woods. It has nothing to do with faction it has to do with  you guys killed me.... hehe feel the pain.<br>
<br>
as to whether the 51 was warrented in his actions or not *shrug* as long as he gives them part of the camp he's not in violation of PnP and I find it hard to believe that with our population all of the local orc camps were taken.<br>
<br>
I can't stand to stay areound for the respan my self but *shrug*.<br>
<br>
Actually this is pretty sillly on the whole.

<br>
Secondly...  I will say I have been one of the offenders of this so called &quot;Farming&quot; of the orc camps in the past, but not to this situation.<br>
<br>
My story is...  I am an Iksar Shaman.  Being one of &quot;evil&quot; lieniage, I have few places to rest my weary bones on those long treks from my homeland, Cabilis.  So, one of the simple solutions is to become friendly with the residence of Freeport.  Also, part of epic quest involves traveling in this ilgotten place of the softskins.<br>
<br>
Personally, I just sit and slaughter the camp..  preferably the one to the west in West Commons.  No need for me to loot the carcasses..  I have no place to bank and the copper was/isn't worth my trouble to get off my arse and risk loosing my camp.  Besides, I figure the youngens could use the pennies to upgrade thier attire, and they can have all the belts to thier hearts content.<br>
<br>
Now then, I have come across quite a few youngens who were grateful at my scraps and were curious as to my doings.  Great conversations and I educated them in the why's &quot;a bear&quot; is slaugtering orcs, besides despising those orcs for ruining the softskins lands.  Some have asked if they could steal some of the perpitrators, I always reply, &quot;if you can snag one from my pet, you are more than welcome&quot; (I have a 1st level, 5pt nuke, for faction tag and buffs/heals work too.)  But the latter is so time consuming (PLing), when my pet can slaughter the camp in minutes and I have been here a week already (weigh those factors).<br>
<br>
Then again, I have run into those select few that would attempt to &quot;evict me&quot;.  If they come up to me and say, &quot; Exuse me, all the other camps are taken, may my group have this camp?&quot;  I would comply and sit on the sidelines.  Now, if they come up and say, &quot;Dood!  Your farming!  Get out!&quot;  Guess what?  And this has happened.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of the time I was doing my fourth shawl in EW, on a blue server...  When I was trying to trigger Tanik.  I had to zone from the Death Squads.  When I came back a druid had taken the middle of the ramp and claimed that he had the Tanik Camp and that I had no right to it.  I obviously saw he did not know what he was doing (because the spoiler gives wrong info).  So, I continued about my bussiness.  But, because he had a mob charmed, my pet kept looking at his pet.  Well, he got irate after I pulled a DS in his general direction after /shouting knowing he was threre (yes, I am still curtious, even to jerks).  He then goes off on those colorful discriptions about my lieniage and other forms of name calling.  Well, when his frustrations got the best of him and he decided to leave, guess who spawned?  Takes about nine DSes, FYI.  I have done that darned quest so many times now &lt;frown&gt;.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story...<br>
<br>
We did not design the game and we are not exploting any rules (faction farming).  If you feel the need to talk to someone about thier behaviour, talk to them, don't threaten nore become irrate.  I have as much time playing as you do, folks.<br>

Or is it just some dude like hogged all the phat deathfist belts.<br>
<br>
Too bad it wasn't me I would love to have seen how you would have asked about the camp  probabaly made a HUGE difference in the response.<br>
<br>
And yes deathfist slashed belts are great for power leveling.  If you take a dark elf you can get them up to 6 real quick and easy with wine quest and then with enough belts up to 15 or so within a few minutes.  Severe lack of skills but oh well. <p>Zsuzsana Dracul

However, orcs are about one of the slowest ways to fix faction with FP.  Smart faction fixers use Tumpy Tonics or (a bit slower) buy scalps from newbies in HPH.  Starting from scowly with a full pack of 160 tonics, Mo became non-KoS over all of FP and still has over 100 tonics in the bank.  Total time for this faction work?  About 2H.  Only an idiot farms belts for FP faction.<br>
<br>
On the camp issue, I feel like most, though.  Level doesn't matter.  If he's keeping the spawn down, the camp is his.  He owns it for as long as he cares to keep spawn down.  Whether or not it's worth owning is a separate issue.  PnP only applies to GMs.  PnP is the only viable way for GMs to settle disputes.  It's not what most players use.  <br>
<br>
Most players use FCFS on camps.  The unfortunate part about PnP is it permits KS'ers to call in a GM to KS a camp for them.  The bad part about FCFS is when players rotate in a group to keep a spawn exclusive after the originals have long gone.  For the most part, though, FCFS works a lot better than PnP, which is why the players use it.  KS'ing a camp, whether you do it yourself or with a GM is just plain rude, greedy, and shows no respect or concern for the effort put in by the group already camping. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>
