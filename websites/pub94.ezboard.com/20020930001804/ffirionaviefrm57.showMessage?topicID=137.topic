I turn onto hwy 40 drive, just got off work.  Al the crazed hippy from hell is right behind me in his blue ford pickup.  He dislikes the law about as much as I do.  A Town and Country cruiser makes a left in front of us at the light, then doubles back into our lane, right behind Al.  I look in my rearview and see him roll his eyes.  I already know what the deal is.<br>
...Get on the highway, I am doing the limit, the lights come on.  Al pulls over, cop passes him, gets behind me, I pull over.<br>
Cop comes to the window, &quot;Good morning.&quot;<br>
...Dave thinks &quot;It would be if I'd left work five minutes earlier, instead of sticking around to help out, and therefore crossing your path.&quot;  Dave says &quot;Hi.&quot;<br>
...Cop says &quot;Guess you know why I pulled you over.&quot;  Dave thinks &quot;Because you like brunettes?&quot;  Dave says, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
...Cop says, &quot;Why ya got expired plates?&quot; <br>
...Dave thinks &quot;Does it matter?  Do you CARE that I've had moving expenses, hospital bills, an ailing grandmother to spend tons of money on, a jackass for a lawyer that calls me drunk off his ass at 11pm to return my calls?&quot;  Dave says &quot;You know, same stuff, different day.&quot;  Not that I want sympathy and understanding from this buzz cut Mike Ditka lookalike.  I just want him to finish his business, not make small talk, and go get the next lucky contestant in the grand game.<br>
...And so on.  AFTER I get back on the road, he follows me.  I set the cruise control at 58.  After a minute, lights come on again.  I'm thinking what the f$%#?  <br>
...Cop comes back, hands me my license.  &quot;Sorry to ruin your day, man.  You forgot this.&quot;  Sorry to ruin my day?   *I* forgot this???  Arg!  Ack!  Why don't you just shoot me in the foot, jackass, it would be less painful than spending a moment more in your presence!  <br>
...My nominee for the SASOB award for the day,  Sgt.  Nells!<br>
Who seems to think its my duty to remind him to give me my license back, who is sorry that he had to ruin my day, who looks like Mike Ditka, which is a crime in itself!  Runner up for the SASOB of the day award, Al the crazed hippie from hell, who was snickering like a jackass as he drove past me and Sgt. Nells.  I KNOW WHERE YOU WORK, assbag!<br>
...To the folks in coffeetalk, thanks for sharing my pain.  Even though I hate coffee.  Could we change this to &quot;Orange juice and bagels&quot; talk, or maybe even &quot;Bud Light talk&quot;?  No?  Eh, oh well, pass the coffee.<br>

Dude, feel your pain, I got pulled over on my birthday one year.  I was on my motorcycle, and did a rolling stop at a stop sign.  I get pulled over by a motorcycle cop.  Saw, him as soon as I got on the main road, just went ahead and pulled over.  No use in putting off what I knew was gonna happen.<br>
<br>
Find out that I have warrants for my arrest, so now I getting to go to jail on my birthday instead of to werk.  They write up my tickets, ie running the stop sign, no inspection sticker, no registration, yada yada yada.... <br>
<br>
I git into the back of the cruiser, the cop puts my biking gear in the floor board in the front seat.  &quot;Hmmm, when is your birthday? Is this a DOT helmet?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dude, come on, today is my birthday, you can't possible be serious about writing me ANOTHER ticket for the helmet!&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Two speeding, but got let off with a warning.<br>
Three speeding, got tickets.<br>
One tailgating, got a ticket (it was an older couple doin 50 in the left lane on the highway, in case ya were wondering).<br>
<br>
Took all the tickets to court.<br>
<br>
Plea-bargained three down to half points &amp; fines.<br>
<br>
Plea-bargained one down to half points, and judge dropped the fines because I had to wait so long, and the cop who wrote the ticket was a jerk (judge was like &quot;It says here on your ticket you weren't happy about receiving the ticket&quot;, and I was like &quot;Not really&quot;, and the judge was like &quot;I wouldn't be either.&quot; and kinda smirked at the ticket like WTF kind of comment is that to put on a ticket?).<br>
<br>
Anyways, haven't had a ticket in six years or so since I drive the speed limit &amp; such now.  Which, coincidentally enough, is ever since I had to start paying for my own car insurance, hehe.<br>

It could have been worse.  He could have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> looked like Mike Ditka.<br>
<br>
Then it would have been unpleasant.<br>
