That is to expose Joe and all his dishonesty.  Ebaying, good or bad, doesn't give anyone the right to steal.  <br>
<br>
And personally I feel that this does involve Reso., directly (questionable knowledge of whether or not GL/officers knew of Joe's history) or indirectly (guilty by association).  Speaking for myself, I choose not to hang around people with questionable reputations because rumors fly...then the shadow of doubt of your character can build and so on.  (Weird how this applies to life is'nt it?)<br>
<br>
Just saying &quot;I / We are not getting involved&quot; does not remove you or your group from the publics eye on the issue.  What one does to handle people of questionable character can determine how people view you / your group as a person / whole.<br>
<br>
Also, I have known Zokof here and on Vazaelle and know what he has described is the truth.  We have spoken quite a bit about this issue and the facts he described in detail are correct and accurate.<br>

Not to make light of the situation, this can be a serious problem.  If what is said is true, then this person is very bad for this server.  No matter if you like ebay or not, this person (if the story is true) is ripping people off in REAL LIFE.  Of course, it will all boil down to a he said/she said thing, and will most likely fall on character reputation, which does not look so favorable at this point.<br>
<br>
I agree with Lorii that a guild is held accountable for it's members.  We also need to realize that they will be doing their own internal investigation of the situation, and not just throw said person out because the masses say so.  I wish them all the luck.  Not a postion I would like to be in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 737<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/02 9:59:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: All around lame</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;  Even if it was bad for Zokof to buy the account in the first place, nobody deserves to be ripped off  &gt;&gt;<br>

He ripped himself off by paying for something he had no right to buy.  Everything after that is just gravy.<br>

The simple fact is that when you sign on to EverQuest you EXPLICITLY agree to the EULA by choosing to hit Accept.  If you do so disingenuously you are a liar.

Who are you directing this at?  In case it is me I'll answer :-p<br>

My opinion of the topic?  It is /yawn.  Person A promised Person B that they would give them their account for money, even though both parties know it is against the rules.<br>
<br>
Person B later said screw it and apparently took the character Back, and kept the proceeds.<br>
<br>
The way I see it its the same as someone complaining because they got rooked playing 3 Card Monte.  Sure the hustler is 'wrong' but then again, the sucker is a sucker who screwed themselves.<br>
<br>
The only ray of light here was the the original poster, having had himself sold the account to yet a 3rd Party, has the personal honor to refund his client and eat the loss himself.

<br>
Well, there is some truth to that.  I don't think VI gives a crap about account selling.  By making the rules the way they did, they are simply trying to limit their own liability, and so that they don't have to deal with the CS issues.<br>
<br>
But if you want to bring the discussion to the level of 'Which rules are meant to be followed, and which are just there and its OK to break' is another issue entirely.<br>
<br>
I won't say I have never slipped a few miles over the posted MPH on the highway, but I won't complain that I got caught in a speed trap either.<br>
<br>
If you buy an EQ CD, and register an account, that account is recognized by VI as yours, and is non-transferrable.  Everyone knows that.  So if you 'sell' it to someone, as far as VI is concerned you violated the rules, and the punishment is having the account banned if you get caught.  The 'sale' itself is completely irrelevant.  I can offer to sell you Mars as well, but that doesn't mean its a legit sale if you give me money.<br>
<br>
Go to the Cops if you want to press charges for fraud / Con scheme but as far as the actual 'transaction' it is null and void.<br>

The only thing that comes to mind here is the good ol &quot;let he who hast no sin cast the first stone&quot; sorta thing.  I find it hard to beleive that you feel someone committing a transgression waives all rights.<br>
<br>
According to the letter of the EULA, you are not even allowed to share your account with a wife or friend.  You cannot give anyone else your password.  If I gave my wife my password to play, do I deserve to get ripped off?  If you are using the EULA as your justification of all things might and holy, then anyone who has shared a password with a friend or loved one is as evil as Zokof and Ogah.<br>
<br>
I'm still of the beleif that breaking a EULA doesn't give someone a green light to do anything against you other than Verant.  It is a contract with them, and what gives Ogah the right to punish for it?<br>

In the case of selling accounts, I'm not so much saying it's a bad idea because it volates the EULA, I'm saying it's a bad idea because you're just asking to get ripped off, and if playing the game is so painful you'd pay to avoid it, find a new game.<br>

The answer of course being &quot;no&quot;, but if you hadn't been buying fake ID's in the first place this wouldn't have happened to you, which kills people's sympathy.<br>
<br>
If you trip walking down the road and break a leg, people feel bad for you.  If you break into an amusement park at night, fall off the fence, and break your leg, they just call you a moron.<br>

The fake ID example's a really good one for this, as is Eliezer's drug sale example.  I want to extend both a little further.<br>
<br>
You get ripped off buying a fake ID, get caught at the club/bar, can't get in, get mad, and then decide to sue over it.  Remember, the original poster here has appealed to Verant on this.  No court would enforce your &quot;contract&quot; for a fake ID or for illegal drugs.  If you get scammed, you're just SOL (and not Shadows of Luclin).  In any legitimate contract, the duty of the court would be to restore everyone to the condition they were before the breach was made--but not if the subject of the contract was illegal in the first place.<br>
<br>
Also, Ridale said VI would have trouble enforcing the EULA because people deserve compensation for their work.  This is specious logic.  We're not VI employees--we don't deserve compensation for playing.  The EULA is a contractual agreement, and the terms of that contract are binding unless they are illegal in the state you live in or waive constitutional rights (and this particular term does not).  Even if the work-compensation model were appropriate, and it's not, the EULA would constitute part of the terms-of-employment agreement and still be binding.<br>
<br>
Why doesn't Verant enforce the EULA on this?  Because you can't squeeze blood from a turnip.  The people who are buying and selling accounts probably don't have very much, and Verant would have to prove damages, which would be small potatoes--maybe, at most, $300, although that's a stretch. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
In this case, the fake ID would have worked for a few months, and then the maker of the ID would have stolen it back from the buyer.  The buyer would have then gone to the police and given him all the info he had on the seller, and see if they could put an end to him selling that specific ID again.<br>
<br>
What I am seeking from Verant is a banning of the Nabiki account.  So it cannot be played, sold, or bought again.<br>

I was trying to point out that a person spending time has created something of value be it a high level character or an item that they acquired through their time put in to get said item.   I think they could legally argue that VI could not stop them for profiting for there time spent to create a thing of value.<br>
<br>
Again, I do not think EBAYing is something that one should do. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uridalestarwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ridale Starwind</A> at: 6/25/02 2:09:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukloeviseq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KloevisEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/02 2:15:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.cci.clarku.edu/ebarry/pix1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the peanut gallery says:</span><hr size=1> very bad form....sorry you got ripped off and others got screwed as a result of it, but as far as Ebaying, the saying goes....<br>

I'd have to agree with you on this one.  The Warrior thread is quite amusing as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 742<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/02 2:45:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: All around lame</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;  According to the letter of the EULA, you are not even allowed to share your account with a wife or friend. You cannot give anyone else your password. If I gave my wife my password to play, do I deserve to get ripped off? &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, but if your account gets banned that is what you 'deserve' - just like if I speed and get a speeding ticket.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  If you are using the EULA as your justification of all things might and holy, then anyone who has shared a password with a friend or loved one is as evil as Zokof and Ogah.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, but they did commit the same EULA violation.  However, Ogah took money as part of his.  Ogah basically 'welched' - If you and I have a friendly bet on the Superbowl and I lose and don't pay, you don't have any legal recourse because technically we are not allowed to bet on sports games.  Do you think if a Bookie gets busted by the Cops they go through his books and pay back everyone who gambled?  I see this as the same way.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  I'm still of the beleif that breaking a EULA doesn't give someone a green light to do anything against you other than Verant. It is a contract with them, and what gives Ogah the right to punish for it?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You are right, no one has the right to 'punish' but that is NOT what happened here.  No one has been punished unless the Account gets banned.  What happened was that one person paid for an illicit service and was conned.  It would be no different than if he gave money to a prostitute and got no sex, or won a bet and wasn't paid.  There is no recourse for these 'rip offs' because they are illicit to begin with.<br>

The buyer would have then gone to the police and given him all the info he had on the seller, and see if they could put an end to him selling that specific ID again  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Not quite, remember you are paying for a SERVICE.<br>
<br>
It would be more like I gave you my Health Club access, then a month later called them up and had them issue me a new Card and yours was no longer valid.<br>
<br>
The account wasn't 'stolen' back from you, because it can NEVER legally change hands, that person just decided to stop letting you use HIS account, even though he promised to let you use it in perpetuity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=885.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=885.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=885.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=885.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=885.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=885.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
