After 55 seasons on my current druid, I realized that I was bored out of my mind with being a druid and needed a change of pace.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I created a rogue and really enjoy the life of a melee character; granted he is only level 14 at the moment.  He is somewhat twinked and, accordingly, I have been able to level easily by soloing up to this point.  However, I know rogues are a grouping class and fully realize I will not level to 60 via soloing.  I really want to be able to learn more about the class.<br>
<br>
I am starting to realize that many of the sites that gave great information on druids (eqdruids and casterrealm) do not have similar information for rogues--or at least particularly helpful information.  I am just now able to duel wield but notice my primary piercer accounts for about 90% of the hits against mobs while my secondary slasher accounts for about 10% of the hits.  I hope that will improve as my duel wielding goes up.  At level 16, I get double attack and I understand that gives me a chance to hit twice as opposed to once per swing.  I have been told that, at later levels, I will want to have proficiency in 1hs for offhand and I have decided to use a 1hs in my secondary to keep that skill up.  To be honest, there are some other things I have no clue about:  making poisons, picking locks, sensing traps, instill fear, etc.<br>
<br>
My question is are there any helpful sites out there tailored to rogues and where one can read about rogue abilities, etc.?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

(edit: lol Kraz beat me to it.)<br>
<br>
I have a 44 Vah Shir rogue on a different server, and have some advice:<br>
<br>
1] Soloing becomes impossible really fast, simply due to the fact that you need access to a mobs back to backstab, and when you're soloing the mob faces you. End of story. Instill doubt is functionally useless in terms of fear kiting; for every time it works, there will be a number of times it doesnt. You'll end up dead a lot of those times.<br>
<br>
2] Strength is where its at baby. Id put any remaining points into stamina. This is because...<br>
<br>
3] ...as a rogue, your purpose in 99.9% of groups will be to do as much damage in as little time as you can.  Strength helps the most with that. Invest all of your resources into getting the best weapons you possibly can, because armor for rogues is a joke no matter what level or quality, so dont worry about it. You want a piercer with high damage (for backstabs) but a good damage/delay ratio (for overall damage) in your primary slot; I used a high damage 1hs in my secondary slot, simply because its easier to find high damage 1hs than it is to find high damage 1hp.<br>
<br>
4] Pick locks is useful 50+. You can use the doors in Befallen to practise your skill up, but beware: if you wait to do it all at once, even if you hotkey it, it will take you a LONG time to raise it. It took me 5 hours of *clickclickclick* to get my rogue from 1 to 194. I suggest renting a few movies and giving your wrist a rest every so often.<br>
<br>
5] LEARN TO AVOID AGGRO. *smiles* Evade is the &quot;hide&quot; skill when used in combat. Make a habit of using it *before* you aggro the mob onto you... It drops you on the hate list even if the mob hasnt turned on you yet; at higher levels, if you aggro mobs at all, you'll get mauled. As I mentioned earlier, rogue armor resembles saran wrap in a lot of ways...<br>
<br>
Thats my &quot;off-the-top-of-my-head&quot; advice. If you have any questions about anything, feel free to send me a tell in game.<br>

<br>
6] Make friends with Shadow Knights (if you're evil) or Paladins (if you're good). Both classes are the best taunters in the game (The Shadow Knights are the best, by far, but the Pallies run a nice 2nd). <br>
<br>
Being friendly with those guys and gals means that in groups, you will usually have a clean backside to backstab, all day long, and you're rarely, if ever, get hit. A good SK can keep the mob on them all day long, provided they know what they're doing. <br>

I don't know, but it seems that some people think they're exempt from the rules that VI imposed upon the game.

They fear animals and snare for kiting, and their attack buffs at high level will be a blast.   Woo woo!<br>
<br>
And my general advice:<br>
<br>
First off, rogues CAN solo.  It's just far less efficient than grouping for us.  Instill Doubt will be your best friend outdoors, once you learn to use it (hint, you can't backstab and ID at the same time).<br>
<br>
Two, agro is your friend.  Rogues have enourmous controll over it... you can evade to lose agro, beg and disarm and backstab to gain it.  Remember, you're not a tank, but you're not an int caster either.  You want to be just under the tanks on the agro list... it's better for the mob to be on you than the cleric, and you have the best evasion AC in the game.  Just keep that defense skill up.<br>
<br>
Three, usually one wants to put your points into stamina when creating the character, but then max strength until it's hitting 255 when buffed, then switch to AC and HP gear.  Keep your dex up too.<br>
<br>
Four, you won't do much damage early on, but as you level, you start to have more fun.  Backstab is a real blessing.<br>
<br>
Five, sneak and hide... learn them well.  They're nothing like Chamo.  They are way better.  Con everything while you sneak about, you're the masters of CR except in certain zones.<br>
<br>
Six, remember that rogues can do almost anything.  We CAN tank a bit, we can pull effectively, and we can do a lot more... just work with it!<br>

<br>
With all due respect... I found soloing a rogue to be one of the most time consuming undertakings possible in the game. Can it be done? Possibly, if you hunt the zone lines, have excellent equipment, and invest in a lot of sow potions. That requires a ton of money though, and its still a risky undertaking.<br>
<br>
My rogue had massive AC for a chain-class, did some tanking with groups in OT (ie, had defense maxed), and still got **mauled** by blues when I had to tank them face to face.<br>
<br>
For a variety of reasons. Instill Doubt isnt like a fear spell--it isnt reliable at all. When it doesnt work, you get mauled. When you get an add, you get mauled. The only snare you have access to is a proc off a specific weapon, so to fear kite alone you have to rely on the proc and the ID working in conjunction... If the fight gets ugly, you have no means of escape, unless you're sowed or at a zone. Plus, once the fight is over, you have no access to healing, beyond bandaids. <br>
<br>
So to summarize what I found: rogues struggle fighting face to face, cant escape quickly, cant deal with adds at all, cant consistently fear and/or snare on their own, and cant heal. Thats why I dont suggest soloing.<br>
<br>
Is it possible? I suppose. Anything is possible if you dont mind 20 minutes of downtime between fights, although at higher levels the experience loss from even a single unrezed death an evening might very well make it beyond pursuing.<br>
<br>
Is it advisable? Not from where I stand... If you dont believe me, try it and find out. I did. It hurt.<br>
<br>
But thats just me.<br>

<br>
&quot;Sadistik&quot; is obviously a play on &quot;sadistic&quot;, which cannot be a name no matter how many exotic drugs new parents are ingesting when trying to decide. It simply wouldn't be accepted by the public. You won't see Miss so-and-so, first grade teacher, asking a question about the brontosaurus, then saying, &quot;Yes, Sadistik?&quot; when the child raises his hand. Admittedly, this -is- a fantasy setting, and real life logic can't be applied to it in every case.<br>
<br>
I may be coming off as someone who is being excessively close-minded and/or negative in this situation, but I have this to say: How can you defend someone naming their character with a misspelled word? It violates the naming policy. That's it. That's all there is to it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uryaeldaggerfall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryael Daggerfall</A> at: 7/2/02 11:07:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 502<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/2/02 12:18:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2220.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryael Daggerfall</span><hr size=1> Do you even bother to read the replies?<br>

Just said it could be a title.  Ever see Silence of the Lambs?  Hannibal Lecter?  Buffalo Bill?  They're titles, not birth names.  Sadistik could be one of those.<br>
<br>
He could very well be just some OOC guy doing a play on words, but it could be a title as well, all I'm saying is you'll never find out if instead of asking you just run around screaming.<br>

<br>
I don't know you.  I have never had any interactions with you in-game and have no idea where this animosity is coming from.  From your posts, I can say that I am glad I have yet to meet you.  You seem to have 2 gripes against me: (1) the fact that I am twinked and (2) my name.  I will address each in turn.<br>
<br>
Lovely quote Ryael:<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice twinkage, champ. It doesn't make it any more forgivable if you admit to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Twinkage--Unless you have blinders on, you would realize from my post that I played my druid up to level 55.  As one might imagine, you would acquire decent gear along that process.  Lets assume that in your last month of playing, you have gotten pretty bored with playing your druid and wanted to try a different class out.  Are you saying that I should have simply deleted all of my hard-earned gear from Siman and started my rogue with my newbie tunic and dagger?  How many people do you know that reroll who do that?  I earned that gear and have every right to pass that on to another character I want to try out.  What gives you the right to judge me?  Every person that I know who has rerolled has transferred their gear from their prior character to their current character.  If you are upset at me for this, you are going to be upset at a lot of folks.  FYI, I am not seeking anyone's forgiveness for twinking Sadistik as I am not sorry in the slightest about transferring my gear over to him.<br>
<br>
Name--Sadistik.  I should first mention that you are getting way too worked up about this.  If my choice of a first name offends your roleplay sensibilities that much, I would suggest that it is your problem and not mine.  As to the origin of the name: I was very excited about creating a rogue.  I wanted a name that would try and match his in-game personality and would reflect the fact that he delighted in dishing out damage.  I chose the name Sadistik.  I am not sure whether it violates Verant's naming policy and if they asked me to change the name, I would have no problem with that.  My purpose was not to offend anyone.  This is a roleplaying server and I want to roleplay a rogue that enjoys dishing out damage.  I am not sure where the harm in that is.  Grow up Ryael and go find some real issues to worry about.  <br>
<br>
As for the other folks that had positive contributions to my thread, I appreciate the input.  I have visited the Safehouse site and have found it to be informative.<br>

&quot;Sadistik&quot; isn't an illegal name.  It becomes illegal if you take a surname that turns it into a phrase (ie: Sadistik Tendencies), but it's legal if he picks a fantasy-based last name (ie: Sadistik D'Valdor or Sadistik Darkblade etc).<br>

With the same weapon combination I'm running out of yellow bar pretty fast (haste and the heavy centi sword) and with sta lower than 100 you're taking penalties when you do. Of course your opponents at your level might not hold out long enough for you to find out, but it will soon be important if it isn't already.<br>

<br>
JBoots are a must, when ID doesn't work.  But against light blues and low dark blues, I can get it to fire about 1 in 3 times, which is a big help.  You don't need to snare with JBoots.  You do need great gear though.  <br>
<br>
Kedge, by the way, is a great place to solo, even though you can't fear.<br>

On an aside, I purchased some shissar fangs in the hope that I could put them in my ammo slot and that I would get stat increases from that.
