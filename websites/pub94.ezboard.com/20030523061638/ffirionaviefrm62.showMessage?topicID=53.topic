The area that I work in, and the buisness that I work for, has been suffering alot since that day. Our sales have droped, we have laid people off and everyone has taken cuts in salary and hours. <br>
<br>
Why? Because people are afraid to spend money. Not Joe Citizen, but Joe Company. Smaller companies. The companies that rely on big companies for buisness. <br>
<br>
Not to mention that gas prices are sky rocketing. <br>
<br>
I want there to be a resolution to this. Either we go to war or we dont. We have been standing on that edge for the past 2 months and its hurting everyone. If any of yall dont think that the indecision to not go to war or go to war hasnt hurt either your company or your parents, think again. Its hurting everyone in every tier of the work force. <br>
<br>
Ya, I support going and blow Saddam into tiny tiny little bits. I do this because I think Saddam is a threat. I think Saddam is a mad man. I think he should be dead. I also support the war because its good for the economy. It will lower my gas prices. It will make it so I dont have to worry about my job, my friends jobs or my family. <br>
<br>
I have said this a few times, but those of you who think that attacking Iraq will cause there to be more reason for terrorists to attack, your fooling yourselves. They want to kill every single one of us. No mercy, no remorse. If they could kill every person in the USA in a single momet, they would. They are heartless, fanatics. <br>
<br>
I once posted a rather hasty thread about people who do not support the war. Well, let me say this. I was watching MTV, not the most trusted news source I know, and they were interviewing 3 brothers who live in Iraq. They asked them questions bout music, movies and the like. Oh ya, they love American music. Back Street boys, Nsync and others. But when the reporter asked them if America deserved 9/11, they said yes. 3 kids, ages 8-15, said that America deserved to be attacked. <br>
<br>
I have no problem with people who question why the United States should go to war. I have no problem with people who are afraid for thier children. My problem is the people who live in the USA, have the government to thank for thier RIGHT to free speech, who dont really have to worry about food, water or cloths, who dont have to worry about disease or famine striking at any time, people who dont have to worry about some war lord from across the city gunning down people for no reason, people who have the RIGHT to do anything they want with in the law making anti-American statments and calling America a facist nation. There are only a few places you can live in this world and actually feel safe. Canada, England, France, Germany, Spain, Australia and America. If I missed any, sorry. I mean, how many countries have rallied and supported the womans movement? <br>
<br>
A question to all of yall who dont like America at the moment. What country steps in when another country needs help? Who provides food and medicine for those in need? Who is honestly trying to stop the bad guys from killing innocents? <br>
<br>
You may think that America is going to slaughter innocent people in the streets. That the soldiers are going to march into Iraq and just kill everyone. You are wrong. Those soliders that are going to do thier duty are just like you and me. Only thing is that they have the balls to put that uniform on and go risk thier life. Anyone who disrespects those soliders, C Pete, should be beaten with in a single inch of thier life. Those men AND women risk their lives to protect YOU. <br>
<br>
*sigh* <br>
<br>
Take for granted what you people have in this country. Thats fine. Its your right to. But just imagine what it would be like if you lived in Iraq, or Afganistan or any other country that doesnt belive in civil rights. <br>
<br>
Go ahead. Compare and contrast living in America to the majority of the world.<br>

Disrespecting soldiers should *never* happen.<br>

The reason the Iraqi kids said that is they don't know any better. They are taught, by government and family alike, that America is evil. They have no news sources that aren't stripped of any news that might be harmful to the perception of the Iraqi government, outside of whatever version of Freedom Radio is currently operating there.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, many people here in the good ole' USA will also believe everything our government tells us. But at least we have the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>capabillity</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of learning the truth of what's going on by simply reading.<br>
<br>
You're right about the economy. It won't recover until the war (or the threat of war) is gone. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Whistler</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

They had fresh water, electrical power and one of the regions best health care systems.<br>

Now they are back at people dieing from diphteria. (sp?)<br>
<br>
Their doctors can't read western medicine journals. They are not allowed to buy vaccines against some of the common diseases.<br>
<br>
That food &amp; medicine are exempt from the embargoes is a truth with a pretty severe twist to it.<br>
<br>
They can buy dentist chairs, but not compressors for them. (So drills don't work.)<br>
<br>
They can't buy plumbing supplies, as bombs require clean water. (So do people.)<br>
<br>
And they can't buy any form of telecommunication gear. Which led to the total and utter destruction of the slowly growing middle class.<br>
<br>
Take your own feelings about 9/11, multiply them by 333, and then wonder why they feel this way.<br>
<br>
(And yes, the Saddam regime is inefficient in distributing supplies, causing perhaps 10-25% of the problem. Various UN guesstimates. And yes, their media plays up this angle, just as most media in the western world downplays it.

New Zealand is also a marvelous place to live. (And probably the safest corner of the world.)<br>

Dear Original Poster,<br>
(and anyone else reading this I suppose)<br>
<br>
Your post seems to say that in America there are not many people in need! <br>
<br>
Are you aware that many of Americas's working poor have no health coverage and that the out of pocket cost of actually seeing a doctor for a disease which could kill you, (lets take cancer for example) would be out of range for many people? <br>
what choice does that leave them?<br>
<br>
How many homeless people have you seen in your lifetime?<br>
Do you think they are all just lazy drunks or addicts? have you ever taken time to listen to some of the stories told by these people about how they became homeless?<br>
<br>
Are you aware that there are homeless and hungry children in America whos family situations don't fit in the governments pre determined slots and so are unable to get any assistance of any kind? <br>
<br>
Many children are placed into foster care to help them, Are you aware the the Foster care system is often very scarry and not always better than the family the children were taken from to begin with?<br>
<br>
I do not hate America, I am simply * ignorant of anything else and in realizing my own * ignorance I must say that I can not stand up and say without doubt that America is the Most wonderful place in the world. <br>
<br>
I do know, from living here my entire life, that there are things I do disagree with, things that I do not approve of and things that I would love to see changed. (does that make me a Bad American?)<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean I feel the grass is greener but it does say I am an observant person who is able to use my own mind instead of buying in to propaganda wholeheartedly and pretending that I am not the <br>
* ignorant person that I am.<br>
<br>
No matter where I  live I would develop opinions and Ideas about the way my goverment was running things.<br>
why is that? because where I live and how I am living is important to me. <br>
<br>
You spoke of buisness problems and gas prices in America, if these are your biggest worries I am very happy for you. <br>

True, the soldiers won't do that.<br>
<br>
The 'intelligent' bombs will. And after 'blowing their country into bits', the hunger and medical supply scarcity will. The 'revenges' from shiites and kurds on the current ruling class will.<br>

Yes, I happen to own a small company and I know I am losing money everyday. But honestly, I can't blame Iraq, since so far they have been destroying weapons and have accepted all the UN inspectors requests. Ask your president to stop this 'War will be tomorrow and is inevitable' speech and all will be fine.

Since your post is rather long, I just will use that. I am not saying, anyplace, that America is perfect. Im not making the bold claim that is the The Most Wonderful Place on Earth. Yes, there are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>LOTS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of problems in the United States that need to be delt with, but those problems have always been around and they will never go away. Even during the lowest unemployment, there were still people on the streets. People who needed economic aid. But why, I have to ask, should I, or anyone else who works hard, foot the bill for those people who are unable or unwilling to work? I dont think its my responsibilty. I put in my hours, I bust my ass and I get paid for it. Yes, I give money to people on the streets because I feel sorry for them. But did you know that there are &quot;homeless&quot; people who make upwards of $100 a hour? <br>
<br>
America is one of the few countries in the world that steps into a bad place and trys to help. With money, food, medicine, supplies. Yes, we take care of other countries that need our help. They dont say thanks. They dont pay us back. We dont expect them to either. But the moment the United States does something like this Iraq situation, people across the entire world leap to thier feet in protest. All the good that America does is instantly forgoten.<br>

I dont want a longer vaction or a new car. Well I do but thats not why I want the US to go to war. Ech if you own your own company then you have put blood, sweat and tears into it. You want it to succed, hell you prolly need it to. The company I work for it the second largest water jet manufacturer in North America and we are fighting tooth and nail to stay open. The owners have sold thier house, cars and all most all of thier stocks to keep the company open. Its a small company, very family oriented. Only 15 people work for us across the US and Canada. I dont want to see it fail and no one else who works for us does. <br>
<br>
This war, if it happens or not, will help. It needs to happen or it doesnt. <br>

Anyone who is of that age really cant understand what happend on 9/11. I dont think they should be killed at all. No innocents deserve it. Soldiers, by the way, are not innocent. They put thier lives on the line. It just shocked me that someone that young would think that. Yes, its because the Iraq news service is terribly biased. I dont think many countries over there really like America. Shit, I know they dont. <br>
<br>
But let me ask this. Do you all think we should just walk away from it all and let Saddam murder folks? Let North Korea walk into South Korea and take them over? Do think it would help to walk away? I dont.<br>

Feed the homeless, visit widows on your free time, work to build a community and then kill a 13 year old. You are still a murderer.<br>
<br>
Off course this is hard to apply to nations, as all nations seem to go bat crazy with terrible frequency, and unfortunately all we can aim for is to do a bit more good than harm.<br>
<br>
Saddam has murdered very few people compared to the economic sanctions. He has killed a few thousand children, the economic sanctions have directly killed ONE MILLION CHILDREN.<br>
<br>
One million children have died due to the gulf war and the following sanctions. Fear of a single man has led the west (we are all collaborators, even if the US and Britain lead this tragedy) to kill a million children.<br>
<br>
Saddam has never been near the level of destruction that the last decade has caused in Iraq.<br>
<br>
It's mind boggling. It's huge. It's a tragedy that is so large it almost appears meaningless to the human mind.<br>
<br>
It's the second worst mass murder in the 20th century.<br>
<br>
Ridding the world of Saddam was not worth a million childrens lives. And more will die before this total insanity stops.<br>
<br>
And if Blix is wrong and the US is right and the man has nukes, tactical nukes especially, it's not going to be bloody pretty down there. A 25 kiloton dirty nuke is enough to take out a carrier group. Which would add yet another tragedy to a pile that is already so high it makes me sick to think about it.<br>
<br>
It's not worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=echtelionfv>EchtelionFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/11/03 3:11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sigh* you silly people</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But let me ask this.

This is pretty cynic if you take into account that you have been selling VX nerve gas and anthrax to him for a decade. Yes, even months after he did the onslaught of Kurds in the 88. And who was the president of the US back then? <br>
<br>
So is it right to put him out of power now?<br>
<br>
If you will do it with some magic words you know that will automatically put him out of existence, yes. With the idea mr. Bush has in mind: No thanks. <br>
<br>
Remember that France, Germany and Russia are not proposing to let him murder folks: they want to enforce the inspections. At least months, maybe forever.<br>
<br>
You seem to have a lot of faith on the future of Iraq after the war, Warden. Are you worried at all about the current murders and human right violations being made in Afghanistan? maybe you should attack them again, because that place is now the same hell it was. Some women can now show their faces, but the country has been completely destroyed and no one cares about the 'warlords' doing hideous crimes to the population. They live far, far worse now and I guess their problems have just started. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=577826">Echtelion HeavyHand</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Just so we're on the same page, we're talking about the guy who won a nobel prize, I believe it was, for his massive health reforms that saved so many lives?  The reforms that the US destroyed?<br>
<br>
Did he kill some of his own people?  Yes.  Is that a terrible thing?  Yes.  Is it also done by our allies?  Yes.  This man is a dictator in an unstable region... to have power there, you must be feared.  And he is.  And that's a terrible thing.  But with him gone, what will take his place?  Right now, a US puppet government... can we imagine the level of terrorism that will hit that area?  How many more Iraqis will die because of this?  How many US troops will need to occupy the region indefinitely?  How much will that cost in Tax dollars and human lives?<br>
<br>
Frankly, war to save lives is terribly rare... argueably WWII, and that's about all I can think of.<br>
<br>
This war is not about Saddam.  It is about territorial and resource gain, and I'm sorry, but I don't see it being worth the massive long term cost.<br>

<br>
<br>
Ok now I am usually a mellow person but this just aggravates the piss out of me.  <br>
<br>
Why you ask?<br>
<br>
Well I was in the navy I did a lot of things that would cause most Americans to have nightmares I can not divulge this information as I was on a submarine and that info would get me arrested.  But I spent my time putting my life on the line to protect people like you,  There were a few times I *KNEW* I was going to die.  Now While I was in the navy I contracted some *strange* virus that they had no explanation for.   After that my work performance decreased, I had problems concentrating I suffered from severe migraines. <br>
<br>
Eventually I got out of the navy, but that was just the beginning of my problems.  Since then I have fought with the government about my medical problems that have caused me to loose many jobs, Finally I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy.  A genetic sleep disorder that can cause you to actually fall into sleep at any time.  Some movies have brought this to light in a rather funny way but they are also close to the truth.<br>
<br>
Now the migraines were a side effect of trying to force myself to stay awake.  The strange virus I had whilst in the navy is what aggravated this I never had problems before that.  <br>
<br>
Now you sit here and say you do not feel you should have to spend your tax dollars to help me out some? well you know what? You owe me that courtesy as I put my life on the line to make sure you had a safe place to go home to.  I put my life on the line to see that you had a company or a job to work at and make money so you can vacation or whatever.  Now I can not even go to the doctor to get medication that helps me stay awake as it is way too expensive for me to pay for.  The medication alone is 300 to 600 dollars a month .. not to mention the specialist, yes I can not just go to a regular doctor I have to see a specialist, and the money they charge.<br>
<br>
The government will not admit that I have a problem,why ? because I was not diagnosed with this till 6 years after I was out of the navy.  <br>
<br>
So now I am out of a job, I am out of anything resembling a normal life because I decided to protect your ass and this is my thanks.   <br>
<br>
This is just one story of why some people cant work .  Take a look around you and see how your government treats those who went to war for them.  I am not saying all homeless or all disabled people are vets, but there are a good number of them out there.<br>
<br>
<br>
So before saying I don't feel I should help these people out (when they helped protect you) you should perhaps be a bit more caring of what others do for you.<br>
<br>

<br>
A) Have you ever been in the Welfare office of your local town? You will find that a good percentage of the people receiving Financial aid are either going to School so they can get off financial assistance and/or they are holding down *at least* 1 job that simply does not cover their basic costs of living.<br>
  (on average)  A single parent working a Full time Minimum wage job and paying for child care brings home about 1.50 an hour after taxes and Childcare Services are paid for. <br>
<br>
What to do with all the people who are unable to work due to physical and or mental disabilities?<br>
  Surely *you* shouldn't have to foot the bill. <br>
I certainly hope that you or someone you love never becomes disabled, if it does happen please do not seek assistance because, as you were kind enough to point out its not anyone else responsibility.<br>
<br>
B) you contradict yourself in the above statement.<br>
 You go from &quot;I don't think its my responsibility&quot; to &quot;I give homeless people money&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps you should try donating some of your time instead of your spare change?  <br>
 Changing those &quot;faceless masses&quot; into REAL people in your mind. <br>
People who could be YOU or your loved one if circumstances were different.<br>
<br>
There very well may be a few &quot;wealthy&quot; homeless persons, I seriously doubt you would find any of them sleeping at the shelter on a cold rainy night.<br>
 If you donated some of your time and energy instead of your spare change you might get a small glimpse of what could be your future.<br>
Of course this is where you emphatically state &quot;not me!&quot;<br>
<br>
There may very well be people on government aid that do not want or intend to do anything with themselves for the rest of their lives, however I will say that the system for aid is set up the be humiliating, frusterating and discouraging and does not provide a person with a great quality of life. therefore why anyone would willingly subject themselves to it unless it was NEEDED is beyond me.<br>
<br>
 You try living on what the government gives as Financial aid, holding a full time Min wage job and raising a child.<br>
<br>
Yes, I have had the shoe on both feet and I do know exactly what I am speeking about.<br>

Yes, and the sanctions worked like this:<br>
<br>
1) Iraq asks for a certain piece of equipment.<br>
<br>
2) Any permanent member of the security council can veto that equipment.<br>
<br>
3) It's delivered to Iraq for distribution. (National if in the southern part, UN led directly if in the northern.)<br>
<br>
Two members of the security council kept pumping vetoes on what Iraq could import. US and Britain.<br>
<br>
Things which were vetoed as too dangerous:<br>
<br>
Any medical journal. Even journals and articles about child health.<br>
<br>
Compressors for dentist chairs. (The dentist chairs themselves were allowed, without drills it's a bit unclear what a dentist is to do with his chair.)<br>
<br>
Key pieces for fresh water. (Pumps mainly, but also a bewildering array of plumbing tools.)<br>
<br>
Key pieces for electrical power grids.<br>
<br>
Many kinds of medicines. Especially many of the necessary vaccines.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's a shameful decade for all of the west. Those who helped little, or just stood silently by when this happened. <br>
<br>
But it's not strange that they feel american deserves it.<br>
<br>
Iraq isn't the home of terrorism, but alot of americans feel that the war against Iraq is a war against terrorism. Misperceptions and oversimplifications are strong on both sides.<br>
