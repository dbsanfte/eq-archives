Step right up an have a look!&quot; <br>
<br>
You're in the seedier part of the market when you hear a gruff voice making a racket off to the side. &quot;Thar she is, folks! She's na yer average flea-bitten tavern scum fer sale. No sirree! Trust ol' Mard when I tell ya this'un's finely bred. Looka those teeth---not a one missin'. &quot; The slaver, Mard, gestures dramatically and the Koada'dal's lips curl open, exposing perfect rows of small white teeth. Another dramatic wave of his hand and she closes her mouth and makes a small circuit of the platform for all to see. The simple homespun shift she wears, plain but clean, brushes at the tops of her bare feet as she comes to a stop in the center. Long, black waves hang loosely over her shoulders and down her back. Her compliance to the slaver's commands is a mysterious contrast to the dignified way in which she holds her head.<br>
<br>
Mard's eyes light up with pleasure as the crowd begins to gather.  A pipe hangs out of the side of his wide, wet mouth, and his belly spills out of a fine green velvet tunic---two sizes too small.  The slaver waves his hat as he paces the platform, causing its gaudy purple plume to quake excitedly. His close-set dark eyes peer into the crowd as he reaches out to gently caress the slave's hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;And tha hair! Aye, aye, go ahead---touch it. Ever felt silk so soft?&quot; A curious onlooker mounts the single stair to the platform and caresses a silky strand with an approving nod. Mard nods proudly, taking his pipe into his free hand as a smile splits his face. &quot;An' she's fit fer work, too. She may 'ave once been a pampered lady, but she's strong an' hardy an' smart enough ta be trained ta do just about anything. How d'ye control her, y'ask? Welp, see, this here bracelet,&quot; the slaver waggles his arm to reveal a tight silver band, &quot;is magickally connected ta that thar choker. Ya just keep this bracelet on ya and she's yours ta command! She can't lift a hand against ya nor can she run away without yer knowledge an' consent. An' ye can call'er back at will if ye've sent her on an errand and have need of 'er back sooner than expected.&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly Mard pauses dramatically, narrowing his eyes as he scans the crowd as if deciding whether to share take them into confidence. Finally, finding his audience worthy, he lowers his voice fractionally to say, &quot;An' dinnae ferget she's a healer too! Yup, that's right. A healer of at least 50 seasons, ta judge by'er spells! Her powers are yers ta command as long as ya wear this bracelet. An' as long as yer connected, she cannae use her powers against ya,&quot; another pause for dramatic effect, &quot;OR against yer will. Here... I'll show ya.&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly, fear flickers across the slave's proud face as Mard turns to her. &quot;Smite me, girl!&quot; he commands, and the slave, under his command, tries to comply---but instead doubles over, her hands clawing at her head. &quot;That's enough, lass... that's enough,&quot; Mard says immediately, unwilling to damage his merchandise, and the elf straightens, sweat trickling down her pale face, her eyes wet with tears.  Mard turns to the crowd, assessing them as he places his pipe back between his teeth.<br>
<br>
&quot;And one more thing... any harm that comes to ye while yer wearin' this bracelet she feels, so she can't be freed by some valiant paladin-like chap without harmin' her, too. The gnome who made this lil get-up really knew what he war doin. So, do w'have any buyers? The price'll be high, mind ye, but th'reward is great. I'm takin bids now, in a silent auction. Write yer bid down and place it in m'hat (sillypixii@hotmail.com). Serious offers only, as I know her worth an' ain't lettin her go cheap. She'll stay up here for y'all to look at fer half an hour more, then I'll take the bids an' announce the buyer on the morrow.&quot; Mard tosses his hat unceremoniously down onto the platform, and, leaving the slave on display, disappears into the doorway of the colorful cart behind him. <br>
<br>

<br>
Ok, here's the deal.  I'm at a roleplaying plateau right now, and I'd like to spice up my roleplay life a bit. Since I'm currently unguilded, this would be the time to do it, as my story won't affect anyone but me. So, if you are interested in having a level 50 high elf cleric as a &quot;slave,&quot; e-mail a roleplayed response to the storyline above with your character's &quot;bid&quot; to sillypixii@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
-No actual exchange of pp or coin of any kind will really take place. This is a roleplayed transaction only, so be creative with your bids  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->                I'm making my selection based on roleplay, not based on actual pp amount in a bank, so even if you have 1 copper to your name but you're an awesome roleplayer, I want to hear from you.<br>
<br>
-Since there are real life factors that may effect the ability of our characters to roleplay (different time zones, personality conflicts, level differentiation), I'm leaving the situation open to ooc cancellation by myself or the &quot;master&quot; or &quot;mistress&quot; at any time via a roleplayed outcome. <br>
<br>
-Please include level, class, and time zone in your e-mail so I can take these things into consideration when choosing Isharra's master or mistress. Even though the purpose of this is roleplay, I need to make sure that we will both be able to realistically roleplay in game, which means that we should be able to group and do other experience-earning things. Isharra will be there as your roleplay slave and personal healer but also for us both to continue playing EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->           <br>
<br>
-Since Mard would probably be selling Isharra in a place where morally unsound folks roam, the buyer has to have a roleplay reason to be there---i.e. no high elf paladins there to roleplay buying Isharra and setting her free immediately. That defeats the purpose of the entire story, which is to drum up some interesting roleplay, not end it in one out of game story. <br>
<br>
To prevent roleplay acts of heroism that would end the storyline too abruptly, the bracelet/choker has a few effects. First, it enables the bracelet wearer the ability to control Isharra's actions by thought alone. There is a mental link that compels Isharra to perform whatever is commanded by the bracelet wearer. Second, there is a physical link between the slave and master in that any harm done to the master can also harm the slave with just a thought from the master. That means that any aggression targeted at the &quot;master/mistress&quot; from would-be rescuers would affect Isharra as well, which prevents killing the master or mistress to set Isharra free. However, if the master/mistress is out hunting with Isharra and is about to die, he or she need only will that Isharra *not* share the pain so that Isharra is able to withstand the battle and resurrect the corpse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Note:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> While enslaved, Isharra will not be able to accept /tells that are in character. The bracelet and choker combination blocks her from everyone's telepathic radar whenever the master/mistress sees fit. So, she won't be able to respond in characterly to reveal her whereabouts or cry for help. I'll of course chat with anyone OOCly, but IC, you will get no response unless you are someone to whom the master or mistress would expect Isharra to respond. Thus, the only time you can actually physically roleplay with Isharra is when you are standing right next to her, and even then, her responses are based in large part upon what the master/mistress allows. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>              Please e-mail responses to me; don't post here.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I don't want a roleplay p*ssing contest to occur here on the boards where people might get their feelings hurt. I'll eventually post the story of Isharra's purchase, with permission from the master or mistress who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Other arrangements will be worked out between players once I choose Isharra's master or mistress. <br>

There must already be a party gathering to rescue this noble elf.  The disappearance of a high elf never goes unnoticed.  I must try to contanct them and discuss any further ideas.

If ever the key to breaking the enchantment is to be found, the time would be decided between both Isharra's owner and myself OOCly, and then I'll give the go ahead for anyone who really wants to participate in the rescue to assemble. But it's certainly going to take more than a few days.
