<br>
What is the general consensus of the server? Meaning what Velious Faction are you or your guild on?  My regular hunting partner and I are trying to decide what faction to be on and we both would like to be on Dragon Faction. We think it would be different and fun from our other characters who have spent their lives on Coldain faction. <br>
<br>
It would also be helpful to know which guilds are on what as well because at some point, I would like to join a guild that not only stands for the things that we stand for (i.e. EVIL) but also is on the same Velious faction.  <p><p align="center"><img src="http://www.antique-index.com/photostore/totf/barritt.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/barrittahl" target="_blank">Barritt's Adventures</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhavingaidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhavin Gaidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/02 10:34:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faction question</span><hr size=1> Well.. for one, if you go Pro Dragon, you dont have to destroy Coldain, and its really even for the server, as it is on most. there isint really a wrong way to go..<br>
But id stick to keeping the coldain happy, because there are only a few guilds on this server who can get the dragon/giant armor drops... i think ^_^ <p>

But for Gameplay considerations, here is my opinion:<br>
<br>
Coldain Faction:  You don't HAVE to hurt this faction at all, although it helps to raise Giant Faction if that is the way you are going.  The Quest armor here is the 'easiest' of the three to obtain, requiring you to fight in Kael Drakkel for drops, however it is also the least 'potent' of the quest armors, on par with the drops from Plane of Growth.  So if you are evil and do PoG, Coldain may or may not appeal to you, I chalk this one up to RP value, as well as for Good/Neutrals who don't want to fight in PoG and who are independent or too far removed from ToV.<br>
<br>
Giant Faction:  A tough faction to be on, as the easiest way is to become enemies with BOTH Coldain and Dragons.  They do have some decent quests though, but Kael as a supply city is far less 'stocked' than Thurgadin.  The Quest armor is better than PoG/Thurg, with the best AC of the bunch, and is often considered the best faction for Melee Armor.  However, to get the drops for the armor requires you to fight in the Temple of Veeshan - No easy feat for the person without a VERY strong Guild affiliation.  Also, to raise King Tormax faction (to do the quests without this faction is tricky) requires hunting the Royals in Icewell Keep or doing some very tedious faction work.  One bonus is the ability to hunt the Dragons of the West Wastes, which is both fun and they have decent stuff.  One drawback is difficulty using the WL Portal and moving through SS to CS.<br>
<br>
Dragon Faction:  Its armor is at least equal to Kael, but people will always have a personal preference.  Less AC usually, but somewhat better stats for the Caster/Priest classes.  One benefit is that it doesn't require harming Coldian faction at all.  On the minus side you can't Hunt in WW, but then again, you can move through WW to ToV that much easier.  But to get the armor drops you must fight in the Halls of Testing in ToV - Againm no mean feat by any stretch.<br>
<br>
So, my suggestion would be to first of all, go with what your Roleplay story requires, and secondly, take an honest look at your capabilities and Guild capabilities, and plan accordingly.  Although the Public Raid system has been working well here, I am not sure if you will have Public ToV in the near future.  E'ci server, a very old one with a strong history of Public Raids, has only just started Public ToV in the last few months.  And even then, any Public ToV is likely to be 55+ with 55 being a Lowbie :-p  So if you aren't in the game to level like a fiend, might want to go for Thurg/PoG armor and then see what the future holds.  Virtually any of these factions is fixable, albeit difficult. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udivadnothsa101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>divadnothsa101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/02 7:25:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faction question</span><hr size=1> add a few points..<br>
<br>
TOV isnt too hard in the HOT  area reative to the Wtov ( kael armor drakes and wurms).<br>
<br>
You can do HOT with 18 - 25 players nicely.<br>
You are best to do Wtov with 30+.<br>
<br>
So if you have a small group of high levels ( 55+ ) you can easyly equip yourself with Skyshine armor.<br>
<br>
Also it doesnt hunt to have alts or have delgated players to do the armor turn ins. That way they can get some nice faction hits with the bosses of Veliuos. ( given that fact the wont hunt it again)<br>

That is, unless you never want to go to West or North ToV and you never want to go to Sleeper's Tomb (yeah, you could do Zlandicar exclusively, but you won't key up this millenium).<br>
<br>
You can do HoT with one group of 60s if you're light on people.  Very easy to single pull and the mobs are mostly blue con.  The most common faction scenario is pro-dwarf first (kael hunting), then pro-dragon, (HoT hunting), then FFA on faction as you hit WToV, Kael (Vindi/Statue), Dain, and the ST key dragons, which defaults to pro-giant.<br>
<br>
If you box yourself in with RP constraints like &quot;I won't kill a dwarf, I am a dwarf!&quot;, you cut yourself off from a potential raid.  What raids you do are determined mostly by what is up at the moment.  Even on a very lightly populated server, it's common for every single raid-level MoB to be dead on any given day.  Toss in RP constraints, which are probably different for every person in the guild, and you will most likely never kill anything. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

LOL!  You DO realize this is the RP Preferred server, right?<br>
<br>
I mean, I don't care if you or anyone else plans on killing everything that moves and doesn't care about RP, but to assume that this server will 'default' to just 'Blue Raid/Kill' is sad if it turns out to be true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umosushi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mosushi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/26/02 3:54:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I didn't say it was bad ..</span><hr size=1> .. just pointed out that you have a choice between RP'ing and killing at the high level.  If you are playing the high level game, I'd give odds that given the choice between RP and kill, you'd choose kill.  IMHO, RP is all about the social interaction between players and the rest of the game is about killing.  I think that if you're not killing things, there's no point in playing EQ.  So what?  Having fun is what matters.  Others play the game as a pure social interaction and could care less about killing (eg. trade skills, bar maid, etc.).<br>
<br>
There are two points here.  One is if you want to kill, you're not going to be able to kill if you have a guild of individuals dead set on their own peculiar faction loves.  Join a guild with others of a similar mind-set or you're not going to be a happy camper.<br>
<br>
The other point is that if you want to kill in WToV, NToV, ST, or other high level zones, you MUST gear up your members.  Doing that means killing pretty much everything that is spawned and you are capable of killing or you'll gear up so slowly that you'll never get anywhere.  If you don't care about hunting these zones, then don't worry about it.  There are tons of people on FV that play here just to get away from the end-game on other servers. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

<br>
On the contrary, RP is all about the social interaction between CHARACTERS, and the rest of the game is about killing.<br>
<br>
There is a huge difference there.<br>
<br>
On any normal server, you are correct that the game is about PLAYER interaction - That is why Paladins help Shadow Knights on their Epic Quests and vice versa.  Because it is about the Players coming together to help each other.<br>
<br>
Who cares if Groo Foesmasher is a Dwarf Paladin and Dain Frostreaver IV is his kin?  All that really matters on a Blue Server is that PCs are people and stick together, and NPCs are just 'mobs' - The fact that their 'skin' has a similar appearance to some PC races is largely irrelevant.<br>
<br>
What I hoped for on Firiona Vie, and found - in at least much larger quantity that other servers - were people who were willing to treat NPCs and PCs alike - It isn't an 'us Players against them Mobs' mentality, but rather, who would my character be allied with? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 660<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 9:33:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2190.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I didn't say it was bad ..</span><hr size=1> I think a majority of the people with that &quot;what would my character do&quot; attitude haven't reached the uber levels yet. Not saying there are none, but it takes far more time to level up as a devout paladin of Brell and loyal citizen of Kaladim than it does to level up as a player in search of the best stuff and most productive mobs for a warrior/cleric hybrid.<br>
<br>
There are more shortcuts available if you play the game as a pure PvE levelling race than if you play it as an RPG.<br>
