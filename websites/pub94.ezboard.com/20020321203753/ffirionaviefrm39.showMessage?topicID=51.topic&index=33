&quot;fyi I 'could' help with nagafen, as I have before on other servers as a 53+ cleric. a 60 wiz with alot of 'aa' could damn near drop nagafen now, as long as there are some tanks to hold the aggro while he walks in the room.<br>

btw not capitalizing and writing the way you speak is a style of prose. perhaps in your infinate knowledge you could enlighten us as to the name of it. kthxla~<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

 You cannot even cast a spell in Naggy's lair if you are 53+, never have been able to, never will. Same with Vox. Heagan please. Go away. Your a babbling idiot who continually tries to get me to get in a who is bigger contest, but it's clear you don't even belong in the competition.<br>
<br>
 To those who wish to join us, if you are level 53 or higher, you will have to kill yourself before the raid till you are 52. We will rez you acordinglly after Naggy falls <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yea Heagan... Its k thx la~, I would call you a newb.. but your doing a good job proving it yourself.<br>
<br>
and fyi. Naggy and Vox are Uber.. I'd venture to say that 75% of all raids on them are a failure as many have the slightest clue what to do. Kinda like you and your 53+ tales, thats all they are.. Tales of a babbling idiot.<br>

<br>
Not that I am wondering why just an interesting observation.  The last time I saw anyone like this on the boards (and they weren't 1/2 as bad as Heagan) it was Fuvi.  Fuvi gets banned (even though I disagreed with him I didn't think he deserved getting banned) and Heagan gets praised.  <br>

<br>
and as to my '60 wizard with lots of aa' reference, yes that wiz would be banished as soon as he landed one nuke, but how much damage would that one nuke potentially do? 2 or 3 k is very realistic, but would you dare say 10k? twice that? more? you bet. <br>
<br>
the kthxla was sarcasm directed at the 'uber heagan' comments, as it has been in past threads with similar dumb context.<br>
<br>
so, you point at certain references, like you have selective hearing. my original beef was with claiming dragon loot while hosting an 'open raid'. It's an 'open raid' because your guild can't do it on their own. oog saw some wisdom in those words and revised his original post. plus you still haven't answered my question about the hundreds of guilds who have hosted open dragon raids over the last 2 and a half years, who don't claim dragon loot, or why they don't.<br>
<br>
look, if you were truely as leet as you claim to be, with all this 'well ' I ' was in the guild that first legitimately woke sleeper', honestly you wouldn't screw with nagafen or vox. you wouldn't say that high level guilds only require 'leveling' as you would know it requires teamwork, dedication, practice, patience for trial and error... all of these things were mysteriously overlooked. or maybe you have no darn clue what you're talking about. it's like your some jealous part timer trying to down the full time players. THAT's why I called you a liar. swallow it.<br>
<br>
maybe you played on test server for a while, where things are rigged by the gm's for trial and error. hell, when SZ was in test every level 2 and his cousin were bumped to 25 in a matter of hours. &lt;just as an illustrated example, similar goings-on happened on test over the years&gt; or maybe you read safehouse, or maybe you have friends who accomplish alot, well that hardly qualifies you to proclaim your leetness. <br>
<br>
yeh, I'll have to go with my original understanding, more than before even, that you are some greedy, bull sh**ing quasi newbs who whine like bitches when your hand is called.<br>
<br>
well, I do hope you kill a dragon, really. probably more for your 'guests' ' sake, than your own, but still.<br>

Go, have fun, learn how to kill a dragon or teach folks how to kill depending on your background, and then relax over it.  Default something or nothing or everything.  It won't matter in the long run.<br>
<br>
If you want dragon haste bad, level up to 55, get 2 groups of 55+ together and go kill the fish in CS.  He spawns a lot and drops CoCW so often, it's trivial to outfit all your guilds melee classes with dragon haste.  This is not directed at CA, but at those saying the only reason to go is to get a CoF.<br>
<br>
Oh, and while I'm here, y'all missed listing a class default for the gloves of flaming might (ya know, the ones Heagan wears to type his posts with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  On old server they were considered a pure monk item, but they're nice for rogues, too.

We will be providing any resist jewelry necessary.   We will be providing the peridots necessary.  We will be porting all of the folks there that can't get ports themselves or are too lazy.  We will be taking our time, our money, to make sure this raid is successful, and when it comes time for vox, we'll be doing the same.  I also said there would be more &quot;open&quot; raids in the future.  But, ya know what, I didn't feel like having to deal with a huge flame war over one piece of loot, so I retracted that.  And the part about us claiming to have done stuff like awaken sleeper, etc.. I never did it.. I hated old economy servers(Rathe was one of the initial 10 or 12 that came up when EQ went live).. But I did log on to talk to my friends there, hence me knowing that Kareem was a part of that event.  And honestly Heagen, if you claim to not to be as &quot;uber&quot; as you said you were, why would you have decided to openly flame me, when I gave an email addy for &quot;questions/comments/flames&quot; in my intital post regarding loot rules?  Oh, because your all mighty self can say whatever you please, and not have any consequences for your actions maybe?  Heagen, please do us all a favor, reach down between your legs.. grab your shoulders, and pull your lodged head out of your arse, it's really sickening, and even more so annoying.<br>
