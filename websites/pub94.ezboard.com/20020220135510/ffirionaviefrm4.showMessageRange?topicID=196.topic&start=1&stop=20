I'm helping a friend camp the fingerbone skelly in Kurns for the shackle quest. While we're at it we're killing the ph for the undead jester. A couple of hours into our so far fruitless camp Dromel and Braxom, of Winds of Destiny, come on the scene. I ask Dromel if they are just passing through, and below is the text of the ensuing conversation:<br>
<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'No we are camping the undead jeste'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Ahhh'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'You do realize that's what I've been doing?'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Good for you'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Wow, I haven't run across folk like this yet'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Like what?'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Camp jumping and such'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Dromel, would you refer me to an officer in your guild?'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Yeah talk to Braxom'<br>
Braxom is an officer of Winds of Destiny<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'He don't speak elvish to well though'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'no doubt'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Well everyone speaks Elvish on the boards'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'If your expecting me to jump up and leave after making the trip here your daft. And btw there are no recognized camps on this server. So if you find him first more power to ya. But if we do to bad.'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'As you wish. It is probably yo much of me to expect honor from everyone'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Still, guilds generally insist honor from their members. I'll find out if Winds folows that path as well'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Go ahead its not gonna help you any'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Do it see how much it help'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'I cam here fully expecting to be here for A LONG time im not just leaving cause some disrespectfull upstart wants to start crap with me'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'I don't need the help in that regard sir paladin. I beleive you are the ones that suffer'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Paldins dont dual weild moron im a warrior'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Ahh so you are. That would explain little though. Even warriors are prone to respect others'<br>
Dromel says, in Elvish, 'Depends on your alignment really'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'No, depends on the player, really'<br>
<br>
Now please draw your own conclusions. Personally, I find this basic lack of player respect to be the worst part of any multi-player game. Not to mention, when you bully your way through a blue server, you're pretty much announcing yourself as a pussy. Since Braxom is an officer in Winds of Destiny, I might conclude that Winds of Destiny as a guild sanctions this sort of disrespectful attitude and offensive play style. I do extend the benefit of the doubt though, as many guilds are simply grabbing all the players they can right now as part of thier building process. If that's the case, WoD you got some weeding to do. I'm interested in hearing from WoD on this matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 10:58:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> i like how you brought this up, although, have you spoken to anyone in their guild yet? have you posted on their site? if so a link to their site would be nice. personally i dont know any guilds' sites other than the 2 i have been in on FV <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The jester is a random pop on one floor right ? So just like the AC in SRO it's pretty hard to claim that you have an entire floor or someone killing a random mob on that floor is violating your rights. Camp jumping usually is taking an area that is being pulled. If you where clearing the entire floor then i could see an issue but most likely you where clearing an area with alot of PH in it. Looks like you told someone you had an entire floor of a dungeon to your self and for them to go away, and leave the random spawn to you. Effectively you'd be shouting in LOIO don't kill any sarnak casters because i'm camping the PhaT L3wTz. I could be wrong on that but I'm pretty sure that he's a random floor pop.<br>
<br>
If the joker is a static spawn and he was planning on KS'ing you and did so I could see a reason to be upset. Neither one of you looked like you were being cordial to each other.<br>
Also is that the log or did you just make it up? Doesn't really look like a log to me. <br>

Even I have seen a little bit of immaturity myself. I dont have the logs but here is a little bit of my story of 2 nameless ( since I cant remember there exact names) but from the guild Norraths Soldiers of Chaos.<br>
<br>
A necromancer and a enchanter were camping the 4 spawn Skeleton ruins right by the EC/NEK Forest zone happily for over an hour. Then all of a sudden 2 melee types run in and announce their presence and say to the 2 that have been there without even asking them anything other then Hail = That Dont worry we are only here for a little bit we need some bonechips.<br>
<br>
Well I really didnt expect this and was waiting for next spawn of course to my surprise it popped and then jumped it with quick haste. I asked that it wasnt right to to barge in on others especially with such rashness and please refrain from taking the camp. They didnt care since they had conned the chanter and realized she was blue to them and they didnt con the necromancer.<br>
<br>
The necromancer Then asked for them to not interfer with the camping of the skeletons. They gave another like you matter to us attitude.<br>
<br>
Well now what these 2 little fellows didnt realize is that the necromancer was lvl 42 and didnt have a pet but now made one.<br>
<br>
Then necromancer was assisting the enchanter gain exp and training while gaining bonechips.The necromancer pet then proceeded to slaughter all the skeletons as soon as they spawned ripping them apart and stopping the 2 ruffions from gaining anything for all the trouble they causing.<br>
<br>
Well after a round of this the flaming began of You bitch and watch your back whore you will get yours. After a few cuss words I announced anymore of this and the GMs will be let known of the incident and the 2 finally left.<br>
<br>
I will try to remember their names I kinda forgot about this but should post these 2's names for others to be warned of their uncaring for anything but themselves.<br>

I suppose roleplaying (to some) equivalates into good folks stepping all over evil races and vice versa. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It was I who enlisted Glail's aid in camping the fingered skellie for my husband's (Zarsiss) shackles quest while I was hoping to get a nicer 1HB for myself. The jester does spawn in the same place, I've seen him there half a dozen times while in Kurn's with no IBC to call my own as yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
At any rate, if roleplaying overrides common courtesy and respect, then so be it Dromel and Braxom... however, I... even as a follower of CT... will not hide behind roleplaying to walk all over the appropriate level players hunting the stable area or any other dungeon. While I could portray evil as the  lizard that I am I'd prefer my reputation remains intact as a fair EQ gamer willing to assist and be kindly to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> people</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> behind the toons..<br>

I agree with Xarshul completely, as that exact thing has happened to my sister and I on several occasions. I'm really not concerned with who needs bone chips for whatever reason, as bone chips drop from mobs from 1 - 60. So the simple fact that you, poor necromancer or shadow knight, have run out of the reagent you need to cast a scrawny little friend, is not my problem. If I am experience hunting a spawn site, and you want to pharm, go away. Same thing with the vile humans and the orc camps in East Commons.

<br>
1. I abide by Verant's PnP on every server on which I play. <br>
<br>
2. When my character belongs to a guild, then that character abides by the rules of that particular guild. Should I take issue with the rules of my guild, and should attempts to change within the system fail, then I leave that guild. I would not remain in a guild and willfully defy its policies.<br>
<br>
3. Aside from those two policies, I am free to play the way I see fit. I feel no compunction whatsoever to abide by YOUR idea of what &quot;EverQuest Etiquette&quot; is.<br>
<br>
4. I play a cleric on FV. Who is all of 13. So much for my &quot;necro pharming.&quot;<br>
<br>
5. I role-play just as much on any server I play on. I choose to play on FV in the hopes that other people will role-play here, too, not because I plan to role-play any more or less here than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I agree with you, however, that role-play is not a valid excuse for for impinging on another's playing experience.<br>
<br>
6. I play on several different servers, with different rule-sets. One thing which I have learned, and which you evidently have not, is that &quot;EverQuest Etiquette&quot; varies from place to place and person to person.<br>
<br>
It's quite juvenile of you to assume that YOUR idea of &quot;EverQuest etiquette&quot; is The One True Way. Everyone knows EverQuest Etiquette, indeed! <br>
<br>
7. &quot;I don't care who you are, why you exist, or why you think you have ANY right to walk up to my perfectly timed orc spawn and ruin it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, that's your problem exactly, Roawen.  You don't know, and you don't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimwyrd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimwyrd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 4:36:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure which attitude is more rude. The &quot;it's mine and you can't have it&quot; attitude, or the &quot;tough luck, I'm taking it&quot; attitude. Verant's policy is very simple. If two people want the same monster, they have to share. Peroid. Not sure where the complication is. And it seems like a very reasonable compromise.<br>
<br>
In the case of the skeletal jester in Kurn's, the proper PNP solution is as follows: when the new person showed up, he should have asked if the jester was camped, if it was he should have let the person already there take next jester spawn, then he should have gotten the one after that, and they should have taken turns like reasonable adults.<br>
<br>
That way one person can't hog a spawn, and another person can't simply evict you from where you're hunting. It's called &quot;compromise&quot; and it's the polite way to go. Is this horribly tedious? Yes. I've camped that spawn, and you can go several hours without seeing a jester, let alone getting a club. It's rude to jump someone's camp AND it's rude not to share a camp.<br>
<br>
Of course, this game has many rude people and that ideal is rarely met. Quite often, someone just comes and takes the camp without talking first, which results in defensive behavior and a quarrel.<br>
<br>
I think Xarshul's story is an obvious case of rudeness on BOTH sides. Was it rude for people in need of bonechips to interrupt your power-leveling? Yes. Was it rude for you to not allow them to share? Yes. Here's a thought, try being nice to each other and take turns. Even if that means you have to be the grown-up and initiate the niceness and sharing.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm a sucker, but if I was a 42nd level necro PLing a young chanter, and a couple people came up and said they needed some bone chips, I would have reacted like this. &quot;/say OK, we'll gladly share with you. Feel free to take the next skeleton and we'll alternate.&quot; or perhaps &quot;/say I have a bunch of bone chips, how about I give you some, so that my friend and I can continue hunting the skeletons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or you can just wipe them out with your 40-something pet and make sure nobody wins...but that seems petty and childish to me (and a clear violation of the PNP requirement of sharing spawns). If you had actually tried to share with the newcomers and they KSed you, then I'd have sympathy for you. But you didn't even give them a chance to share. They were rude for jumping your camp, and you were rude for not sharing. Sounds like neither group played nice. <p>Grimwyrd Storm<BR>

<br>
The only time I actually ever had anyone demand to share a camp was on another server. I had cleared the king room in Permafrost, had all the timing down, and a group came in and wanted their turn. So, to be fair, I said we would share the camp, but that they had to wait til everything respawned, then they could have their turn clearing the whole thing, then I would do the same, and so on. (Yes, I still got experience from at least many of those monsters, though not the weakest.)<br>
<br>
Well, they *couldn't* clear that room themselves. They wanted to reap the benefits of my having done so first. Note that they didn't ask. I had been ready to leave and would have gladly turned the camp over to them and stayed a round to make sure they had it under control if they had even pretended to be polite. But since they DEMANDED rather than make any attempt at politeness, well, I didn't see any reason to be considerate myself, so I decided NOT to leave. Consideration begets consideration. In any case, it was a greay area of the PvP, so I had called a GM myself and he agreed with me, that a complete fresh clearing of the area for each group was reasonable. Since they couldn't handle what they wanted without me having made it easy for them first, they left. After they'd been gone from Permafrost for 30 minutes, THEN I left.<br>
<br>
If someone invokes the PnP on me at a camp, I always share. I may tell them that the experience is now going to suck for both of us, no point in lying if that is the case, but I always share or, at worst, I go elsewhere. If it's a camp that takes significant work to break and they at least ask politely, I let them reap the rewards of my breaking and timing things. If they demand, then they can do it from scratch which is really the more challenging way for them to do it (which isn't necessarily bad but kinda sucks for them if they *can't* do that themselves).<br>

In any case, I tend to ramble. If I have a point, I guess it's nothing more than 'being polite is always good' and that applies to whether you are the person with the camp or the person who wants the camp.<br>

I also hate when someone wants to share a static spawn.  If you are there for a quest item, I can't see how Verant wants you to share when they are the ones who made the item a random drop in the first place.  Can you really accept that you would kill a mob for hours and then someone comes in, kills the mob once and get the item which should by all rights be yours?  I also detest those who come in and don't offer to share, they just waltz right in and start killing everything as if you weren't there.  The only time I will share is if I'm fighting somewhere for experience and the person asks.  If they ask, I will gladly share, if not, well then come back when I'm not there, it's what I'll normally do, if someone is camping, I'll usually go somewhere's else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 7:38:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hehe</span><hr size=1> Imogen, welcome to Firiona Vie.  I noted your other post on a different thread and replied to that also.  I recommend you take some time in groups and interacting with people into slightly higher levels to get a feel for what this world is like, rather than telling us what you think it should be.  No one person wrote a set of rules for the people here, but one seems to be evolving nonetheless.  So in trying to buck against it, you are basicly fighting against an unspoken concensus of the whole community.<br>
<br>
The community of Firionva Vie recognizes the validity of camps, in most cases.  This wandering spawn complicates things.  But if you ever try to take my camp, be prepared for me to ruin your reputation, even if you damage mine in the process.  That being said, I rarely camp at all.  But be warned in advance.  The vast majority of our server community (of which an amazing percentage come to this board) adhere to the same code.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to hear from some Winds of Destiny officers in answer to this matter.  I've had good relations with the guild thus far, but such things still deserve to be answered.  I also happen to know the majority of their officers speak Elvish.<br>

<br>
I do occassionally suggest that people might need to watch and read a bit more before taking sides on an issue that might make it hard to get along with the rest of us, as I have done with you, but if I've given offense I appologize.  Still, better to hear it from me now than to see the effects in action later on without warning.  PnP is a joke, and established nothing the players hadn't figured out for themselves, far better for themselves, long before.  We are a self-policing community here, and we do a pretty good job of it.<br>

Now in mho if sombody wanted you to leave thier camp first off they wouldnt have played stupid and pulled the little &quot;Are you camping out of the game yet?&quot; crap.

If he hadnt have been such a snide litte P**** about the whole situation from the start I would have been far more resonable.<br>

For ALL of you that think you can get your way by being a complete and utter jerk to people dont expect to get your way with me.

Orbson... had to restart so im not sure if he has the guild officer tag yet... and speaks Vah Shir and a little bit of human and elvish. Still hard to talk to him yet.<br>
Also if you want to speak to them about me you will have to do it in game. As from what I can tell I am the only member that even looks at this or our guild message board at all. Hope that helps alittle and I actually encourage all of you to do such.<br>

Amber is technicly the guild leader but I havent seen her in a month.<br>

And btw I dont think a single one of those people speak elvish expent for mabey molsone... thats a big mabey though.<br>

So feel free to discuss this or whatever else you want with them they are good people. But none of it will change the fact that I do not deal with rude people period.<br>

Not to mention he wasnt even close to the jester PH room when we got there. If anything I would recomend that people steer clear of these two they are verry snide and aloof acting fellows that obviously hold themselfs above others for resons I sure cant see.

I for one, &quot;camp out&quot; often inside camps when other people are there so i can be right there and ready when i log on and nobody is there anymore. <br>

But Braxom, your guild officer, is one of two characters played by the same person.  The other one is Senjen, a wood elven warrior.  And I know him well.  Translation need not have been an issue.<br>
<br>
As I've pointed out numerous times in the past, no one comes out of a mud slinging contest clean.  That's why I am very careful about who I accuse, when, and how.  I'm guarenteed to hurt myself at least a little in the process, and I want to make damn sure it's worth it.  Now, is this worth it, for you?  Because right now both parties in this dispute look bad.<br>
<br>
Like it or not this is a post with the title of your guild in it.  If it got really nasty I'd lock it, but so far it hasn't.  People have a right to take issue with a member of a guild and call on the guild to either defend or censure the person involved.  It doesn't even matter who I am siding with in this (no one, really) but I do believe in the right of someone to turn to the officers of a guild when they believe they are being wronged.  And I believe it is the responsibility of any good guild to respond, even if only with &quot;He's one of ours and you aren't, so deal with it.&quot;  At least then we know where that guild stands.<br>
<br>
I'll be sure to draw this thread to the attention of the members of Winds of Destiny I am in touch with.  Draw what conclusions you may from what's been posted here, they have a right to know about it.<br>
