Why are we still worrying about this?  If some guild, i dont care who it is, wants to wake the sleeper...<br><br>Well it's their choice, i'm not so greedy that if they want to experience a once-per-server event to feel special, that i would want to take that right away from them.<br><br>Remember that sleepers tomb might be  getting a revamp on all servers anyway, that'd make this a real moot point.<br><br>But say fire and fury woke the sleeper tommorow?  Would you hate them for it?  Why?  If resolution woke the sleeper tommorow, i'd still think they were a fine guild with nice people and some friends in them.  If awakened souls awoke the sleeper tommorow, i'd say grats to them, and wouldn't think any less of the friends i have in their guild.   What if you dont even have a sleepers key, and probably wont ever see that zone (i stand a good chance of not seeing it /shrug)...<br><br>I dont really think your post makes *that* much sense.  While really, if a guild just wanted to wake the sleeper to make other guilds have a harder time, i'd say /rude to them.... What if they just want to wake the sleeper for the thrill of doing it?  That'd be my reasoning anyway!<br><br>You cant compare the sleeper to other things in your post.  The sleeper is a once in a servertime bragging rights event!! Primal still drops after the sleeper is awake, and off of easier mobs!  So a couple nice items dont drop..? so what?  there are nice items to be had other places.

I dont mean that to belittle other players, but frankly asking a group of 50 plus people (Reso) to not do an encounter they might have worked very hard to do is extremely selfish. They worked hard to get to a level where they could do this encounter. They had people dedicated enough to achieve the levels, AA, collect spells and gear. They EARNED the right to do it if they choose to. How dare you try to cheapen their accomplishment by trying to lay on a heavy guilt trip. If Reso wakes the sleeper and people get pissy then I would call them poor losers.

If you could track and actually spent time in Western Waste then maybe you would realize that we were trying to get Myga to spawn.  Unfortunately our methods of spawning him could be different then yours so it could look like we weren't doing anything.  Until you can tell me that Resolution would not kill Myga if they didn't spawn him, I will continue to laugh whenever Myga is brought up.  Oh, and how do you expect the people you would pay for a Myga spotting to be certain that AS, FnF or anyone else capable of killing PH's weren't the ones to spawn him?

SOOOOOOOOOO are yall still in this conversation??? well if so GET OUT.<br><br>second people keep tossing dirty laundry of fnf out in to the open.  and yall get mad?  frist off it was my oppion that what was said on those bords in fnf stayed on them.  so if u had seen all the posts you could have folloed better.  what was posted up was verry misleading.  cuz how he did included 1 or 2 posts there were about 60 more in a total of 4 pages worth of posts.  all that was taking place in that post was disicusing the issues at had.  so if you were not in fnf at the time you have no reasion to be disi9cusing there laundry cuz you played no part in it.  i really cant blame fuvi for throing that out on the boards after he was asked to leave, but its not someting i would have done.  fuvi just was retruing a debt to fnf i guess.  <br><br>thrid once again why do people who are not 60 as of now care?  it would be anoter good 5 months befor u thoguht about ST.  how many established guilds are there out there that think they are ST ready? i can think of 2 guilds besides reso, thats AS and fnf.<br><br>now I KNOW fnf has a shit lofe of primals still stocked up or that would be my impresion.  after last seeing ramel using a SOD i would guess they have a few of those also.  they could have been faromign keys for the past 2 months right?  then they could have been doing warders again. or maby they are i dont know after returing from vactaion.<br><br>AS has the raid knolage to do it and the people im guessing. have the been faring keys? yea they have how many do they have? no clue.  could they have started farming the teasy keys earler then they did to set them up? hell yea kland is cake get his timing donw and sit on him.  so they couldhave had more keys to be at the stage to get robes and soDs.  now i can hear a faint &quot; we cant get to mobs in time&quot;  well tough shit work for it like fnf did and reso dose.  <br><br><br>the real key is dose it benefit reso?  the porpous of this game is to have fun and to win. i have never played agame that the object was not to win.  so if be wakign sleeper reso can put them in the first drivers slot.  then WHO the hell are you to judge them for doing so WHEN IT DOSE NOT EVEN AFFECT YOU.   i relaly hate to break it to people.  the likely hood of a person whos not in reso fnf as seeing ST besides justzonging in cuz u won the role on a key at 1 open raid that yall some how managed to kill kland is SLIM to none.  its the bare facts.  FACE it you cant bitch if it dont affect you so if u arent 60 atm or u dont have a key get out of this discution.<br><br>if you dont agree it shows how little you know about servers and ever quest. there are no open raids on ST.   there are no open raids on ST key mobs mainly cuz they are killed shortly after they spawn.  <br><br><br>the restof this is my oppion not fact as stated above<br><br>i think it would be great to try and kill the sleeper, it would be a reltively un heard of.  most guilds send  9 to 10 in to ST and kill frist warder and log on there twinks and go to the zones where the sleeper is bound to show up. <br><br>so why not mount an asualt agenst him.  oog its not a zone wide DT its actuly an AoE Dt that dose not have THAT large of a radious and he uses it aproxmitly ever 45 secs.   so why not orgnized and try and kill him.<br><br><br>Reghar Fireforge<br>Crusader of Brell <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20%
