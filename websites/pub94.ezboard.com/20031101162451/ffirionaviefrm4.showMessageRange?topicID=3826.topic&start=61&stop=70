<br>
It forces me to play without people who say &quot;(( ooc I would love to group with you but my guild charter says I can't ))&quot;.<br>
<br>
And it's not like I was looking to group for phat lewtz or whatever... this is people I see roleplaying out loud (/say) and who intrigue me, so I try to get involved, but they can't cooperate with me in any way because of their guild charter, because I'm not &quot;evil&quot;.  Yes, evil, which is all about cooperation with like minded individuals, and would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do something advantageous for itself instead of following its principles.  (Well okay that's lawful/orderly evil, but still, it's limiting and it affects how I can play when you take away potential groupmates).<br>
<br>
My point - your strict, absolute rules about who your guildmates can and can't group with causes me a loss of potential fun by interacting with people who happened to pick a different race/class than me, in a way both they and I might find enjoyable.  It limits the story, like where I offered to hire them at a disgustingly high rate for their services, when I was really just looking for someone to keep me company for a while while working on a quest, and dabble a bit in roleplaying on FV.<br>
<br>
Basically, these peoples' guild charter  wrecked my fun.<br>
<br>
Also,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Someone said the game would have all the same characters You would know who everyone waswhen you met them. That is wrong.

<br>
I think that was me that said that.  Yes, if we followed Verant's guidelines, it would be the same damned characters.  Oooh, another dark elf agnostic rogue!  Ooooh another dark elf shadowknight.  I wonder if this one will say Innoruuk every third word and talk about how strong his hate is, and show me the blackness of his heart.<br>
<br>
How boring.  Sure you have choice.<br>
<br>
I'm sooo sick of the same old evil.  You know, the evil that bands together to fight good, as if it's some sort of happy team that works together to fight those wacky lightbringers.  /yawn.<br>
<br>
What about the kind of evil that doesn't know it's evil.  The kind that pretends to be good, the kind that lies to itself and says it's good.<br>
<br>
Interesting evil is the priest who burns heretics over some point of text or procedure of religion, or for having an opinion differing from the holy writings about whether the sun revolves around the world, or the world around the sun.<br>
<br>
Interesting evil is the paladin who uses his position of authority to win fame, and only takes on tasks which are likely to result in glory and honors from people, not the unsung but important quest.  It's the paladin who smiles and receives praise, honors, is described as kind, gentle, caring, and protective, but then goes home and beats his squire silly if he forgets a task or makes a mistake.<br>
<br>
Interesting evil is the drunken wizard, who knows his drunkenness is hurting his friends and companions who rely on him, but who refuses to get help with his problem for selfish reasons, until one day, a recklessly cast spell nearly kills a companion.<br>
<br>
Interesting evil is the evil that knows it's evil, but only works with people considered &quot;good&quot; because it can get away with more while in their company... say a rogue who doesn't let anyone know she's a rogue, and uses her position of trust to embezzle and set up a network of spies for whatever purpose.<br>
<br>
Interesting evil is the evil that exploits good for its own gain.  Anyone read Ender's Shadow?  About the way Bean's gang's new bully uses adult sympathy for children to increase his status and that of his gang, in order to get into the soup kitchen?  That was interesting evil.  From another perspective, Bean was interesting evil, because he analyzed everything in terms of his own gains, and was willing to hurt others for those gains (like wanting to kill the bully in cold blood early on).<br>
<br>
Anyway, far be it from me to tell anyone how to roleplay, especially when I don't bother anymore, but if you want me to be interested, you'll disconnect &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; from professions and races, and make it instead dependent on actions.<br>
<br>
The best RPing I've seen (I say best because it most made me want to get involved) wasn't on FV, it was on rodcet nife, in a guild where the roleplay was all about motives and actions, and not about &quot;dark elf, thus evil&quot; or &quot;paladin, thus good&quot;.  I'm sure there are plenty of examples on this server, too, and I haven't bothered to find them, but SOE's descriptions of the races, classes, and deities are totally boring, are stereotypes, and if we all followed them as &quot;rules&quot; (which they aren't, they're explanations and background material, such as you'd find in a player's handbook for a paper and pencil RPG really), you could predict a character's motives and actions almost exactly by knowing her race, class, and deity.  And because some races or classes have very resistricted deities, sometimes just knowledge of race and class is enough.<br>
<br>
How much richer a game would it be if you have more realistic and interesting types of evil, such as closetly-evil paladins who believe they are good, and so on?  Much richer, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Anyway, rules which allow no room for interpretation, or the &quot;spirit of the rule&quot; just restrict possible stories.  You can't argue with that, it follows from what a rule is.  A rule guides behavior by stating unacceptable (or required) behaviors.  If someone encounters the rule, and it contradicts what they're trying to do with their story, if they follow the rule, they were restricted by it.  Why restrict needlessly?<br>
<br>
No offense to anyone who roleplays their race/class/deity &quot;by the book&quot;, but it's just not at all interesting to me, and when you require it of your guild via a charter or whatever, it restricts me too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caeona>Caeona</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.spacespider.net/emo/grouphug.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 603<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 5:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No offense to anyone who roleplays their race/class/deity &quot;by the book&quot;, but it's just not at all interesting to me, and when you require it of your guild via a charter or whatever, it restricts me too.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

I can interact with people without grouping with them.  If it means putting my XP bar on hold...well since I left the game because I couldn't role-play in the ascribed setting my XP bar stopped being relevant.<br>
<br>
I think it is FAR, FAR more interesting to role-play in a deterministic world (where actions do not determine alignment) than to play with the same definitions of good and evil in EVERY other game and fantasy novel.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 1304<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 9:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif height=120 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hm</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How much richer a game would it be if you have more realistic and interesting types of evil, such as closetly-evil paladins who believe they are good, and so on? Much richer, in my opinion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I quite agree ... and there have been a few characters I've met like this on FV, and they have been wonderful to know. <br>
<br>
However, I'm still going to assume that when I meet a guy carrying a flaming sword, he's a worshipper of the light gods, and therefore my enemy.  That's how Didi knows the world.  Her player knows that maybe the paladin may be a bastard (considering some of the paladins who post on the soapbox, highly likely actually).  But Didi knows nothing of the paladin's background, actions, character, or story and is going to treat a paladin like a paladin.  Didi takes SOE's description of the races and classes as her base assumption, what she was taught as she grew up, unless proved differently.  Unless circumstances happen to show her that paladin is different (e.g. he's KOS in all the good cities, consistently worships the dark gods, and kills light-worshippers) she will have no reason to change her mind.<br>
<br>
And may I say there are too many paladins claiming to be evil who really just help out whichever side, good or evil, that they feel like at the moment.  That's not evil, that's self-serving chaotic.  Likewise all the dark elves claiming to be good.  I have met ONE, only ONE, who supported that with the faction work to enter Kelethin and the 'good' cities.  Simply running around saying &quot;I'm good&quot; while still amiable in Neriak and KOS in Felwithe does not make player of Didi consider you to be 'good', just more self-serving chaotic.<br>
<br>
You say you ally with the Sarnaks?  OK, better not be KOS in Chardok.  You say you ally with the Coldain?  OK, better not be KOS in Thurgadin.  You say you ally with the 'good' races?  OK, come meet me in Kaladim, or Kelethin, or Felwithe.  I say I'm allied with the gnomes, and I'll meet you in Ak'Anon any time.  I'd be ashamed to claim any such thing if I hadn't done the faction work.  In short - kudos to those who wish to roleplay something a little different, but (a) character of Didi (being a racist dark elf) will still judge them on their race and class until she sees something different, and (b) player of Didi isn't going to have a lot of respect for that claim if they haven't backed it up with the real faction work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 1819<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=68>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/smile.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hm</span><hr size=1> [quote}Basically, these peoples' guild charter wrecked my fun.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Without quoting the rest of it... this one line can be used to evoke it.  You blather on and on how it is interferring with YOU as if you, your fun, and your XP bar are the only things which are important.  The guild's charter might be heightening the fun of those who refused to group with you based on the fact you are of a proscribed race or class.  But that isn't possible in your world because it interfers with YOUR fun.  <br>
<br>
If you really want to RP with someone, there are a thousand ways to do so without grouping with them to kill things.  No, it likely would not move your XP bar an iota, but, to some of us, that is not the only definition of &quot;fun&quot;.  In fact, the conversation in /say might well have been exactly the sort of experience they were looking for at that time and your contributing to that would not move your XP bar but could give you an experience as well.<br>
<br>
Again..... it seems the opponents to RP have the ONLY arguement that it interfers with their single player game.  News flash, EQ is not single player and their is no requirement for RPers to enchance your fun at the expense of their own.  Most RPers won't stop you from not RPing (as long as you don't give them grief for RPing), so why is their RPing without you such a threat to you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Custom Title Repo'd</span><br>  Posts: 1162<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/03 6:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Labeling &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Good&quot;</span><hr size=1> /sigh <br>

And the arguing goes on and on.... it never ends, eh?<br>

p.s. My suggestion to all of you is to just not argue about it. Both sides feel so strongly about its own philosophy that discussion on the issue never ends positively. Just have fun your own way and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreelosthehunter>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 917<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Labeling &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Good&quot;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
