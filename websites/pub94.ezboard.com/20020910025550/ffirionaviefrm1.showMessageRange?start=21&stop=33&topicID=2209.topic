Then, they hide/bury/toss their loot items aside. hehe, sorta what I would do if I was them.<br>
<br>
TLC is fun, and I spent today meeting a nice group of RP'ers in the Karanas, due to some of our items being TLC ones. It wasn't the only reason they were there of course, even if TLC wasn't in place today they would have been welcome, but there is still the underlying feeling that they are useful, and I like that to be part of the game no matter what your level is. TLC gives this in a unique way.<br>
<br>
The combination of TLC/dropable items is much better than the system used on blue servers, in my opinion.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxianya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xianya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/1/02 1:10:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> I like the tlc, for all the reasons previously mentioned. I would like to point out , however, that in order for this to work, there must be a constant influx of new characters. Eventually, it is possible that the server will be filled with 50+ who are then in competition wooing the younger characters to come do tlc camps for them. Already, I have had many friends reroll their characters BECAUSE of Tlc. Some were truly new players who learned too late of a particular item they should get but cant because of Tlc. Others were just people who normally have an alt they can turn to when they get burned out on their main.<br>
<br>
I believe in Tlc, I just see that sometime in the future (if we dont all go to EQ2 or some other MMRPG) , we will have to be allowed at least one more character to keep the server working.<br>

<br>
As the original proponent of TLC, my opinions remain:<br>
<br>
1. Overall, in combination with 1 character per server, it makes for a better EverQuest.  I wish TLC had been in the game from the beginning, because I think the game would be a better one for it.  I also personally prefer this combination to 'recommended levels'.<br>
<br>
2. I do agree that there are some quests out there that were designed without TLC in mind that TLC makes very hard and/or impossible, and that those items should be flagged non-TLC.<br>
<br>
3. This isn't totally related, but the removal of no-drop still worries me long term in that the drop rate for many no-drop items is purposely frequent, and them being dropable on FV might turn into a problem.  Overall, however, the removal seems to work fine and well with the TLC and 1-char per server restrictions.<br>

Slightly off topic, but since you brought it up, the geonid caves in Wakening lands are tacklable w/ a group at your level.  You could collect the unrefined gems now, and then move your group out to Western Wastes to hunt velium hounds for their fur in your early 50's.  Put the two together and ya got yourself some really nice ranger-usable armor upgrades.<br>

I ran into more KS'ing assholes purely due to TLC than I ever ran into on a blue server.  And, actually, on FV it was pretty much the only place I ran into that type of player.  Why?  Every TLC quest item had either a mule farmer or some rude idiot that would just run up and start KS'ing your camp.  Since you need these items for your epic and you can't just shrug it off as &quot;bah, just a level 10 skellie, let him have it&quot; and come back when you can't be KS'd.  Nope -- you need to hang around, not level up, and sit there and petition and squable with some idiot over a pathetic green spawn.  GAH!<br>
<br>
Or, you can level up far beyond the TLC point and then pay that same rude farmer for an item you could have easily gotten yourself.  Yup, now that's some nice high/low level interaction there -- paying people to KS someone else's epic.<br>
<br>
TLC also pretty much breaks all quest discovery.  Do you like being the first person to solve a quest across all the servers?  If so, just plain give up on that notion on FV.  Quests are designed for normal blues.  The TLC aspects on FV are completely ignored.  This means if a new quest comes out and you're level 60, it could easily need some magic or lore item from a green spawn and thus you couldn't even help others solve the quest.  Same thing for new trade skills.  You can't kill for your own components, you have to pay a farmer.<br>
<br>
Basically, the TLC and zero no-drop rules don't promote high/low interaction.  They promote KS'ing, farming, and ebay'ing. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

I just don't think FV has the downside you're complaining about.<br>
<br>
I've been on this server since Day 1, and I've played more than regularly (read: too much).  In all that time I've never had problems with KSing outside of a few decaying skeletons in the newbie grounds.  Stormfeather and the AC get KS'd from time to time I'm sure, but that's problematic on every server, it's not due to TLC.<br>
<br>
I spent a few weeks camping the shrunken goblin skull earring, a popular raid item worth more because it does go trivial (in mid 40's).  During those few weeks, there were two other groups also camping the earring.  Did we jump all over eachother's spawns?  Nope.  Did we secretly try and sneak the Grachnists away from the camp when they spawned?  Nope.  Did we get into huge verbal arguments and threaten to petition eachother?  Nope.  <br>
<br>
So what'd we do then?  Well, we said &quot;Hi, can you give me a tell when you guys head out, I'll be in Overthere&quot;.  Or sometimes we'd just help eachother, working on the assumption that the sooner one party got an earring, the sooner it'd be our turn again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
That's just one example.  Being something of a farmer myself from time to time, I've had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  plenty</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of times where I bumped into another group who wanted to fight the same monster(s), and we always worked it out just fine, and I even made a few friends in the process (/wave Elaira).<br>
<br>
If you were having wierd-ass Killstealing problems over certain spawns, I'm really forced to conclude you brought a lot of it upon yourself with your abrasive personality.  Cuz while I can't imagine people just randomly jumping your kills, I could certainly see them doing it if they were greeted with &quot;Hey, get lost, this orc pawn belongs to be biatch!&quot;.<br>

There are too many quests and trade-skill items that drop off 26 and under MOBs, though.

   Only exception I could see is the one you seem to be basing much of your bad experiences around, the putrid rib bone for the monk sash used in monk epic (and maybe Dyllin Starshine for testament of Venear).  Even then, our server pop is so low I have a hard time visualizing this as a big problem (having just started a character in Qeynos recently, I can confirm that Qey hills has all of 3 or 4 people running around it late-night).<br>
