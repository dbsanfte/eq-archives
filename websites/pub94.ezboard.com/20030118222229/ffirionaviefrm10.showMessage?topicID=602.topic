<br>
&quot;So be it&quot; Sighed Vulak'Aerr, shaking his head in discontent. &quot;If that is your wish,  you are well aware of the consequences&quot;. Vulak'Aerr turned his look upon the elders in the room and noded slowly. The reflection of the torches in his eyes became clearer as they began to moisten. <br>
<br>
The shackled form remained still as the judgement was passed upon him. <br>
<br>
A dark silence descended upon the majestic dome shaped room. Chants began to echo throughout the hallways as the elders began conjuring an ancient spell. Never had this spell been used upon one of their own, never had one of their own betrayed the circle of elders.<br>
<br>
The shackled form began to hurl in pain, torrential pain. His once massive form was shrinking, his limbs becoming shorter. His golden scales melting into a uniform surface, turning into a somewhat pinkish in color. <br>
<br>
Vulak'Aerr turned away from the transformation. &quot;I have lost some of my kind through warfare, but never have I lost one because of infatuation. You are a disgrace to our kind, you have betrayed us for the last time. You are being stripped of all magical powers, poor fool.&quot;<br>
<br>
Screams of unheard pain echoed throughout the realm. What seemed to be the screeching cry of a dragon was now the wailing of a human voice. Every resident bowed their heads in respect to the loss and continued on about their business.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will now live the undignified life of the race you loved most, humans.&quot; Vulak'Aerr muttered a word now incoherent to the human.<br>
<br>
The cries stopped abruptly, as the human fell to the ground. Too weak to move the human lay lifeless on the bitter cold marble floor. With his last shred of stamina he opened his eyes, but even that was too demanding. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let it known from this day forth&quot; said Vulak'Aerr. &quot;Harve'cha is now a fallen dragon soul&quot;.<br>
<br>
Vulak'Aerr looked at the human form for the last time and snarled with disgust. &quot;Send him to where he now belongs...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Wake up you drunken idiot!&quot; Snarled the city guard as he clenched the hilt of his bastard sword.&quot;Get off your back and go about your business&quot;<br>
<br>
The naked human slightly opened his eyes and frowned. &quot;Ugh..&quot; he exclaimed as he put his arms over his eyes. &quot;What..where?&quot; <br>
<br>
The guard released the hilt of his weapon and snickered out of amusement. &quot;Too much of the dwarven ale eh?&quot; Said the guard with a dwarven accent. The guard kneeled down and shoved the human to his side. &quot;Go on, go home and wash your self. You look horrible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have never seen you around here, you must be from queynos?&quot; The guard inquired.<br>
<br>
The human nodded in agreement with a puzzled look on his face. &quot;I.. aye.. &quot;.He sat down and stared at the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look like shit, maybe a good bath and some clothing would do you good.&quot; Said the guard in a comical tone. &quot;You know we do have laws against civilians walking around naked and smelling like trolls&quot;.<br>
<br>
The human put out his arms and looked at them. Turning his hands, and bending his elbows, he tilted his head with a look of amusment upon his face.<br>
<br>
The guard chuckled at the naked human. &quot;You know what?&quot; asked the guard as he stood up. &quot;There is a tailor not too far from here, take these copper pieces and do me a favor&quot; Said the guard as he reached into his pocket for some change. &quot;Go and buy yourself a pair of pants&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard extended his arm out to the naked human with some change in his hand. &quot;Here take this...&quot;<br>
<br>
The human rubbed his eyes and looked at the guard. &quot;Thank you I guess&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you ungrateful bastard!&quot; Scowled the guard as he threw the coins at the human. &quot;You best not be here by the time I return!&quot; <br>
<br>
The guard turned around and walked off. &quot;Or else its the city jail for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
The human looked at the ground and picked up the coins. &quot;Where am I?&quot; he asked himself. The human sighed and got on his feet. He looked around but couldn't see much of anything, It seemed as though there was a heavy morning fog. Faint noises of clattering metal could be heard from not too far. <br>
<br>
&quot;What am I here for?&quot; he asked himself as he walked around aimlessly. &quot;Clothing..  guess I must find something to wear before I get into any trouble&quot;. <br>
<br>
As he gained his posture, he walked towards the city noise. <br>
<br>
<br>

Alot of merchants trying to attract potential customers with nice deals. <br>
<br>
Across the street he could see a little tent shop with leather clothing hanging from the ceiling and its sides. There also seemed to be a little being in the tent rocking about in her rocking chair. &quot;This must be it&quot;, he thought. There was a fair amount of people walking around browsing wears from other merchants. &quot;I can't draw attention to myself.. people will think I am a mad man on the loose!&quot;<br>
<br>
He was crouched behind a barrel of ale with a potent smell, glancing over it once every so often to find a good moment to cross the street.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Come all! Come see my fabulous wears from ancient dragons!&quot; Screamed a vendor. <br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect, this might just be my break.&quot; The human thought to himself. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have items for everyone! Come, Come all and purchase my wear! Temeilion has everything you wish!&quot; He shouted <br>
<br>
A massive stampede made its way to the back end of the road, leaving all other merchants wondering what it was that he had in stock.<br>
<br>
The human peeked up once more, looking both left and right he couldn't see anyone within range, nor anyone looking his way. With swiftness the human leaped from one side of the street to the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Psst.&quot; Whispered the human.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh? who goes about?&quot; Asked a little gnomish voice. &quot;Show yer self!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am right here m'am, hiding beside your little tent.&quot; The human whispered again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I witnessed many kinds of tactics of stealing from merchants.. do you really think i will fall for this? HA! get lost before I call for guards!&quot; She scowled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Humm, no m'am, i am in a little bit of a bind here. You see I am somewhat without clothing and wanted to purchase a pair of pants from you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yeah.. i beleive ye alright. Who would be dumb enough to walk around naked here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Look m'am.. I only wish to buy a pair of those leather pants you have hanging there, t'is all i want.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, i have one better for you, SIR!, come out of there before I really get mad.&quot; The old woman seemed to be getting really irritated at this point and the human knew that his options were growing slim. <br>
<br>
&quot;Alight, fine... &quot; whispered the human. He looked both sides of the street and people were still rounded up with the famous dragon gear merchant. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come out now, I have no time nor patience for games!&quot; Snarled the old gnome while holding on to her broom&quot;<br>
<br>
The human quickly ran around the corner of the tent and into its opening, hastily looking for a spot to hide the human couldn't seem to find one.Then as he glanced in the back end of the tent he could see a pile of leather scraps, &quot;That might just do!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!&quot; Exclaimed the little gnome as she threw her arms up in the air. &quot;Oh my good heavens put some clothes on!&quot; Cried out the gnome while clutching her chest. <br>
<br>
The human landed in the pile of leather scraps and buried himself in it.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is what I have been trying to tell you m'am!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You never said you were naked! Good lord, I need a drink.&quot; said the gnome as she walked to a small keg in the back of the tent. <br>
<br>
&quot;M'am, please.. i beg of you, some pants&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes.. yes yes yes.. hmmmm&quot; thought the gnome. &quot;What size ye be?&quot; she asked. &quot;Oh wait nevermind.. i know exactly what size ye be.&quot; she snickered. She grabbed a pair of tan leather pants hanging from the mens section. &quot;Here these should fit you like a glove and bring out those nice... ummmm.&quot; she blushed and threw him the leather pants. &quot;Put these on while I pour myself some ale&quot;<br>
<br>
The human rolled his eyes and proceeded to slip into his pants.Putting his feet in wasn't the problem, but little leather scraps were also following into the pants. With a little struggle the human got his pants up and tied. brushing off and pulling out the rest of the scraps the human smiled. &quot;Thank you m'lady&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, young one&quot; Smiled the little gnome form behind the curtains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, I have these coppers, to cover the cost&quot;. Said the human.<br>
<br>
The little gnome walked out from behind the curtains and made her way to his hand, she counted the copper pieces and smiled. &quot;You are 4 copper pieces short, but It'll be fine.&quot; the gnome took the money from his hand and stuffed them into her pouch.&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sat in her chair and was looking at the human with an inquisitive regard, peering him up and down. <br>
<br>
The human looked at himself wondering what it was that she was looking at, &quot;What is wrong?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me young lad, what be your name?&quot; she asked while rocking her little chair back and forth.<br>
<br>
The human suddenly took a step back with a puzzled look upon his face. &quot;Who am I?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;I cannot say my real name, for I do not exist anymore, and surely dragon slayers would come running after me&quot;, the human shut his eyes. trying to vividly remember something worthy of a name. His mental vision grew cloudy.<br>
<br>
Two golden eyes appeared in his vision, glowing with seering fire. &quot;Fallen dragon soul&quot; said the figure. &quot;You are a fallen dragon soul!&quot; Screamed the figure as a set of razor sharp teeth came at this face.<br>
<br>
The human was knocked to the floor as if he had been hit with a war hammer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, what in the lords name does ye have, me name is Ebbie&quot; Smiled the little gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am fallen dragon soul&quot; whispered the human.<br>
<br>
&quot;Phallen dragonsoul eh? your mother hate you?&quot; <br>
<br>
The human looked up at the gnome with a grin, &quot;Aye, Phallen Dragonsoul is my name.&quot; <br>

<br>
Phallen pulled himself back on his two feet and brushed off his backside and smiled at her nodding in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, where is a nice young stud like yourself heading to?&quot; Ebbie inquired.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I am not sure yet. I haven't really made any plans at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ebbie took a long sip from her ale and set down the mug on the little wooden table next to her. &quot;Where are you from?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Queynos...&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhh yes.. I know Queynos all too well, What brings you to Freeport then?&quot;<br>
<br>
Phallen's eyes started to scan the room, quickly thinking for an answer.&quot;I came here for guidance&quot; he replied. Phallen knew that it wasn't guidance that he needed, what he really needed was a recollection of memories that he had prior to waking up in Freeport.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye... Me thinks I can help ye with that Phallen.&quot; Ebbie stood up from her little rocking chair and headed to the front of the tent.&quot;You see over there?&quot; As her little hand points to another shop.<br>
<br>
Phallen looked at her with puzzlement,&quot;Yes, that little shop with bread for sale?&quot; he said taking another glance at the bakery.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep.. that be it, just go there and ask for guidance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what kinda of baker weilds powers of the intellect?&quot; He asked himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go on lad.. don't be afraid, It's not like she weilds powers from the dragons ya know!&quot;  She laughed.<br>
<br>
Phallen looked at Ebbie with a horrified look, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am only teasing you.. sheesh.. loosen up..&quot;<br>
<br>
Ebbie walked back to her chair shaking her head in disbelief, &quot;You know, for a second I coulda sworn you believed me&quot; she snickered with amusement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh..&quot; Phallen turned his back to her and rolled his yes. &quot;That shit ain't funny&quot; he thought to himself as he walked over to the bakery.<br>
<br>
Temeilion was still screaming to the top of his lungs about his dragon gear and how good his deals were, and people were all taken up in awe at the nice artifacts he had layed out on his vendor table.<br>
<br>
Walking towards the bakery Phallen could smell the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread, &quot;This smells rather good!&quot; he thought to himself. As he got closer to the bakery, merchants tried desperately to lure him with great deals.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, Sir! You won't believe what I got here today! Check it out! Hottest deals on Crystal chittin gear! Here, for prime example, Crystal Spied eyes!!! only 400 Platinum pieces!!&quot; Shouted one dwarf merchant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh shut up already with your Crystal spider eyes, get new material!!&quot; Shouted another merchant from across the street.<br>
<br>
Phallen quickened his pace towards the bakery, &quot;Jeeze.. next thing you know they will be slinging food at each other&quot; he thought.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving at the bakery, Phallen was starving. The bakery smell was strong and was mouth watering. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye want a cookie sir?&quot; Asked a tiny female voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;huh?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I said.. Ye want a cookie sir?&quot; She asked again.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is not what I come here for.&quot; Phallen replied evading a direct answer for he knew that he really wanted some of that bakery.<br>
<br>
A little hand popped up on the table and then a little halfling face followed. She was rather pretty for a halfling, nice little chubby cheeks, and short stubby hands. &quot;If you don't want my cookies.. then what might you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am looking for guidance.&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhhh... well then.. cookies are just what you need!&quot; The little blonde haired halfling looked around the table, &quot;Now, where did I put that guidance cookie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry, I must have you confused with someone else,&quot; bowed Phallen as he started to walk backwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't go anywhere! I will find that cookie and you will eat it, and all will fall into place.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How is a cookie supposed to bring me guidance, ridiculous really.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because my name is Andlie, and when I say you eat my cookies.. you eat my cookies. Got it?&quot; snarled Andlie.<br>
&quot;But, M'a...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; She raised her little arm in the air, &quot; I don't want to hear you till you eat my cookie!&quot;<br>
<br>
A moment of silence grew between Phallen and Andlie. Phallen wasn't sure if he should make a run for the nearest street and get away form the crazed baker, or stay and be told what to do. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah!, I found it.. &quot; exclaimed Andlie, &quot;Eat this and you will understand&quot;<br>
<br>
Andlie handed Phallen a flattened hard as rock cookie. Not knowing how to go about eating it without breaking his teeth he reluctantly took a small bite from it. A sour taste ran through his mouth, and his cheeks puckered instantly. Trying to keep the look of disgust from showing he smiled while pretending to chew on a much bigger piece of cookie than he really had.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mmmmmm.. quite tasty!&quot; Said Phallen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now come with me, hurry we don't have a great deal of time&quot; She told him showing him the back door the the tent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we going?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;For guidance moron!&quot;<br>
<br>
As Phallen followed her he could feel his legs becoming very weak, his vision dimming around him. &quot;What in the world is going on?&quot; he asked as he put his arms forward looking for something to hold on to.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just follow me.. I will tell all.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xandriaphallen>Xandria Phallen</A> at: 12/2/02 6:13:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andlievoluptuous>Andlie Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pr0n Star</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/02 10:02:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fallen Dragon Soul </span><hr size=1> YAY!  =)  *shoves a cookie into Phallen's Mouth*<br>

Northernlite Dragonsoul. I will finish this story of epic proportions, to convey to the vast world or norrath, who she is and how she forever changed the life of the one man tortured by the soul of a dragon.<br>
<br>
Andlie turned around and grabbed Phallen's searching hand.&quot;Come on ...&quot; she snickered.<br>
<br>
Phallen's vision was becoming more and more faded, couldn't quite make things out. He followed Andlie's lead blindly, keeping a defensive stance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch your head here.. the door is a little low&quot; Pointed out Andlie as she opened the door located in the back of the bakery.<br>
<br>
Crouching down Phallen cautiously enters a dark room, unsure if its his vision that has faded or not he grows an expression of concern.&quot;What have you done to me.. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shush.. here, sit down.&quot; Andlie pulled a chair and put Phallen's hand on its arm rest.<br>
<br>
Phallen sat down and put both hands on his knee's. &quot;Ok.. what is going on.. this really isn't funny anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trust me Phallen.. It's merely a tranquilizer. I need you to be completely relaxed if you want me to wander in your head and figure you out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andlie sat down in front of Phallen and extended her arms out on the circular table between them. &quot;Lay your hands down with your palms upwards please&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright&quot; Says Phallen as he extends his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok now, I need you to relax and let me inside that head of yours..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok.. trying to relax&quot; Replied Phallen as he shuffled around in his chair trying to get comfortable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Andlie shut her eyes and lost all facial expression, falling deep into trance she began what was to become an experience of a lifetime. Looking into Phallen's soul was like looking through a clouded crystal ball, not much color, not much of anything but distorted recollections of events. There was something not right about Phallen, he wasn't just your normal customer. Maybe this was out of Andlie's league, or maybe there was something blocking her from entering within Phallen's soul. <br>
<br>
As she looked closer into phallen's soul she felt a force forming between her and the vision, something was repelling her away. The more she wanted to peer into him, the further it pushed her away. &quot;Now this can't be right...hmph!&quot;<br>
<br>
Her face grimaced as she mentally fought through the force, gaining ground she felt the force weakening. &quot;Interesting... i think&quot;<br>
<br>
A suction began to form, pulling Andlie into the visions. She felt herself being pulled into his soul, frightened she tried to grasp for something. Swinging her little arms around hopelessly fighting, she was swept off her feet and into his soul.<br>
<br>
She fell into what seemed a cloud, or a really foggy area. Shocked, she got back on her furry feet and looked around not sure what to expect.<br>
<br>
What is going on in here? Andlie asked herself as she walked through the dense clouds.<br>
<br>
Andlie could see glimpses of memories playfully wisping around her. Memories of unseen lands, nature at its best. Mountains after mountains filled with blossoming tree's, River's of crystal blue water. Andlie could almost hear Tunare singing with joy as her lands were blooming with divine glory.<br>
Wow, such pretty lands, She thought.<br>
<br>
Andlie walked further through the fog, arms out in front of herself waving the clouds out of her path. With a burst of fear she took a quick step back as another figment of memory flew at her feet. She bent over and tried to grab hold of the hazy bulb of images but her fingers ran through and the images dissipated.<br>
<br>
Odd, she mumbled <br>
<br>
A faint smell of searing flesh was caught by the refined halflings nose,Ewwwww, what is that smell.<br>
<br>
Determined to find where the smell came from, she stomped her little feet forward following the nasty smell.<br>
<br>
The stronger the smell got the denser the fog became, like a dream. A little unsure of her steps now she treaded slowly forward, eyes wide open.<br>
<br>
The fog cleared as a gust of warm wind blew in her direction. Looking ahead Andlie stopped dead in her tracks, a look of pure mortification on her face. For the first time in her life Andlie felt very small and very scared, This is impossible.. oh my god... what is the meaning of this.<br>
<br>
An ethereal cage was holding a monstrous creature, with ethereal shackles holding in place. Golden scales covered its body, its eyes golden as the sun. Its stature was gigantic, it head had a majestic crown forming. <br>
<br>
Andlie reached inside her pocket and pulled out a little cookie. Staring at the dragon she munched on the cookie with a face of inquiry. Wiping the crumbs off her mouth with her sleeves she took a step closer towards the dragon. <br>
<br>
Don't approach me! I warn you! Scowled the dragon.<br>
<br>
Falling on her ass with the fear of Cazic Thule put into her she lay still, hard as rock. <br>
<br>
I have eaten far bigger than you! <br>
<br>
Andlie's eye fixated on the dragon, she straightened herself a little bit. W..Wh..W.. She shut her mouth and bit her lip. <br>
<br>
Shook her head and lifted her hand stuck out her index finger, and made him sign to hold one second.<br>
<br>
Andlie clamed her breathing and shook her shoulder a little bit. Who are you? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xandriaphallen>Xandria Phallen</A> at: 1/5/03 1:41:12 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=602.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=602.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=602.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=602.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=602.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
