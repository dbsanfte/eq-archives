Well, no...attitude</span><hr size=1> Short version of my question - is the server population low enough that any class can get a group if one is avalilbe? <br>
<br>
Or is it that the attitude of the server is such that you need not be a 'need' class? <br>
<br>
<br>
Longer version - <br>
<br>
Like many of the other post here, I've grown weary of what I see on my current server (Nameless) and thought to try a new character here. I read a few of the other post about 'what class' and many replies like the below - <br>
<br>
&quot;We can repeat a thousand times.... Play a character YOU really want to play. Nothing else matters. You only get 1 character here and if you RP, people will RP back to you.<br>
The race and class &quot;neeeds&quot; are secondary to the creation of a character which you should want to RP.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nice idea. But. My previous characters were a Shadow Knight (46) and a Beastlord (52). They both ended up being retired when after I got them to the level listed solo I wanted to try grouping, and got the standard 'Are you a cleric/warrior/enchanter? No? Ok, keep shouting, someone will pick up in a few hours...'<br>
<br>
So, although I agree with play a class that you enjoy (and from appearances one that can solo), I don't want to get to the level where I can do my first plane raid or hunt in Chardok and find out that unless it is a zone you can solo in, you'll never go (ok, not literally, but you get the picture). Although I have no regrets - beastlord was huge fun for 51 levels...my concern is that if I don't start a cleric or enchanter that I will hit the same brick wall at a certain level that my previous characters hit. <br>

What your class is has hardly seemed as important in my experience as oppossed to your time availability, and who you know.

Times are changing, but there are still several of us out there that prefer /shout to be reserved for certain roleplaying reasons.  I hear there are many that have it turned off.<br>

I have found that the best way to find a group is to go to a zone and talk to the people who are hunting there.   Announce your intentions, and you will usually be welcome.  I've never been turned down for RP reasons, but then again - my old high elf would have never asked to join a group of trolls either.<br>
<br>
My personal philosophy has always been this:  &quot;The more the Merrier!&quot;  If someone needs a group, and we have the space, I vote to let them in.  I am here to interact with others. <br>
<br>
It matters not if they are a rogue and I am already grouped with four other rogues:  &quot;Your blade is most welcome here!&quot;<br>

You try being a ranger with a pack of rogues... scary.<br>
<br>
The other way to get to know people is jsut, well, get to know people.  On the boards, participating in activities, RP channels sponsored by guilds or individuals, when you happen upon someone, etc.<br>
<br>
The only ones I see looking for the &quot;ideal&quot; team... well.. I personally dislike it for its exlusionary aspects and blue server feel (doing something for max mechanics, RP be hanged).  I don't care who the group is... if they are looking for jsut one kind of individual and don't want to see the value in anyone else even to try a different approach, then why are they playing here?  XP does not have to reign supreme.<br>
<br>
About being in a group with 3-4 rogues with a ranger as the healer/snare-er/fear-er/buffer... well... actually, our downtime was surprisingly low.  We'd take things down faster than they had time to really hit us.  Generally the only med breaks were for the mana drain of snare and those would usually end up being breaks for other things ((afk type)) as well since they were pretty infrequent since snare is not mana intensive.  Plus... the XP -was- coming in, a nice stream, not a trickle (near constant pulling -will- do that).<br>

Well, no...attitude</span><hr size=1> I'll group with mostly anyone.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't group with a necromancer or shadowknight for RP reasons (not only because I'm a &quot;good&quot; character and those are &quot;evil&quot; but also because my character's history has reasons to dislike those types).  I have grouped with some Tier'Dal clerics, as I haven't really had a reason to dislike them personally as long as they're polite.  I've also grouped sometimes with Iksar because my character knows little about them, and once with a couple of Ogres that said they followed Rallos Zek and were fighting the evil Mistmoore vampires, as we were on the same side.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I will look preferentially for a certain class for my groups (like if it's me, a paladin, a warrior and a ranger, I'm going to see if we can find a healer of some type), but that generally doesn't work too well, as there just aren't enough people around to be really picky.<br>
<br>
Hybrids are fairly useful on FV because in a small group when there aren't &quot;core&quot; classes available, they use every one of their other spells and skills.  Rangers, monks and rogues will tank, enchanters do some major fearing and DoTs when grouped with a snare class for fear kiting, clerics will melee and nuke, etc.<br>
<br>
In raid situations, the &quot;big 3&quot; classes will be needed.  But others are invited as well.  And most groups welcome pretty much anyone for whatever their talents may be. <p><div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"><BR>

<br>
Yes play what you like to play. I pay a druid on this server in his 51'st season. in the entire time I have been here I have been refused groups twice. Once while hunting hoppers I offered to group with another soloing hoppers as well and was turned down cause he wanted to solo. The other time was... hrm twas so long ago I don't remember the exact reason but it was not because  of the class I play. My general experience is that as long as you do not have a bad reputation here you won't be turned away from a group because of the class race you play.  You will se many many &quot;unconventional&quot; groupings here.<br>

Well, no...attitude</span><hr size=1> The keys have been said :<br>
<br>
1) Dont Solo up. By the 40's, you most likely need a few friends to get into a group easily.<br>
2) Dont shout for a group. Run around.. see if you can meet people, and then ask. Chances are you wont be refused if you try that way.<br>
3) Make a name for yourself. If you are known to rp, boardside and in game, things will get easier for you. Also, if you are known to be an asset in groups, it will be. <br>
<br>
Remember, that for a large amount of people on the server, level and equipment dont count as much as on a standard blue server. But those are specificly the people you wont find by shouting. They wont deny you, or reply 'we'll try for &lt;insert class here&gt;' a while longer. They just wont reply to your shout.<br>
<br>
I also had a little more luck with asking &quot;might you have use for my powers&quot; than &quot;u got room4me?&quot; I wont say that the latter wont get you into groups. But the chances are significantly lower.<br>
<br>
So - bottom line is - DO play what you want to play. But do play with and around others. Not alone. You might find that those 'chore' levels until you can have fun are a lot fewer than imagined. That is, if you keep an open mind and enjoy the challenge.<br>

I'll echo the above, be courteous and discreet, and as long as you can find a way to make the group work you usually won't have problems.  50+ things may tend more toward the &quot;ideal&quot; group but if you meet people you never know how you might end up.
