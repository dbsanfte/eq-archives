He is a handsome, bearded young man wearing an apprentice robe of the Order of Three (obtained during his recent studies in Qeynos), but his scholarly good looks are somewhat diminished by the weary, troubled expression on his face.  Times had been hard in Norrath lately, and there were many troubles about. <br><br>He stops dead and stares, open-mouthed, at the beautiful young woman who is working behind the bar.  Quickly, he shakes himself gently and continues to approach the bar, feeling a slow flush creep across his face.  He sits and clears his throat, then checks the contents of his purse.<br><br>A look of dismay crosses Vexis' face, quickly concealed.  Times were hard for a young adventurer, and his meager funds stated plainly that he should be ordering bog juice.  If they carried such a foul brew at this establishment.  He had planned to partake in quantity, not quality, this evening, but he knew that the beautiful bartender would not be impressed with a display of destitution.<br><br>Drixa comes over and asks for his order.  &quot;I'll have a mug of your best ale, milady&quot;, he says, trying to hid his wince at her quoted price.  The mug is soon delivered, and Vexis takes a small sip, finding it excellent.  He wishes he could afford to drink ale of this quality all the time.  Someday…<br><br>The bar is not very busy at this time of day, and Drixa busies herself nearby Vexis' stool, cleaning mugs.  He periodically glances furtively at the barmaid, blushing if she looks his way, and trying to work up the courage to say something to her.  He realizes that a great many more drinks will have to be quaffed before he will be able to work up the nerve.  Absentmindedly, he mumbles a spell, and assumes the form of one of the half-elven.<br><br>Glancing up, he sees the startled, questioning look on Drixa's face, mirrored on the faces of the other customers as well.  Ah, he had been too long in the wild, and had forgotten some of the niceties and considerations of civilization.  Of course it would be disconcerting for the others to see someone change form without any kind of warning.  Vexis grins apologetically, and says, by way of explanation, &quot;My hangovers are less serious when I drink in this form.  A trick of the elven blood, perhaps.  Or perhaps just my imagination.&quot;  He swallows a large draught of his ale.<br><br>Drixa flashes him a winning smile, which makes Vexis' knees go weak.  &quot;I am guessing that you are what the Erudites call a craftkeeper, and what the other races name an enchanter?&quot;<br><br>Vexis draws himself up proudly, but then his mind goes blank.  &quot;Aye, I am&quot;, he says, lamely.<br><br>Drixa eyes him curiously.  &quot;I know little of enchanters, or the magicks they wield.  I hear many tales of swordplay and beasts slain, gallant knights and treasures won.  Do you have any interesting tales?&quot; she says, again flashing that flirtatious smile (or so it appears to Vexis).<br><br>A tale?  Aye, perhaps a heroic tale would win her heart!  Or so he hoped.  Vexis was still unwise in the ways of women, having been cloistered for many years in the Academy of Arcane Science in Freeport.<br><br>Vexis nods, while taking a swallow of his ale, and thinks for a moment.  One tale comes to mind, and he begins.<br><br>&quot;I am an enchanter, as you correctly surmised, and this tale may tell you something about our powers.  It took place many months ago, when I was an enchanter of the 6th circle, or 20th rank, as is reckoned by those unfamiliar with the circles of magick.  This was before I lost my power.&quot;  Seeing the question in her eyes, he quickly says, &quot;Of that, I will not speak.&quot;<br><br>Drixa looks disappointed, and Vexis covers his embarassment, by taking another sip of his ale.  He looks upward a moment, trying to recover his train of thought, then continues.<br><br>&quot;This tale of mine concerns a comrade of mine named Bjorrn.  I knew him in my boyhood, when we were street urchins, and I met him again when I completed my studies at the Academy.  This was in Qeynos.  In the intervening years, he had become a well-practiced man of fortune.  A thief, in other words, but a gentlemanly rogue, and trustworthy, if he counted you as a friend.  He was of the 16th dagger at the time, as the thieves' guild reckons such things.&quot;<br><br>Vexis takes another sip of his mug, beginning to warm to his tale.   <br><br>&quot;As you may know, the gnolls of Blackburrow and the city of Qeynos are in a state of perpetual war.  The guards of Qeynos offer a bounty on gnoll fangs, and Blackburrow is filled with the spoils of many a raid that the gnolls have conducted.  Bjorrn and I found ourselves with our pockets empty, and being of an adventuresome frame of mind, decided to do our civic duty and venture within the burrow, and help to curb their numbers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We entered the burrow easily enough, and slew many a lone gnoll as we ventured deeper into the burrow.  There were many patrols and guards, but we were able to sneak past some and slay others, before they could raise the alarm.  Bjorrn was scouting ahead, sneaking through the dark places of the burrow, and we were always well forewarned of any gnolls that approached.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anyway, Bjorrn had scouted ahead and found a small chamber where four gnoll guards were playing cards.  Bjorrn said that there was a great deal of money on the table, and wanted me to come with him and see for myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I cast a minor spell on each of us so that we would be able to clearly see the other, and then wove a minor charm of invisibility around myself.  Following Bjorrn, as he moved silently and gracefully through the inky shadows, we soon reached the chamber and stared for a few moments, sizing up the gnolls.  They were not just ordinary guardsmen, but were the elite of the gnollish troops.  Bjorrn signalled me and we crept away from the entrance to the chamber.&quot; <br><br>“Bjorrn’s eyes sparkled with avarice as he faced me, but he was no fool.  He thought for a moment, weighing the odds.  ‘This will be a tough nut to crack.’, he said.  ‘Each and every one of those gnolls appear to be tough and well-trained, nearly my match in combat.  I could defeat any one of them, but any two together would spell my doom.  We shall need your skills.  Should we chance it?’, he said with a cocky grin.”<br><br>“I was always shocked by how much faith Bjorrn out in my skills, and in my opinion.  A terrible risk we were taking, and yet, I thought I could see how it might be done.  I was more experienced than Bjorrn, you see, and I did not think the gnolls would be able to resist my magicks.  ‘Aye, let us make the attempt’, I said, smiling back at Bjorrn with more confidence than I felt.  Quickly, we laid our plans.”<br><br>“He inspected his sword and dagger, and adjusted his dark clothing while I wove some protective magicks around us.  We would need every advantage.  Finally, I wove an enchantment that gave Bjorrn the quickness of a striking snake, so that he would be able to more quickly land his blows.  A short lasting and costly magick that, but well worthwhile.”<br><br>“Bjorrn slipped quietly into the room, and crept slowly through the shadows pooled around the table where the gnolls played their card game.  I waited just out of sight outside the chamber.  The plan called for Bjorrn to draw their attention, so that they did not notice my efforts until it was too late.  Time seemed to slow to a crawl as Bjorrn slowly made his way across the room.  Finally, he was in position behind the gnoll that faced the doorway to the chamber.  Quickly, Bjorrn struck before his presence was discovered, stabbing the gnoll in the back.”<br><br>Vexis pauses at this point, for his throat has gone dry.  He finishes off the mug in one long draught and waits while Drixa brings him another.  Taking another swallow, he resumes his tale.<br><br>&quot;Our plan worked.  None of the gnolls thought to run for help, or look around the room for other opponents.  All four charged Bjorrn with mindless ferocity.  For a brief moment, he fought desperately as the four gnolls slashed at him from all sides.  Then, I finished casting my spell, and instantly all four gnolls stopped swinging, staring slack-jawed into space.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, one of the magicks that we enchanters wield is the ability to mesmerize our opponents.  It only lasts a brief time, and is broken if the creature takes any sort of hurt, but it is a very effective magick.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anyway, three of the gnolls were under the spell, while Bjorrn gamely fought the fourth, who had awoken after a slash from Bjorrn's dirk.  I cast a curse upon Bjorrn's opponent that caused him to slow his attacks against my comrade.  Then, I knelt and tried to focus my energies for a moment.  We practitioners of the art can not weave magick indefinitely but must periodically meditate and regain our spent energies.  I briefly did this now, as I knew I would need every bit of power I possessed.  I caught a glance from Bjorrn and knew he was a little worried.  His opponent was badly wounded, but he was tiring, and had taken a few minor wounds himself in the initial flurry of combat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I stood and cast another magick upon one of the gnolls who stood frozen.  My charm was successful; instantly, my will became his.  I spoke a harsh command at the gnoll, and then began to renew the spell that held the other two gnolls.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Things were dicey for a moment there.  I had made a novice mistake, and mistimed my spell.  The three gnolls awoke from their sleep, and while the one whose will I controlled ran over to aid Bjorrn, gleefully slashing at his former friend, the other two charged me with barks of anger.  I stunned them both with a flash of color, then froze one in his tracks.  The other scored a slash along my ribs before Bjorrn and the gnoll whose mind I controlled came to my rescue.  They had slain their opponent.&quot;<br><br>Vexis takes another swallow from his mug.  &quot;I cursed their opponent, then knelt again to try to regain some of my spent energies, only standing briefly at one point to renew the spell that held the other enemy gnoll motionless.  I was fortunate: I could feel the gnoll whose mind I controlled struggling against my will, but I was able to keep him fighting at Bjorrn's side.  Together, they slew the gnoll they faced.  Two down.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bjorrn had been wounded further, and he wisely decided to back out of the combat, as I commanded the charmed gnoll to slay the last enemy gnoll.  The enemy gnoll tried to attack me instead of fighting his former comrade, but I caused his feet to adhere to the floor of the chamber, and he was forced to first defend himself, and then attack in return once his native bloodlust had been aroused by his wounds.  The two traded blow after blow.  It was a close thing, but the enemy gnoll fell to the ground, his life flowing from several horrific wounds.  His former comrade stood over him, panting with exhaustion, and almost as equally wounded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bjorrn had used his brief respite from combat to staunch the bleeding of his wounds, and he had recovered some of his strength.  He took his position near the last gnoll and nodded at me.  I broke the charm that enslaved the gnoll's will.  The gnoll tried to flee and summon help, but he was so badly wounded that he cpould only move at a slow, shuffling crawl.  Bjorrn slew him with a single backstab.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bjorrn flashed me a quick grin as he began to rifle through the pockets of one of the gnolls.  His grin seemed to say that he had never had any doubts about the outcome.  It had been a close thing though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We divided the winnings on the table and in the pockets of the gnolls, and set up an ambush in the chamber.  We slew many of the gnoll elite as they returned from guard duty, and even slew a gnoll commander who had the misfortune to poke his snout into the room.  All in all, it was a profitable day for us, and we dealt the gnolls a grievous blow.  Although, I am given to understand that they eventually recovered from the loss.  They are a prolific species.&quot;<br><br>Vexis drinks a long draught of his ale and looks up at Drixa, trying to determine if her tale had pleased her.  &quot;A worthy tale&quot;, she says, smiling.  &quot;Pardon me a moment, I have another customer.&quot;<br><br>After she leaves, Vexis begins to blush, feeling a little foolish.  Had her smile been one of mockery?  She had doubtless heard epic tales of battles against giants and dragons.  And he had been trying to impress her with a tale of his struggles against the gnolls of Blackburrow!  What a fool he had been!<br><br>His look of embarassment begins to change to a fond smile, as he remembers back to that day long ago.  Perhaps it had not been an epic battle, but it had seemed epic.  Bjorrn and he had stood on a knife-edge, with glory on one side and death on the other, and had prevailed, against long odds.  Perhaps it had been a worthy tale.  He smiles and has another drink. <p>Vexis Larseker<BR>Seneschal of 1st Fist of Light<BR>Enchanter of the 3rd Circle (8th Rank)<BR>Email me at <a href=mailto:gravesrh@erols.com>gravesrh@erols.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=65.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
