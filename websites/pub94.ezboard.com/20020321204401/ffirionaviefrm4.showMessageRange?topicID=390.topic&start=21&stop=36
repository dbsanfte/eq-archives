Funny thing happened to Aelfwine the other day. We had bought our wedding cakes off a very nice high elf last week. I had met up with her and made the purchase. He happened to see her the other day and Hail'd her just to thank her for the cakes, and instead of replying, she gave him Clarity and kept on going, lol. We figure she gets so many requests that she just automatically assumes that's what people want. He then sent her a tell thanking her for the Clarity and the wedding cakes. <p>Narie<br>

Take a play out of my playbook and bite their heads off a few times.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (No, seriously, I don't do that.)<br>
<br>
Part of the problem may be your presentation.  In what you've presented, you hedge an awful lot in order to be polite.  It might serve everyone better if you were more blunt:  &quot;No, I'm sorry, I don't have the time to do that right now, but maybe some other time?&quot;<br>
<br>
Being polite doesn't mean capitulating to everyone's requests.  If you did that, you'd never get to level.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest being polite but firm.  I've turned down friends' requests when I'm dead-serious about moving tailoring up, for example, but I always let them know I'm available for future requests.<br>
<br>
I'd turn down every request to powerlevel, though.  And I might be downright rude about it, too.<br>

I play enchanters only...and while I don't get the tells for ports or sows...I do get the guilt tells about grouping. (Well on my old server anyway). You know...along the lines of...&quot;if you don't group with us we cant do anything&quot;....&quot;please come on we have been looking for 2 hours and you are the only enc not in a group&quot;....etc. I used to give in and group where and when I didn't want to...and that just made me cranky lol. Got to the point I was hiding from friends and guildmates alike. Thing was sometimes I logged into EQ when I just wanted to chat with friends and didn't have the time or the energy to group. People didn't want to hear that. Not when they &quot;had&quot; to have the &quot;perfect&quot; group in order to move 2 inches from a town. After a while I got angry at myself for letting others effect my game &quot;life&quot; so much I rather avoid it then come have my fun. So I just started telling people ....&quot;Thanks for asking, I appreciate the offer...but I am not in the mood to group tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;. And if they kept after me...or even got angry and surly...I would just keep being nice and polite and say No. And I would smile a lot in my tells. Nothing seems to shut people down then you keep being nice and happy and just say &quot;No thank you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot; over and over. Anyway...not exactly what you are upset about...guess my point is everyone gets this in some form or another...and your best bet is to be honest and nice. Even to guildmates and friends. If they really are your friends they will understand you aren't a trick pony just their for their use. Only time I will always help is a CR...other then that...sorry my game time is just as valuable and for my enjoyment as the next players.  <p><b>Spring Starwind</b>

<br>
Was in Qeynos working on my baking when I get a tell from an aquaintance that is lower in level by me. He tells me he is in trouble in Blackburrow, would I mind helping him? Well, a request like that, of course I'm going to help, figured it was a CR or something like that, I drop everything, run to BB, tell him I'm at the first level and he says he is on his way. He comes up, obviously not on a CR, but with the three gnolls way out of his league that he had pulled when he heard I was there and wanted me to stand there and heal him while he fought all three, all green to me. I just couldn't believe it. I healed him for those three simply because I didn't want him to train everyone else up there if I left him to his own defenses. I was livid and explained to him that I would not be helping him any further, he was actually bummed out about it and put out with me for not staying. I just couldn't believe it, actually tricked me into coming by making me think he was in trouble.  He thought nothing of my time that he had wasted at all and really didn't understand at all why I was upset about it. <p>Narie<br>

Well, in retrospect I should've killed all three of the gnolls instead of letting him do it, but of course, I didn't think of it at the time. My jaw was still dropped from what was happening, hehe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, the people that are my friends and the guildmates I would do absolutely anything for, are the ones that never ask for a thing, or if they do, it is something so small as to be inconsequential, compared to all they've done for me. <p>Narie<br>

If you are being completely bothered by a guild member, it's your responsibility to talk to an officer and get the situation taken care of, if you can't take care of it on your own. <br>
I'm not worried about my guild when it comes to port requests when I turn 29, I enjoy helping them and they are always helping me and I am comfortable with what I should expect once I am able to group port. I feel it's part of my job within the guild itself. I don't feel like I will be overburdened with port requests 3 times an hour every hour. Should that happen however, and a guild member were to get out of hand with constant porting expectations, I am completely comfortable in talking to any of our officers and know that they would take care of the situation immediately.<br>
If you are feeling like the only reason you are even in the guild is to be their taxi, and you are not enjoying yourself at all, then you need to make some changes and have some talks and get something changed. <p>Narie<br>

Horacio, normally I'd say I don't want or expect any presents at all, but now that I think about it. A pair of pants, something, anything, that will cover up the hiney. It just isn't proper for a soon to be married woman to be running around with her buttcheeks hanging out. Do pants even exist for half elf druid females that don't look like garters, sheesh. Woops, but that's a whole other rant :P <p>Narie<br>

It's those personal tells that came from no where that get me.  <br>
<br>
Besides, we had a pretty fun way of dividing porting jobs in the guild.  All the druids and wizard roll for it.  0 to 100.  Lowest gets to go pick up the first batch (this is of course in raid situations), and then so on so on.  We had druids promptly sworn that she would quit any attempts at gambling after she rolled a 19, but then got on her knees and thank Tunare when another rolled 11. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

It was around 1:45 EST and I was about to log off.  I had not slept much the night before and needed some sleep as I had work this morning.  Anyway, I am a level 41 druid and I was sitting outside the Kelethin bank about to log.  I got a tell from a one-time acquaintance from another guild who I had helped out in once in the past.  On the first instance a couple weeks ago, she was completely nekked and needed a port for a corpse run to Paw.  My first thought was why she wasn't bound at the gypsy ring in NK but I clearly saw her need and ported her to NK, sow'd her and showed her how to get to the wizzy spires from the druid port.  She thanked me and that was that.<br>
<br>
Last night at 1:45 in the morning with work the next day, she sent me a tell asking if I was about to log, which I replied that I was.  She then asked me to do several things before I log: (i) port her to surefall glade (easy enough), (ii) guiding her from surefall glade to some undislcosed location in everfrost so she could meet someone who was supposed to give here something (hmmm...this goes above and beyond your typical request) and (iii) then porting to her to some other location, which she expected to be WC.  I politely responded that I needed to log soon as I was exhausted and had work the next morning.  She then pleaded that she would give me 20pp and a telescope she insisted was worth 60pp.  I kindly replied that it wasn't about the money but that I was exhausted and really needed to sleep and suggested that I was not the only person on the server able to port her.  She then sent more tells saying it would only take a half an hour and expressing her displeasure at my actions.  I commenced to put her on my ignore list (the first so far) and logged.<br>
<br>
As they say, no good deed goes unpunished...<br>
