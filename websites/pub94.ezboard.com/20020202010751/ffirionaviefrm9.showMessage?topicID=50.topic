How can the next step not be 'Ogre bashes gnome!'?  There are infinite scenarios in which conflict between players would make perfect roleplaying sense.  The lack of ability for good and evil characters to fight against each other hurts the potential for roleplaying too much IMO. <p><B>Vachir</B><BR>

Seriously, for a storyteller roleplayer, the fighting is not important and not required. Not required at all. If it is required by someone to be able to RP... then the RP is shallow. .. well ... it is not my sort of RP anyway. Futhermore, many of us hate PvP and the possiblities for having others enforce their 'roleplay' on you to actively ruin your session, with you having no option but to be the victim in THEIR story (even if you win, if you never wanted to fight at all) and not the protagonist of yours. If this server had been PvP .. I'd not be here, and neither would many others.<br>
<br>
PvP and RP are two very different things. If you haven't realized by now, learn it now: although some people love PvP AND love RP. and see them as natural partners, as you do, many others love RP but hate PvP. People like me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Perhaps that ogre player has to learn to more than one response to every situation.<br>
<br>
If you *really* feel this way, go to a Zek server. It is what they are for, people who love PvP. <p>------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>

Again this would assume the reason the ogre does not attack the gnome is because he has a high chance of losing, not because the game prevents him from doing so.  <br>

Yes PvP and RP are not the same thing, but they are not opposed to one another by any means.  Paladins and Shadow Knights, Druids and Necromancers, Dark elves and High elves, there are just some situations in which PvP does make sence.  Of course there are situations in which PvP is not a sensable solution but there are also those where it is.  My argument would be that lack of PvP prevents roleplaying solutions to situations rather than encouraging them, how else would you suggest a group of elves stop a PoG raid by an evil guild? <p><B>Vachir</B><BR>

PvP is fun when people actually RP with it, but usually, you get the little 12 year old who is pissed cause mommy locked him in his room until he finishes his homework and he wants to take out his frustrations on other players.<br>

<br>
I guess you could use duels but /d is only 1v1, for that to work well you would need to be able to have groups duel each other or in fact multiple groups dueling multiple other groups.  This would become a real pain to set up in situations like trying to break up a dragon or plane raid by those of opposing allignments.  The real problem is that /d has to be accepted to work, of course that group doing cazic wouldn't accept your duel, they're just there to get their phat lewtz and have no intrest in PvP, even in a roleplaying context of a group of iksar coming to the aid of their diety.  <br>
<br>
From the initial concept of FV I thought everything looked good except for the lack of PvP, with the language barrier and anti-grouping/guilding rules it would be impossible to have 'griefers' as in 12 year olds running around shouting 'I pwnz0rd j00' as you could interpret random ogre attacks on defenseless gnomes any way you want to from a RP perspective.  While it's perfectly viable to have a peace loving high elf cleric who lives his entire life without the use of a weapon it's just as viable to have a rallos-zek following ogre who's only goal in life is to bash anything that moves.  Should the ogre not be able to kill the elf because the elf doesn't want to die or is this restricting the ogre because it prevents him from fulfilling his purpose?  Sorry, but I just can't accept a RP scenario in which good and evil coexist without being in conflict with one another. <p><B>Vachir</B><BR>

I do not believe fighting always has to be a part of roleplaying, but there are some scenarios where it gets trite and circular when the only 'response' you can do between two groups of people that oppose each other is fill the shout channel with meaningless taunts.  I think there are many possible responses, but there comes a time when fighting becomes a part of the roleplaying, and /duel just doesn't cut it.<br>
<br>
Five evils come across Seven goodies and start to taunt and banter with each other.  That is as far as it can go without PvP.  With duel, there are no group strategies that can be used, and two people will be left out.  The time spent figuring out (ooc) who should fight whom removes the roleplaying element even further and if one side refuses the duel it is a big /yawn.  Nobody is going to give in or back down through /shout or /say banter so it grows tiresome.<br>
<br>
Just because some people (it isn't always 12 year olds, in fact most of them are 20-40 year olds that have the mentality of 12 year olds) don't know how to properly control themselves in a roleplaying situation does not mean PvP is bad.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I think PvP is something that should be a switch that you can turn off and on as you wish (though not while in combat).  GMs do this all of the time when doing quests, why shouldn't we be able to?  Just put a trigger that doesn't allow you to turn it off if someone is attacking you and you won't have people abusing it.  Or what the heck... why not?  If you don't want to die, then just let us turn it off an on any time we want.  How would this be an abuse?  It would allow for US to choose when we wish to be in combat.<br>
<br>
But it is completely un-realistic to have a gnome run into a group of ogres and 'banter' with them without any fear of being whacked.  It is also boring as get out to just hear threats and taunts as some weak excuse at roleplaying conflict.  It isn't creative at all... it's been done a blue-zillion time before all in the same way.  I wouldn't even have a problem with them making the 'home zones' of a race at least PvP to all races considered enemies.  That way you wouldn't have halflings sitting invis on the newbie log in Nektulos where the worst anyone can do is 'verbally dance' with them.  What a joke.<br>
<br>
Maybe another idea is to have a PvP 'arena' part of each zone so that you don't have to run to the Arena every time you want to have an actual fight or resort to *yawn* duelling.  Mabye at least make each homeland zone PvP to any race considered an enemy race.<br>

Roleplaying without any degree of PvP is a war of words, and after a while people grow tired of seeing the same bullies yelling at each other across the playground.

That's no more conductive to roleplaying than being non-PvP. If the restrictions are lifted, the server becomes little different from Sullon Zek. <p><FONT COLOR=#656565><I>It is pitch black.

If you want to PvP, that's how you do it.<br>
I don't feel like being forced into a situation where I can be killed by any marauding person seven levels higher than me while I'm just going about my business. ESPECIALLY if they are to enter MY home and go about killing whomever they want, that is truly as unrealistic as you say not having PvP is. And believe me, since I live in Paineel, and have numerous non Cazicite foreigners there this situation would happen often.<br>

No, a PvP area in each zone won't solve the &quot;I don't want to fight&quot; situation, which is fine, but it would offer people an alternative if the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> want to fight battles without breaking the RP.<br>
<br>
The point is that we want to have a control over it when we do want to fight, or at least be aware of where there might be danger (ie PvP in home zones) so that we can include some degree of fighting without the current inadequate limitations.<br>
<br>
In the original example, if the gnome doesn't want to fight, he shouldn't be forced to, unless of course he goes into a situation where he is aware that he risks 'getting eaten'.<br>
<br>
No, /duel and /guildwar aren't a PvP switch at all.  /duel is limited to two people, which is very unrealistic when it involves any situation with more than two people.  /guildwar was still bugged last I recall, but even if it isn't, it involves having to get everyone into two guilds and a lot of planning and organization.  Not everyone that fights will be in a guild, nor even in the same guilds.<br>
<br>
If you had a PvP switch, you wouldn't be forced into anything.  You wouldn't have to join a guild, you wouldn't have to do anything but turn it on when you want to fight and off when you are done.<br>
<br>
Arkitip - I'm glad if you're happy with the current situation, but that doesn't mean it is the best way or the only way.  /duel doesn't solve every situation... you're right it's the best we have now, but it doesn't have to be the only possibility.  There are plenty of limitations that could be placed on the PvP home realm situation, as they have been working on with the team servers.  At least some of us are trying to come up with alternatives to improving the game and what little 'realism' we might gain in this fantasy game.  Not all suggestions will work, but just accepting everything 'as is' would have never yielded us this server to begin with.

I think perhaps all zones within 1 or 2 zones of a city should be PvP, with the exception of oceans (death on boat = corpse at bottom of ocean, not fun) <p>For a good time click <A HREF="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthescurvydogbuffetfrm1.showMessage?topicID=47.topic">here.</A> <BR><BR>

I really doubt that anyone here is going to stop playing the game due to the current rule set, or they would have already.  Chit chatting about how they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> might</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> make the game better has no bearing on whether I am having fun or not.

That being said, my suggestion wasn't about cities having Arenas.  That actually serves no purpose except for those of the same 'alignment' (so to speak) that want to RP a duel.  Granted, dark elves can make it through Freeport to the arena, but that's about it.  I don't believe that Trolls can, at least not without a bit of faction work.  I know plenty that were KoS by default.  What evil races can get in Halas (or would want to), Rivervale or Qeynos?  What good races can get into Neriak or Cabilis?  I don't mean invising in and all that jazz, I mean simply arranging for a PvP type encounter?  That pretty much leaves The Arena for having any 'fair' combat RPed out.  Not exactly convenient for spur of the minute action.<br>
<br>
I agree that making at least an Arena available in the newbie zones near cities (and one in GF) would at least provide for the opportunity for larger battles to take place.<br>
<br>
Do you have to have PvP to roleplay?  No.  But there are a lot of things you don't have to have.  I'm not talking realism as in the real world, I am talking about realism as in the opportunity to provide a forum that makes more sense for those that want larger scale battles (or those smaller scale chance encounters) but don't want to go to The Arena to do it.  It wouldn't impede on anyone else's fun, but would provide for something that would equate to the encounters one might find in a fantasy novel or movie.  That's all.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of things that aren't realistic about EQ, and there are plenty of things that are put in for the sake of realism that don't enhance the game.  <br>
<br>
I was in many roleplaying stories when Bristlebane first opened.  That was back when all duels were broadcast serverwide, for those that are newer to the game.  It was quite annoying to have ambushes and large scale encounters that involved creative dueling.  Yes, we did the best we could, but it would have been so much nicer to have the opportunity to have group combat instead of lots of single duels.  Am I saying the game <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> has</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have something better?  No.  But I think the game could have something better that wouldn't impede on anyone else. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=50.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessage?topicID=34.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessage?topicID=55.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.firiona-vie.com/images/arfv.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=50.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=50.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=50.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
