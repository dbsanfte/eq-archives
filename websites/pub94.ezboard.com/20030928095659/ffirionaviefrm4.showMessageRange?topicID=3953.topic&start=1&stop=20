These people have been long standing friends and excellent raiders within our guild, and when they decided to make the jump to FnF, I respected their decision and wished them well. I even put a nice little post on the FnF boards, recommending them, and congratulating FnF on their change in policy to allow e-bay folks into the guild. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just wanted to put in a plug here for all the recent applicants from AD you guys just got/are in the process of getting. The group we collectively refer to as &quot;Team Cookeville&quot; are a very nice group of people. Groggle is funny, well equipped and a skilled warrior. Horze seems to have more strategy information than anyone I've ever met an is able to skillfully play illustrumn and skern while botting the cleric in a heal chain. Coer also a rather funny guy, if you can get over the fact he is an assling. <br>
<br>
These people are friendly, witty, and skilled players and I'm glad to see you guys are finally accepting them as such, regardless of their ebay background. Since they essentially made up the core of the ebay toons in our guild, maybe now we will shake the 'ebay guild' nickname we've had for so long, though given the choice of having the players or loosing the nickname, I'd choose having the players. I wish them all luck in FnF. <br>

Somehow, Xoraxis saw fit to remove this post, which indicated to me that either<br>
<br>
1) He was not really planning on letting E-bay folks into the guild and recruited these people solely for the purpose of creating problems in AD<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
2) Planned to let e-bay folks into FnF, a rather large change in existing FnF policy, but was embarrassed of his policy to the point of deleting a 'Grats' postings off his message board.<br>
<br>
Later, he saw fit to send me a series of very hostile tells, calling me everything from a backstabber to a loot whore(Screenshots taken, but not attached) while informing me he was removing my post from his boards. He acted like I had shot his dog, had sex with his mother, stole the family fortune, and whored out his sister all in the same day. Back down bro, I didnt even mention your name in that post.<br>
<br>
Xoraxis, this message is for you. I could give two flying fucks whether you let e-bay people into your guild or not. Its been our policy since guild creation that we evaluate people playing the toons, not the source of the toons themselves. In guild chat we've often chuckled that we've been called the 'Ebay guild' based on the fact we had a few ebay toons in our guild. Now that those toons are headed to your guild, I'm sure many will relish calling FnF the new 'E-Bay guild'. It never bothered me, grow up a bit an it wont bother you either. You sir, are a buffoon. Deleting posts off your boards can only ever lead to posts being posted in a more public forum.<br>
<br>
IMO, better you be a buffoon than a complete ass, like you will appear to be if you don't let these people into your guild because you've changed your mind about e-bay. They are good people and solid raiders.<br>
<br>
Oh, and regarding me being a loot whore, I welcome any forum that might have AD describing my looting habits to FnF guildies describing your looting habits. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thepromisebreakers.com/knatassig2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=omertagrowspot>omerta growspot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 5:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3953.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Censorship, got any other bright ideas?</span><hr size=1> been in AD about 3 months... i cant remember one time knatas/kkarma got a piece of loot. the officers always put others before them in the best interest of the guild as a whole. im just glad we are no longer &quot;team ebay&quot;. grats on the new title <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iceborn>Iceborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 5:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3953.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> Damn!<br>

Obviously you post was merely intentioned to ruffle some feathers and you're disappointed that the post was removed as opposed to being filled with counterposts that you could have tried to exercise some wit against...I can identify with that sentiment.<br>

&gt;----<br>
&gt;  Because I think you all deserve an explanation, and because I don't wish <br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt;be misunderstood.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;First off, I wish to make it clear that I don't really care about ebay one<br>
&gt;way or the other. I support people's freedom to buy and sell characters if<br>
&gt;they wish to, and from our applicants I require that they play their class<br>
&gt;well and that they are going to stay with us for the long term. I see <br>
&gt;merits<br>
&gt;in both arguments for and against allowing ebayed characters into a guild,<br>
&gt;but that isn't what this is about.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;We've been told time and time again that Fire and Fury would never allow an<br>
&gt;ebayed character in as long as Xoraxis was guild leader. Xoraxis has turned<br>
&gt;down applicants because he had reason to believe they were bought. He has<br>
&gt;insulted those guilds that do allow ebay, and publically made Fire and<br>
&gt;Fury's official position as that of not allowing ebay. I never really <br>
&gt;agreed<br>
&gt;that this was our formal policy, but I did respect Xoraxis' position to <br>
&gt;make<br>
&gt;gulid policies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Now Xoraxis wishes to allow ebayed applicants, which to the astute among <br>
&gt;you<br>
&gt;would contradict the &quot;never&quot; part of the above clauses.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I do not wish to be associated with lies and hypocrisy, and I can't support<br>
&gt;our guild if nothing we say can be said with a clear conscience. I can't<br>
&gt;face the rest of this server behind a veil of deceit. I don't want to be in<br>
&gt;a guild where my guild leader doesn't speak the truth.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;What's worse is not simply the fact that Xoraxis' words mean nothing. It's<br>
&gt;that he didn't change his mind, he wasn't convinced that his previous<br>
&gt;convictions were incorrect, but he is compromising his beliefs simply<br>
&gt;because it's the easy way out.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I'm not the only one that should leave. Anyone who holds truth as an ideal<br>
&gt;and honesty as a necessity of human existence should as well. But, you are<br>
&gt;all free to make your own choices.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I would rejoin, under the following conditions:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;1) Xoraxis' rejection of those applicants that were bought through ebay as<br>
&gt;has been done in the past. Or an official and public discussion of our<br>
&gt;guild's policies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;2) An apology from Xoraxis to all our members for openly lying to us.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;3) A promise from Xoraxis that what we hear from him will be the truth.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Otherwise, bye.<br>

&gt;  Xoraxis is only doing what he feels best for the guild.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;With this said I am concerned that these changes are being brought to the<br>
&gt;guild without much discussion if any. I must agree with Ww that with all <br>
&gt;the<br>
&gt;reso bashing for their guildng of ebays that our even considering them is<br>
&gt;only showing our words to be hollow. Also while we are not a democracy I<br>
&gt;would hope we are not also a dictatorship. If the will of the masses is<br>
&gt;ignored then there is eventually revolution desired or not.<br>

&gt;  I log on to have fun. Progreesion is fun. Regression is not fun. If <br>
&gt;Xoraxis<br>
&gt;is going to swallow his own words and do something like this then I have no<br>
&gt;doubts he is doing what he thinks will help the guild. My experience with<br>
&gt;ebay was not bad. We had one ebayed toon in my last guild that I knew <br>
&gt;about.<br>
&gt;He was under heavy scrutiny for a long time but ended up being one of the<br>
&gt;nicest people that I knew in the guild. It was the person that bought<br>
&gt;Demiath and he was a great guy.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I am not here to argue right or wrong. I want to play and have fun. I am <br>
&gt;not<br>
&gt;here to create drama or make waves. Whatever the leadership supports I will<br>
&gt;support. If doing this hurts the guild and alot of senior members leave <br>
&gt;then<br>
&gt;it will need to be stopped. If majority thinks the change will help us grow<br>
&gt;stronger then I support it. I personally am neutral. I see pros and cons<br>
&gt;both ways. But as it stands now we only support ebay in one<br>
&gt;direction....out. Thats not helping the guild at all.<br>

&gt;point too tired to really care or focus. He had also said earlier that some<br>
&gt;info was already on the board, where?<br>
&gt;Other than the ebays I think ancient darkness is a good guild for the most<br>
&gt;part that will greatly help us advance in the elementals. I pray that I<br>
&gt;remember right in the fact that we can vote on them one by one and not as a<br>
&gt;whole group<br>

&gt;And, clearly, I don't consider the case in our guild to be the same. If you<br>

&gt;  if you read nueeliens post and use leet deduction skills such as only<br>
&gt;sherlock holmes (or myself) would have, you could derive that we're <br>
&gt;probably<br>
&gt;merging (absorbing, whatever) with Ancient Darkness, and they have ebayed<br>
&gt;characters in their ranks, including some who have previously been guilded<br>
&gt;with us (pre-Ebay). Witherweaver is quite incensed about this as he feels<br>
&gt;Xor is going back on his word about not letting ebays in, which is <br>
&gt;obviously<br>
&gt;somewhat.. uh... dishonest/hypocritical/etc., and will give us a bad rep.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;so, now that we know whats going on, my opinion follows!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;i'm sorry WW, but i disagree with you. your point is VERY valid and i am by<br>
&gt;no means saying it is wrong. Maybe it IS a cop out to do this, maybe it IS<br>
&gt;the easy way out... but i feel that desperate times call for desperate<br>
&gt;measures. i personally am at the point where i don't even enjoy logging in<br>
&gt;anymore, for a number of reasons. anything that will help us get back on <br>
&gt;our<br>
&gt;feet and progress i am all for, our &quot;rep&quot; and this whole fucking server be<br>
&gt;damned. i really don't feel you should fault Xor for trying to find a way <br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt;get us back to where we were. i agree with rollen in that i hope we can at<br>
&gt;least discuss this as a guild before deciding to let them in because i know<br>
&gt;its a heated subject. but i personally don't give a good goddamn what the<br>
&gt;server thinks of us, or whatever words or convictions we went back on, i<br>
&gt;just want to progress and finish this damn expansion instead of sputtering<br>
&gt;out just before the end. i will support whatever changes Xoraxis makes as<br>
&gt;long as it keeps us moving and makes this game fun again. i know alot<br>
&gt;probably don't agree with me but uh... what else is new<br>

&gt;  Yes Will. It's AD, and to say they have some perchased toons is to say <br>
&gt;that<br>
&gt;Maine has some trees.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Hypocrisy:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;1.        The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one<br>
&gt;does not hold or possess; falseness.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Putting aside ones beliefs does not make one a hypocrite. In this case, <br>
&gt;Xora<br>
&gt;isn't saying the perchased toons are good now, even though he believes<br>
&gt;otherwise...he's saying they may be nessisary now, even though he believes<br>
&gt;they aren't a good idea.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Hell, I once said I would never join Fire and Fury...but these things<br>
&gt;change. The needs of the individual and the needs of the guild change a <br>
&gt;lot.<br>
&gt;In this case, the guild needs more people to be able to advance, so Xoraxis<br>
&gt;(the individual) needs to put his beliefs aside.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;It's not hypocrisy, it's not a veil of deceit, it's changing a policy<br>
&gt;because it's percieved to be needed.<br>

&gt;  Agree with norok, however.. AD has some people that don't deserve to wear<br>
&gt;this tag , being guilded with someone like Braellar will make me leave. I<br>
&gt;think that this should really have been discussed with the guild, not just<br>
&gt;flat out told that this is how its going to be without our imput. I<br>
&gt;understand that what is happening is for the good of the guild, but a <br>
&gt;change<br>
&gt;this big deserves everyones imput, or at least more people than just the<br>
&gt;officers. Lots of people have put time into this guild and should have a <br>
&gt;say<br>
&gt;in where it goes.<br>

&gt;The difference in my view is that I do not see this as lies and hypocrisy. <br>
&gt;I<br>
&gt;see it as a changing of opinion. I never saw people who bought a character<br>
&gt;as the debil.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I think the ebay thing will have less impact on people than the fact that<br>
&gt;many of us know so many of the people in that guild that I am not sure how <br>
&gt;a<br>
&gt;mass application would work. I have alot of friends in AD, but I am sure<br>
&gt;there are some people I have had bad encounters with as well. I would think<br>
&gt;alot of others here will feel the same way. I worry about that more than<br>
&gt;anything else but Xor already said people will be judged individually and <br>
&gt;we<br>
&gt;do not have to take in the asshats.<br>

&gt;  1) Xoraxis' rejection of those applicants that were bought through ebay <br>
&gt;as<br>
&gt;has been done in the past. Or an official and public discussion of our<br>
&gt;guild's policies.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;2) An apology from Xoraxis to all our members for openly lying to us.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;3) A promise from Xoraxis that what we hear from him will be the truth.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;1.) I'm not rejecting members we desperately need, however, if you wish to<br>
&gt;start a discussion it's your right.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;2.) I am sorry that I have to do this, but I have to do this. We can merge,<br>
&gt;or we can die. In the past i've been against ebay, but people change, and<br>
&gt;the fact that FNF is still around is a testament to that. And the fact that<br>
&gt;you're calling me on this after the position i'm in is pretty shitty.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;3.) I've done my best to adhere to this. If you're going to start taking<br>
&gt;quotes i've said from months ago and then applying them when unexpected<br>
&gt;things come up, when things happen so that peoples minds change...I do my<br>
&gt;best to tell the truth, but if you're saying someone cannot change, or<br>
&gt;adapt, then I don't know how anyone will be able to adhere to this.<br>

&gt;  Change is an awesome thing.<br>

&gt;I guess WW would have fought for the South in the Civil War, or perhaps<br>
&gt;would have died fighting for the British in the American Revolution.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Instead, maybe we can step back and realize that change is how <br>
&gt;civilizations<br>
&gt;survive. It is what makes humans so cool. We are willing to consider and do<br>
&gt;things we had previously either thought impossible, or had even decided<br>
&gt;against.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Quit the guild? Demand apologies before coming back? I love ya WW but I<br>
&gt;think your calculator needs new batteries.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;We dont have the numbers to advance. This server is a very dificult server<br>
&gt;to maintain a high end guild on. We have absorbed/merged with 3 guilds to<br>
&gt;date (AS, DS, PD), so this concept is not a new one.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I congratulate Xoraxis for being able to set his ego aside and do what is<br>
&gt;best for this Guild.<br>

&gt;  Wither, Really don't know what to say I love your loyalty to an ideal<br>
&gt;however misplaced I might think it is. Thats what makes a guild great<br>
&gt;diversity, see so many different people thinking so many different ways and<br>
&gt;most of the time we end up keeping each other in check somehow. However I<br>
&gt;think this time you are taking it a little too far (I don't mean to insult<br>
&gt;you so please don't take offense). I think when Xor said this isnt a<br>
&gt;democracy what he should have said was &quot;Just trust me to do what is best <br>
&gt;for<br>
&gt;the guild&quot;. And I do, I have no doubt in my mind he will do what it takes <br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt;make this guild survive.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;What good is this ideal if we crumble as a guild? Would you rather have the<br>
&gt;guild fail and break up than to see an ideal change? Think carefully about<br>
&gt;that, this is so much bigger than some words that were said before. Like<br>
&gt;Penrif I also said &quot;I will never join Fire and Fury&quot; my my how times change<br>
&gt;I am happier in game than I have ever been and its all thanks to you guys.<br>
&gt;So I guess what I am trying to say is this, don't get hung up on something<br>
&gt;that will seem so trivial later.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;However if you find you just can't get past this one thing then its <br>
&gt;probably<br>
&gt;time for you to move on and if that is your choice I wish you luck sir it<br>
&gt;has been an honor to be guilded with you.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;You are repeating the history of Kerg; believe it or not. Kerg did this to<br>
&gt;Xoraxis over a measly item gotten through the Seru key quest. He came out<br>
&gt;with a long accusatory post that was all misguided speculation.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I appreciate your concern; especially over honor. I have often had my own<br>

&gt;  Well, its also not an 'all or nothing' deal so to speak so there will not<br>
&gt;be for example any ebayers FORCED upon us. Perhaps, and im going from<br>
&gt;information provided last night, we should look at this as merely the<br>
&gt;application of multible members of the raiding core of AD. If someone that<br>
&gt;happend to be an EBayer were to apply and they were a complete and total<br>
&gt;dipshit that had obviously no fucking clue what they were doing, i think<br>
&gt;Xora would have but little qualms in telling them they should be castrated<br>
&gt;with a rusted ginsu and give them the proverbial /boot.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;That being said, I must say I am not /excited/ at the prospect of dealing<br>
&gt;with even /more/ people that i do not know. Its been difficult enough to<br>
&gt;learn who was what, ect. I still catch myself self doing /who's on raids<br>
&gt;trying to remember who is of what class in order to get a buff. This is<br>
&gt;probably a reflection of the fact i choose not to exp (for the most part) <br>
&gt;on<br>
&gt;FV (other than to help others, i have no reason to). Regardless of this, I<br>
&gt;do recognize as a raid leader myself that we do have a definate need for a<br>
&gt;few dedicated souls, as is typcial. We /have/ the numbers for Xegony /IF/<br>
&gt;everyone logs in and during the summer, thats a big if.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Anyway, I dont have a problem with Xoraxis and his handling of this<br>
&gt;situation because of a couple factors, A) he has not become (nor will the<br>
&gt;guild) avid supporters of ebay -- hes just willing to accept the 'good' <br>
&gt;ones<br>
&gt;if they prove themselves as such and B) As i stated above, its not an all <br>
&gt;or<br>
&gt;nothing thing so we will have the luxury of discarding any dumbasses that<br>
&gt;happened to have a paypal account.<br>

&gt;Its his job to make the guild work. It was great when we could afford to<br>

&gt;  Xoraxis will do what he thinks is best, and the rest of us can do what we<br>

&gt;a discussion thread for each one of them, in which Ebay info will come out.<br>
&gt;When the time to vote comes, I will vote no on each and every single<br>
&gt;Ebay'er, irregardless of skill.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Xoraxis can invite an Ebay'er to app. That doesn't mean that the rest of us<br>
&gt;have to accept that app. Members are voted in, not guilded by leadership<br>

&gt;  How large is Ancient Darkness? Are you saying that we can't find 30<br>
&gt;non-ebayers in that entire guild? If Taleryan, Maert and Hazkorn were<br>
&gt;members of Ancient Darkness, would they be allowed back into FaF?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;On our old server, our guild fell apart when our numbers juuust started<br>
&gt;sliding below what we needed to raid the Eplanes comfortably. As our <br>
&gt;numbers<br>
&gt;fell, more and more diehard members of the guild who 'would never leave the<br>
&gt;guild for any reason'...did just that. They left Paradigm for our worst<br>
&gt;enemy, because they 'only want to see PoTime before I quit EQ forever', and<br>
&gt;if that meant joining a guild with some of the biggest assholes on the<br>
&gt;server, then so be it. The rest of us were left in a dead guild because we<br>
&gt;couldn't stomach being such hyporcrites.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;If you want to be a hypocrite, that's your decision. Don't expect me to<br>
&gt;follow your lead. Vote 'no' to Ebay.<br>

&gt;  Hmm.. Well even though I have been away for a few weeks, I still feel <br>
&gt;very<br>
&gt;strongly about this guild and it's leadership. I agree with much of WuWu's<br>
&gt;post, but I also feel Xoraxis brought up many good points as well. The fact<br>
&gt;is, In my opinion, it is Xoraxis' responsibility to bring this guild back <br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt;it's once elite status. I feel with Xoraxis' change in heart/mind or<br>
&gt;whatever..he is doing just that; making tweaks to the already solid core to<br>
&gt;get the rest of the system back in line.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Simply put...I do not give two shits where people come from..meaning Ebay <br>
&gt;or<br>
&gt;Self Groomed..If they are good people, proven to be such and understand <br>
&gt;they<br>
&gt;will be scrutnized for a lengthy period.. bring them on board.<br>

&gt;  AD merger is a great idea, and good job Xor for putting it together, if <br>
&gt;we<br>
&gt;had gone on much longer doing the same things the guild was about to<br>
&gt;implode. I just think each app should be paid attention to, the ebayed<br>
&gt;people might not be so bad, the fact that they are going to apply is all<br>
&gt;good. I definitely think this should happen.. I just think we should be <br>

&gt;careful who gets in and that it should be discussed more openly. We're<br>
&gt;falling backwards and like the AS mass app this could be exactly what we<br>
&gt;need to make the push to time, not to mention some of these people already<br>
&gt;have at least some of the flags we need and are decently geared up.<br>

&gt;  who are you calling a hypocrit? I dont see where I contradicted myself.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Telling us how you watched one guild die while refusing to see the writing<br>
&gt;on the wall and do something about it doesnt speak well as to why we should<br>
&gt;listen to you Mishal.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;We have to get more members, if you wanna go recruit noobs more power to<br>
&gt;you. /who all cleric 50 65 and let em have your best recruiting spiel, ive<br>
&gt;done it, i aint doing it again though.<br>

&gt;  I think there is bigger problems that are going on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I agree with WW. And will be a great shame if we loose him along with those<br>
&gt;that have left and the sol roes that came over and that left.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Its great that in /gu chat that people still continue to worry about<br>
&gt;resolution and bash them. Grats since the beginning on bashing on them, to<br>
&gt;everyone that did, really. They have the numbers and dedication now and <br>
&gt;will<br>
&gt;be passing us because instead of focusing on getting to plane of time when<br>
&gt;we had numbers people pissed it away. Prime example is VT the last couple<br>
&gt;days. Yesterday, there was 3 groups of us crawling there way through. 10<br>
&gt;hours people tried.. and no one logged. Reso had about 40 on at that time.<br>
&gt;Its obvious no one wants to crawl through VT and will wait till about the<br>
&gt;end to log on. To get phat lewt. Which AHR loot went to people that were at<br>
&gt;that raid for a whole 1-2 hours. Seen this happen many times.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Will a merger with AD solve things? Who knows, but its not like anyone has <br>
&gt;a<br>
&gt;say in it. But if ebayers are let in, and many have voiced strong opinions<br>
&gt;against it. Grats us on gaining unequiped unflagged purchased toons and us<br>
&gt;losing core members.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;There is some great people in AD. And some I would like raid with.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Will be voting NO on each and every ebayed toon.<br>

&gt;  From what I've read each person will be voted upon individually, if thats<br>
&gt;the case then I'm all for it. To me the biggest deal about someone that<br>
&gt;bought there character is that they have no idea how to play.. our app<br>
&gt;process/probation period is plenty long enough for us to determine if we<br>
&gt;want them in the guild and if we want them to stay in the guild. We need<br>
&gt;more members and this is the way to get applicants, as long as we vote<br>
&gt;accordingly it shouldnt do anything but strengthen us.<br>

&gt;You talk up reso about how they are gonna pass us soon and they apparently<br>
&gt;are doing it the right way.........well guess what playa, they guild ebayed<br>
&gt;characters. They faced a shortage and were in a state of decline and they<br>

Yeah it's a known fact that FnF's prior stance was anti-Ebay, and now we are seeing discussion about allowing it in.<br>
<br>
Either you <br>
<br>
A) Decided that FnF's business needed to be seen by the rest of the server<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
B) Were trying to stir up shit with the current AD apps to Fire and Fury.<br>
<br>
I'll go out on a limb and say it's B, but even if its A why are you so proud of it?<br>
