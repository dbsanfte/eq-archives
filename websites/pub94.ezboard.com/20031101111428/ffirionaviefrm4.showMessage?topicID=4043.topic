Someone remind me what good TLC and the absence of NO DROP items does for us.<br>
<br>
We've been able to get around the restrictions imposed by TLC for a long time. PoP raids have made it so anyone can do it (unless they have no friends or alts) but even before that it was only a minor problem. I personally outfitted most of the clerics and druids in FnF with Remove Curse using the pet trick (that was over a year ago, BTW, when Remove Curse was actually useful).<br>
<br>
How many problems has buggy NO DROP caused us? Seems like every-other raid someone would have to re-log to clear the NO DROP bug last winter. That's relatively minor, but one has to wonder why it happens, and why it STILL happens...<br>
<br>
And now, the latest idiocy. The magician epic weapon is summoned. Summon one, click it to summon an epic pet, then destroy it because it only has one charge. In order to add an augmentation slot to it they introduced a non-summoned version. All you had to do was run out to Tox Forest and hand a summoned epic weapon to a new NPC and she'd give you a new weapon in return. The new one doesn't have the pet clicky but does have the same stats as the epic weapon, plus it has an augmentation slot. But guess what? It was tradeable! How about that! A tradeable epic. I heard people were selling them (or trying) in the bazaar for 20k. I heard of low-level mages having the non-summoned version now because it was NOT NOT DROP. What makes it worse is: this isn't the first time an epic weapon has been tradeable on FV. Heck, the mage epic itself was tradeable a long time ago. I think the rogue epic was, too.<br>
<br>
Well, the NPC is gone. Those of us (yes me!) that were too late will have to do without until Sony gets around to implementing a NO DROP version of the non-summoned mage epic weapon. Of course, they also have to figure out what to do about all the epics that got traded. And what about the ones that were traded and later augmented? People aren't going to be happy if the weapon just goes *poof*!<br>
<br>
We've already got the screwiest server economy going. I suppose it is THAT which will keep TLC from ever being changed. Too many people have dedicated too many resources to the TLC economy for Sony to change it now.<br>
<br>
And you know what? The population is booming! All those nay-sayers that predicted FV would be shut down because no one wanted to play here were wrong, although they may be been right when they said it, hehe. Sony keeps tweaking the ruleset for us, the population keeps growing, and the TLC bugs just won't go away. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237657"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.redhills.com/img/enannsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=witherweaver>Witherweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 708<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/03 11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4043.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What good is TLC?</span><hr size=1> Warrior epic was not no drop originally, too.

<br>
Yes, the TLC can be worked around, but it does hinder farmers...  Go to my old server (Cazic Thule) which is one of the oldest servers, look around on any night in a zone where decent loot drops (like crystal caverns, etc...) - See how many 65's are running around destroying everything because they need money for their newest spell...<br>
<br>
I like the TLC here and want to keep it...  I don't see farming NEARLY as much as you'll see it on other servers...<br>

<br>
No one farms the lower-level zones because the TLC economy has rendered the loot from those zones worthless. To continue with the example of CC, there's not much (if anything) in there that is worth the bother of farming. I wore a couple robes from there for quite a long time. (I still think BCR is one of the prettiest in game.) These days, you can get a much better robe from a friendly tailor. And if you happen to be in the same guild you'll likely get it for little-to-no cost. There's no point farming the robes, and the same goes for most of the other things available there.<br>

TLC and No Drop. To prevent farming, and to encourage a more realisitc world, we got TLC, meaning if someone didn't get XP from a kill, for being to high or to low in a party, TLC would kick in. <br>
<br>
But, at the same time, No Drop was removed, so, when you out grew equipment you could hand it down to someone, or sell it. Like you would in real life. <br>
<br>
And it all worked well till pop raid feature came out, to get around TLC. Suddenly, you had farmers every where. I had problems with a shaman in LGuk training everyone there so he could farm all the items uncontested. I wasn't the only one either who ran into this person (No need for names, the issue has long since be resolved)<br>
<br>
You see farming all the time. Because TLC can be bypassed and all items from it sold in the bazaar, more people are intersted in doing that.<br>
<br>
On top, you have lots of players that do nothing more then spend their time in the bazaar buying low and selling high. That doesn't bother me too much. Now that some players have obviously accuminalted millions, they are buying any high end gear they can, regardless of the price, and then marking it up more, because they know the rarity of it. Not to mention that you can now have up to 20 duplicate lore items, because of the shared bank slots. <br>
<br>
That's fine, for me, since paying 100,000 for one item isn't anything I plan on doing. It won't make me enjoy the game anymore then I already do. <br>
<br>
But it has ruined our economy, and the idea behind a rollplaying server, there are more rollPAYers then players. Meaning, they are more bazaared then twinked in the old fashioned sense of the word twink. The only people that don't think the economy is ruined are those that have tons of money. But then, that's kinda like real life, isn't it? Those few with the money don't see a problem with poverity. <br>
<br>
And that's why FV has seen an influx of people that are greedy. Because they know that 98% of everything is for sale on this server. I suspect there is more buying of gear and plat on this server then other servers for that simple reason. <br>
<br>
I've encountered more and more people that have no clue where thier gear comes from, they bought it all. And some of it is truely nice gear. Gear they couldn't have gotten themselves, and gear I know that costs lots of money, yet these people don't have a clue on how to make any money in game. To me, that makes me think they bought thier plat, and continue to do so. Short on money, 10-30 dollars can fix that quick. <br>
<br>
In the end, it does't bother me to much. I'm not interested in telling others how to play. And, if I encounter someone I think was eBayed, and they suck in thier class, me and my friends snicker behind thier back and never group with them again and we let our friends (not strangers we don't know), know that they stink, and should avoid them.<br>
<br>
But back to TLC. With an easy way to get around it, it's stupid to have. But just removing it would cause more issues. <br>
<br>
I always felt the idea behind the bazaar was so that tradeskillers could sell the things they made. That's why it's full of ovens and looms and forges and anything you need to make items. <br>
<br>
To take this server back towards rollplaying more, I would like to see a new tag, called No Sale. Meaning, you can't sell it in trader mode. Basically, take the No Drop, and make it so when placed in a traders satchel, it won't show up when people are browsing your wares. You can't put a price on it.<br>
<br>
Sure, this makes you say, well, whats to stop them from just spamming the bazaar with shouts for these items. Whats to stop them from making a macro spamming shouts. <br>
<br>
Nothing is stopping them. But I suspect, that at first, it will be really bad. It's already pretty bad in the Bazaar and PoK. In time, people will get sick of the spam, and either put those players on ignore, or turn shouts off. And in time, it will settle into something tolerable.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 1903<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/03 1:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4043.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/smile.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What good is TLC?</span><hr size=1> The examples you cited were problems with the NO DROP flags and not TLC.  Yes, one is always cited as the reason/compensation for the other, but they are totally different than each other.<br>
<br>
Yes, there have been many NO DROP bugs on this server at various times.  There are still, I thik, some GM tradeskill items which produce a droppable bag or are themselves droppable.  There are times (for me usually after a partial crash) when a client comes up like it is on a blue server.  And so on.<br>
<br>
TLC is not NO DROP, TLC is only that which makes the magic and lore items not drop if you are too high of a level to be fighting that target.  TLC is intended to make targets available for those who are level-appropriate.  Lack of NO DROP allows those who are level-appropriate to gather things (farm) to sell to those who are not (either too high or too low).   <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">

Locks are also relatively easy to get around.  But we still use them.  Let's even use your nice Remove Curse example.  Suppose when I was going to FG for shard farming, and there wasn't a trivial loot code here, when I went past the Great Saprophyte, I'd check if he was up every time and if he was, kill him.  Now I don't.  Why?  Because it's not worth my time to go set up a raid for it, even if I can do so by logging in another character to /afk somewhere in a raid with me.<br>

People still farm OOT, because you always see jboots for sale, even jboots MQ or rings of the ancients.  I'd much prefer the people farming that were getting xp from it.  Go to another server, especially like a year ago, and odds are you'd find a 60(+) necro or druid farming the AC in OOT for MQs and getting no xp for it.  Now, sure, a 60(+) druid or necro can solo it on FV and get the drop using a raid, but it's an extra obstacle to bother with, and it's going to discourage spontaneous farming (passing through an area, remember the existence of a loot dropping mob in the area, go farm it because nothing better to do).<br>

Sebilis - Obulus Death Shroud.  That place was (recently) packed on the server I originally came from, because ODSes were huge for mana preservation III.  Before the xp changes, froglok dars were all green at 65 in Sebilis.  However, if you'd zone into Sebilis to see what was going on, you'd find about 5--10 people soloing or duoing, most well over 60, in addition to the few groups of correctly-leveled people there legitimately for xp and loot.  The soloer types would basically clear every frog, plus as many named camps as weren't taken, just to farm loot and hopefully snag an ODS or haste belt.  The legitimate xp-ers, because of this, would run out of mobs to kill, and their xp would suffer, plus, they'd have soloer types grabbing their nameds they'd spawned if they didn't make it back to the named before repop.  It was ugly.  That doesn't happen here.  TLC is a big part of that.<br>
<br>
As for no nodrop, that's really a nice thing.  Loot arguments in guilds, etc, are a lot less frequent I think here than on other servers.  You don't have a guild equipping warriors in 5 expansions' worth of gear ahead of bards, clerics, paladins, and shadowknights because the warriors can pass things down when they get the next upgrade.  Go to another server, and you'll find MT warriors with elemental, ornate, eradication, vindication kael/skyshrine, thurgadin bps/armor, and so on, with all but one piece rotting in the bank (if not already destroyed).  The no drop tag is also very artificial.  It's really used too frequently on other servers.  If the idea is that an item becomes somehow bound to the soul of the person who has it, that's great, except why would mundane non-magical items like, say, silk from the spiders in velks be nodrop?  Oh yes, because we want to create a timesink for people so that getting Flowing Thought 3 during the velious era takes hundreds of hours of tradeskilling and farming to accomplish, so people play our game longer.<br>
<br>
Basically, in my opinion, no drop = timesinks.  There's plenty of content in EQ to keep people busy without silly timesinks.  When people are free to buy/sell as they see fit, you have the option to choose the method you find most fun of making money in EQ, and then spend that money on buying something you'd have to spend some non-fun time farming if it was no drop.<br>

But the ODS is losing value. Have you looked at the price lately? It dropped. Last month it was listed in the bazaar at 22k-25k. Now, 12k is common and I bet it will go lower. You can easily get a much better mana preservation item elsewhere. Level 65s have been farming gems in Seb a long time.

I think the lack of no drop far, far outweighs the problems with TLC as an advantage. The very concept of no drop is just stupid. What, it sticks to your hand forever? I helped a friend get their jboots on Cazic Thule. We MQ'ed them, but it seems that someone had previously dumped the 3250g to Hasten, because as soon as the druid handed him the ring and rapier, poof jboots. So the only person in our team who DIDN'T need jboots is now stuck with them forever. sigh. About 10 hours of combined efforts wasted. To someone used to only FV, the very concept of no drop is baffling and confusing, and certainly makes no sense rp wise.<br>
<br>
No drop is just a lazy, quick fix for a headache of a problem, farming. I think the TLC goes a long way towards solving it. If they would fix the raid workaround, we'd have a decent system going. Even though I've myself used raids to get obscure drops for quests, I still wish they would fix it, and perhaps dampen the recent influx of people flooding to FV just for that. <br>

When I left about 6 months ago, it was 5-6k, about.  That's because the instant-click value of jboots make them better than travelers boots (5250pp minimum price), and because the only alternative is camping them or traveler's boots.<br>

In all honesty, I haven't looked at the price lately.  But I can tell you they were MUCH cheaper on the server I came from, because they were so heavily farmed, because of the lack of TLC (in my opinion).  On Rodcet they were roughly 15-20k after the change to add MP III, and the last I heard, had sunk to 6-8k.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You can easily get a much better mana preservation item elsewhere.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

But for more money.  Mana Preservation IV costs a hell of a lot more than III, and ornate boots (priests' biggest/cheapest source of MP4) aren't all that common... much easier to get an ornate breastplate, because there are at least mobs that drop them (nearly) every time.<br>

Maybe, but I've never once seen Sebilis completely empty on Rodcet.  (Maybe it's because the server has a decent-sized asian population, so it is really a 24/7 server).  I've zoned into an empty Sebilis at prime time more than once here on FV.  Bottomfeeding farming just isn't as attractive here because you have to either work around the TLC or maybe it's because with all the lack of nodrop stuff, kunark armor sells for more to a vendor than in the bazaar.  Either way, it's probably a good thing.  Better to leave content open to people who are the intended level for it.<br>

Right.  If you read my post again (and I don't expect thorough reading since I write a damned novel every time, sorry) you'll see I said &quot;before the xp change&quot; or something like that.  If you weren't aware, the xp/blue-con formula was tinkered with a couple times.  The original formula which lasted like 1-2 days I think, was 45 = min blue to 60, 47 = min blue to 61, 49 = min blue to 62, 51 = min blue to 63, 53 = min blue to 64, 55 = min blue to 65.  Then, they changed the formula for 61-63 or something.  I don't remember too well but I think it was something like 60-&gt;45, 61-&gt;46, 62-&gt;47, 63-&gt;50, 64-&gt;53, 65-&gt;55.  Someone can correct me if I'm off on those numbers, which I probably am.<br>
<br>
Finally, after much complaining that people were running out of xp mobs in tier 1 planes, or fighting too many greens and light blues, or something, the system was changed to what we have now.  60-&gt;45, 61-&gt;46, 62-&gt;47, 63-&gt;48, 64-&gt;49, 65-&gt;50.  Where again, -&gt; means &quot;has blue-cons all the way down to&quot;.  The curve is still a bit sharper than 1-60, but it's less of a drastic change.  (The slope is roughly an average of 0.75 before 60, but 1.0 for 60+).<br>
<br>
So, yes, the entrance of seb can con light blue and rarely dark blue to you now at 65, but it was green as grass before the change.  (Dars run 43-50, so at 65 now, they will run green for 43-44, light blue for 45-49, and dark blue at 50.  See for example, <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/ficticiousname9/zone/Ruins_of_Sebilis.html">www.geocities.com/fictici...bilis.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enheduannalia>EnheduannaLia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The girl is about to do something stupid.</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/03 4:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4043.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What good is TLC?</span><hr size=1> (I usually have no need for profanity.

Gravely asks if I'd take the trouble to form a raid for an item, if needed. I'd say, it depends on the situation. I'd do it if I knew I was going to pass that way and I knew someone that needed it. I'm not into farming just to sell stuff, but others are. And making a raid is trivial. I know people that are almost never not in a raid. (BTW, spawn time on the shroom is about two hours so I don't feel like I'm depriving anyone of exp -- I don't bother the shroom if there's a group nearby.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 1905<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/03 6:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4043.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What good is TLC?</span><hr size=1> I think he is referring to the guild you were once in while they were taking the small number of keys that are now No Drop (and are No Drop on every other server) and passing them around. <br>

Since you are quoting prices of various things and how those prices have changed, I do have to wonder, though, how right the statement made was.   Are you upset the item wasn't flagged No Drop on inception or that you didn't get to sell the item during the time it was not No Drop?<br>
<br>
I am finding, more and more, those who complain about how much TLC and the &quot;no drop bugs&quot; are hurting them are really thinking about the money they didn't make on those items and and crying a river because of it.  I am realising the majority of people who want TLC removed have in mind something they want to farm (or want an alt or friend to farm) no matter how much they are &quot;crowing&quot; about how little TLC does other than &quot;ruin&quot; quests.<br>
<br>
Oh... and on the old TLC work arounds of sicking a pet on the target and walking out of range.  I don't know if this is by intent or if it is a fix to that problem... I have been playing a pet class character on this server and if I am out of range of my pet (i.e. it has run off chasing something while I am engaged with another) even if another party member is with it, if it gets the last blow, the target goes poof just the same way it does if any NPC gets the last blow.  I have also not found the corpse when it has died and I didn't get an XP message when my pet was too far away (and I am able to go right to where it was killed).  At times I have thought it was just I didn't find the corpse, but it has happened enough times with my duoing partner being right with my pet on the chase that I am pretty sure it isn't.  I haven't tried it with a root and DoT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=manouk>Manouk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/03 6:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4043.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   TLC</span><hr size=1> I thought the game was called EverQuest, like lots of quests, not just one ( like Jboots) .

Apparently my original post didn't cover everything it should have. I'm frustrated by the constant influx of TLC-related bugs. They are getting better at many things but they still haven't got the special rules for FV quite ingrained in their programmer's heads. Tradeable epics aren't new.
