But today I have , Moral a paladin , Was In a Lost Dungeons group , collection but we were doing quite well, would have mostly likely won. <br>
<br>
Anyway as a bard i am lull pulling ...Moral didnt seem good at holding aggro ....in fact id probably say he couldnt tank at all but that wasnt the problem. We get quite a way in, and A Wisdom augment drops. We ask if anyone wants it, cleric says yes. No reply from Moral the paladin. Cleric loots the NODROP augment. Then turns out Moral did want gem, before we can sort things out the following happens...<br>
<br>
Moral , who didnt appear to have much of a grasp of english says &quot;I REALLY FUCKING GREEDY ASS PIGS&quot; , now had I have known what this sentance meant im sure something would have been rectified, however the next moment he is up and running away , disbanding group as he gos, shouting a few abusive but barely coecive things as he runs.......with all our loot. Casters get killed by mobs, I zone with about 21 hp left . Adventure fails . Moral camps.<br>
<br>
I understand he was upset about not getting augment, but this reaction was just ...well throwing his toys out of the pram. We all get annoyed but running away with peoples loot and ruining other peoples adventures is not the way to go about it. <br>
<br>
Im not to good with ezboard so if anyone needs screenshots etc as proof send me a private message. I felt the need to draw this to the eyes of the community.<br>

I think I grouped with him in the group before you met up with him.  Granted, my stupid computer crashed on me after we failed that LDON, but I don't think anyone died.  Maybe he was frustrated when he joined you.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
All I can say is that he had real difficulties holding aggro.  Now, I understand that he is only 55, and I was 62, and the whole group was higher level than he was, but I deal with a lot of paladins, and I know 55th level paladins that can grab a hell of a lot of aggro, fast, and keep it.  Not the case here.  My dear ranger friend took the initiative and went forth, boldly stealing aggro, which helped an awful lot toward keeping my mana pool intact.<br>
<br>
Another incident happened, though, where one of the orcs ended up teleporting through the dungeon ceiling.  Quite a while later, it came back to the group, and proceeded to beat on Yours Truly.  Puller was off looking for the next critter, Moral was sitting, and I'm starting to gripe when my HP dropped under half.  Eventually he gets up, but moves forward toward where the puller is, instead of tussling with the orc that is beating ass on his cleric.  Yeah, I live, cos halflings are the best, and the rest of my group was competent, but still.  That was annoying.  No message came that he would be AFK.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'd cut the guy some slack if I hadn't seen this rant, but running off with the group's loot because he wasn't paying attention to what had dropped is completely lame in my book.  Sorry, pal, if this is what you do in my absence, I don't want to group with you again.  I am willing to teach you group tactics, since you don't seem to know them, but you don't seem to be able to be a good person in the process.  Good luck to you, I'm sure your guild will be proud of you being soapboxed for this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinjofv>SinjoFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Freak Master</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/03 5:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4137.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Moral The Drama Queen</span><hr size=1>  I was disbanded from the group while typing. I thought I might have disbanded by error so I slowed the mob Verachi had pulled and asked in say for a re-invite. I soon realize that Moral is upset. Now when the aug dropped and after a few folk said &quot;pass&quot; I said Grats to the cleric. Paladin are wisdom users too and I offered to compansate Moral by giving him 1k pp for my error in &quot;awarding&quot; loot too soon. Now Im a necromancer and have no need for wisdom. why I was disbanded is still an utter mystery to me. Next thing Moral dose is Blow profanity in my face. Ok I will toss civility out the window, Moron! <br>
  <br>
  To all of Moral's guildmates who offered aide and kind words for this foul situation, you have my appreciation. To Moral who got me killed, chanter killed and cleric killed... I present you the double Bird!<br>

Simple.<br>
<br>
That is the cool thing about our no drop rule.<br>
<br>
If he hadnt have thrown a tantrum im sure someone could have come to this conclusion as well as me....<br>
<br>
Heck I think my cleric has a bag of about 8 augments...sitting there...waiting for one of my regular group mates to decide they are ready to put it on a piece of equipment.  Of course we trust each other completely so that makes that kinda easy.<br>

I've been spoiled by Gerbo and Tinwin.  I can slap down all kinds of high-aggro druid spells (Ennare + Ro's Smouldering Disjunction + Breath of Ro) with one of those two tanking, sit, and never worry about even getting &quot;sit aggro&quot;.<br>
<br>
I was trying to figure out what Moral was, or wasn't, doing in the group last night, and I think what he wasn't doing was stunning.  That explains the two orc combat medics that completely healed themselves twice (each).  As a druid, I only have one stun spell that works underground (Fury of Air--and in theory, it shouldn't work underground as nothing else in its line does either before it or after it, so I'm waiting for it to get &quot;fixed&quot;).  Eventually, I loaded it when I realized no one was stunning healers to interrupt them when they cast Complete heal, though by then, we'd botched the collection and everyone just wanted to leave.<br>
<br>
(And just don't get me started on the nuking enchantress.) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/MSSig.JPG"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

&quot;However, at the same time that we were all feeling so good about overcoming these forces of ignorance and prejudice, a young man in Laramie, Wyoming, by the name of Matthew Shepard was losing his life to them.  Beaten senseless and tied to a split-rail fence in near-zero weather, arms akimbo in a grotesque crucifixion, he died as agonizing a death as another young man who had been tortured and nailed to a wooden cross at a desolate spot in Jerusalem known as Golgotha some 1,998 years earlier.  They died, as they lived, as brothers.<br>

Assuming the item to be augmented isn't NO DROP already,one just:<br>
 <br>
1) Hands item to holder of augment (assuming you trust them)<br>
2) Augment holder augments item<br>
3) Augmented item gets given to owner.<br>
<br>
Shocking how hard that was,eh?<br>

I knew it was gonna start bad when the chanter was harping on about dps. Yes, we had plenty of dps. Or we would have if Moral hadn't jumped into the dungeon while I was in process of casting Call of the Predator. I guess some people hate atk. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Then, as he'd zoned in before we were ready, I had to click off the always thoughtfully cast Brells and cast Warder's Protection in the dungeon - Brell's makes me break in misses, as Gyre likes to say. The chanter hastes Moral, and fails to haste me.<br>
<br>
Hello. I am the dps class. I have a longsword with lightning running down it and a fireman's axe. Haste just makes me more effective. I'm not bothering Guvyen for it, he's got enough problems trying to keep mana up for Malosi and emergency slows. So there's a chanter in the group and I'm running off clicky eyepatch haste all night.<br>
<br>
Anyway, he’s having no luck keeping aggro off the casters, which was the absolute first thing I learned in playing. 40 levels of duoing with a wizard get you pretty good at that.  Also, grouping with Lonorin and Joybrook tends to spoil you in dungeons, paladin wise. Elsbet sends me a tell stating that he’s going to get her killed, so I step up and take over. Mind you, I’m pretty damn fierce as a tank. If rangers could wear plate and had plate mitigation, I’d be scary. I run just over 5k hp/12k ac exp group buffed with focus/virtue/Warder’s. <br>
<br>
So I take over and start pulling with Flame Lick (#1 aggro spell in the game, thx), not worrying too bad about adds because hey, we have a chanter in the group. I’m holding aggro just fine, Guvyen has started Maloing and slowing on inc cause they’re not going anywhere aggro wise. Anyway, we get a few, chanter gets overwhelmed, I call for Lasgalen to evac back to the entrance. Mind you, the group we had the night before could have handled the overpull, and it was myself, Elsbet, three other rangers and a wizard.<br>
<br>
We start running into casters. Nothing that I don’t have a Ykesha on me and I don’t really have time to load Call of Fire and put it up. I nicely ask casters to please load a stun and use it. Then, Moral starts using a stun with a 10ft knockback. It went downhill from there, we won’t mention the caster complete healing itself or me actually switching out my regular group page for the page that has /disc weaponshield as the 1 key.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it was kinda of a check run on a collect mission. I was logging the entire thing and sending it to Absor. The catty tells between myself, Elsie and Las should make for interesting reading.<br>

I am married to him in RL.  His heart is really in the right place, but I do know he is quick tempered, and for leaving as he did in the group I know he felt bad and returned the money from the loot and gave someone his horse.  His feelings were very hurt in the aftermath of his actions and he had tried to send each one of you a tell that were in his group.  Some of you ignored him, which is understandable as you were probably not wanting to hear from him.  Moral is really task oriented and a good fighter.  He probably did not see the &quot;who wants to roll&quot; , and the fact that the gem was looted furthered his aggrivation and he logged in frustration.  I know probably that was not the right decision for the moment, but there IS always two sides to the story, and for those of you that ignored his tell, you didn't give him the chance to explain himself. He has many years of EQ experience both on this server and others. So for Moral I would like to apologize for his behavior the other night for those that didn't want to let him. He was very upset and VERY remorceful about what he had done.  Thanks for your time.<br>

<br>
Sorry to focus on this, but I find it kind of tough to believe that someone with many years of EQ experience could have so much trouble getting/holding aggro as a Paladin. I've played with Elsbet many times as Talethia in some tough places, and even as a level 51 Paladin I've *never* had trouble with aggro. To think of a level 55 or above Paladin who's unable to keep the mobs from beating the crap out of his Cleric/Casters is just inconcievable to me. I mean, even if a stun doesn't take, it still aggroes the mob. And to let a mob CH itself twice is unfor-fucking-givable. <br>
<br>
I'm sure his heart IS in the right place, but this guy has picked the wrong class to play. A Paladin who doesn't know to stun mobs, or when and why he should be stunning and/or bashing mobs, is someone who hasn't taken the time to learn their class properly. I still can't get my head around it. <br>
<br>
I suggest that if your husband wants to avoid further soapbox posts about him, you send him to this website and have him read the hell up on what he's supposed to be doing. It should become his bible:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath">pub148.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Again, I'm sure he's a nice guy IRL. But if he wants to get some respect from other players, he's going to have to earn that respect by learning his class, being useful to his group, not getting his casters/healers killed, not wasting people's time and most of all, PAYING ATTENTION. That means noticing when something is up for grabs, noticing when someone's health is getting low (yes, even if you have a healer, accidents happen and you should be ready for anything), noticing when someone says they're low on mana, noticing when someone is getting beat on when they shouldn't be and altering your behaviour according to what the situation requires.<br>
<br>
I mean, jeez. Think about what you're supposed to be for a minute. You're supposed to be the ultimate noble Knight in Shining Armour, fer goodness' sake. You should be watching out for every member of your group, and willing to sacrifice yourself for their sake should that be the best course of action <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>for your group.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> There is no &quot;I&quot; in team, as they say. I have lost count of the amount of times I died casting LoH on another group member during wipe situations so that they had time to evac the rest of the group. It's what we do. I bet over 95% of Paladins on this board have done the same thing more times than they can remember. It shouldn't just be a roleplay thing. It's about being a decent, unselfish player. That's what will ultimately help you to build a good reputation here, just as great players like Elsbet and Tinwin have.<br>
<br>

Apologies for using your words as an example, but I will not apologise for the advice and opinions given. I am quite serious about the actions your husband needs to take if he is to improve sufficiently and have any chance of repairing his reputation.
