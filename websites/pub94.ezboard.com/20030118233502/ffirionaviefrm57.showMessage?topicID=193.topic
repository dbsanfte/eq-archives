First let me introduce myself. For those of you who don't know I'm a 17 year old guy, from the eastern U.S. I enjoy reading these posts but don't add anything much, too introverted I guess. But, I come here with a question to you all. Before I get into that let me tell a brief story. You see, my best friend(female, 17 as well) and I have been talking lately about a lot of things in general, but most important for this story, love. Now she doesn't know this but I think I may be in love with her, and don't want to say anything for several reasons, one of which being I'm not actually sure, and don't want to say something I don't actually mean. Now let me clear up when I say love I don't mean just saying something to get her into bed like most guys my age...in fact I'm one of the dying breed of my age who believes is waiting for marriage for that kind of stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  shocking isn't it...but that's not really important. What is, is that we have been  talking about the subject of love in general, as I said above, and we tried to define it....phew there's a hard thing to do. So, knowing that most of you are older then I, and many married, some with children, I thought I would pose the question to you, knowing that wisdom usually come with age, and maybe it can help me with my little problem. (And I don't mean family love, the love of friends, or a dictionary definition <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I mean romantic/true love)<br>
<br>
So to start I'll tell you all what I think it is. So hopefully more will do the same<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . To me, love is something that is incomprehensible, it's something that you don't experience, but feel. It's a mixing of all the emotions, feeling rapture and sorrow all at once. It's something that you don't find, for it will find you in time. It's caring for someone as much, or more than you care about yourself, and wanting to play a bigger part in their life than you already do, and have them play a larger part in yours. It's thinking of them when they aren't around, and wondering what they are up to. It's something that can't truly be defined, because it is different for everyone, and actually knowing 100% that you were in love would ruin it anyway. It's sharing someone's feelings, the good, as well as the bad. And wanting to help them struggle through those difficult times.<br>
<br>
That's about it mainly. It will probably just look like rambling to the rest of you, which is why I ask for your opinions as well. What is love to you?<br>

every single person ive ever fell in love with has pushed me away, shut me out, ignored me. Im a great friend but im poor at intimacy, thats what it comes down to. Love for me just heralds the dawning of another long depression so i try not to think about it too much in RL terms.<br>

I think I'm the opposite, though. Every person I've ever loved I have ended up pushing away and shutting out of my life, and I'm really not sure why. Makes for an awfully lonely existence.<br>
<br>
Someone once said it's from low self-esteem, but I don't know if I agree with that. <p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0">

<br>
For me, love is defined when I look at the person I'm laying next to while they are still sleeping and I try to imagine my life without her. It's joy that she's here with me. It's pain, the heart wrenching, gut twisting knowledge that one day I'll have to live without her.  It's excitement at all the wonderful experiances we've had together, and look foreward to having. It's fear as I have never felt any other way of the day she leaves me. <br>
<br>
Love comes in many forms.<br>
<br>
Sometimes love is like when I was young, insistant, consuming, demanding. Sometimes it's gentle, touching and patient. More and more these days I realize that the fire I always thought love to be is only the beginning. Many people loose love once that fire is gone, I myself have passed that phase and have settled into the slow calming warmth that is the strength my partner lends me throughout my day. I cherish that more than any moment of direct passion from our past. It gives me the strength to keep going. <br>
<br>
That's how I feel on the romanitical true love emotion you expressed intrest in. However there is more than that. <br>
<br>
Friendship is a love in and of itself. Family is too.<br>
<br>
As much as my partner nourishes and sooths my soul now my friends have helped shape who I am, what I have become. I love them for that. Recently I left my hometown, I took for granted the day to day presence of people who accepted and understood me, and who supported me unconditionally. They will never know how deeply they have affected my life, nor can I ever ever thank them enough. You are at a phase where friends come and go, they did for me, and they do for everyone to varying degrees. Treasure your time with them. Let them know how much you feel for them, if you don't now you may never have the chance to do so.<br>
<br>
As for family, this you cannot pick. But they too shaped who you are and what you will become. Thank them, they deserve that much. And if they treat you well, love them, let them know that.  If they don't treat you well, do not dwell on it, your health and happieness is more important than bonds of blood.<br>
<br>
Love is a four letter word for every emotion you could ever hope to encounter because it will eventually lead you to experiance all of them. Hate, Loathing and Malice can all be the product of love. If you doubt me, wait until someone hurts the one you hold dear. <br>
<br>
I'm just a sappy romantic at heart, I can't help it. I'm sorry. <br>
<br>
And before you worry over much about love, be happy. Be healthy. Live long and prosper. And just rember what Sting said in &quot; Love is Stronger than Justice &quot; ...  Love is a big fat river in Flood .<br>
<br>
Grab a paddle boy you're gonna need it. <br>

It's a lot of things. To be comfotable with someone who knows you better than you probably know yourself. To know everything about them, but they can still surprise you. To know that you would stop the movement of the universe (if you could), if they needed you to. To love yourself enough to accept all of your faults, because they can't if you can't. To tell someone your deepest thoughts, and they share your deepest feelings. You can't see yourself tomorrow and all of the tomorrows, if they aren't there with you.  Love isn't always going to be deep, intense, and passionate. Sometimes love is felt more when they see you sleeping, or want to kiss you most in the mornings (stank breath and all). To be able to argue with someone and never stop loving them. And never ever stop cherishing everyday with that person, even the bad days. You never know when that day might be the last. Love isn't always going to be sunshine and rainbows, but it should always make you happy. <br>
<br>
  I guess that's a summary of how I view love <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Serinity Di'Marcia<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
For me, love is my ex-fiancee keeping me from flipping out when I was working two jobs a couple years back, and from two weeks before Thanksgiving, to Feb. 25th, I only had Thanksgiving and Christmas off.  Just having her around kept me sane, working package pick up at Sears during Christmas season is no fun whatsoever, plus, I had the second job.  Yah..me crazy.<br>
<br>
It was her being an emotional outlet when my social group exploded and started hating each other.  People I spent every day with, saw more than I saw my family, and BOOM, everyone is at each others throats.  Screwed me up more than I let on, because Tina was there to hold me and listen to me and scratch me behind the ears even after we broke up.<br>
<br>
It was both of us knowing when the other was upset about something, even after we broke up.  We had some freaky psychic link or something, any time I was about to explode and cause massive property damage, she would call.  Any time she was upset about the new boyfriend, or her moms worthless trashy boyfriend, or anything else, I'd call, not knowing the other was upset.  Just one of those feelings.<br>
<br>
Ooh..like one day, I was really down the entire day, seriously off the wall messed up.  I got home from work, had a breakdown, prayed to a God I don't even really beleive in for her to call me.  Turns out, that same day, she attempted suicide, and was put in a mental hospital.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of that...<br>
<br>
I feel the same way about this girl I work with as you are about your friend.  I could be having the worst day possible, and just seeing her would calm me down. She is my Zen.  One day, after having a &quot;friend&quot; screw me over by using my credit card, I called the little shit, and he was hiding from me...I went completely nuts at work, went outside, and sent my bare fist straight through my car window.  I was on a complete rampage, but as soon as she stepped outside to see if I was ok, I melted, I hugged her, and just started babbling.  Then she shoved me off of her, and started griping at me about how she didn't want me getting blood on her, and I thought it was funny.  I think I love her, but don't want to say a word about it, because I value her friendship, don't want to freak her out, and plus, she's already taken...by a complete jerkoff.<br>
<br>
So yeah, it's a completely undefinable thing.  Of course, even though I don't fall for astrology, I am a Leo, and much astrology points to Leo's having personalities that push people they care about away.  Fun fun.  I haven't talked to my ex-fiancee in about a year now, because I acted like I complete fucktard trying to get her back.  <br>
<br>
So...errr...don't be like me.  Don't push anything, just let what happens happen.<br>

I was just talking to a good friend of mine about the very same thing...<br>
<br>
Love to me....is everything. It is the driving force behind my ambition, my creativity,my pleasure, my joy and even my pain.<br>
<br>
If you love someone enough to let them love you back, there is always a very real chance you will get hurt...but it is a chance that is always worth taking. Love is what inspires in me my urge to write, and to sing. Love is what wakes me up every morning &amp; gives me the courage to face my deamons when its time to dream. Knowing love is there makes me happier than I ever knew was possible. On the same note, it leaves me open to such fits of despiration &amp; tears as to which I never knew I held inside me.<br>
<br>
When you are in love with someone, they make your day. A thought, a word, a smile..a small memory of them &amp; you are suddenly ok. Your day, no matter how good or bad, is now just better. They bring sunshine to your every day...even if the day is already bright. <br>
<br>
Ok, so I am rambling like a silly love struck girl. Maybe that is what I am, or maybe that is what I wish I were....either case, I have given a lot of thought, and a lot of phrase to my ideal of love...and there you have it, summed up nice &amp; short.

My reason? Friday at school I had 60 bucks stolen from me during my gym period, now I'm not one to get excited easily, but needless to say I became pissed. Started cursing up a storm, punched the closest thing  next to me...the wall thank god. Stormed out of the gym, and saw her. Even without talking to her, the sight of her just calmed me down enough to think things through rationally. And for the rest of the day whenever I would get pissed about it I would just think of her, and I would calm down. And, I don't want to say anything to her for mainly the same reasons you have stated, save for the fact that she isn't taken by anyone...yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . And just to freak ya out more, guess whose a leo too, though I never did care about horoscopes.<br>
<br>
     Lith, I never was one to really express my feelings to my friends, though now I may start. Never did really hit me that I took most of them for granted, and soon after graduation I won't be seeing many of them again. So from now on I'm gonna try to let them know how much they mean to me...well most of them anyway.<br>

     And, to the rest of ya, keep posting please. No matter how outrages your thoughts may be, no one here will chastise you for your beliefs.<br>

<br>
I honestly don't know what love is.  In the past, I've put it as &quot;willing to die for someone, willing to kill for them, willing to sell your soul and insodoing regret not being able to do more&quot;.  As of more recently, I feel this is more obcession than love.  Yes, those are things I would have been willing to do for two of my best friends because they helped me through a hell of a lot of shit a couple of years ago.  Teen years <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>suck</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I've been distancing myself more and more recently....  I've been hurt in the past because of people leaving me, and I find it easier to deal with if I just don't care anymore.  I used to be semi-dependent on people, on a specific person.  I don't let myself be like that anymore, because not only is it a bad way to be for myself, it's completely unfair for the other person.<br>
<br>
True love, the kind that bards sing about, is more or less equal pain and pleasure, if not more pleasure than pain.  My parents are lucky beyond belief that they found each other.  They're complete best friends: they love just being in each other's presence even after being married for almost 27 years.  They argue, but never about minor things.  Not even about the fact that Mom hasn't gotten a job in three years and is going for her Masters.  Dad could easily go ripshit on her for costing the family so much money when she could easily be making a lot, but he doesn't.  He steps back, trusts her, and lets her do what she loves.  They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>trust</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> each other so completely, and they've earned that trust from each other.  It's unbelievable, and I would do so much to feel that same kind of thing in a relationship someday.<br>
<br>
The kind of love that most people think of when they hear the term nowadays, for the most part, is pain.<br>
<br>
Really very sad that what I felt was supposed to be the purest, deepest, most true feeling that one could feel turns into a monster.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I can trust myself to love easily again.  I don't like being left.  I hate the fact that I am letting myself build barriers, but I don't know any other way of tearing them down.<br>
<br>
So....  yeah.  Love is pain, and love is that unbelievably special thing my parents have. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Amaeliya/forestsig.JPG "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lethecerulre>Lethe Cerulre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DE Enchantress<br>

It is what I searched for for many years early on in my life to never truly have it returned from my family.  Love is what I felt for my ex-fiancee until he crushed my heart into pieces because he decided to trust the word of a lying friend and not ask me if the words that were said to him were truth.  It's something that has different levels for with which to fit all those that you care about into some nitch in your heart.  Aboslute love is what I feel for the man napping on the couch behind me as I type this and for the little boy sleeping in the room above me.  Love is the happiness that flows through my heart when I see those two play together and have so much fun, even though they are in no way physically related.  <br>
<br>
It's the quiet that envelopes me as I feel the warmth of my boyfriend as I snuggle with him.  It's the concern and caring I feel for each member of my guild as I get to know them better.  It's the one emotion I have searched with much pain to find for 23 years and I think I have finally found it.  It is also what tugs at one particular portion of my heart at this time of the year as the days grow closer to the time to remember the loss of the only family member that ever truly cared for me.<br>

<br>
I've loved, and still love, two men in my life. One is one of my best friends. The other....isn't.<br>
<br>
In both cases, it's been....the most painful thing I've ever dealt with.  But for different reasons.<br>
<br>
The first one...it took me 10 years and a lot of pain to figure out the key thing, in my opinion, about love. My love for him doesn't have shit one to do with him, really.<br>
<br>
Let me explain.<br>
<br>
If he leaves my life tomorrow...well, it wouldn't matter...no that's not right. It would matter, but it wouldn't make a difference. I will still love him just as much as I do now.<br>
<br>
I've also learned that love seldom has anything to do with romance and dating, and that type of crap. It has to do with caring so much about one person that their being happy makes you happy, even if that means you have to not be part of their life...and that brings me to the second one. Not saying it doesn't hurt, but I'm glad he's happy. *grin* <br>
<br>
Lastly, don't try to analyze love. It makes your head hurt. Love...just IS. It just is. <br>

I think it's a give and take thing, each person supporting the other, each person working to make the relationship stronger.<br>
<br>
I don't think that love is some overarching thing that controls people, some weird force or something.  You don't just fall in love and live happily ever after.  Relationships take work.  Love is like planting a garden.  You have to plant the seeds and water them every day, or they'll wither and die.  You can't take it for granted.  I've seen what that's like - my parents take a very casual attitude towards their relationship, and barely treat each other with respect anymore.  It's really sad.  You have to be willing to work for your relationship, and to compromise.<br>
<br>
Some people may think that what I'm talking about isn't love, and is some &quot;lesser&quot; emotion, but really.  Not everything comes naturally, even when you're in love.  Your partner won't know exactly what you need without being told, and neither will you know everything your partner needs.  You need to trust each other, respect each other, and try to make it work.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it won't work, especially if one person is doing all the work, and one person is getting their way all the time.  Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, things just won't work out.  You have to be true to yourself, as well... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I won't attempt to define it in the noun sense as it is something of an abstract concept on that end(something like describing what salt tastes like).<br>
A wise man once said, &quot;Choose your love, Love your choice.&quot;  I try to apply that on a daily basis with my wife.  To truly gain the more abstract noun form of love, we need to love the person we feel attracted to.  This means showing love to her through service to her, kind deeds, compliments, thoughtful gifts, speaking with her/listening to her(women want this more than most things you can give), and thinking about her well being on a regular basis.  <br>
A relationship was never meant to be 50/50.  We are not to give 50% of ourselves and then expect them to give 50% of themselves.  That almost always leaves us feeling that we have done our part and the other owes us something.  We are to give 100% or more, to make our best effort, and expect nothing in return.  THAT is loving someone, and such love is rarely non-reciprocated by one worthy of such love resulting in a strong 100/100 relationship.<br>
Unfortunately, today's society focuses more and more on pleasing ourselves and asking the question, &quot;What do I get out of it?&quot;  If one enters a relationship doing so to simply satisfy his own lust or because she makes him feel good, the relationship will last only as long as she continues to satisfy that lust or continues to make him feel good unless he takes action and begins to get beyond HIS needs and places HER needs in higher priority.  Of course, such action can lead to marriage if she decides to begin thinking about his needs more than her own.<br>
The point of all of this is, a woman can fulfill the needs of a man better than the man can himself.  (sex is a great example of this, but is goes much further than that)  Likewise, a man can fulfill the needs of a woman better than she can alone.  When we realize this and fill those needs of the one we love, and the one we love fills our needs, the relationship is strong and lasting.  Both parties have their needs, and likely their wants, met and both are very happy. <br>
Such is my experience, and the result of a great deal of study in many relationship books. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/scndtst.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oligith Fandarel</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Koada'dal Enchanter of the 35th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>League of Honour</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lanshamilton@firionavie>Lans Hamilton</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.odinsrealm.com/odinsrealm/tatakau/torge/tobluebutton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Why am I called a paladin again?</span><br>  Posts: 398<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/18/02 11:26:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.odinsrealm.com/odinsrealm/tatakau/ogre/ogrebknight1.gif width=47 height=47></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Confusion, love, etc...</span><hr size=1> I'll comment once I re-find my meaning of live.

<br>
Here is my advice.  Tell her you love her, if you think you might but are not totally sure.<br>
<br>
Because if you dont you may miss the chance to find out or to say it or anything.<br>
<br>
Life is too short.  Love is too abstract.  And my opinion about waiting til marriage... heh well it follows the same philosophy.<br>
<br>
My suggestions for to practice Carpe Diem (siezing the day) but I don't suggest throwing caution into the wind, just consider that each day is precious and at 17 is a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">very precious time</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and age.  <br>
<br>
You are likely a senior in highschool at 17, and you must grab this time by the horns and live it like you won't ever have the chance to live it again, because it will be gone ...<br>
<br>
...and when you graduate even if you are thickly in love with her you will have major decisions to make, even if they do not seem major, they are.  And you will likely lose the one who you consider your true love due to circumstance. and just life.<br>
<br>
Live like there is no tomorrow, but consider the consequences of there being a tomorrow.<br>
<br>
...and just live it up, because you wont be able to go back to do it again, and you will only GROW off the experiences, making you more knowledgable for future loves and relationships, and it will make you ultimately a better person &amp; lover considering you are not psychologically scarred by the heartache in between.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like that quote says...&quot;its better to have loved, then to have never loved at all.&quot; <br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to show it.<br>

Hmmm.<br>
<br>
Love is something this jaded romantic has tried time and again to define, and failed.  Love has meant many different things to me in my life.<br>
<br>
Love is all-consuming passion.<br>
<br>
Love is tenderness and roses on Valentine's Day.<br>
<br>
Love is respect.<br>
<br>
Love is a deeply felt connection, as if you've always known that person from before time began.<br>
<br>
Love is a ripping, tearing, rending pain that you are sure will kill you.<br>
<br>
Love is spanning distances of thousands of miles with a single thought.<br>
<br>
Love is a hug when you're sure no one cares anymore.<br>
<br>
Love is no regrets, and every regret you've ever had.<br>
<br>
Love is knowing your life is more complete because you had them in it.<br>
<br>
Love is visiting a grave and knowing that person is still with you, even in death.<br>
<br>
Love is the double-edged sword you hold, even though you could cut yourself with it.<br>
<br>
Love is everything, and anything.<br>
<br>
Love is endless possibilities.<br>
<br>
Love is my future, and my past.<br>

<br>
Don't even try and find deep meaning in love, it's not worth the hassle of putting all of it into words.  Just live it and be done with it.  It is by far the most complex emotion humans have to deal with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jenori>Jenori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/02 5:40:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Confusion, love, etc...</span><hr size=1> Wow...Serenity, you hit a chord. <br>
<br>
I'm gonna go cry for a bit now and then read other's replies. Not that I'm necessarily sad, just...well, yeah, that's love as I've known it...and still do even if he and I can't be together like we once were. <br>
<br>
Though I may have found someone else that I can know love like that again...we'll see.<br>
<br>
So I guess I pretty much agree with Serenity on this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowfoxgold>Shadowfox Gold</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/02 11:13:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Confusion, love, etc...</span><hr size=1> Dammit....<br>
<br>
I didn't think I could still cry about this.<br>
<br>
....<br>
<br>
Much of my life I have been an incredible skeptic and cynic.<br>
<br>
I used to not believe in love, or at least that other people had feelings and ascribed the word &quot;love&quot; to whatever it was that they felt.<br>
<br>
Then I fell in love.  It went from fascination and &quot;I think I could live a long time with you,&quot; to lovers and partners, to absolute best friend.  Someone I didn't have to hide any thought from.  A mutual &quot;I don't know how I could ever live without you.&quot;  Someone who became for me an integral part of who I am.<br>
<br>
We spent much of what I consider my adult life together.<br>
<br>
I knew absolutely in whose arms I planned to take my last breath.<br>
<br>
Now that person is gone...<br>
<br>
...the third time in my life I have lost a best friend to circumstances I couldn't control. <br>
<br>
The first was my sister, my childhood friend above all others, we began to grow apart at puberty but illness deteriorated and demolished her in slow motion into something totally unrecognizable as the friend I once knew.<br>
<br>
The second was my dog, laugh if you want - but I really didn't  have friends as a teenager - I watched her being born, and when in old age she succumbed to illness, I was the one that put her to death.<br>
<br>
The third ...<br>
<br>
...ended in a way that destroyed what I had come to believe love was, destroyed my view of people, destroyed my view of life...<br>
<br>
...probably, I'm still in shock.<br>
<br>
I spent most of last year believing essentially that I wear a coat of thorns.  That when I really reach out to touch someone elses heart, they and I both get hurt.<br>
<br>
The panic attacks at night, the bizarre sensation that I'm being physically struck by ghosts, crying every day feeling the stabbing feeling in my heart and abdomen, constriction of the throat, wanting to exhale till I can't anymore and then stop breathing - only to be betrayed by my body over and over again...<br>
<br>
...they have all passed into another reality now.<br>
<br>
All friendships I severed, because no longer believe they were friends.  I trust no one, including myself.  Reality it seems, is a figment of my imagination.<br>
<br>
Three years after knowing it was ending I am still learning to be really, truly, alone.<br>
<br>
Looking back with hindsight it seems to me that we form a construct in our mind of the other person - and fall in love with the construct - not the entirety of who the other person really is.  <br>
<br>
I know for certain that being together in love there were problems, life never works out perfectly or goes how you expect it to... at least it has not for me.  But I know it was the happiest time in my life.  I am still in love with the construct in my mind even though I know that the entirety of the person and the construct are not one and the same, maybe they never were, and I can never see things the same way again.<br>
