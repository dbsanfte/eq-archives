I'm not aware of anything that requires primal to hit, and I'm not that fond of robes. There's enough stuff in the game to keep me entertained with or without a ST zone. The &quot;We earned it&quot; arguement is just a bit whacky is all. How does one &quot;earn&quot; anything in video game? By playing it? What a horrible prospect to have to come home from work nightly and have nothing to look forward to except slaving away at your Norrathian job for another 4 or 5 hours. Sorry, I don't buy it. I think you've been playing the game for fun all along.  <p><CENTER>

Well with sow, lev and invis I can make a sweep of WW and see if Myga is up or not. I guess because I can't track I am not worthy of finding Myga, but then a wizard can't track. <br>
<br>
Reso's method's of finding Myga. Killing the PH's or searching after a zone repop.<br>
<br>
Beornn's method: Hunting in WW and seeing that Reso or somebody else has cleared them then show up later with his superior tracking skill (we all know that because he can track he is a better person than one who plays a warrior or other non-tracking class) and gank Myga if she spawned.<br>
<br>
I found it very disturbing that while both guilds were in the middle of large raids that a FnF druid just &quot;happened&quot; to leave their raid to check on Myga spawning at the time that PHs/Myga would be respawning. <br>

It's back to it's spawn point and surrounded by a whole gang of people that don't think it's all that special that they made it to the lair themselves. EQ is a game of linear progression for everyone who plays. Getting there first isn't anything to brag about and it doesn't give ya any rights. As Reg made clear, just about anyone can wear any guildtag they want. Choosing to play the game with your current friends instead of choosing to wear the power guildtag of the day shouldn't really cost you some end game content. Course, having your finger on the red ST button makes the recruitment officers job much easier I bet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubobmato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bobmato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/02 1:10:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1452.topic&index=26>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waking Sleeper</span><hr size=1> Maybe we could get VI to make a quest, involving the dragons, for puting the sleeper back to sleep.

If you think it will give you a chance at Ancient spells ... I guess thats fine your choice.  As for the &quot;lowering of you to FnF's standards&quot; why don't you knock that bullshit off eh?<br>
<br>
Fuck FnF's standards ... it's peoples standards huh?  If it all boils down to FnF's standards why do I make items for Reso people (Eskarina got 2 items she needed for White Dragonscale Cloak made by me yesterday) why do I buff people when they ask for it?  (ask Griffe and Yiar about kei).  Why do I group with Reso people when they ask or invite them to group with me?<br>
<br>
If it comes down to the King Tormax bullshit that happened I think the rank and file of both guilds have a bitter taste in their mouth about it because the leadership wouldn't or couldn't sit it and talk about it.  For god sakes /rand 0 1 or some bullshit to find out ... no instead we waited a long ass time and neither guild got shit ... thats right we both got screwed.  As for us &quot;lagging&quot; you up ... you do NToV with 55 people or so there were about 60 people at the zoneline so obviously you aren't blaming us for lag.  As for your god rods if you will remember we were assembled at the zoneline when you ran back and pulled him.  We had god rods down and it was said over guild not to cast not to do anything.  Our god rods disappeared ... whether you picked them up or not who knows who cares all I can say is quit making excuses for the death ... if you want to say why then say 2 of our clerics went ld in the fight ... not FnF caused 2 clerics to go ld by spamming them to hell or by lagging up the zone.  Why the extra bullshit?<br>
<br>
Why don't the people in Reso that don't like FnF and the people in FnF who don't like Reso keep their fucking mouths shut huh?  Name off people you don't like not a fucking generalization of the guild. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Phantasmist of 60 Seductions</I><BR>

It would be awesome.  So when the announcement goes out of who woke the Sleeper, it can be said it was a Multi-guild event including Reso, FnF, and AS (and whomever else was there) decided the time has come to wake the sleeper on behalf of the Firiona Vie server.<br>
<br>
To deny a paramount event like waking the Sleeper to those capable to those who could readily do it is selfish.  Will any of our lives really change all that much if it does happen? I think not.<br>
<br>
I say do it as &quot;server&quot; event vs. a guild event.  It would be nice to hear there was a collaboration between Reso, FnF, and AS to do it, rather than a competition, race, or oneup-manship happening at the high end.<br>

<br>
How does a cleric earn his epic? They work hard hunting down the quest pieces and muster enough forces to do the big encounters.<br>
<br>
How does a guild &quot;earn&quot; any loot they get off a boss mob of any sort? /boggle<br>

They have the people on who showed enough dedication and skill to get the job done. Thats how they earned it. Of course EQ is a game of linear progression. However there are side steps and places you can skip. One poster already pointed out ST is not a &quot;nessecary&quot; step. Its just a nice one.<br>
<br>
Of course I play this game for fun. I actually posted on another thread fun for me does involve getting loot. My fun is not entirely derived from obtaining loot, but I'd be a LIAR if I said it wasn't part of it.<br>
<br>
Killing the 4th warder is NOT trivial for Reso. They have been working at if for some time. Congratulations to all who were involved. If Reso wakes the sleeper I am going to be a good sport about it and congratulate them. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

In fact I had a whole post waiting for you.  But it never came, sigh.  And now here like a month after, it comes.  The accusation that we are &quot;stealing&quot; your spawns.  Please explain your reasoning that killing a ph entitles you to the rare spawn that may pop?  So the next time I am in Srra plowing snakes for Commanders, and I just happen to leave right before one spawns, I am entitled to that spawn by your reasoning?  Wow, thanks.  I think I never knew about this rule in eq.  Killing a rares ph means you get that rare.<br>
<br>
But wait.  What if, just for an interesting example, someone was killing a the ph for said rare for...  let say a week and a half straight.  And then some &quot;other party&quot; comes along and kills the same ph, then the next spawn is the rare?  Who gets the rare?  All the different possibilities are realllly confusing, could you explain in detail how this new policy of yours works?<br>

If I was killing placeholders for the express purpose of spawning the rare, and was remaining in the area waiting for the rare to spawn, I would be upset if someone came along and killed it.<br>
<br>
Grachnist the Destroyer, Shimmering Geonids, Quid Rilestone, Etc.<br>
<br>
I'd have put in all the requisite effort in getting the thing to spawn, and then someone else popping in and killing it would be really rude.  If I left the camp, then obviously I gave it up, and if the rare spawned 10 mins after I left congrats to whoever took over the camp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PS: Don't anyone read this as attacking Elaira, just discussing the theoretical rights to a monster that's spawned by killing bunches o' placeholders.  I'd popped a shimmering geonid and was medding for mana again, and Elaira saw it on track, dropped by, and respected that I put in the work to get it there and just moved off to clear a different portion of the cave (I've had 2 occasions where other people weren't that polite).   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueyston.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eyston</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/02 4:12:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1452.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Reso, you have a choice</span><hr size=1> Side note, Myga is an 8 hour spawn with PH... you don't 'camp' him Syll.<br>

Okay...<br>
<br>
Sarhea, I do not know much about this plague of the Karanas thing.  But I would like to ask you, how does curing the plague of the Karanas hurt other people and deny them things on the server?<br>
<br>
I just don't see justification for waking the Sleeper in that you don't have any aspirations for primal.  Other people do, and leaving the Sleeper sleeping won't harm you, right Sarhea?  If you had the choice of letting the Sleeper sleep and letting other people get items they do want (which you may not care about, but hey, no skin off your back), or waking the Sleeper and not letting people get things that they do want, which would you choose?  Either situation really does nothing to impact the way you play this game.  You probably wouldn't even notice it.  So why not choose the one that benefits others more?<br>
<br>
BTW, I have an ST key ... I have a gnome mask ... I have my primal spear ... I have a clawed guardian bracer ... these aren't my motivation<br>

Clearing the placeholders means there is a chance that 12 (?) hours later Myga (a named dragon who drops a pice needed for a quest which results in a wizard spell).<br>
<br>
There is more than one placeholder as well. So its not like Reso had a group camping a single spawn point waiting for the rare to pop. There were at least 4 seperate groups (trying) to clearing placeholders at any given time of day all hoping Myga would pop. I remember killing Myga at 2am MST because we were lucky to get one to pop. I aslo rememebr clearing the Placeholders and returning the &quot;x&quot; number of hours later to find a group from reso there.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
No can claim that spawn if you ask me becuase of the weird time to pop and the fact that if you zone into that zone its almost always empty... how in the world are we to know who cleared what?<br>
<br>
If reso really wants to claim it, I suggest they treat it like the AC camp in SRO. I suggest they clear the placeholders and have a team of reso in there for the entire respawn time &quot;camping it&quot;. That way if another team zones in they can say, &quot;Hi! We're camping Myga, just so ya know ok?&quot; I'm sure any guild would respect that especially if they are there for that many hours.<br>
<br>
This would be no different then camping the AC in south ro. You can't clear all the place holders, leave for 12 hours and expect to return and have someone surrender the AC to you if they happen to find it in the zone. When you camp the AC you go there KNOWING its gonna be a long ass camp and you sit on your bum and wait patiently.<br>
<br>
Of course, with Myga they could be there for days, but that just goes to show how rediculous this whole thing is. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>
