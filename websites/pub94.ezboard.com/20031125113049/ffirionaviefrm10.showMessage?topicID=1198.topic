The first chapter, &quot;Aina's journal&quot;, was originally written as a stand alone story with no subsequent chapters or definitive ending.  However, I was pursuaded to change my mind and the result is what you see below.  Thank you and enjoy.))<br>
<br>
The night was stifling hot. Moisture clung in the air like hot breath as condensation slowly built up on the walls of Castlestorm. And there was no breeze, no current of air to offer relief for even the briefest of moments. Aina shifted her weight on her perch, a small ventilation window some thirty feet above the main entrance doorway. A book lay neglected near her feet as she turned to face the non-existent wind. It was a perfect night, she thought, heavy, brooding, and full of dark promises.<br>
<br>
Short quick steps broke through the silence. Aina turned back to see a small figure still fastening the last of his armor with one hand, while his other hand balanced a warsword across his shoulders, as he raced down the steps. Kedrick was running late again. Aina smirked at the sight of a gnome carrying a blade taller than he was. The gnome paused only briefly when he spotted the Tier'Dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reading anything good, Aina?&quot; Kedrick inquired.<br>
<br>
&quot;Night spiders and their poisons,&quot; Aina quipped, &quot;Researching a new slow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kedrick only nodded as he ran through the doorway just as Katryna came walking in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your poison will never be as good as my disease!&quot; Katryna taunted as she started laying various scrolls and parchments on a couple tables on one side of the greeting hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mine stacks!&quot; Aina's comeback caught the shamaness offguard as she contemplated the new possibilities.<br>
<br>
No sooner had Katryna emptied her bags than the deserted hall was filled with casters of all kinds, crowding around the two tables in search of new spells or ways to acquire them. Katryna took it all in stride as she queried who wanted what and who still needed what she didn't have, carefully taking notes for her next trip.<br>
<br>
Aina looked on for a while before picking up her book again.<br>
<br>
&quot;How's the weather up there?&quot; Aina looked down and saw it was Dekarn querying her. Surrounding him were three buxom applicants who seemed more interested in his wardrobe than the tour he was taking them on. As one applicant reached up and caressed his face with the back of her hand, Dekarn, without waiting for a reply, choked out &quot;Nice talking to you, Aina,&quot; and resumed his tour down one of the more dimly lit hallways of the keep.<br>
<br>
Smiling, Aina just shook her head and let her eyes wander back to the crowd around Katryna when she noticed a gnome cowering underneath one of the tables. This gnome was unclean, untagged, and clearly unhappy with where he was at. He alternated his desperate gaze between the kitchen hallway and the door out, almost as if undecided which way he wanted to go. Looking behind him, the dirty gnome gave a sudden yelp and bolted for the door, making it only halfway there before getting landed on by a hungry Vah Shir, knocking him out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lunch will be served shortly,&quot; Toxox crowed happily as he picked up and carried the unconscious gnome off to the kitchen.<br>
<br>
At about this time, Lord Haavok and Laelu entered the hall, Lord Haavok making a beeline for the guild vault down the center corridor. The ogres standing gaurd stood at smart attention as the Lord of Castlestorm unlocked the vault with his key and made his selection for one of the younger guildmembers. Relocking the vault, he headed back up the corridor.<br>
<br>
While this was happening, Laelu announced, &quot;Raid tomorrow, remember to bring resist gear. And we will be needing a rogue with lockpicks,&quot; she added looking straight at Aina, &quot;work it out with Diablita and Lazo as to who will cover that duty.&quot; Turning back to Lord Haavok, the two began discussing tentative group assignments as they headed up the stairs.<br>
<br>
After the two had left, Aina gently slammed her book down on the window ledge as she leaned back against the window frame, lines of frustration clearly etched along her face. Returning to her room, Aina opened her journal and made the following entries:<br>
<br>
1) Visibility is too high in the window above the main entrance doorway, need to find a less conspicuous place<br>
2) Don't hire gnome spies, the Vah Shirs get hungry<br>
3) Don't bring a book, no one is fooled<br>
<br>
Tapping a finger on her chin, Aina added one final note.<br>
<br>
4) Still need a distraction, might have to steal a screenshot from Xaenria's collection and pin it up in the courtyard to buy time. Lord Haavok as Fier'Dal or Guktan should ensure he does not wander into the vault while I'm in there with his key.<br>
<br>
Satisfied with what she had written, Aina slipped the journal back into its hiding place before leaving to case Xaenria's room next. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ainanimus>AinaNimus</A> at: 10/22/03 3:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ainanimus>AinaNimus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>May Innoruuk shine a little Hate on your path.</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 3:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1198.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mail call</span><hr size=1> *feint* *feint* *full swing*<br>
<br>
The sound of the blade hitting the metal staff reverberated throughout the arena area as the force of the blow sent the monk sailing fifteen feet through the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand up and fight,&quot; Haavok gritted out.<br>
<br>
Grinning, Bendar jumped lightly back up, slowly twirling his staff as he faced off with Haavok again. The two continued their sparring, neither using their magics as this was not a battle to the death. Aina watched on discreetly, watching as each tried to gain a tactical advantage through footwork and feintwork alike. Two old fighters, each knowing only too well the other's advantages, disadvantages, tricks, and habitual tendencies. As a result, all day sparring was not uncommon between these two.<br>
<br>
When the two fighters stopped for a mend break, Aina wandered back towards the guildhall. It was still early morning, mail had just been delivered, and only a few folks were up and awake. Katryna, Elyta, and Muarah greeted Aina as they enjoyed their breakfast and mail in the courtyard.<br>
<br>
Back in the arena, breaking the silence, Bendar protested, &quot;You know Dominion has always done whatever he wants, M'lord, and my influence with him just doesn't reach very far.&quot; Haavok growled, swinging his blade and knocking the water cup out of Bendar's hand, &quot;Break over, fight!&quot; Soon, the arena was once again echoing sounds of combat.<br>
<br>
Entering through the main doorway, Aina turned and headed down the hall leading to her room. However, after turning a couple of corners, Aina stopped suddenly and pulled her shroud around her face as she disappeared from view. Returning to the entry hall, Aina headed down the center hallway towards the guild vault, barely glancing at the guards as she passed them.<br>
<br>
&lt;Haavok&gt; /time<br>
&lt;Haavok&gt; /tell Muarah TL to bind for two. Now.<br>
<br>
Coming to the end of the hall, Aina paused and looked back. The guards continued to face forward, stonelike in their stances. Approaching the vault door, Aina closed her eyes and tried to sense what was directly in front of her. Locked but not trapped, just like all the other times she had come down here and sensed the lock. Pulling a stolen key out of her pocket, Aina turned it slowly as the tumblers yielded freely. After again ensuring no one was looking down the center hallway, Aina opened the vault door and slipped inside quickly, before gently closing the door behind her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ainanimus>AinaNimus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>May Innoruuk shine a little Hate on your path.</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 3:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1198.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The vault</span><hr size=1> Aina's eyes adjusted to the gloom quickly as she surveyed her surroundings. The first thing she noticed was that this was no vault. Instead, Aina found herself in some sort of outer room, the vault itself still being protected by yet another door, this one unlocked but with multiple traps on it. Sensing something amiss, Aina carefully inspected each different trap and its respective trigger. After extensive examination, Aina was able to surmise that the traps were connected to each other, requiring them to be disarmed in a certain order. Working her way back and forth across the door, Aina disarmed them one by one. Finished, Aina opened the door partway and was immediately greeted by a strong rush of foul air, reeking of dankness and decay.<br>
<br>
'Leave it to Apep to convert a crypt into a vault,' Aina mused to herself as she pushed the door full open and surveyed the next chamber. Steps spiraled downward to several dusty sarcophaguses and ash-filled urns. Bones littered the floor from wall to wall, crushed and charred, some still with rags of flesh hanging to them. Scattered among the bones were remnants of armor and weaponry. The walls and columns, marked with black soot and deep scores, gave testament that many an unlucky soul had fought hard to avoid this grim repose.<br>
<br>
Approaching the last few steps, Aina sensed another trap and ran her hands along the handrail, feeling for some sort of disabling switch or lever. Back near the top of the stairs, Aina found a small string running a short distance down the underside of the handrail. Tugging on it, Aina heard a trap release its tension harmlessly.<br>
<br>
Bones snapped under the weight of her feet as she stepped onto the floor and made her way past a partially open sarcophagus. Approaching one that was fully closed, trapped, and locked, Aina sensed another trap and disarmed it twice, to be certain, before picking the lock. Picklock failed. Gritting her teeth, Aina tried again, releasing her breath only when she had finally coaxed the lock to open. Pushing back the lid, Aina angled for a closer look at the rusty lock, toying with the mechanism for a bit before penning down some notes and moving on.<br>
<br>
Slowly, workng her way around the room, Aina inspected and disabled every trap and lock she came across, occassionally scribbling down notes or drawing small pictures of what she found. After making a full circuit of the room, Aina stopped and inspected her notes, shuffling them a bit as she tried to organize them. When finished, Aina took one last look around the room before ascending the stairs and leaving.<br>

What was the point?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pride,&quot; Haavok replied, standing as he dismissed his skeletal illusion, &quot;Rogue pride. And what happened to my hour, Bendar? She made it through here in only 52 minutes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I protest, M'lord, that magic lock on the outer doors had her stumped for days. A total shame, too, she left before respawn,&quot; Bendar spoke as a new shadow fell across the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;She'll get a quick education if she pulls this stunt again. Don't forget to lock up before you leave.&quot; Haavok began to cast a spell as he spoke.<br>
<br>
Haavok hit a chardok princess for 8,147 points of non-melee damage.<br>
A chardok princess writhes in the grip of agony.<br>
A chardok princess has been slain by Haavok.<br>
<br>
&quot;Already on it,&quot; Bendar replied as he slid a sarcophagus lid back in place, looking up only after Haavok had already left. &quot;And an even greater shame that I don't get to watch what happens next,&quot; Bendar sighed to himself.<br>
<br>
As Aina left the main hall and stepped through the courtyard, she noticed Laelu had joined Katryna and Elyta for breakfast and was now being hailed by the priestess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning, Aina,&quot; Laelu's voice was warm and friendly, &quot;Would you like some buffs before your hunt today?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If it is no trouble, then I thank you kindly,&quot; Aina accepted the group invite when offered.<br>
<br>
Laelu begins to cast a spell.<br>
Katryna begins to cast a spell.<br>
Elyta beins to cast a spell.<br>
<br>
A short while later, Katryna said, &quot;Ok, we're all done, need to med now.&quot; Aina only nodded as she reviewed her full buff bar.<br>
<br>
Ntalliya begins to cast a spell.<br>
Aina has been summoned!<br>

I do not tolerate insubordination.&quot;<br>
<br>
He had not killed her nor had he shown her any mercy, not that she had expected any. He had driven home his point with each drop of blood he drew. If she didn't fight back enough, his attacks became flurries, ripping her flesh with the curse of his blade as he taunted her for giving up or giving in. So she had fought with all she had, resorting to jousting in an attempt to keep him turned around and showing his backside. Although she did land a few backstabs with this strategy, she was still no match for him and fell incapacitated when his magics finally ate through her buffs.<br>
<br>
When the cloud of disease eventually dissipated, Aina regained enough of her health to roll onto her side and pulled herself to her knee. Hot and cold flashes ran along her spine as she tried to regain her sense of balance and summon the strength to stand up. Gritting her teeth, Aina bound the worst of her injuries before standing full up and willed her herself to begin walking out of the now empty arena.<br>
<br>
As Aina reached the arena's archway, she paused as she noted a courtyard full of Storm members, a path cleared through the middle up to the steps where the Lord of Castlestorm stood, leaning slightly forward on his blade as he watched her impassively. Glancing through the crowds on either side of her, Aina caught the eye of her good friend, Dekarn, who nodded slightly at her. In a moment of clarity, Aina understood what was happening. Haavok was not throwing her out of the guild, instead he was making an example of her in front of any others that may wish to defy him.<br>
<br>
Resolved, Aina braced herself as she began walking the gauntlet. She was a proud being and would not show weakness. They could judge her, if they wished to, for disobediance, for deception, even for allowing her pride to get the best of her, but she would be damned if she didn't willingly stand up in front of them to face the consequences of her own actions.<br>
<br>
Her now soaked bandages were ignored as she focused on walking without stumbling. Every jolt from her steps reverberated along her spine and yet she did not allow the pain to show upon her face. Her mind burned with the many faces of her guildmates as she passed them and yet she walked with eyes focused forward, seeking neither sympathy nor assistance for her wounds.<br>
<br>
Reaching the steps in front of Haavok, Aina returned his steady gaze as she kneeled in front of him, bowing her head slightly. Several moments passed before he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since you are so proud of your stealth abilities, Aina, those abilities are now at my beck and call, as well as that of my officers. Whether it is scouting enemy positions, recovering corpses, or what have you, you will fulfill these duties on demand and without regard to inherent risks or distances to be traveled. Against my enemies, you are permitted the fullest use of your skills, taking whatever liberties and loots you desire. However, use those skills again in this castle and I will not show the leniency I have shown today.&quot;<br>
