<br>
My highest level character in the one my partner ran  for over a decade (and still runs online) was a 10th level Druid, followed by a 9th level Paladin.  Since every magic item in his campaign was unique (for example, there was only one +1 short sword), having any magic items was extraordinarily rare.  The aforementioned Paladin decided to have her holy blade created by her temple--and it worked out so that the blade she wound up with fit her persona perfectly.<br>
<br>
The focus shifted from who can do the most damage (&quot;hack-n-slash&quot;) to roleplaying, being in-character, and so forth.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that EverQuest is only about smashing monsters and getting loot.  If that were the case, why bother with things like faction, with some of the sometimes-impressive scenery (like the mysterious goddesses carved in the mountains in Eastern Karanas), and with story-based quests?  I think the structure is there to roleplay around; whether you choose to ignore that or not is up to you.<br>

And it seem's to me that so many of you people have gotten it stuck in your head. That if you strive to attain these thing's you are all of a sudden struck down with the almighty d00d stick and forever lost as a rollplayer. I bet if alot of the people like this (shin im talking to you!) would just loose that attitude. You know the one im talking about (I am rollplaying d00d's must die! attitude). Everyone as a whole on friona vie and this board in particular would have a much better time. <br>
<br>
      I supose if you have played the game for a long time and you have seen all there is to see and you just want to play your &quot;roll&quot; and be left alone that's fine. Leave everyone else alone also if that is your intent. But for people that havn't, It seem's like you are missing so much. I see new things every day in everquest alot of wich are just icredible as far as a game goes. I sure wouldn't want a small minded preconcived idea that if I lvl and get the phat lewtz im gonna be damaged good's holding me back from experiancing those things.<br>
<br>
    And Robin you make it sound so unapealing &quot;smashing the monsters and getting the phat lewtz&quot;. That is what adventure is about! in Dungeons and Dragons and Everquest. You go explore and find new and interesting monster's and KILL THEM. And eventually by default you lvl up because of it. And from there you move on to the next bigger badder thing and defete IT. Story line and who your character are go hand and hand with this. You make it sound like the two oppose each other some way. They do not and if you played dungeons and dragons for 10 year's and never killed anything more than a kobold, why not just go play the sim's are dating or somthing just as drab as that? And as for seeing the things beetween the lines and the carvings in the stone.. That is part of the whole picture the whole grand scheme of things. People that lvl up and have fun killing things are not blind to that, as some would think. I certainly am not and think it is awsome the depth that was put into this game. But you can have both.. thats what im trying to open everyone's eye's to. Why dose it have to be split down the middle d00d's/rollplayers<br>
<br>
have you ever taken a d00d aside and tryed to show him your finding's. And show him the the thing's you have uncovered. Or do you just /rude /ignore him and walk off? destroying his opinion of rollplayers and forever mabey blinding his eye's to the thing's that you so covet?<br>
<br>
All im really trying to say is that if everyone looked at thing's from a different perspective. The d00d's mabey wouldn't seem so bad. And the Rollplay Jerkoff's wouldn't seem like such aloof im better than everyone stuckup's. And everyone that fall's in the gray inbeetween that just want to play the game wouldn't have to listen to both ends of the spectrum complain about the other.<br>

It isn't black and white.<br>
<br>
EverQuest was designed for people to level up in. Unless you're just shelling out 10 bucks a month to look at a 3d model saying, &quot;Hail, Soandso! Would thou care to walk across this open field with me?&quot; If so, go right ahead.<br>
<br>
If you just want to roleplay, though, and don't mind graphics, play a freakin' MUSH or something. That's ten bucks less your wasting, and you don't level up there. Other than that, EverQuest is MADE to level up in and kill things. Roleplaying is the side part. MUSHs are made to roleplay in. End of story right there. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

If you re-read what I posted, you'll see how carefully qualified everything I said was; it was not &quot;roleplay vs. levelling&quot;.<br>

RP in EQ doesn't mean you don't play the game.  It characterizes why you play the game.  Does your character have a back-story?  Is he distinct from you?  Why does your character do these things in Norath?

Interesting views.<br>
 <br>
Do I kill things? Yes. Frequently. A lot.<br>
 <br>
Do I level a lot? No. I don't.<br>
 <br>
I help allies. I swat a LOT of greenies. I kill things simply because my Harm Touch is back and I want to hear something scream and die in front of me.<br>
 <br>
I also do things that don't involve killing or questing. This means I don't have a steady flow of experience. I'm at a decent level (31) right now. No hurry to 60 here. I'm having fun roleplaying-as opposed to roll-playing,which is a good slang term for letting the dice do all the role-playing for you.<br>
 <br>
So yes,roleplayers will level slower than non-roleplayers. Very simply,if one does nothing but what levels one up,you WILL level up faster. Stop to smell the roses,as opposed to hunt-kill-loot-repeat...in other words,to interact with anyone in any detail past finding the next things to hunt-kill-loot-repeat...and you simply won't do as much towards leveling up.<br>
 <br>
Roleplaying does not equal not leveling-however,as a means to gain levels quickly it stinks on ice because it discards the most effective method of using one's time to do so.<br>
 <br>
Which is why most roleplayers find d00dspeak annoying. It's a glaring sign that the person is only interested in the fastest and non-creative way of doing things...and that's just not RPing squat,people. It's,to quote someone else here- &quot;Laziness&quot;.<br>
