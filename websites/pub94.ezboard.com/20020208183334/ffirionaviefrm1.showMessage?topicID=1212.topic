IF someone adds a negative reply that reply is usually just deleted but the post remains. Saying congrats to someone for whatever achievement like completing a really hard quest, getting an epic, or even just winning a GM event (which any level can do) deserves recongnition. To me it is no different than someone posting a wedding annoucement. Someone posting about a wedding could easily upset someone who strongly opposses weddings in RL (see a recent girl girl wedding posting on this board). But if you ask me, all of these examples I listed deserve to be celebrated.<br><br>Hiding these posts in the &quot;Kudos&quot; section (which I dont think gets read very much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) is just catering to the folks that only seek to tarnish or belittle others accomplishments. Why can't we just let people be recongnized for their achievements and celebrate with them?<br><br>Hmm, I guess this maybe does belong in the soapbox doesnt it?<br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A> at: 1/28/02 3:24:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugoestwoodwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goest Woodwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 3:35:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1212.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Congrats messages.</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, you made me think a bit.  While those types of messages are quite frequently in the general forum,  I actually think I lean towards the Kudos forum myself. <br><br>Honestly, and this may be personal bias showing, I think the majority of people that post those types of posts are only seeking or giving &quot;Kudos,&quot;  so why not put it there.  I view a &quot;I got this, did that&quot; as simply a request to &quot;Now praise me!&quot;  <br><br>I also seek out praise, but it is generally done with friends and the folks that completed the task with me.  I simply don't require or desire the praise of others, but that's my problem.  If someone were to send me a &quot;grats&quot; for something, I would think they would put it into the Kudos forum.  <br><br>Also, I must admit, if they do stay in the general forum, they are easy enough to simply pass over.  I know what loot drops off what beast, I don't care how many people you did it with, etc., so I simply don't read.<br><br>So to sum up in less than a thousand words,  I prefer those type of posts in the Kudos, but if they don't move, I'll simply move on past. Weddings should be posted in the Events forum, for that's what they are.<br><br>May Tunare forever bless the ground you tread,<br><br>Goest<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 3:44:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1212.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Congrats messages.</span><hr size=1> I can see your point.<br><br>I just thought the Kudos! section was for recongnizing an individual who went out of thier way to help someone or some group.
