That's one thing that frustrates me about most roleplaying games, that I'd prefer the game to play out like an interesting novel, with dramatic combat scenes, which was something nice about the Freeform Roleplaying I used to do.<br>
<br>
My ideal game (the game that I wish someone would invite me to participate in, hehe) would be long term, fantasy-based rather than modern or futuristic, and would contain epic, world-changing storylines.  Characters would start fairly weak and/or young and would work their way up in power.<br>
<br>
One major rule would be that characters would not start inter-party fighting, unless it was part of a major dramatic event, just because I've seen way too much inter-party conflict that either caused problems between the players OOC, or was just petty and stupid (like when the party spends 40 minutes thinking up a plan to deceive a camp of enemies, and one character blithely throws it all away in such a deliberate and idiotic way just because he doesn't like one of the other party members, apparently roleplaying the alignment of &quot;chaotic stupid&quot; - which of course prompts some of the other party members to turn on him in the middle of the camp, etc etc, just ruining the realistic RP mood).<br>
<br>
To foster working together, the characters would probably have to be kind of created in such a way that they would have a reason to work together, like encouraging the players to create characters following the same deity, or of the same race, maybe some of the same family, and certainly of the same or similar alignment.  Definitely each having some compelling reason to go on the campaign.<br>
<br>
I would rather have my gamemaster give me some definite guidelines on character creation rather than having him say, &quot;So you are in this tavern in X town, I don't know why, but you just are...  And something happens and it's just obvious to you for some reason that you should investigate.&quot;  It's not going to ruin the game for me if the GM tells me to make a character that's a police detective or whatever it is.  It'll just make it more interesting to me to be able to roleplay something that makes sense for the setting.<br>
<br>
I can also enjoy a real hack and slash dungeon crawler, and if that's what I know we're going for I'm going to break out the uber stats.  I just don't like creating a character with personality and having that personality ignored.<br>
Like the time I created a rogue that was weak in combat but quite strong in charisma, allure and guile, and whenever I tried to talk to/persuade any NPCs about anything they ignored me.  Either give the players some guidelines and some idea of how the game is going to be played, or tailor the game to the characters a little more.<br>
<br>
I have a few character archetypes that I usually play.  Usually I play charismatic characters that like to talk their way out of things, only attacking if there's no other choice (except in the aforementioned hack &amp; slash games, when I'll usually play a surly, strong person).  Many of them have low wisdom and are the extremely confident, fearless type that would take almost any dare.<br>
My characters are invariably good in alignment, unless the particular game is specifically an &quot;evil party&quot; game or Vampire game or something.<br>
I had a great time once playing a snooty, yet good-hearted noble Elven minstrel in one of the more roleplayish AD&amp;D games I was in, who'd run away from home to seek fame and adventure, and ended up half falling for the somewhat uncouth Wood Elven ranger.<br>
<br>
I usually like to play a spellcaster or healer type, though tougher fighters can be fun as well.  I've had characters of all types over the years.<br>
<br>
Well, that's probably more like 82 cents than 2 cents, but I'm suffering from insomnia and rambling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usmallcutepuppy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smallcutepuppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 562<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 7:17:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Table Top Gamers</span><hr size=1> Number One thing I look for is a mature roleplaying group.<br>
<br>
Once you have that it doesn't matter what system you use. Personally I tend to just use the books for inspiration, have people roll up a character so I have a reference point, then I make them hand me all their character sheets and I do all the rolling myself out of their sight. Most of the time I don't even use the game's dice rules, unless for some reason I find them particularly appropriate; I just mentally assign an impromptu difficulty, roll 2d10 and improvise what happens based on that.<br>
<br>
Haven't had a good regular group since college though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I miss campaigns. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umylodifv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MylodiFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 9:19:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Table Top Gamers</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> apparently roleplaying the alignment of &quot;chaotic stupid&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I have had the most success with the D&amp;D, but this is mostly due to a fairly reasonable gaming group and a good Storyteller. <br>
<br>
What I don't, and I guess will never get is when my Storyteller for one game in particular told us that dying was a natural part of the gaming process. Okay??? Sure, in D&amp;D you can get a body resurected, is this what most players look foreward to? No. ( was not the same ST as my good games ) Why plan adventures that require your players to decide who is going to kick it before they go off into the wilderness? Seriously. Bah, I just want a good game where I can put the personality behind my character into play. I enjoy making slightly off the wall characters, why give them that extra spark if no one is going to appreciate it?<br>
<br>
So far my favorite ones have been my Dwarven Bard and my Aesimar Cleric of Corellion Latheren ( sp? I don't care it's way too late to look it up now ).  Both started off on Faerun, although the Cleric moved onto a Spelljammer environment. <br>
<br>
What I want to know is, am I the only one who has problems finding a compatible gaming group? I don't want Rollplay, I want Roleplay.  Does anyone else have this problem? Or additionally the problem of: &quot; Erm, you're roleplaying that exactly like -blank- from - blank movie/book/etc.- . If I wanted to play with Duncan from Highlander or the Crow I suppose I'd play in that setting. What's with that?? &quot;  * sighs * Sorry pet peeve. <br>

You all know that guy: the one with all the books from every damned system out there, who hates the fact that he runs games well because he never gets to play. Thats me.<br>
<br>
My three favorite Tabletop games would be D&amp;D3e, Rolemaster/MERP, and the WW Storytellers system.<br>
<br>
What I look for in gaming is, like mentioned above, mature players that know how to weave a proper story. If they arent creative, then maturity doesnt help them. I have many nights where we will play 6-8 hours and not have a single combat and minimal skill rolling. I prefer hardcore RP to combat.<br>
<br>
Another thing I look for is a willingness to work with others to weave that said story. Its a group project and needs everyones imput to make it truly epic. <br>
<br>
I would also prefer it if people had the ability to RP something that conflicts with their RL selves. I cant stand it when Im running a good game because noone feels that Lawful Good is a cool alignment. Thats D00Dism to me. They wanna be the bad-ass good-guy. Thats fine, but not ALL THE TIME! <br>

<br>
You baiscally declared yourself a fighter or magic type.  You could learn any skill you wanted, but to cross types costed you extra points.  Made sense to me.<br>
<br>
I prefered the simplicity because I did not get tied up in keeping up with a bunch of stats and could focus on the action and roleplay.  Nothing got to me more than trying to run a game in another system and having that &quot;problem&quot; player that could quote rules by page number and argue what they &quot;ment.&quot;<br>
<br>
When DMing, I always held individual sessions with players to start the backstory and to flesh out the characters.  Was alot better than &quot;You meet in a bar, summoned by a strange note; not knowing each other at all.&quot;  Shoot, it used to take me as long as 4 months before I'd bring the group back together for party adventurers.<br>

Valpo High School gaming club in 1990-1991.<br>
<br>
Most of the people there were also in National Honors Society or the Quiz Bowl Club.  A few of us were on the cross country team together too.<br>
<br>
The Best GM's were the Juniors and Seniors.  I was just a freshman.  We played almost every night after school in the cafeteria.  Then we started playing at eachothers houses.<br>
<br>
It was a magical experience.  Truely magnificent.  I have role played since, but nothing compares to that year, to the stories we wove, and the adventures we had.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mostly we played AD&amp;D, but also Shadowrun, Paladin, and a WWII game (can't remember the name).<br>
<br>
My dad got a new job out of state at the end of that year, and  I moved with my parents to Ohio, where my new school didn't even have a games club.  <br>
<br>
Though I started a new games club, the school made us call it a Chess and Games club, because roleplaying was kind of taboo.<br>

It was never the same.  I participated very few tabletop rpgs during the rest of highschool, but they sucked and I got wrapped up in other extra curriculars.  I got to put &quot;president and founder of the chess club&quot; on my college application, next to a bunch of other crap.  Though after my sophomore year I left it to persue other activities.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, I continue to read the books I started reading in 1990, starting with RA Salvatores novels.  I have moved on from RA Salvatore (though am still within the genre)except for his Daemon Wars Series for which I await the next release.<br>

sigh...<br>

I can remember parts of it like it was just yesterday.  GOD IT WAS FUN.<br>

It seems that I always have at least one power gamer to deal with so I tend to favor flexible, but well balanced systems that are easy to police. The best ruleset for that is the HERO system. The D20 system (3rd ed D&amp;D) is my current second favorite.<br>
