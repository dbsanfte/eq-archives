It saddens me that the FV server becomes less and less a special ruleset server and more and more of a regular server, and it seems that the population is starting to lean in favor of this occurring.  <br>
<br>
I for one really liked the original FV ruleset, and I have watched as it has been torn apart piece by piece and more and more people seem to support those changes.<br>
<br>
FV isn't special anymore except in one important way...the friends I have who play on it.<br>
<br>
I for one can't wait until EQ2 comes out.  Now that FV is the way it has become, EQ just doesn't interest me much any more.  My friends are the only thing that keep me coming back.  <br>

Thus... it is not only a matter of 65s farming (which yes, I agree they have far better things to do), it would be more likely someone in their low 50s. Oh.. but that's right, they are no longer considered &quot;high level&quot; because they are not 65. 50s is high level to someone in their 30s who might actually be trying to get the item when it is level appropriate.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I understand your point, Caillou, it is not just a matter of 60s or 65s farming.  But what one must realize is that the lower the level of the farmer, the less likely said farmer will be affected by TLC on the things they want to farm.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the 50s farmer.  What items are there out there that are a good profit for he or she?  I'll hazard to say that most items that would be of any interest, she'd still be in level appropriate range to go farm.  So TLC does not affect her, so no need to use the raid bug.<br>
  <br>
You mentioned the SMR.  The Arch Magus ranges from 43-45 so it wouldn't be TLC to your level 50s farmer.  Even at level 60, it would still be light blue.  So again, TLC not an issue.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at people who might come here from other servers to farm stuff they can't on their home server.  What items can they not farm on their own server?  The items that would be No-Drop back home (they can farm magic/lore items all they want back home).  Again, lets look at your lower level farmer (since I believe we've already established things that 60s and 65s would farm wouldn't be affected by TLC anyway, and thus not likely to bump heads with low level folks).  What items of interest for a 50s farmer are No-Drop back home?  It's not the SMR.  I'd hazard to say that there aren't any items of interest for a 50s farmer that have all three of the following in which TLC would be a deterrent:<br>
<br>
1) Worthy of farming<br>
<br>
2) Drop off a creature so far below their level as to be locked by TLC<br>
<br>
3) Is No-Drop back home, but not here.<br>
<br>
You mentioned how you could see TLC being dropped (because of raid glitch or otherwise) would be a clarion call for farmers.  I don't see it that way.<br>
<br>
Again, I think people are thinking of TLC in terms of times past.  Let's not forget, when the idea of TLC was first devised, there were no light blue mobs.  With the advent of LB mobs, the range in which you'd not be affected by TLC is increased.  So the only thing on a green mob of any interest to a high level person that is affected by TLC would be a quest item.<br>
<br>
So in today's game, who is benefitting from TLC?  Is it protecting anyone?  It's not protecting low level folks from farmers because high level people (60+) aren't going to farm low level content these days, so TLC protection not needed to ward of that 65 farmer.<br>
<br>
It's not protecting low level folks from the level 50s farmer because with the advent of light blue mobs (a concept that came about after the idea of TLC), anything worthy of the 50s farmer to farm is likely still in range for them not to be locked out by TLC.<br>
<br>
So in today's game, the problems that TLC was devised to alleviate do not exist in the large extent that they did when the idea of TLC was first born.  All TLC serves to do in today's game is to create instances where doing a quest becomes way more difficult than the quest was intended to be. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

As a SK I didn't get the Kunark expansion until I was in my mid to late 20s, I think, and as a SK it would have been almost impossible to get there!  I grant you it would have been harder to solo them as a SK, since the pet is next to useless, but it IS possible to pull only 2 at a time, and it IS soloable for some classes anyway.<br>

Not that I didn't run for the zone more than a few times.  I still recall Tallonar stopping by to watch one day and having to yell at him to not try and 'help' as I ran around madly.

<br>
If folks are gonna be jerks and take things away from the youngsters and go sell it in the bazaar or give it away and take the fun outa questing for it ( if you let them give it to you that's your fault ) then too bad - FV is gonna go by the wayside. And sooner or later another server will open up for those that don't agree and all those that are fed up will migrate over to it . . . <br>
