It was a celebration many people enjoyed... Why 8? One from each class... Cleric, Wizard, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Shadowknight, Rogue, and Warrior. The child had be 12 or 13... It was Innoruuk's favorite age of the dark elf... when the person changed in many ways that would shock the man. A meeting was taken place at a Inn in the 3rd gate area. Each guildmaster was there with record of every 12 or 13 year old's information. Also the queen's advisor who was in charge of the event was there jotting it down... He stood up, &quot;Alright. We will go with the Casters first.. Clerics first, do all 4 caster groups then the rogue and warrior.&quot; He looked towards the old aged Guildmaster... He had lightblue robes draiped over him and he was holding a bible type of book of Innoruuk... He stood up slowly then stared at his list. &quot;Well.. I have 7 people born on this date, 4 who are 12-13. 3 females and 1 male.&quot; The advisor took a deep thought... &quot;Kill the male.&quot; The priest was confused, &quot;Wouldn't you want to kill a female?.. It would kill the outnumberance.&quot; The advisor shook his head, &quot;We will whipe out what is not needed... Who is the fool?&quot; The priest stared at his list... &quot;Heress... only a 3rd circle cleric. Alright.&quot; The advisor jotted it down quickly, &quot;Thank you...&quot; The old cleric then left the Inn because he did not want to talk about scheduled deaths... The wizards, enchanters, and magicians already had their's planned out.. &quot;Ok... a girl wizard named Alic, boy enchanter named Nexomius, and a boy mage named Sirius...&quot; The advisor mumbled to himself as he wrote it down. He then turned to the Necromancer/Shadowknight guildmaster... &quot;Alright Xon, who are the 2?&quot; The evil man stood up and grinned evily... &quot;The unlucky necromancer is a woman named Puzuzu, and the fool of a shadowknight is Jakkin.&quot; The advisor nodded... &quot;Great way to get rid of that troublemaker, aye?&quot; Xon laughed out loud and nodded in agreement... The rogue guildmaster then stood up swiftly.. &quot;I have decided to give our most skilled roguess to the guild.. Yuim.&quot; The advisor was confused, &quot;Why your most skilled?&quot; The rogue bowed then replied, &quot;Because Innoruuk deserves the best. Make this young man's torment to be remembered... If you know what I mean.&quot; The advisor shook his head saddly but wrote it down, &quot;Then be it.&quot; The warrior stood up and gave a gruff face... almost like a dwarf, &quot;We have chosen our weakest warriors.. Dian and Devius... The twins.&quot; The advisor nodded in recognition but questioned, &quot;Why the weakest when Innoruuk was offered the best by a ROGUE?&quot; The warrior stood up to his tallest, &quot;I do not worship this man... but we shall get rid of the filth and make the dark elven race perfect.&quot; He sat down and smiled in proud to himself.. the others snickered.  Xon stood up.. &quot;I wish to give my own ideas of torment if I could...&quot; The advisor then replied, &quot;Choose one, the other one is for crowd entertainment.&quot; Xon's eyes went red... &quot;I choose Puzuzu.&quot; They both laughed evily then after some more commotion.. Everyone departed.<br><br>Later on that day Puzuzu went to the guild just like a normal person goes to school... Xon was going to have all the members in a meeting. The young necromancer wondered who the 2 victims were for this 1000 years.. She ran to the meeting and sat by her friends AJ and Hellix... Some necromancers had already heard the word and stared at Puzuzu with big eyes. Puzuzu was confused, should she have had fixed her hair? She looked further down her row of seats and noticed many people were jabbering to a shadowknight who was cursing at them.. &quot;Leave me alone you bastards! I deserve no attention... Lord Xon does!&quot;.. AJ chuckled, &quot;Kiss ass...&quot; Puzuzu ignored her... she knew something eiry was going on. Suddenly black smoke filled the stage up ahead and Xon appeared.. Many of the older necromancers and shadowknights scowled in praise and howled in cheers... Puzuzu hated the noise.. it always sent a chill down her spine. <br><br>Xon's eyes were red... it seemed he was enjoying himself. Like usuall... He then used his loud, powerful voice to let everyone hear him... &quot;Hello my evil spawn... Necromancers..&quot; All the necromancers screeched... &quot; and Shadowknights..&quot; The shadowknights roared in echo... &quot;Welcome to the meeting tonight.. Have you all noticed that it's the 4000th year of the dark elven race!?!? We have gone far.... Well.. Cut to the chase.&quot; Many screamed.. &quot;I have chosen the victims.... these 2 shall be remembered for maybe the next 1000 years or so...&quot; Many people laughed... &quot;Congratulations Puzuzu and Jakkin.&quot; <br><br>Puzuzu was paralyzed.... she stared over at Jakkin who fell out of his chair.. Many people were pointing at him and saying.. &quot;YOU ARE THE ONE!&quot; None seemed to notice Puzuzu though... she didn't care. She was one of the flunking Necromancers.. almost everyone was amazed at Jakkin's talent. Why would Xon kill Jakkin out of all people?... Puzuzu understood why they would kill her, she was a big troublemaker. She liked the reputation but never knew this would happen... Xon always told her, &quot;Your day will come when you shall regret it you fool...&quot;<br><br>AJ and Hellix stared in awe at Puzuzu.. &quot;I can't believe it!&quot; Hellix started to screech, she seemed excited... &quot;I am THEE ONE's best friend!!&quot; Her and AJ started to dance... &quot;SHUT UP.&quot; Puzuzu yelled... &quot;How would you like to be the one who is being killed?...&quot; AJ shrugged.. &quot;I never will be that lucky.&quot; Suddenly Xon casted a trance spell that guided their eyes towards him.. &quot;Alright. This is how it goes.. Jakkin shall be have his torment put the way the crowd decides.. As for Puzuzu... It's time your demented guildleader showed you some of his stuff!&quot; He lifted his hands in praise and most of the guild cheered.. AJ and Hellix cheered... Puzuzu was mad stiff. &quot;Damn you.&quot; She said. She got up out of her chair and left the meeting room... How would she get out of this one? <p><center><br><img src="http://a0.cpimg.com/image/8A/CA/8481930-eaf4-014B01B8-.jpg"><br><font color=purple><br><b><br></b></font><a href="http://www.mines.edu/students/a/averheyd/">\m/Verbreiten Sie die Krankheit\m/</a><br>Fürchten Sie die Schwärzung...,  Hageln Satan</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umelmell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melmell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theorderofthedragon.com/docs/fanart/cross.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A_Idiot_666</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/7/02 8:30:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://a0.cpimg.com/image/8A/36/8501130-86a6-00800074-.jpg height=145 width=128></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Puzuzu didn't understand it.. Why must they show honor in such a horrid way? Or was it just her?... She hated being a necromancer... Maybe she could show them. She walked down the street with her head hanging low. A couple richy people bumped into her then bowed, &quot;You are Puzuzu the Chosen are you not? Quite a honor... I would do anything to be in your place.&quot; That gave Puzuzu an idea.. &quot;Give me all you own and sure as heck I will...&quot; The man laughed and shook his head, &quot;Innoruuk has chosen, I will not deserve the natural flow of chance and choice..  I still wish it though.&quot; Puzuzu was dissapointed... These people seemed to take things so seriously. Life wasn't suppose to be that simple... Yes. You can change things... The 'flow of chance and choice' sucked anyways. :P<br><br>Puzuzu rolled her eyes at the excited chatter from the 2 dark elves as she walked further away from them. She had to hide. Hide forever maybe... She loved a wild reputation, being noticed, and famous but this was the type of famous she didn't ask for... She didn't want to sacrafice herself to abunch of suckers. Especially with the 'dreaded whore', her guildmaster, would choose her fate. &quot;Ick.&quot; she said to herself... Almost home. She wondered what her parents would do, they were alot like her. Hating all these 'brainwashed fools' and Innoruuk but still devoted themselves to him... They would probally bitch and moan with her but not do anything about it. <p><center><br><img src="http://a0.cpimg.com/image/8A/CA/8481930-eaf4-014B01B8-.jpg"><br><font color=purple><br><b><br></b></font><a href="http://www.mines.edu/students/a/averheyd/">\m/aegrotatio egrotatio\m/</a><br><font color=grey><font size=10><TABLE STYLE="filter:glow(color=#a2a2a2, strength=5)"><TR><TD><center>Timeo Cariosus Acerbus Abyssus</TABLE></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspirits101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spirits101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/9/02 7:25:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .Good story</span><hr size=1> Very good story.

What the hell?... Was Innoruuk controling it or something?.. Nah. It always chased her, today it just seemed more specific. Puzuzu glared at the stupid wolf. The damn thing was like a cow, so stupid it will not excape under the old fence without a will, it just munches on the grass until it is slaughtered. The dog would surely see his death if he messed with the already maddened necromancer. Did it care? probally not.. It howled then charged at Puzuzu's feet.. Grabbing on to her grey robe and pulling her down. It attempted to atleast. Puzuzu started to try and kick it in the neck.. finaly after many failed tries she succeeded kicking it right in the middle of the neck. Hoping she made it feel it the dog seemed to quit gnarling at her and sat down.. It started whining in utter pain. Puzuzu kicked it hard in the stomach killing it. It gave one last whine before dieing. <br><br>Not looking back at the black wolf Puzuzu turned the corner to her underground house. Opening the door with the Innoruuk symbol on it, she spat at it, and walked down the stairs that lead to the floor of the house. Her mother was washing some robes and her father seemed to be deep in meditation. Puzuzu groaned loudly enough to get her mother's attention, &quot;What is wrong dear?&quot; The necromancer sat down pityfully like usuall, &quot;You will get your dinner, just be patient.&quot; her mother scoffed at her while trying to speed up. &quot;It's not that..&quot; Puzuzu muttered to herself, &quot;I am Innoruuk's little 4000th year sacrafice.. thats all.&quot; The pot dropped out of &quot;mom's&quot; hand... it interupted her father who had a growl on his face. &quot;YOU WHAT?&quot; Her mother screeched.. Puzuzu rolled her eyes, &quot;I am the god damn chosen one to be sacraficed to Innoruuk, ok? As in 4000th year chosen one?&quot; Her father's expression changed quickly from a maddened face to a awed glare... &quot;MY Puzuzu?... Our daughter?&quot;<br><br>~Bleh.~ Puzuzu thought to herself. ~Just as I thought.~<br><br>Her father put his arm around her and sat down... &quot;Our family? Our daughter?.. &quot; The mother had tears in her eyes... Puzuzu DID NOT want this type of attention at all.. here they were, proud of her when usually they were very ashamed. Always mocking her, whipping her and the such. But today they were pretty much worshiping her, muttering to themselves about how important it was, they couldn't get over it. &quot;Guys, chill out!&quot; She yelled... &quot;CHILL OUT?&quot; Her father laughed slamming his fist on the table, &quot;Out of all honor, I have finally got what I have deserved... What I have owed to Innoruuk...&quot; Puzuzu was confused, &quot;But I thought you hated Innoruuk?&quot; He shook his head, &quot;No. Not until I have realized how amazing he actually is, ok?&quot; Puzuzu gave a pouty face, &quot;I will not die for this bastard.&quot; It made her parents immediatly back up.. they had blank stares..<br><br>Puzuzu didn't care. She thought they would help. But no. The odds went aggainst the favored... She kicked the door open and walked out... seeing the same black wolf once again on the ground motionless. Soon her body would be like that, stupid, non-aware, motionless... NO! She couldn't. What about her dreams of becoming a warlock?.. &quot;I will succeed in what I have been wanting for the past 4 years.&quot; She said sternly to herself. How would she bribe these people? How could she change their minds?.. She had to do something that would amaze them..<br><br>/ooc:Thx for comment!:ooc\ <p><center><br><img src="http://a0.cpimg.com/image/8A/CA/8481930-eaf4-014B01B8-.jpg"><br><font color=purple><br><b><br></b></font><a href="http://www.mines.edu/students/a/averheyd/"></a><font color=grey><font size=10><TABLE STYLE="filter:glow(color=#a2a2a2, strength=5)"><TR><TD><center><font color=red>\m/SPREAD THE SICKNESS\M/</TABLE></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspirits101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spirits101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 10:08:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...keep it going</span><hr size=1> I like the concept of a rebel dark elf necromancer, but who is still &quot;bad&quot; .

She was related to Hydrokronik the Dreaded. Even Innoruuk wouldn't mess with him... Hydro has been to the evil Void.. and tooken hold of the black magick. Less then 10 warlocks had their hands on it, and lesser had the power or knowledge to control it. Many went to self destruction, dedicating their souls to it just like Xell, the creator did, then once they had used the black magick they were turned to ashes. But Hydrokronik had stayed strong... The magick had tried to control him but it always failed. Hydro only had used it once in killing some of his worst foes. Puzuzu was just a normal failing necromancer... The warlock's most pathetic spells could kill her instantly. But she didn't care.. If she worked for it she could grab it.<br><br>Where was Hydrokronik though?... The last she had heard of him was he had married a Pure One, Sakurajosui the high elven cleric. Then went off somewhere and caused destruction... He was one of the most confusing people to figure out. One of the few who knew Xell well enough to talk to him normally with comparable powers... Since Xell's death he had been on a revenging streak. He wanted to somehow gain control over the magick of the Void and turn it towards making evil more powerful. He had respect for Innoruuk though... That was the downfall. <br><br>Since she did not want to return home because that was pretty much suicidal she walked towards the gates of Neriak... Pulling over her long black cloak she treaded out. Many guards glared at her but did not bug her much.. They just took her as some useless lonely beggar. Puzuzu didn't care... She already was that way practically. <br><br>The cold air of Nektulos bit on her face. She poked her face out of the corner seeing the handsome Tdail giving orders to some of those weird stone men. &quot;I want you to search out for Puzuzu the necromancer... We must sacrafice her at once or Innoruuk will not be pleased.&quot; Puzuzu knew Tdail could see invisibility but the stupid stonemen couldn't... After he walked off towards his watching area she quickly casted the smoky spell on herself then ran quickly towards the bridge. <br><br>After a long tread of avoiding black wolves, undead, and other younger necromancers she finally made it to the log. The log where she, in her earlier days had fought for her life to survive. Now she just laughed at the snakes, firebeetles, occasional wolf cubs, and other things that crawled all over it. Remembering the errands of killing the silk for her guild. How stupid she had been to serve them. Walking over and noticing her invisibility fade she grabbed hold of a spiderling and crushed it with her bare hands... &quot;Soon.. This is how those Innoruuk following whores shall fall.&quot; A young necromancer cringed at seeing the spider blood all over her hands... Puzuzu just laughed and kicked the necro in the stomach... &quot;Curse you and Innoruuk.. Curse you.&quot; The necromancer was shaking all over... This is what she wanted them all to be doing. Realizing how pathetic she was at causing anger to such pathetic things she ran off... the necro's friends came over to help the hurt dark elf. &quot;That was Puzuzu... We better report her.&quot; One of them said.. <br><br>Puzuzu had about 3 or 4 black wolves barking at her... She was running quickly as she could towards the bridge... Pulling her hood over herself yet again she walked on the bridge. Hoping the guards would kill the wolves first before attempting to capture her she went on without haste. She was right... Once all the wolves had howled their last howls the guards started chasing her. She was almost out. Once she had left the passage way that lead into the forest the guards would be too scared to leave their spots. She hoped anyways...<br><br>&quot;Puzuzu!! Get back here!&quot; They roared... Armor clammering and all. Puzuzu laughed to herself, what energy they were wasting. Not showing any sign of tire she went on running. Seeing the light of the Commonlands she ran towards the hillside that lead towards Freeport. She climbed the deadly height and arrived on top of the mountain. The guards were still after her. Puzuzu groaned annoyingly as the fools struggled up the mountain side. She yelled at them.. &quot;Your armor is too heavy, your weapons too big.. fools!&quot; Flipping them off as they slid back down and ran back into Nektulos. But some shadowknights arrived... &quot;Uh oh.&quot; Clammering to her feet she ran towards Freeport.. Sliding down the mountain side and onto the wall she walked.. It was a long brick wall but the shadowknights stayed out of the guard's eye.<br><br>After 20 minutes of balancing and stress she made it to 'safe point'. Jumping off the wall she struggled, breathing heavily, and running into the city. Many humans threw dust at her. &quot;Worthless peice of trash necromancers... go sacrafice yourself to Innoruuk you self destructing bastards.&quot; Some stupid young mage said. Puzuzu thought, what a brave idiot.. She ran towards him with her black dagger and struck him in the heart with no haste. Quickly pulling it out of his chest she ran towards East Freeport...  Noone really hesitated except a couple walked over.. &quot;What a fool.. Never mock the dark elves at such a age...&quot; They left him dieing and decaying.. <br><br>Puzuzu ran through the streets and passage ways until she arrived at the docks.. A guard stopped her. &quot;Why would a dark elf be heading over the ocean? Nothing welcomes you here between the gnome city ya know.&quot; She shrugged... &quot;I am just a rebel.. I am leaving my city in search of someone. CLASSIFIED.&quot; She said sternly. The guard shrugged, &quot;Whatever... Don't cause trouble is all I care about.&quot; Puzuzu ran across the wooden planks and rested at the edge. She never realized how tired she was. The scorching sun was setting. A human monk, half elven ranger, and a dark elven necromancer were there. Noone interesting. The dark elf seemed to be of high status... Puzuzu bowed towards him and gave a simple, &quot;Hi..&quot; The dark elf glared coldy at her, &quot;Yuin is the name, what do you want, scum?&quot; She shrugged then asked, &quot;Do you know Hydrokronik the D--&quot; &quot;Of course I know Him.. What makes you think I don't?... Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; He was a chatty one.. &quot;DO you know WHERE he is???&quot; Yuin laughed, &quot;Of course I do, you think I'm some dummy?... Crushbone, stupid. Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; Puzuzu groaned, &quot;Ok thanks... Do you know when the boat gets here?&quot; Yuin seemed pretty laid back, guess he hadn't talked in awhile, &quot;Duh. I do. 10 minutes maybe. Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; The half elf chuckled....<br><br>&quot;Will you quit saying that?&quot; Puzuzu said slowly... Yuin shook his head, &quot;I am a Defiler, and proud of my rank ya know?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Do you make conversation with yourself or something?&quot; The human monk asked... The half elf added, &quot;Yes.. You are pretty good at it...&quot; Puzuzu gave the glare.. &quot;I agree.... What if we don't care if you are a Defiler?&quot; That shutted Yuin up. He then rolled his eyes, &quot;Because you are boring people, and I worked hard for this rank.&quot; Pulling out a flask of black hellish smoke Puzuzu backed up, &quot;WHERE did you get that??&quot; Yuin laughed evily, &quot;Puzuzu, you were supposed to be sacraficed long ago, ya know?... Why the hell do you think I know all this shit about Hydrokronik?.. I'm Yuinapherius the Tormenter of COURSE.&quot; That made the other 2 back up and jump into the water. Puzuzu lifted her eyebrow, &quot;Oh I see... Well, I'm related to Hydrokronik the Dreaded, so HA.&quot; Yuin shrugged.. &quot;Like I care. Many people are. Doesn't make you special, well... You are in a way. BUT has NOTHING to do with my friend.&quot; <br><br>Puzuzu turned away from him, &quot;WELL, Yuinapherius... Want to help me get to him?&quot; Yuin glared hard at her back.. &quot;No, Puzuzu, and call me YUIN, scum.&quot; Least he called her by her name.. She was silent the whole time. Finally the boat arrived and on board she hopped... Sitting down she began to meditate. Yuin seemed alittle more good looking in the light, she noticed he had the same scythe as Hydrokronik and a  horrifying robe. Yuin shrugged at her. Puzuzu shook her gaze away from him and glared at the endless ocean... Watching as the boat slowly descended from Freeport. <p><table><tr><td><img src="http://user.netomia.com/puzuzu/reap.jpg" alt="Reaper"></td><td><p><b>I walk in the black ashes of the graveyard... the full moon is like white in black.<br>The reaper has sliced my soul, that black hellish feeling has returned.. <br>Decaying and eating away at my spirit and soul.
