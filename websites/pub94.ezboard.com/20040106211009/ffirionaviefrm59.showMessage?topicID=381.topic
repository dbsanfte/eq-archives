Critical elements of course include the presence of just about every class, but the raid will not be able to go without a cleric, monk to pull and enchanters to mana sieve..<br>
<br>
Please note, that this raid is of course also dependant on Vox nay being asleep. If she is not present, the raid will not take place. I will be checking her presence the morning of and will report. If Vox is not up, I am more than willing to take those interested on an exploration run of the pits.<br>
<br>
Blayze &lt;61 cleric League of Honour&gt; Gijan &lt;51 monk Chosen Spirit&gt; and Bakanome &lt;53 paladin Saga&gt;  and Aegisfang &lt;53 Warrior Shards of Chaos&gt; have committed to assist in this raid. <br>
<br>
Again, a frost torn books will go to Tinwin if in attendance. However, to make up for the reserve, I will have a few nice items I will add to the rolls at the end! All other items will be random rolled from a seed. This means I will first roll a number between 1 and 1000, and then all rolls will be to that number. E.G. Meledi rolls 871. All people rolling on item then roll /rand 871.  *edit note, this method avoids folk worrying on if the rolls are fair.*<br>
<br>
Meeting: <br>
Preclear group Permafrost 10:30 am EST<br>
Permafrost Zone 12 noon<br>
If you need a transport to Permafrost then ask before raid and not at 12PM. Fastest way to get to meetingspot will be Halas PoP book or Port to Surefall and then run through Blackburrow and Everfrost.<br>
<br>
Reserved Loot and other special loot rules:<br>
- Torn, Frost Covered Book&quot; for the Paladin epic is being reserved for Tinwin / Durum &lt;confirming who got one&gt;<br>
- Torbrin's Mystical Eyepatch is only to be rolled on by pure wisdom and pure intelligence casters.<br>
- Kayruul's Mystic Pouch will first be rolled on by monks, if they have it already then other people can roll on it<br>
- Runed Bolster Belt is only to be rolled on by pure melees and hybrids.<br>
- White Dragon Scale is only to be rolled on Bards pursuing their epics. I will not be rolling on this.<br>
- White Dragon Hide is only to be rolled by pure wisdow and intelligence casters. **edit teach me to cut and paste.<br>
<br>
You got to sit through the whole raid to be allowed to roll, this means from the moment the first giant is pulled till the moment Lady Vox dies. People will roll whether or not they are over 52, those buffing and assisting on the prepulls are also eligable in other words. Those who feel the need to ignore what is said in channel or disregard commands can be excluded from rolling for loot. So better keep your head to the game.<br>
<br>
If you can live with all these loot rules and reservations then by all means sign up and we will slay a dragon this day.<br>
<br>
Channels:<br>
Please use the following chat channels:<br>
<br>
Fellowchat- raid wide chat<br>
Fellowraid - important announcements only. This is where I talk, MA posts messages, snarers announce when snares land, etc. NO CHAT HERE.<br>
Fellowlead - all group leaders (first person listed for each group) and raid leaders will communicate here. Please use chain of command whenever possible (you -&gt; group leaders -&gt; raid leaders)<br>
<br>
Resist Gear:<br>
Try to acquire as much cold resist gear as possible, mages present will summon the appropriate +15 fire /cold resist all/all shoulder gear.<br>
<br>
Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible. If you are level 52, CR gear is more important that MR gear, because you will resist most of her fears if you have a bard in your group. Low MR/CR means death, it’s that simple. <br>
<br>
If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). There are a wealth of other items available, especially with the addition of SoV.<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
<br>
Floorplan:<br>
<br>
Go to www.eqatlas.com and familiarize yourself with the layout of the lair. <br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Perma report in to the raid leader.<br>
2. Do not invite friends unless asked to do so.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
4. The raid leader, pullers, and group Leaders will use Fellowlead channel. All other communication should be on the Fellowraid channel.<br>
5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, and nukers).<br>
<br>
At all times do not move further forwards than your raid leader unless you are a designated puller.<br>
<br>
We will begin giant pulls as soon as critical mass assembles. &lt;anticipated at 10:30 to prepull&gt; <br>
<br>
Our path will be (using the eqatlas map for reference): from entrance to  [3] &quot;King's Room&quot;, Pause to insure everyone is present, &amp; the puller will pull giants to the raid [2] Ice Giant Diplomat, to the hall at loc. approximately 900, 50. From here the raid will have the final giants pulled to it, and be buffed. It is imperative that you do not wander or move past the raid leader, or risk falling in one of a number of pit traps, if you should fall into a pit trap STAND AND DIE, do not train the raid, your corpse will be recovered at the end of the raid.<br>
<br>
Once again, at all times prior to charging the dragon do not move further forwards than your raid leader unless you are a designated puller.<br>
<br>
Assault on Lady Vox itself:<br>
<br>
General notes: <br>
1) Everyone should have hotkeys setup to announce significant actions..<br>
<br>
2) To land spells you need to be within Vox's melee/AoE range. Best place is right by her tail.. This is why EVERYONE needs good resists, full buffs, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Healing. If we have dragon groups setup with no clerics in the melee groups, each group will have an assigned cleric (or two). When tanks need a heal they should 1) send a tell to their designated cleric (have a hotkey for this), 2) turn off attack and 3) back away from Vox &amp; towards their cleric once they no longer have aggro. Clerics should have hotkeys to target all of their designated tanks, as well as an /rtarget hotkey. If we get 3-4 clerics each tank group will have a cleric and this will be easier.<br>
<br>
4) Pushing. 20 tanks beating on Vox will push her around. It is imperative that Vox NOT get pushed into a wall. MELEE BE PREPARED TO MOVE AROUND VOX AS A GROUP TO KEEP PUSHING HER AWAY FROM THE WALLS. You should always be between Vox and the nearest wall if in doubt. If necessary, melees should stop attacking and back away to get Vox back into the center of her room. Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall. Since Vox is a caster, it is best to have all melee on one side of Vox to push her as much as possible (now why the heck would we want to do that?), because it will interrupt her from casting Complete heal on herself, regardless of whether we manage to land any stuns or not. <br>
<br>
When all groups have reformed the MA group and SA group (groups 1 &amp; 2) will enter Vox’s chamber and engage. Tanks remember to activate disciplines. Bard's priorties are 1) Elemental Rhythms, 2) Guardian Rhythms - have your best drum out. Add to your twist a song to haste the tanks in battle.. Also, bards should NOT be attacking Vox. 1) puts you up the aggro list, 2) minimal damage output when you have a drum going, 3) Ripostes will kill you quick. We need the bards alive to keep our resists up.<br>
<br>
As soon as the MA group has engaged Vox and has her positioned in the middle of her lair all remaining melee groups will enter and position themselves behind Vox. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT PUSHING VOX TOWARDS A NEARBY WALL. The casters can move up from the hall to the entrance of [1] Vox’s chanber <br>
<br>
Healing the MT will start with paladin LoH rotation, and then the clerics will take over. It is imperative that paladins and clerics announce heals in &quot;Fellowraid&quot;. Furthermore, Paladins now get DA at 51 - use it when Vox beats on you after your LoH, BUT ANNOUNCE IT SO THE CLERICS DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO HEAL YOU.<br>
<br>
If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.<br>
<br>
Every enchanter should run to Vox and dispel two times to remove all her buffs (remember to stand within melee range). If short on enc, other classes can dispell. Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispels should remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each enchanter should announce on the channel &quot;Dispelled&quot; once two successful dispells are complete. Need a minimum of 3 dispellers.<br>
Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead.<br>
<br>
Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath range.<br>
<br>
Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
<br>
At 60-70 Health:<br>
Pets are called in to attack. <br>
An enchanter can attempt tash. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transferred to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to pull Vox into the center of the room. The risk to enc tashing is rather low by the time Vox has reached the 60 percent mark. <br>
Once all dispells are done, the debufs should come. Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). <br>
Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does fire resist, 1 does magic resist). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br>
Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is not the end of the world, it will heal approximately 5k of hitpoints.<br>
<br>
At 50 Health:<br>
Nukers (other than Wizzys) charge, get under and behind Vox and blast away, when out of mana, get out of AoE / melee range. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Melee classes that cannot cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead. Cold based spells may have a reduced effect (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
At 20 Health:<br>
Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking, get under and behind Vox and blast away.<br>
Continue to mana sieve, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.<br>
<br>
Hopefully enough of us live to take her down.<br>
<br>
<br>
Buffing:<br>
<br>
This has been the bottleneck of many raids, I’m looking into how we can speed up this process so most likely there will be some changes to the system used and depending of the prescence of higher level we can use other spells then those who where used in previous raids.<br>
<br>
The buffs used will be the following list (or better if higher level casters are present):<br>
<br>
#01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire)<br>
#02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
#03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)<br>
#04 shaman stamina <br>
#05 shaman Harnessing of spirit<br>
#06 cleric shield of words <br>
#07 cleric Heroic Bond <br>
#08 cleric symbol of naltron (reagent: peridot)<br>
#09 enchanter rune IV / V (reagent: peridot)<br>
#10 enchanter group resist magic <br>
#11 druid circle of Summer<br>
#12 enchanter haste / clarity <br>
#13 open Chloro, Damage Shield, or open for Celestial Healing, etc.<br>
#14-15 open for self buff <br>
<br>
The buffing info will be more then likely be updated/changed to find out the fasted way to do it.<br>
<br>
Important rules:<br>
<br>
Listen to what is said in Fellowraid:<br>
Do not attack untill MA ask for it, in the case of the MA forgetting to ask it that will mean he will tank it till it’s dead ALONE . Both MA and SA will sound of there assist line in Fellowraid channel so everybody can see what to expect as assist call. In case of adds then SA will offtank one and the rest is taken care of by Enchanters and Bards, just wait for assist call and assist MA or SA, whoever of both calls first for an assist. If a target it mezzed or charmed then the same rules apply, wait for assist call, even if it breaks and starts pounding on you.<br>

<br>
When you &quot;seed&quot; the loot rolls, is it supposed to do anything?  As far as I can tell, the process described above really doesn't do anything.  I mean, it determines the bounds of the roll....but why is that randomed?  It seems /rand 1000 would accomplish what you needed just as well.<br>
