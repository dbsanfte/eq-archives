There seems to be an assumption that anyone who doesn't have a last name MUST be a d00d if they are lower than the level needed to get one.  <br>
<br>
It was about the time I got my last name that I started getting RPed with more.  Even jsut to the little things like saying hello back (unless I forget to hit enter first, I will -type- hello %T rather than just hit the &quot;h&quot; key) or getting into conversations started from such mild things as commenting on the appearence of one's armor, the weather, or other such.  I never expected anyone to just walk up to me &amp; RP, but I would take a deep breath and try to start any sort of any conversation when not in combatty sorts of places, like the waiting for the spires or boats or what not.  I wouldn't interrupt, I wouldn't assume someone one online unless they had just arrived or hailed the scion or some such.  In fact I would assume many were caught in /tell hell.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
But... it IS the one complaint I hear most often from anyone starting on FV.  It is a great server, and it is quiet, but does anyone really roleplay, the lower tier wonder.  Or rather they wonder if anyone will ever roleplay to or with them.  I keep reminding them its like starting at a new school and one has to meet people.  But it can be discouraging.  I have also suggested to some of them nudging up their recognition factor by getting involved on this board since that probably is what helped me.  But it is still discouraging to some.<br>
<br>
Someone I know might never come back to this server since he got hounded by the RP police for his name &quot;Chivalrry&quot; (or something like that...).  I had even assumed it was a take-off on the word chivalry, but he said it had been his grandfather's name, not that it matters, it isn't a bad name for a character, we have girls in this day &amp; age named Faith, Hope, Charity, Joy, June, May, April, etc.  The point is, the only interaction that person got from RPers was a condemnation of his name (actually I don't know if the character was male or female, I only got tells).  Why not, if you think a name is suspect, why not ask the orgin of it... purely in IC?  Oh, but wait, it was a brand new character, he/she had not hit the &quot;proper level for RP&quot;.<br>
<br>
But.... I am guilty of it, too.  I don't take time out often enough to RP with those jsut starting out.  But I do wonder how many of the fringe-d00ds might have been or might be &quot;redeemed&quot; if someone jsut took a little time out to RP with them.<br>

<br>
Il'l hang out in Nektulos and come up with silly quests and award the items for it. It's a blast. Just because your a little older in season, dont mean you have to cut your self off from other people.<br>

Someday these young folk will be the same level as you! It's a nice way to make friends and future hunting partners<br>

<br>
this is what i was pushing for when i first got here.  everyone was complaining about the patch that changed the language restrictions and such, and complaining about the influx of d00ds.  i came in with that influx, and did i see these people in the newbie zones trying to rp to the newcomers and convert them from their heinous ways?  <br>
<br>
not really.  then again, as they pointed out so clearly, they can't be expected to take the precious time they pay &amp; play for and waste it on such a thing as going to freeport and standing around in a pub trying to strike up a conversation.<br>
<br>
you're busy, i'm busy, we're all busy.  i try to do the 'small talk' routine, but unfortunately i was never very good at that in real life either.  <br>
<br>
your suggestions to your friend were good.  this board has helped me in numerous ways.  at least i know who the self-proclaimed roleplayers are out there, and can recognize them in the zones i'm hanging out in.<br>
<br>
so take pity on the n00bies.  consider it a gift to charity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uattumadabeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Attuma Dabeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Heads</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 2:58:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1169.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Do you ever RP with someone in the lower levels?</span><hr size=1> I must agree it seems that whe most people reach lvl 40+ they just stop RPing.I almost get all of my Rping from the younger lvl chars.Hell i pretty much only lvl on killing town gaurds so i RP tons with the lower lvls and i love it!I'll pretty much ignore all of the lesser races(being every other race other than ogres!)But i do love Rping with the lowebie paladins makes the game that much more fun for me.<br>

<br>
Hmmm the old &quot;No one RPs call&quot;<br>
<br>
When I started (not very long ago) I didn't know how it was or what to expect I just went out and did. RP just came in with others also RPing. So I think its just the same ol same ol, if you want to RP just do it don't wait for them to flock to you and get it done for you.<br>
<br>
As to going in the first step training zones. I also like to gather some stuff and give it out to those that show they are trying. But the best thing I have found is doing things on a more individual basis taking them around getting them started telling them in an RP fashion what to look for or expect next.<br>
Just me I guess.<br>

<br>
I RP when I can and probably do much less than I did when I first came.<br>
<br>
Being in a High end raid guild on an FFA server....when I get home (PST) my guild is already in raid mode.  I usually log into the bazaar and get 3 tells saying move yer but ogre!  So i quickly grab some grub, sell my sellables, bank my unnecessary loot, dump my cash into the bank and DASH.  Often i meet porters or I just dash off to luclin.<br>
<br>
On more than one occassion I am interacted with almost as soon as I pop on.  about half the time I blurt a Hi and run.  Other times ill give a RP explanation or make some coment about having things to do.  I do feel bad about &quot;Blowing people off&quot;  but I dont have much choice.<br>
<br>
The times I get to interact with lower characters are on my off times (which arent many) and then I always try and RP.  Not to hard for an ogre SK who can turn into a skele and wants to kill everyone.  Im even KOS in Grobb now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just understand that on this server many of these people are buried in tells, group chat and trying to coordinate groups, raids, or talk to good friends having EQ or RL difficulties.  Sometimes your &quot;Hail, Bob!  What brings a fat halfling like yourself to the gutter of Luclin?&quot;  isnt intentionally ignored.  Its just that the High end game is more hectic than you can imagine if you have never been there.<br>

I hope this helps.  Dont curse us all.<br>

<br>
You get that too?<br>
<br>
Seriously, I'm not really that high up there, yet...but I try to RP when I can with those around me. Trouble is, well with Jenori's personality she isn't really the kind of person some of the newbies want to get to know. <br>
<br>
My favorite thing so far has to be going through Nek forest. Several times, some poor little dark elf has been struggling with those halflings that wander around there. Mostly all I can do is bind their wounds and pray to Innoruuk that they don't die. I've had some very interesting conversations because I don't tend to wander the forest in my Teir'dal form. The newbie log there is another favorite place.<br>

<br>
Oh &amp; I wasn't saying anyone should -ever- expect people to walk up and RP with them or expect to be the centre of attention... jsut that most starting characters here have a tough time finding the elusive key to unlocking the RP &amp; so RP alone.... playing their characters' loneliness, too.  <br>
<br>
But yeah, it's a dead horse..... bleah...<br>

<br>
The hard thing about RP'ing with folks is that you have to be careful you're on the same page.  If you start in on some heavy RP topic with a stranger, you can easily end up with one very confused or even mad player on your hands.<br>
<br>
BTW, I strongly suspect that the no-RP until you're 20 thing is a hold-over from the language barier days.  Back then, most people just plain did not even bother talking to the under 20's because you pretty much knew they couldn't speak with you.  Bjond mastered all the born-tongues at 19 and after he did, I discovered that all you had to do was even hint that you knew someone's language and you'd get a torrent in response. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

Sadly, I would have thought the name Chivalrry off-putting when first I saw it, simply because of all the d00ds coming out of the woodwork these days. Chivalrry could be a hell of a guy, but I doubt I'd initiate something out of the blue because of my kneejerk reaction to the name. Not to get into the whole name issue again (for the record, I don't think descriptive names like the example of Quickhands the Rogue that someone used in another thread are &quot;bad&quot; roelplaying. Just the opposite actually).<br>
<br>
I know that if I can, I'll roleplay through things with just about anyone. Since I have a terrible time remembering to /con well...anything, their level is not really a big determining factor to me. <br>
<br>
I do like the idea of helping the wee ones, but through a roleplaying standpoint. And of course OOC tells if they need help with game mechanics. I too would set small quests for younglings had I the time or anything worthy to give them. I do this with tradeskills sometimes as I learn.<br>
<br>
I do differentiate between &quot;helping&quot; them by giving them items and roleplaying with them. I have roleplayed with quite a few folks out there, of different levels, and much of it didn't involve any sort of item transfer at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubraellarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braellarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 8:42:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1169.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Do you ever RP with someone in the lower levels?</span><hr size=1> I dont even look at lv /shrug i RP with anyone 'especially' when at spires.<br>

<br>
In RL I am not good with &quot;small talk&quot; I'm a to the point kind of gal.  I make eye contact and look at those that are speaking to me, but rarely will I strike a conversation for the sake of hearing my own words.  <br>
<br>
*hijack*<br>
<br>
What is RP anyway?  I got a very rude comment from a Dark Elf the other day.  I said &quot;bel'la dos&quot; or &quot;vendui&quot;  something like that.  He responded with &quot;I'm a Dark elf not some (don't remember the word) Drow&quot;.  Now why did he have to be rude to me? I was putting for the effort.  Who or What defines the guidelines of Roleplay for Firiona vie?  There is so much information and different ways different games define Roleplay.  What definition are we adopting on FV?  Is it up to the personal choices and groups we hang out with?  <br>
<br>
Is it acceptable to tell another Dark Elf  &quot;Hey, I don't speak that dialect of language&quot;  when they don't like the &quot;drow&quot; language?<br>
<br>
** hijack off **<br>
<br>
So Yes, I interact with EVERYONE i have need to interract with.  Is it RP?  I dunno.  I use Norrath and EQ as my context.  Do i this, thou, thee and m'lord?  No, that is not my character.  I keep my sword sharp, my eyes open and attention focused. (except for when I ramble)<br>
