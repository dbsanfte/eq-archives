The RP is there is you want to start it or look for it -- though it's a lot more common towards the high end than at the low end. I think a lot of the problem is people branding a failure to fit to the alignment rules as some form of &quot;RP collapse&quot; or whatnot.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something. IC, I've had Iksar and Teir'Dal friends and allies, and Elven nemeses. And you know what? For my character, that makes sense and that generates RP. Sure, there's some OOC manipulation needed to make this happen, and if you're not comfortable with that, that's too damn bad.<br>
<br>
Yes, the d00ds have increased. Yes, there's a significant group of people who play on the server for economic reasons. That doesn't mean the RP is dead. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.realitywerks.com/hosted-images/elludensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fajon>Fajon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warpriest<br>

I have no problem admitting when I call it poorly.  I should have waited to post what I did.  The contrast between Morgrist's post and Nakath's was so extreme that I was hasty.  <br>
<br>
I stand by the fact that Nakath is the one truly whining and crying about all of this and then bitching because people are whining.  It seems hypocritical and read like a temper tantrum.  <br>
<br>
People here had something and it was taken away without any of their say so in it.  Having something taken from you is a legitimate reason to gripe. Some are glad it is different some are pissed and some are indifferent.  In any case I agree that it is a dead horse and kind of pointless because no amount of griping will be likely to work to get it back.  However this is the forum to gripe in, if you are tired of this gripe then don't read it.<br>
<br>

I haven't seen this at all recently, and believe this to be an exageration.  Furthermore, just dont read the threads or comment constructivly on them... that's you're choice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because the changes benefit them, even though they do not utilize them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is your opinion.  It could also be said that the new &quot;free&quot; enviroment is less &quot;RP&quot; friendly to them.  That's their opinion.<br>
<br>
Neither of you are right.  That's why its an opinion and not a fact.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because the changes are less restrictive at the real cost of fun to no-one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I agree with you, but you have to take into consideration that Everquest has an established background and setting.  If you want your character to be a dark elf that follows Tunare, you may... but there should be a penalty of some sort for going against &quot;the way the world should be.&quot;  In a &quot;normal&quot; RP game, those penalities can come from the person running the game, or other players.  In EQ though, there is really no one running things, and players have limited options to cause repucussions.  (I dont believe training someone or the like is acceptable behavior... other then breaking the rules, there is little one player can do to affect another negativly.)<br>
<br>
That is what I feel the exp rules accomplished.  They made it more difficult to be the &quot;odd&quot; character, which it should be.  If there is no &quot;norm&quot; and everyone is some special instance, the entire setting become muddled and worthless.<br>
<br>
Again though, I totally see what your saying and I understand where you're coming from.  I disagree with you, somewhat, but its really not that big of a deal to me.  I just think that the setting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> should </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be enforced in some way... I would like to see a better method then exp penalties and the like, but if that is what they have in my opinion it is better then nothing.<br>

No disrespect, but how is this different from Not Roleplaying?<br>
<br>
Are dark elves just Blue people?  Halflings just Short people?  Erudites just dark skinned egghead people?  If so what is the point?<br>
<br>
I am not suggesting that there is no room for deviation, or that you have to regurgitate everything that SOE says, but in order to play a Role with a large group, certain ground rules need to be respected.<br>
<br>
For example, Norrath is the name of world we play in.  There is nothing stopping you from calling Qwertyville...  Just like there is nothing stopping you from calling Planet Earth Planet Ghora in RL, but then you need to expect the same response.<br>
<br>
Also, I think that the general gist of Races and Cultures should be respected.  No, you do NOT have to say that all DEs are mindless rabid creatures of Hate, but I do expect you to agree that most are from Neriak, and they live in a society where Innoruk is highly regarded, and they are generally enemies with Elves and Halflings, and reasonably cordial with Ogres and Trolls.<br>
<br>
So yes, there can be a DE Troll Hater, Halfling lover, but you would be uncommon at best.<br>
<br>
Now, if you choose to disregard ALL the backstory, then you are effectively SOLO Roleplaying, and there is very little point to that in my estimation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fajon>Fajon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warpriest<br>

<br>
Here is a classic case of limited realm of roleplay...<br>
<br>
You can't compare paper RPGS, LARPS, and other things like that to EQ, thats like compairing apples to oranges, and heres why.....<br>
<br>
First of all, EverQuest is a non-liner, non-changing realm.  Monsters are the same, cities, places, events are frozen in time, except for the occasional 24.95 module or GM event that happens once in a blue moon.<br>
<br>
RPG's, Like D&amp;D, Vampire, Rifts, etc... etc... are worlds created by a Dungeon Master, the realm you live in on a paper game is constant changing and you are more physcially involved in the events that change the realm that you walk in.<br>
<br>
EverQuest, you kill a certain major boss, god, etc... grats, he'll be up in 6 days or so, go back and do it again.  Its more in line with the MUD's ((Multi User Dimenisons for those who didn't know the term)) I used to play back in the day.  The realm is limited in that sense, so really, the only Roleplay we have on this server is between character interaction, and not world interaction.  Granted, if you have an imagination, I guess you could raid some city as a group of evils/goods and kill guards and the like, but when your done, the city doesn't change, it stays the same.<br>
<br>
I think the problem with those who want to &quot;roleplay&quot; (using that term lightly) is that they want the world to change with their desires, but its not going to happen.  Basically, what you create in this game is situations between players,and not situations in the world itself.  <br>
<br>
Prime example, Lets say, I, (going to my Bard For a Day Story )  wish to become the leader of the Dismal Rage.  Thats great, maybe in my realm of RP I am, but not every follower of the Dismal Rage is gonna log in and have someone standing there saying, sorry, Pietro Zarn is no longer the SK guildmaster, go look up Kaneer Ca'Vehroe.  Just not going to happen, and will never happen.  The realm of imagination lets you think the things you wish to think, but in the end, just because how you see something, doesn't mean the rest are going to acknowledge it because in their RP, your existance may not even affect their story or their way or roleplay.  <br>
<br>
Thus why if you are going to RP on a EQ server, you have to realise that your story or the way you roleplay isn't going to affect everyone that walks by... and not everyone you interact with is going to be involved in your roleplay either.  I think when people try to involve everyone in their roleplay, they cause all these tizzy fits about good and bad roleplayers...<br>
<br>
One more example before I shut up, Shintou... granted he RP's with everyone, but not everyone is going to RP with him.  Maybe they don't want a Shintou in their RP line, maybe they don't RP at all... who knows, who cares. They spend their money to play this game just like the rest of us and they have that right to do what they please with their time on the server....<br>

So in conclusion, there is no right or wrong way to roleplay, Whether you wish to do so or not, that is your choice.  But remember, The physical game doesn't change with your characters accomplishments... it stays the same on through time or untill someone at SOE changes it, as where a true RPG does change with your characters accomplishments.  RP here is player interaction, not world interaction, NPC's don't RP with players... just how it is... <br>

<br>
Something I feel very strongly about.<br>
<br>
I *LOVE* this server.  I love the people on it. I love a lot of the characters here.  I love that I find RP ANYWHERE I go.<br>
<br>
I know that I sport an unpopular bend to a semipopular opinion, but, I feel pretty damn strongly about this server.<br>
<br>
I think the people who're upset by the fact that they no longer get hand held through their RP, makes me sad, and went a long long way towards my ending Sar's life. <br>
<br>
I saw a lot of &quot;The game won't foce you to RP the way I like, so I just won't RPwith you&quot;. <br>
<br>
And that's by people whining that RP is dead.  I got more quality, fun, interesting RP from people who the fascists say arent/can't be RPers, due to race/level/guildtags.<br>
<br>
See, I enjoy my RP.  But that's because my RP NEVER had anything to do with whether my shouts were zonewide(and, Shin and I have had some great shouting matches, SINCE the change, that we couldnt  have had before it), or whether I could group with a high elf or not.<br>
<br>
I'd have been the same Sar if the rules hadn't changed, but playing the class/race/deity combo I did, I'd have likely rerolled a lot sooner than I did, due to the insular way the evil community acts, as a whole.<br>
<br>
So, in closing, yes, a big reason I rerolled Sar was because I got tired of the &quot;There's no RP.  There's only subpar d00ds pretending to RP.  They're not blue, so they don't count as RPers...Oh, but not *you*, Sar. We don't mean *you*&quot;<br>
<br>
I called bullshit, and started playing a character that the evil community leaves alone because of both her race and her guildtags.<br>
<br>
That way, I get to RP *my* character, the way *i* want, without having to explain myself, ic or out to any of you.<br>
<br>
And one more thing.  Those who know me. Think about how it sounds for you all to go off about &quot;evils grouping with pales&quot; &quot;pales trying to play evil&quot; and all of that shit, knowing damn well that you have RPed with Sar, and *looked the other way* at Sar's relationships ooc, so your character didn't have to deal with them IC. <br>
<br>
~Trae, the disillusioned.<br>
<br>
PS.  I will say this.  As close as we canget to a perfect example of Good, consistent RP, without having to be hand held, as so many of you obviously prefer, look to Prime Nightmare.  Naught started a damned good thing. Cielo and co do a great job keeping it active and alive. <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/traesig.jpg"><br><i>Still keeping things sane(or not) at <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner" target="_new">Sar's Corner.</a><br>Yes, you can touch my <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=588147" target="_new">clothes.</a></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thevolcanogod>thevolcanogod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 799<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 2:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV lost</span><hr size=1> *whistles innocently* <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>

<br>
To me: EQ is a lot more like the muds I also played back 10-11 years ago. The world does not change. It remains the same. It is backdrop to the character interactions we have with one another. We are the poeple who choose how we RP, we decide how our character is going to behave and feel and react. <br>
<br>
Coded limitations restrict RP. I believe this firmly. I played a Moo based on Dragonriders of Pern that had code for everything. Instead of simply role-playing feeding your dragon, you actually had to perform a set of coded tasks to do it. Very boring and very tedious. Your dragon could sicken and look weak without you allowing this. This is not RP to me.<br>
<br>
RP is where you choose what happens to you and how you react to other people's interactions. <br>
<br>
If you do not want to play evil as a dark elf, there is no reason you should -- however, there will be other people who DO RP as you being evil, and that is their perogative. That is because you cannot force your vision of RP on anyone else. A person has a right to RP an assumption about your character whether or not they know the facts. They can also choose to see the light and realize you are not how they percieved you to be. (Ie; Say a RL person is a bigot and hates all people of a certain race, regardless of their personalities, it is the same thing as in the game).<br>
<br>
Syrienne can RP how she wants. She can RP that she is, though of an evil raced, a good person -- however she will have to prove, via RP to people who do not believe this, that it is so. *shrug*<br>
<br>
RP folks, is what you make of it. No set of rules or instructions is going to make that any better and could in fact, make it worse. <br>
<br>
I can go on any server of EQ and RP. The thing is: here on FV, more people are going to RP -back- at me because more people here lean toward the idea that we should RP than would normally occur on another server.<br>
<br>
If you want pure RP folks, please, go find a Mush. These are text only games and most of them are very immersive and full of RP. If you don't see a theme you like -- make up one and host your own mush and advertise about it on other mushes.<br>
<br>
Thats what everyone else does.<br>
<br>
However. I have no problem RPing a mix of RP and doing OOC on EQ. I have a lot of fun here, and there's no pressure to do one or the other, and I am happy because there are folks I can RP with, and folks I can just bash around on things with and not have to worry bout RP for a while.<br>

<br>
Yes, this is -just- a game.  I was -never- in any doubt that EQ is a game.  But, I am having to admit that just like all other games, the vast majority of people either cheat or accept those that cheat and make excuses to &quot;need&quot; to cheat.  <br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
I'm still not sure I will continue playing.  As nothing but a video game, EQ is not all that interesting and I am not in any way shape or form all that enthralled by -any- video game.  For me the real draw to FV was the RP and my misguided notion that RPers might not be as compelled to cheat.  I was wrong.  I admit it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=apepsadisticdream>Apep Sadisticdream</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>May I offer you a<br>

<br>
If you play a star trek role playing game, would it be acceptable for someone to play an tolkien elf?<br>
<br>
It's not about forcing an individual's vision onto anyone, its about creating a story that meshes with the world as it's presented.  Some people wont do that, such as the &quot;drow&quot; types, and that's fine.  Some of them are pretty good RP'ers, and I just sort of glaze my eyes over their language and move on with the RP.  That's ok too.<br>
<br>
But, the history and background of EQ exists and can not just be ignored.  If you do that, you aren't really RP'ing in the same world as everyone else.  Of course, no one can stop you... but I know personally I just try to move past people who insist on breaking continuity.  Im not rude about it, but they just arent a part of my story.  I treat doodz the same way.<br>
<br>
Can you be a &quot;good&quot; dark elf?  Sure why not, does that somehow fall outside of the established material?  Can you be a &quot;evil&quot; paladin follower of Inny?  No, you can't.  It violates the &quot;rules&quot; of the world and setting and just doesnt make sense.<br>
<br>
People don't like restrictions, but they do exist.  There is a history and background to the world and it shouldnt be ignored just because you dont like it.<br>
<br>
On a slightly off topic note, why would this thread be closed?  Even if its come up before, no one is being nasty and I think some people are enjoying talking about it, even if they disagree.  I don't think disliking the topic should be grounds for thread removal. &lt;shrug&gt; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~Vabris Vy'Tok, of House Vy'Tok~<br>
