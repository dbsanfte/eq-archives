<br>
It is well known that Lord Gray was taken prisoner by the League of Honor.  The lighties will have you believe that he is still held within their walls - alive.  You ask each time his name comes up why he doesn't just gate out.  Consider this, Kyri, perhaps he can not gate because he died at their hands.  Surely you do not think the evil lighties to be above slaughtering him?<br>
<br>
Have you fallen so far, Kyri, that you believe the words of those in the League of Honor?  I have heard so very many rumors of his fate since researching my family history.  There are those lighties that will have us believe he a slave to the League of Honor.  One went so far as to tell me that he is tending their gardens!  Others have tried to tell me that he is attending to the, ahem, 'needs' of a cleric of Marr - or even several lighties in other versions of the story.  Others will say that he is simply imprisoned.  Why do you think there to be so many stories?  It is to suit the needs of the League of Honor!  They do this to sew the seeds of confusion in the powers of darkness.<br>
<br>
He is dead, I tell you!  My brother is dead.  I am here for that reason alone.  One day my powers will be strong enough and we shall attempt to recover his corpse.  One day we will move against the League of Honor to recover him.  One day, we will ask the priests in the church of Innoruuk to perform a resurrection.  Until that blessed day, I wait and study.<br>
<br>
Now I am fully aware that you will not trust me since I bear the same name as him, but please take a moment to think about this.<br>
<br>
~Turns to Didi~<br>

I salute you on your leadership of the League.  I am in your service.  Please call on me as you see fit.<br>

But come now, we both know the lighties are soft, they would rather corrupt him, turn him to their precious &quot;light&quot; before deciding to kill him. A trip to Sister Isle with all of Marr's wenches waiting for him, might be all it takes for that. If they wanted him dead they could have killed him without carrying him off.<br>
<br>
  Of by the way, have you heard the one where the evil lighties claim Gray is a monk now and practices meditative arts in the garden while tending it? The attending the Marr servants needs is highly plausible though i must say. I can't help it if the lighties are so foolish that they can't even keep their stories straight. Before you know it we will hear that Gray's corpse is tending a garden for the servants of Marr's minstrels while feigning death the way these lighties tell tales.<br>
<br>
   If they did kill him the body should have turned up somewhere, its not like they have any necromancers who might get some use out of the remains after all. Unless of course they decided to use it for fertilizer for some new tree they planted for additional hugging, or whatever those lighties do in the woods. Or at the very least one of them would have stepped forward with the typical lighty &quot;nyah nyah we killed your leader pbpllltttt!&quot;  gloating that they could kill a captive outnumbered several dozen to one.....<br>
<br>
   So i still think he's around somewhere, until i see his rotting corpse myself- you don't live very long in this profession assuming the ones out to get you all just go away and die. They're not dead til i see it for myself. So yes, when the time comes i'll be with you, to prove it to myself once and for all one way or the other. Until that day i'll consider him alive.<br>
