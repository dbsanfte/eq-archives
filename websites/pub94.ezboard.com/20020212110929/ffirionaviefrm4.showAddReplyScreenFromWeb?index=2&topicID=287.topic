Firiona Vie is not an easy server to play.  It takes an understanding of the game, and the ability to push your class to its limits in order to survive and progress.<br>
<br>
The TLC helps to keep the population of the server down.  Most people don't wanna play somewhere when they can not get what they want when they want it.  It causes you to have to think and plan if you want an item.  It discourages farming.  Not having items no drop is wonderful.  That way, if someone misses an item that they need, maybe someone else has it.  Please note:  when I killed one of my epic mobs the other day, the item was Lore and No Drop. <br>
<br>
 I have had a GREAT experience with a customer service rep on this server- something that never happened during the two years I was on Prexus. <br>
<br>
The language situation I believe adds to the roleplaying situation of the server; why would a halfling and an Ogre know to speak to one another except for the halfling to say &quot;eeek&quot; and the Ogre to say &quot;yum.&quot;  The language situation is kinda difficult.  Sometimes people approach me and I can not understand them or offer to help.  All I can do is sow them and leave.<br>
<br>
There is room on this server for the roleplayers and those who want to be &quot;the first.&quot;  There are several guilds which are large enough to do big things, and plently of independent people running around just making nuisances of themselves.  You have a choice on which direction that you can go here.  I like the fact that for a husband-wife team (my situation), this server rocks for the two of us to spend a fun afternoon exploring and trying new quests or new adventures.  However, <br>
because the server population is small, it is hard for a single random person to find a group- last night, I saw 13 people in Dawnshroud peaks; with the exception of a newbie zone, that is the most people I have ever seen in one zone.  <br>
<br>
I love the automatic anon tag, and yet I hate it.  Lost a corpse the other day, and would have loved to send a bard a tell &quot;wanna earn some pp and find a corpse?&quot; only I did not know who the bards were, nor could I shout in the zone for one (there was two other people besides me anyway).  However, as a druid, it is great to not get constant teleport requests; I can do drive-by sows if I feel like it or offer to teleport if I so chose.  I have seen how it is on a larger server, and it can be heartbreaking to watch a druid friend get pestered and insulted for not teleporting.<br>
<br>
Because I don't know what is being used for which quest or I have an item that I suspect someone needs, my bank account is constantly full of moss, smelly hides, and miscellaneous minerals.  I think that the banker hates me.  <br>
<br>
So I think that while the TLC, low server population, lanugage, and the ANON tags have their problem, I also think that there is a plus side.  I would be hard pressed to call anything &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; on this server because each has its own strengths and weaknesses.   I just think that being here, one has recognize that everything has its strengths and weaknesses, and if we change any part of what is present, then we are not really that much different from any other blue server.<br>

I didn't even group until I was in my 11th season, I soloed the entire time because I was worried, being new to EQ, about how bad I would mess up when grouping. I still have this insecurity when grouping with players I've never met before.<br>
<br>
I now have a number of friends I group with on a daily basis and we are all of like temperament and game playing style. I absolutely love this server, but because it is so different from the regular blue servers, I think it requires a bit of a different play style. It made me actually strive to cultivate friendships here and I'm the better for it.  If I hadn't taken the time out from leveling, to actually get to know the people around me,  I think I would've gotten very bored and frustrated very fast. If you see someone in need, help them and remember those that helped you when you were in need.<br>
<br>
If you group with someone and find you group well with them, keep their name in your friends list, even if you only spent two hours hunting together but had a good experience with the person, chances are, he's out there looking for a group too.  If you see yourself running into the same person quite a bit in your travels, say hello once in a while, stop and chat if they are wanting to chat too. Doing this was actually how I came to be in a guild now, I kept running into this fellow everywhere I went for weeks, we would often stop and chat, I didn't realize he was an officer in his guild until he gave me an invite.  <br>
<br>
Sure, I've been on this server for a little bit now and haven't leveled very fast but I've met alot of wonderful people and enjoy the game immensely. <br>

<br>
Zone populations are lighter than a regular blue server, but in the lower levels there are still plenty of people.  I suspect you have to be very agressive early on if you are a group dependant class and came here alone.  Make friends, join a guild etc. I have a permanent partner, and I play a soloable class.  I don't mind somewhat empty zones.  I would hate to be a cleric or rogue on FV, if I was anti-social at all.  The quiet is incredible.  No OOC spam, no auctions in every zone.  The world &quot;feels&quot; emptier, even if 20 people are in the zone with you.  I think this contributes to realism and RP environment.  I am much more inclined to try and talk to players I meet, and rp as well.  I also like camping something level specific and not having to wait for A_druid_Farmer_124567 to finish the camp before taking it over.  Languages are alot of fun.  None of my other characters ever learned any other languages.  My partner and I are very strict about it.  Every time we zone (and with melee only bind spots, its often) and every hour within a zone (we use a timer) we train a point of language.  At lvl 20 we have mastered elvish and dark elvish.  She has learned 50 points of Barbarian, we are feeble in 4 or 5 tongues and have a point at least in everything else.  As we travel and expand our horizons we are able to understand more and more people.  I think it helps in immersion, though perhaps lvl*10 might be more appropriate for language...<br>
<br>
The indifferent:<br>
<br>
TLC definately favors the experienced players.  I have a few servers and a few high level characters under my belt.  I play with my rl partner.  She plays a monk and I a Northman shaman.  Between us we have to camp about 15 things in the next 5 levels.  Without foreknowledge, either from experience, or from spoiler sites, you will find yourself buying alot of TLC items later for quests (monk epic for example starts at lvl 1).  Also the level specific camping has slowed us down considerably.  While leveling is not as important to me as it has been before, we do play alot less as well than on previous servers (average of 20 or so hours a week vs. 40-50 or even more gah!), I will not feel complete as a shaman until lvl 35 (pet at 34 and no more spell book!).  There are also alot more interesting things to do in the midlevels, and I have expensive hobbies...  trying to master tailoring, smithing, baking, brewing, pottery, and alchemy will easily cost me 25K throughout my career, so the better loot at higher levels is enticing me....  The market... Wow, it is rare indeed to buy in game without first hitting the boards here.  This is ok, but perhaps only a few percent of players actually comes here.  Maybe the bazaar will fix this up.<br>

<br>
The Good:<br>
<br>
One character per account.  Surprised no one else listed this above; I think it is the single best thing about FV.  You make a character and you stick with it.  You earn a reputation and if you screw it up you really only have one recourse.  Spectacular.<br>
<br>
Languages.  The languages annoyed me at lower levels, but in my mid twenties, I find it refreshing.  You have to work a bit to communicate with those outside your “culture”.<br>
<br>
The Blah<br>
<br>
TLC.  I was once a big proponent of this, and I still believe in the core idea, but with only one character per account, it does not seem to be as necessary as before.<br>
<br>
Low Population.  This is great in that there is plenty of elbow room and dungeons are rarely filled with more than two groups.  Raid competition when the upper levels start filling out should be conducive to amicable scheduling and cooperation rather than the current situation on Druzzil Ro, for instance.  On the other hand, the above poster was correct – it is really tough to be a group-dependant class.  As I move up in levels, it seems to be easier to get into a group, ironically enough.<br>
<br>
The Bad<br>
<br>
Reduced range of  /shout.  I know what problems they thought they solved with this, but it really hampers finding a group and warning of trains.<br>
