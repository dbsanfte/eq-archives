If you don't think buying toons is a bad thing you should have posted on that when it was a hot topic.<br>
<br>
I don't see where being in Fire and Fury entitles you to buy the toon, same as I don't see how Fire and Fury is entitled to my gear.  I came to raids, I nuked stuff, I got gear, it doesn't belong to Fire and Fury and I'm holding it, it belongs to me.  Paprika thought otherwise, the rewards she got for the effort she made she was made to feel she didn't deserve and returned those rewards.  Some shallow self-centered callous vermin actually accepted those items rather than insist she keep them.<br>
<br>
Tommy (the person who levelled Gwenlynn) spent a lot of time playing in order to presumably have fun, Bako said he was one of the best 2 bards on the server and how wonderful he was to stay up till such late hours but then he de-guilded and became some completely horrible creature who was twinked out by being in the guild and had comparable gear to Johanna for a third of the effort.  So we know Bako was lying before or after she de-guilded, possibly both.<br>
<br>
Of course Bards getting more FaF gear than they earned would probably apply more to Alesa than to Gwenlynn, but then again any friend Bako hasn't betrayed yet is a rare commodity that he values over say a guild member who say comes to raids.<br>
<br>
We Bako?  No you.  Well I guess maybe you meant you and Restoria who make all the decisions in the guild but mostly it's you.  Hmmm, Sliver deserves the Willsapper and it's most useful for him to get it but Restoria says such nice things to me I'm so confused.  I know I'll say Fuvi is running the raids today and I'm just a member, OMG what if he doesn't give it to Sliver, hey Cloude make sure he awards it to Sliver or this is all for nothing, Vaniki dead, Sliver has WS, wasn't my call though, all is good.  OMG what's going on now, Trakanon? WTF, we might die, it's not a guaranteed kill, I'm scared, where's my mommy? RAID OFF RAID OFF RAID OFF<br>
<br>
That's you gimp, running the guild down, way old news, first Vaniki kill SERVER FIRST, you haven't changed in the least from that day.  Hey we even wiped to Trakanon getting Johanna's Epic, I guess we shouldn't have gone then either.  I know you're feeling down now so go look at Kritical's Magelo Profile and pat yourself on the back for that masterpiece, oops it's not even the best Warrior Profile on the server anymore but that doesn't matter Resolution cheated by using more people than you did so it doesn't count.  And you know if we got Kritical xxxx, xxxx and xxxx this would be the best again, so we better raid xxxx and xxxx and xxxx so Kritical is the bestest and we win the game again.<br>
<br>
If you're having fun killing trivial little mobs and hoping for the good loot Fire and Farming is a good place to be, plan slightly harder mobs when Kzan can't make raids.  Want to do N ToV, got to get rid of Bako to try it and Kzan so you won't die when you do try.  Bako was very pleased that you died on Eashen and Ikitiar that way people wouldn't want to go back so readily.<br>
<br>
Need some help in Ssra, let me know, it's not raid points so you'll have trouble getting people in the guild out there raid points aren't and never were my concern though, want to kill an epic mob shoot me a tell, ask your own guild mates to help on an epic mob and they refuse just because it's a free day.<br>
<br>
Game is about fun, content is fun.  Destroying content is bad, we've been over that.  Using more of the content is good.  Tripping over an AS raid when that guild is made up mostly from people who made toons after FaF was decked out in Primal should embarass you.  Why are you still killing the same mobs?  41 percent haste is common as dirt, destroy 2 41 percent talismans just to get keys for a zone you never use, so you couldn't want a 36 percent haste helm.<br>
<br>
I know all the problems in FaF were because of me, that's why Bako kicked me out of the guild and all your problems are solved, now he's still trying to blame me for your problems, atleast find a new excuse.<br>
<br>
You want loot make a chick toon, join Fire and Farming and say Yes Sir to Bako.  If you aren't motivated by loot Fire and Farming as nothing to offer you, figure out how to change the guild, I tried and couldn't, or change the guild tag.  Maybe you should try a new game, new server, new guild, leave the house more, who knows but if you're not having fun eventually you'll have to realize telling yourself better days are coming over and over isn't going to make it so.<br>
<br>
Failed on Klandicar today using 28, ZERG POWER, guess what levels and gear can change a loss into a win, nothing can let you kill a mob you don't try though.  Did you get the good loot today?  Grats on using that raid force to get a rez goo, takes one group - forgot no raid points who would go?<br>
<br>
Hey Bako I do sleep well, I didn't betray my friends, I don't get a sick feeling in my stomach wondering if people are finally going to get fed up with my incompetence and leave the guild and I don't have to wonder if people are honest with me or if the loot stops people are finally going to tell me how pathetic I am and the loot is at a trickle now.<br>
<br>
Maybe learn from Uolian, plan an open raid, invite Fire and Fury members and try mobs you think you should be killing, I'd recommend against letting Kzan come success in early open raids would be very uplifting.  Or maybe you like logging on to be reminded how awesome killing Kunark Dragons was because the LOOT ROCKED.<br>
<br>
Yes, Kzan is lying, because KZAN IS A LIAR and he can't bring himself to tell the truth.  Truth is scary to him he's been a stranger so long no reason to even let it near him.  Maybe you should buy some EQ lessons, willing to teach Ramel?<br>
<br>
You have a core of everyday players who have the levels, AA, gear and some may even remember how to kill harder mobs still.  If you think killing Va'dyn is cool because he might drop a 100hp neck realize that you have the option to get a better neck from Cazic Thule and Dreadstorm doesn't they can use a lot more of the items Va'dyn has and would like to get some spells would like to progress as a guild, kill some of the hardest mobs they are able and most importantly have fun.<br>
<br>
If you want to kill anything that moves go play Diablo, play a game with 3000 other people using the same environment and you should realize that moving up and on is a good thing that should contribute to yourself and others having more fun.  Yippee you can kill Va'dyn anyday, doesn't mean you should.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you need a day set aside for working on Ssra Keys and Veracity earrings, maybe get some spells people in the guild are missing but aren't 60 spells that drop off raid mobs.  Need to make it worth raid points and get some people out there.<br>
<br>
Or you can go kill whatever trivial little mobs you can find and hope for the good loot, whatever is fun for you, enjoy~! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uapepsadisticdream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Apep Sadisticdream</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>~Making your dreams<br> my personal playground~<br>  Sadistic Mage Admin</span><br>  Posts: 1153<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/02 9:09:36 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Embrace you own identity</span><hr size=1> /groan<br>

<br>
Aye, put your money where your mouth is.<br>
<br>
Sorry to disappoint you Phewvee but:<br>
<br>
1) Unfortunately you didn't ruin any suprises, sorry to rob you of that satisfaction;<br>
<br>
2) You admit that buying/selling toons doesn't bother you, yet you admit to using it to &quot;inform&quot; people about Kzan to make him look bad - hypocrisy;<br>
<br>
3) A long time ago in a thread far, far away you stated you meant no malice towards Bako with your &quot;break a leg comment&quot;, that it was a joke.  However anyone with half a memory and the ability to wade through your posts should be able to make the connection that you spit hatred at the guy (gimp, cowards, etc...), so either you are lying about your opinion of him or you were lying when you said the comment was a joke - I'll go with the latter;<br>
<br>
4) Now for the big one.  EQ is a game Phewvee.  Obviously you take it very seriously because it seems to be the defining thing in your life from which you derive pride and self-esteem.  I said seems because who really knows, however your tone suggests that you do in fact take it, perhaps a bit too seriously.  Spitting hatred at someone over a game is sad.  That type of emotion and fervor would find better employment in Al Queda. <br>
<br>
If you think you are making Bako or Kzan or anyone else look bad with your self-appointment to the &quot;I'm here to inform&quot; committee, then you miscalculated.  But killing mobs, looting them and unleashing your childhood angst against &quot;someone&quot; is all part of your enjoyment within EQ.  Perhaps EQ2 will have an official Asshole character class or better yet a server for you folks.<br>

(Or even if the zerging question has been resolved).  But anyway.  Zerging isn't a question of numbers, its a question of how you use the people you have with you(ie tatics).  You can zerg vindi with 1,  you can take him out without zerging with 100.  Zerging I would think would be defined as not using your raid force to the fullest of its abilities.  Or trying to simply overwhelm a mobs hps with shear dps.  Not caring about positioning, healing, debuffing, etc, etc.  Having more numbers on a raid just makes the zerging more impressive.  I mean seeing a 100 dead bodies in vindi's wake is cool, seeing one in his wake is just rodekill.<br>
<br>
So anyway, unless you know how a guild is killing a mob, I would hesitate to simply use their raid force as the determining factor of whether they are &quot;zerging&quot; or not<br>

Kzan's post clarified that.<br>
<br>
So Kzan is a liar was the point of your post?<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I don't think we have killed the Exiled yet. <br>
<br>
This is a lie, he knows they haven't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I know&quot; aren't in contradiction.  But in this case, with Kzan playing the amount that he does, allowing the possibility that we have done Exiled and he didn't notice it is a tad absurd, so granted.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; Our very first attempt we came damn close. He was at like 2% in the end<br>
<br>
This is a lie, tanks used offensive discs on Glyphed which was the main reason Exiled failed. 2% and Exiled has nothing to do with a FaF attempt.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's not a lie that's his lack of understanding of the mechanics of the game.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; We'll get him next time for sure.<br>
<br>
This is a lie, you failed the next time as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Doesn't fall into the category of lying, because the truth of the statement cannot be evaluated.  &quot;It will rain tomorrow&quot; is neither a lie nor the truth, simply a prediction.  Once tomorrow comes, the statement is pretty meaningless and should be modified to &quot;It rained today&quot; which may or may not be a lie.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I can't recall 100% but I dont think we have done a 425 dain.<br>
<br>
This is a lie, he knows they haven't.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't have a damn clue if we've done 425 Dain or not.  It may be possible that we've done him and Kzan was not present or simply didn't inquire.  It may be likely that he is going to take actions to figure out which Dain it is, but I'm not going to make that assumption seeing as I don't know him well enough to speak on his behalf.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I think people were saying we would have won if we had done combat rezzes but we didnt. =P<br>
<br>
This is a lie, people on rez effects will not effectively block rampage from getting to clerics, once you are rezzing in on Dain you have lost.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again not a lie, lack of understanding on Kzan's part.  The latter part isn't necessarily true.  More accurate would be once rezzing becomes necessary on Dain you have lost.  If you're rezzing people in and still winning you have a higher raid force than is required.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I could be wrong though.<br>
<br>
HOLY SHIT THE TRUTH.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clearly.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I try not to get hit and when I do I go down pretty quick so I wouldnt really know =).<br>
<br>
This is a lie, he dies a lot, he's very poor at playing his class and it's easy to check what a mob hits for it's called scroll up, the absurd concept that whether or not it's 425 Dain will show up in guild chat is a farce, aka another lie from Kzan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not a lie.  He said he tried, he never said he was good at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; So far fun for me is staying in a small guild trying to do the big mobs.<br>
<br>
HAHHAAHHAHAHAHA Tag EM all Kzan, this guy wanted 50 people to raid Crushbone and he's wanted more every step of the way, because more people means easier to cover up his incompetence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seems off topic, did Kzan lie here?<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; But on the other hand I wonder if it would be even more fustrating with a bigger guild.<br>
<br>
This is another lie, he's trying to claim that 50 people clearing N ToV shouldn't be having fun because OMG it's 50 as opposed to taking that elite force to Eashen and Ikitiar and wipe 3 times, something that could have been prevented from not inviting Kzan.<br>
<br>
Or more simply he's trying to belittle Reso's accomplishments.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not a lie in the technical sense, but I think you're working off of his implication here.  Given his original post his implication is hard to read.  He could be claiming that he wouldn't enjoy taking an overpowering force to take on a weak opponent.  You could argue that makes him hypocritical citing examples where he has done so, and thus he shouldn't enjoy his time now.  Thus if he said he enjoys himself (I think he did), he would then be a liar.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; I will see the majority of the end game mobs with my guild. <br>
<br>
This is the biggest lie of all, We are so far ahead of Resolution...., regardless of your ability to kill mobs you won't see them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Prediction, not a lie.  I don't think Fire and Fury's comparitive status to Resolution is an issue here.  There's no debate that Resolution is farther ahead than Fire and Fury (I think we're measuring distance here by difficulty of mobs attempted and defeated, so I'm going by that assumption).<br>
<br>
The latter is your prediction, and you could be incorrect.<br>
<br>
Was the only intent of your original post to get across that Kzan is a liar?<br>

Trying to apply logic or rationalize Fuvi's posts here is like trying to rationalize the barking of that annoying dog in the truck, parked outside of your favourite sidewalk cafe. He's got a mad on for me. Let him bark like a rabid dog. It doesnt affect me or my game play. It brings me great joy to know he is still writhing in angst over our disagreement we had months ago.<br>
<br>
I mean really... why bother getting into it with him? We all know what type of person he is. He is a self declared asshole and he seems very proud of it. Good for him.<br>

Granted, he's writing in 10 paragraphs what could be summed up in 1.<br>
<br>
Fire and Fury members have publically on this board flamed Awakened Souls and it's members for being a guild that has and supports buying characters.  The purchase of both Eldraed and Stabbington were condemned by people on these boards and in FnF, and AS members were told to /guildremove if they were moral people.  A member of FnF then purchases a level 60 epic bard on e-bay (3 exist on the server that I know of) with the intention of this person being in FnF.  Now, the same members that were blasting AS for having an e-bayed toon are going to have one in their own midst.  The same people who told AS they should /guildremove are going to have to give FnF members that same choice.  He's just showing the hypocrisy of the situation.<br>
<br>
Draw your own conclusions, but saying that isn't logical is just being naive.<br>
<br>
Of course, he also defends it by saying e-baying characters shouldn't mean shit to anyone.  So pretty much he doesn't think FnF is doing anything wrong, just being hypocrits.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna go back to running circles in the nexus now.<br>

As for those flaming AS on the various gear/toon transactions, I guess I'll have to visit that thread and see what was said by whom.  Ultimately, as far as that activity goes, it's all a matter of opinion.<br>

Not anyone in FnF. Some folks in FnF may have expressed thier opinions about eBay'ed characters though.<br>
<br>
I was really reluctant to buy my first ebay character. I mean the stigma and all. I got over it pretty quick. It got easier and easier as I went along and by the time I bought my 5th I didnt even think twice. (I started with 2 on this server, bought 5 for a total of  7)<br>
<br>
I still enjoy the lower levels though. I have a level 7 character I started up late last nite (deleted my SK, /cry Janz) and I am having tons of fun with him.<br>
<br>
Its not about adding to FnF. None of my ebayed purchased characters have been on FnF raids. We used my cleric once but thats an account I have owned from day one. I did get someone else to help me level it though because I am kinda pressed for time with trying to keep 7 characters geared up and earning xp. I have spent about 500 US so far on extra gear for these characters and I plan on spending more. But I am gettting side tracked here.. where was I? <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, what its all about. I told this to Lithis in a discussion about twinks. &quot;I see them as tools&quot;. Tools and nothing more. My cleric is a com heal tool that heals my Dire charmed pets. I have other uses for my ebayed characters that arent so obvious though. Like tells I get from people trying to recruit them, offering &quot;x&quot; number of choice loots if I sigh up etc. and I already mentioned monitoring guildchat.<br>
<br>
I think some guilds are on to me though. They use shout on raids now instead of guildchat or raid channels. So now I have to actually BE there to collect info and observe their actions. It makes it a lil harder but I still think its worth it. Info &gt; all. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

<br>
&gt;&gt; Embrace you own identity&quot; &lt;--- it should be &quot;your&quot; btw.<br>
<br>
Flaming spelling, a winner is you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Aye, put your money where your mouth is.<br>
<br>
Sorry I don't buy integrity, I have it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Sorry to disappoint you Phewvee but:<br>
<br>
You dissapointed me by playing politics to get loot meaning your knowledge of game mechanics came at a price of the happiness and attendance of others.  From that point on you had no ability to dissapoint me because I lacked any expectations of you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; 1) Unfortunately you didn't ruin any suprises, sorry to rob you of that satisfaction;<br>
<br>
I expected you would know, note it wasn't news to Kzan that Gwenlynn was the bard in question, it was news to the community in general.  If Captain Roleplay was going to be surprised somewhere down the road that Kurley was into EBay instead it came out with that post.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; 2) You admit that buying/selling toons doesn't bother you, yet you admit to using it to &quot;inform&quot; people about Kzan to make him look bad - hypocrisy;<br>
<br>
Nope, hypocrisy is expressing a belief you don't hold.  I never said Kzan was bad for buying a character, I just told people that he did.  I didn't have to try to make Kzan look bad he's perfectly capable of that on his own, I just have to make more people aware of what he does.  People can use that information to modify their opinion on Kzan or EBay.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; 3) A long time ago in a thread far, far away you stated you meant no malice towards Bako with your &quot;break a leg comment&quot;, that it was a joke. However anyone with half a memory and the ability to wade through your posts should be able to make the connection that you spit hatred at the guy (gimp, cowards, etc...), so either you are lying about your opinion of him or you were lying when you said the comment was a joke - I'll go with the latter;<br>
<br>
That's because I possess a grasp on reality that Charles fails to.  Bako's actions in game governed by the sense of self importance Charles gets from playing a video game I attack.  Wishing physical pain on Charles someone I have never and will never meet is not something I do.  Bako thanked me for that comment at the time.  Once you can seperate game and reality figure out the difference between Fuvi and Bryan you have a chance of understanding the difference.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; 4) Now for the big one. EQ is a game Phewvee. Obviously you take it very seriously because it seems to be the defining thing in your life from which you derive pride and self-esteem. I said seems because who really knows, however your tone suggests that you do in fact take it, perhaps a bit too seriously. Spitting hatred at someone over a game is sad. That type of emotion and fervor would find better employment in Al Queda. <br>
<br>
Correct comments, incorrect target.  Bringing up Al Queda close to September 11th, that's just pathetic.  Again you can't dissapoint me after all I tried to cut the brake lines on your car, no wait, I sent an email, but that was the same as cutting the brake lines on your car.  Bako ruins the enjoyment of people who play this game, since you don't, no worries.  I attack that and point out how to have more fun playing a video game.  You still have no grasp of analogies.  Using the game as a tool for RL interaction is something Bako does, not me.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; But killing mobs, looting them and unleashing your childhood angst against &quot;someone&quot; is all part of your enjoyment within EQ.<br>
<br>
If I don't like something people are likely to know, I don't keep things bottled up and let them fester.  I suffer from neither anxiety or depression now nor did I as a child.  I didn't let EQ affect my RL in the least and then quit because it wasn't worth it for a &quot;family guild&quot;.  I play the game to have fun, other people played the game and it was &quot;too much like a job that didn't pay&quot; and were worried about feeling appreciated for that effort.  Wow, I would have quit long before that point, I play to have fun, if it's not fun I don't play.  The end game can be reached by other means that suffering and work.  If you're not having fun but think you will have fun down the road realize that the road doesn't really end and rather than having fun at the next stop you'll be working more to get further down the road.<br>
<br>
Dalnin &gt;&gt; now I remember why he got booted off the board the first time.<br>
<br>
So do I, because Banegrivm was one of the best things ever to happen to the server and would lead the RP Server into an age of enlightenment unknown to any of the other servers.  But he left to get more loot on Legends.  You can all thank me now for letting you know months earlier that Banegrivm's primary motivation was never RP and was just a tool he used to get loot for himself.<br>
<br>
WWX, some things you don't find in a dictionary<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I know&quot; aren't in contradiction. But in this case, with Kzan playing the amount that he does, allowing the possibility that we have done Exiled and he didn't notice it is a tad absurd, so granted.<br>
<br>
Oliver North, not sure if you're old enough to remember, maybe you studied him in school never lied, HA!  Although it's impossible to prove what someone remembers it's still lying if you do, the King of Kudos does remember and lied about remembering.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That's not a lie that's his lack of understanding of the mechanics of the game.<br>
<br>
It's a lie, it wasn't damn close, it wasn't 2 percent.  Kritical and Kerg screwed up, can't admit Kritical made a mistake so people were led to believe we just weren't ready for a mob and the Ssra basement was deserted again for some time.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Doesn't fall into the category of lying, because the truth of the statement cannot be evaluated.<br>
<br>
It can be because he was referring to the first attempt which would mean the next attempt would be the 2nd which had already failed, they since attempted a 3rd and failed.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I didn't have a damn clue if we've done 425 Dain or not. It may be possible that we've done him and Kzan was not present or simply didn't inquire.<br>
<br>
Yes all the phone calls and emails and playing and the King of Kudos wasn't sure about killing a mob.  I do believe the phrase is beyond a reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Again not a lie, lack of understanding on Kzan's part. The latter part isn't necessarily true. More accurate would be once rezzing becomes necessary on Dain you have lost. If you're rezzing people in and still winning you have a higher raid force than is required.<br>
<br>
This one could actually be Kzan's lack of knowledge about the game as opposed to a lie, on further review this one can be chalked up to incompetence.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;&gt;&gt; I try not to get hit and when I do I go down pretty quick so I wouldnt really know =).<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Not a lie. He said he tried, he never said he was good at it.<br>
<br>
The qualifier &quot;so I wouldnt really know&quot; makes it a lie, the implication at that point is that he doesn't die very much.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;&gt;&gt; So far fun for me is staying in a small guild trying to do the big mobs.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Seems off topic, did Kzan lie here?<br>
<br>
Yes he did.  Kzan now states it was his opinion all along to remain a small guild because that's what he is in now when infact he has always advocated having a larger guild throughout his time in FaF.  His goals were always far more consistent with the guild Resolution is now but lies to say his goals match his current guild.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;&gt;&gt; I will see the majority of the end game mobs with my guild. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Prediction, not a lie. I don't think Fire and Fury's comparitive status to Resolution is an issue here. There's no debate that Resolution is farther ahead than Fire and Fury<br>
<br>
No it's not Fire and Fury vs Resolution, Kzan said End Game.  By the time Fire and Farming was in Vex Thal there would be how many new expansions?  New one coming out next month and even Innoruuk hasn't died let alone Tunare, Sontalak, Burrower Beast, Rings'a'plenty, Shei, Cursed, Arch Lich, Creator, High Priest, AoW.  New content and new standard for end game comes out within about 6 months of Fires of Heaven killing off the old content, there is no reason to believe Fire and Farming will ever be within 6 months of them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Was the only intent of your original post to get across that Kzan is a liar?<br>
<br>
Primarily yes, because I consider that his greatest failing.  I realize other people think lying is OK because well not like you want to spoil Santa Claus to a child and keep making larger and larger exceptions throughout their life.  But no it wasn't only, I saw Kzan spewing lies and decided to post and economy of motion I don't make seperate threads for every concern.<br>

I don't really care about anything else you have to say, but I'm going to speak up here.<br>
