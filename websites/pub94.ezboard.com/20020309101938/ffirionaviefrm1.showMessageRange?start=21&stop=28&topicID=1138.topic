<br>
The only language my Dwarf has mastered is Dwarvish, thanks to the level cap on languages. In the other racial languages, her skill is merely &quot;Good.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would be greatly annoyed, should you insist that she speak Dwarvish, unless you happened to be playing a Dwarf at the time.<br>
<br>
I can understand someone speaking Language X perfectly well when their skill at X is Master and mine is Good. Any failure in communication, therefore, is on the part of the other player, not on mine. Under these circumstances, I am willing to make allowances when asked, but I don't take kindly to demands.<br>
<br>
Edit: This is assuming we are in a &quot;language neutral&quot; place.  If we're in a city where one language is predominate, it may be a different story. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A> at: 1/21/02 12:35:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 3:17:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Your last comment ..</span><hr size=1> .. might indicate a misunderstanding in how languages work.

<br>
This is why it irks me when someone insists on speaking gibberish to me.  There is *always* a common mastered tongue between me and everyone else.  Most people will quickly jump off the bad language when they find I know their racial.  This one annoying little furball was just being perverse -- asked him 3 or 4 times, then gave up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 5:45:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why we love FV</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Your last comment might indicate a misunderstanding in how languages work.&gt;&gt;<br>

<br>
I am aware that the garble is symmetrical.  Moreover, that's exactly my point.  Because the effect is symmetrical, if I can understand you perfectly but you can't understand me, then it is clear that I (as a player) have some comprehension skill which allows me to discern meaning from a partially garbled transmission which you (as a player) lack, regardless of which character has the imperfect language skill.<br>
<br>
At which point, as a player, you are asking me to make a concession to your lack of skill.  That's a bit ironic, I suppose, since in terms of our characters, it may be mine which lacks language skill.  In any event, the point is, when a person wants me to make allowances for their shortcomings, they should ask, and not demand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 8:44:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> &lt;sigh&gt;</span><hr size=1> Uh, of course you can understand me perfectly.  If I can see the person, I always speak their native racial.  So, I'd be speaking Dwarf unless your speech demonstrated fluency in a different language.  It's hard enough understanding what people mean when they are fluent -- many statements are ambigous (such as your comments above).  Garbling it just makes it worse.<br>
<br>
The point is not that I can't understand, it's that I don't like putting up with people that are deliberately annoying; I don't like &quot;griefers&quot; of any stripe, though &quot;language griefer&quot; is a new one.  I'd phrase it as a request, but that's only being polite.  Not complying has consequences.<br>
<br>
If all you had at your disposal was a broken garbled output, of course I would help you work through your impediment.  If you have the choice of perfect output and garbled and still choose garbled, you're being deliberately anoying.  I hope you realize that other than this one dwarf in FP, you are the ONLY person that I've run across that insists on speaking something they have no skill in after finding out there is a fluent alternative.  If this isn't idle argument and you really do this in game, I'd put you on ignore.  If you were in group, I'd kick you out.<br>
<br>
All of this is getting *very* far from the subject thread.  What I like about FV is that it's small, it's new, it's got good people, and I can get around all the new rules with only minor hassles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaelofthevoid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhael of the Void</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Servant of the Void</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 1:38:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why I love FV</span><hr size=1> I spent close to a year on Fennin Ro and Rallos Zek before FV opened up . One thing that got on my nerves constantly was a /tell from someone I'd never head of.  Something like &quot;Hey dude, I'm Soandso's alt! Wanna go get some xps?&quot;  <br>
<br>
I don't care if you're an alt of someone on my friend list.  Some people go on my friend list because they are fun to talk to (like Bobmato and Kazanti on FV) but the majority of them are there because they know what they're doing.  If the cleric keeps me alive all night , he/she goes on the friend list.  If the enchanter runs around like a aviak with his head cut off at the first sign of danger, he dosen't get a spot on the list.<br>
<br>
So that's my favourite part of FV. the people I meet today are there tomorrow.   you get to know people and their characters much better here, and some of the &quot;n00bies&quot; i've met here are playing their character GREAT because they've had to stick with it and learn from thier mistakes.<br>

<br>
I love Firiona Vie.  This server is wonderful.<br>
<br>
1. Roleplay.  Only once, in the last year and a half of playing this game did I encounter any roleplay on the servers I tried before, Bristlebane and Tholuxe Paells.  Once.  I love to roleplay.  I have a character with a developed background and personality that defines how I act in game.  I strive to remain in character at all times, unless forced to OOC for important reasons or to help players with questions not answerable in character.  I have roleplayed more in just the last week than ever on another server.  Multiply that times the weeks since this server opened, and I am having a great time.<br>
<br>
2. Twinks.  I hate twinks.  I despise running by orc hill and seeing someone in 70k worth of equipment.  Not only because it is annoying to see someone in equipment that they did not earn (that character, I don't care if your alt earned it, you didn't.), but because it is unfair to other players without that advantage.  They create a feeling in lower level character, especially new players, that they are not as good since they don't have similar equipment.  Once they understand why, it creates feelings of resentment and jealousy.  But, primarily, I hate it because twinks, especially at low levels, don't group.  They take an entire area that should support a low level group and kill everything to power level themselves.  That is what really bothers me.  The 1 character limit and TLC combine to drastically reduce twinking.<br>
<br>
3. Languages.  Thank you, you actually managed to make languages interesting.  I like some other ideas that have popped up about making NPC's speak racial languages, but I'm happy to at least have this.  I spent 30 minutes in Ak'anon, gesturing and leading a gnome around when we did not share a common language to get him to help me turn Nitrates into the Zoo guy for the Regurgatonic.  It was so much fun in the end, when he got it, I was smiling and laughing out of game.  I also rewarded the young gnome with some platinum which I hope helped him on his own endeavors.<br>
<br>
There are other reasons I love this server, and if this discussion continues on, I might chime in again, but for now, I'd just like to say thanks to creators and players who gave this server its uniqueness and to everyone who even attempts to roleplay.  <br>

<br>
I wasn't aware that &quot;deliberately annoying&quot; meant &quot;not catering to Bjond's every little whim.&quot;  But if that is what it means, then, why yes, I must say that I am deliberately annoying.  I happen to roleplay a Dwarf who prefers not to speak Dwarvish with non-Dwarves.  Took that one right from Tolkien, basically.  A pity that that's a problem for you.  I thought that this was the Roleplaying server, not the &quot;Do not annoy Bjond&quot; server.  Evidently I have much yet to learn.<br>
<br>
It also happens that in real life I like to try to communicate in languages other than English whenever possible, because I enjoy learning and practicing new tongues.  I suppose occasionally other people might find that annoying.  Personally, when I am in Korea, I'm going to speak Korean as much as I can, even if my grasp of the language is less than perfect and the Korean person I am talking to speaks English fluently.  Call that perverse or &quot;deliberately annoying&quot; if you like.  I suppose you'll be the Merkin expecting everything to be said and done in English, and loudly complaining that you can't understand people's accents.<br>
<br>
I did mention earlier, of course, that I'm usually happy to make accomadations and switch languages if I am asked politely to do so.  Apparently you overlooked that, or perhaps you just think that it's beneath you to ask politely.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I don't like &quot;griefers&quot;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh, my.  So now it's not just annoying, it's actually griefing to play any way you don't like?  This really is news to me.  I honestly had no idea.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I'd put you on ignore.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, by all means go ahead and put my little Dwarf on /ignore then, if you still have room.  From what you've said, I gather your /ignore list is either already full, or nearly so.  I imagine that you like to put a lot of people on /ignore, more than you have slots, really, so I'm actually quite flattered.<br>
<br>
You do remember that this whole thing got started when I said to you, &quot;I suppose you and I wouldn't enjoy talking to each other in-game very much,&quot; Bjond, don't you?  You could have just put me on /ignore right then and there and been done with it.  But I suppose it's more fun to call me an annoying griefer first, isn't it?  I must admit that I, too, get a little thrill from righteous indignation once in a while.  Perhaps we have more in common than you think.  But no, that couldn't be.  After all, I'm just a griefer.  And you're annoyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If you were in group, I'd kick you out.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I'll hazard the guess that you play a shaman or druid, since you must solo quite a bit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/22/02 1:59:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I think you need to reread ..</span><hr size=1> .. what I wrote, Imogen.  You are the only one I've run across  that insists on being misunderstood by speaking a language you don't know when there is an alternative.  Unlike RL, it's not cute, you're not practicing (zero potential for skill-ups), and you're all alone.  I'm not going to walk up to you and insist you speak Dwarf or even mention it if it's just casual chat.  But, if you keep pestering me in a bad language to buy something, that's ignore potential.<br>
<br>
Refusing to speak the tongue the group knows is definitely bootable.  I like to hunt in the harder spots.  Clear comunication is vital.  Refusing to do so endangers the group.  I'm not being petty.  I'm keeping the group alive.<br>
<br>
FYI, I group often and my ignore list is empty.  I get along with nearly everyone.  I think I've put maybe 5 people on ignore total over my entire time in EQ.  It would indeed put you in a select group to earn a spot on it.  BTW, is Imogen your character's name or a web alias?  I'm curious if that furball in FP that kept trying to sell me an Ulak was you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1138.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1138.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1138.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1138.topic&index=28><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1138.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1138.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1138.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
