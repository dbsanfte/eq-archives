<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I stand before you,<br>

You seem to believe there are no<br>

Do you believe there are no<br>

Are we mindless beasts,<br>

Does anyone believe...<br>
<br>
That the Drow are as worthy as man?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Do you not see the corpse of the lone tier'dal within your woods?  Did your people not hunt him down and slay him?  Why?  You call us evil for doing the exact same thing.  Its hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
And you druids and rangers who say we are evil for killing your wolves and bears... what are they for attacking our children for no just cause?  They are fit to live and our children are not?  You would hold a wolf or bear's life in higher regard than a person?  You cry out when you see the corpse of those beasts rotting in the sun yet you buy armor made from their pelts.  I call you a hypocrit.  <br>
<br>
Innoruuk is our Father, yes.  He fuels our hearts with hatred, yes.  Is this hatred unjust?  I think not.<br>
<br>
I am not a pawn of evil, I am not evil.  This is not a child's game.  This is survival.  Kill or be killed.  Fight or die.  You hunt mine and I hunt yours.  Survival of the fittest.  The meek shall inherit nothing.  Hypocrisy is the true evil. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/6/02 7:15:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sad sigh*</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya just looks at Anrae with a short, sad sigh.

<br>
Oh sweetie, you listened to my voice but I don't think you understood a word I said.  I don't know if you even can, but since you asked questions I'll answer them.<br>
<br>
Are your children hunted and slain by my people?  <br>
<br>
I have seen other elves who have fallen in the woods.  I have also seen tall elves, tree elves, humans and all sorts of other people in the same state.  And I am as sad when I see them as I am when I see the unskinned wolves and bears, because they weren't killed because someone needed food.  They may not even have been killed because someone needed to defend themselves.  They may just have been killed because of fear or of hate.  But whether I like it or not, both the murderers and the murdered are still my family, still my people.<br>
<br>
And your next question... Is a wolf's life more valuable than a person's?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She tilts her chin and pauses for a moment.  Her brow is slightly furrowed as she looks into Anrae's eyes as if searching for something.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I value all life.  Norrath holds the city you grew up in as close to her heart as she holds the city of the dwarves.  Tunare gives growth to the trees of your forest as surely as she does those of the Feerot, and of Toxxulia.  And if my Mother and my Grandmother find worth in anything enough to feed and protect, who am I to question them?  Who am I to love anyone any less than they?  Who am I to hate…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She suddenly blinks and breaks her eyes away from Anrae's, her eyes a little shiny.  She almost seems to shake a moment, then returns her gaze again with all the fire and passion she showed in her first speech to Shintou.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And even though I know you already have your own answer to your last question, I’ll answer it just the same.  The hate that Innoruuk inflicts you with IS unjust.  But the injustice is to you, not me.  He forces this hate on you with constant attacks, constant pain.  He needs you and your people so desperately that he fights every moment to keep you in as much torture and torment as he forced on your ancestors.  And like them, you’re not strong enough to fight the endless onslaught.  Maybe someday you will be, and maybe someday you’ll come home again…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya realizes she’s trailing off, and that her speech isn’t going to do much good.  So she reaches back to the table and picks up the brightly feathered armband she’d made.  With a half-shrug and a slighter smile, she hands it to Anrae.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It’s okay if you don’t, I understand.  It’s hard to be strong.  So instead I’ll be strong for you.  And maybe if you wear this, and see how lovely it is on your beautiful blue skin, it will remind you of me.  And maybe, for just a moment, knowing there’s someone who cares will help you hurt just a little less.<br>

I am the only daughter of the granddaughter of the second brother  to the King of Neriak. I grew up well cared for, but not spoiled or drowned in opulence. My needs were met, but not grandly, if you gather my meaning. My mother was a cleric of Innoruuk, fanatic in her motions to please her god. My father fell when i was very young, and my memories few of him. As I grew, my mother brought me with her to the temple in the third gate, to bring me to Innoruuk.. i was 10, the time of decisions. When i looked at the way my mother changed in this place, at the way everyone looked, I decided No god would affect me this way. Gods use man to satisfy their own ends. You label me &quot;neutral&quot;, but i was Free to rule my own destiny, my own future.<br>

The day my eyes glazed over, my will became stronger, and a voice thundered in my head, &quot; Kill Him!&quot;  I am now in service to Innoruuk, yes, I am still &quot;neutral&quot; by nature of who i am, but follow a god by my choosing. Yesterday you asked me, How fares Sel'quar, in response i answered, We prosper. Your next question was &quot;on the backs of neutrals?&quot; I speak for Sel'quar, and I am neutral, Am i weak? no, do i use others to aid my house in it's growth? Nau, I do not. I do not understand you anymore Shin...and given your hostility toward me, I'm not sure i want to. <br>

Daughter of Tunare, you are right in saying we are all children of Tunare. Long past is that fact, and no teir'dal would openly admit that. We are proud of who we are, we hold our traditions tightly in our fist.  Innorruuk made us thus, he planted his seed in the new &quot;king and queen&quot; of Neriak.  But as bloodlines continue the link to Tunare is diluted with each teir'dal child's birth. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> shakes her hair back, holding her head high as her lavender eyes sparkle</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Okay, I've got a riddle for you then!<br>
<br>
A coupla weeks ago, I took a bunch of clay.  I slipped it up with some water and molded into the cutest little doll!  Then I put in a pretty stone so that my doll was holding it, and then stuck it in the kiln so it would be in the fire until it was as hardened as it could be.  It's been out of the fire a long time now, and I've carried it all over the place since then.<br>
<br>
So here's the riddle: What is my doll made of?<br>
