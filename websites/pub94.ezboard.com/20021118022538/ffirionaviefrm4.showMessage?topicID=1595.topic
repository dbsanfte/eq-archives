<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Item Duping</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I sincerely doubt that there are any game-damaging dupes out there. We've had the reward offer out there for some time, and only received one that was verifiable, and that was a dupe of soulbound items which are all no-drop anyway. <br>
<br>
Here's a copy of the reward offer: <br>
<br>
Hello all, <br>
<br>
For those who are new to online games, a “dupe” is a bug that allows a player to “duplicate” or “copy” items, creating two items where once there was one. We've heard some reports that there may be a dupe bug somewhere in game. While we're confident that we do not have any current<br>
issues of this type, we'd like to provide an incentive to everyone to report such things should they become aware of them. <br>
<br>
The FIRST person to submit reproduction steps for any dupe bug will receive the following:<br>
<br>
a) A free EverQuest account. We'll mark your current account as free, or provide you with a new, free account,<br>
and<br>
<br>
b) Subject to approval by us, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the title of your choice</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> will be applied to one of the characters on your account.<br>
<br>
To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore, THE REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT LOGICAL STEPS ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG.<br>
<br>
Send an email with a subject line of &quot;Dupe Bug Report&quot; to<br>
eqmail@verant.com containing the following: <br>
<br>
1. Station Name<br>
2. Real Name<br>
3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)<br>
4. Primary Play Server<br>
5. Primary Character Name<br>
6. Complete reproduction instructions. <br>

One rogue got a full suit of russet from GMs for it in addition to the title &quot;prince of thieves&quot; (this was pre-Kunark when Indocilite was the best armor around and war-only -- russet is plate/all indo).  However, what happens to most people is that they get banned.  I've heard of far more bannings than rewardings.<br>
<br>
Most of the banning stories go like this: guy reports with full details to GMs.  Verant decides that no one is exploiting that bug sufficiently to warrant a fix.  Verant does not reward reporter and does not fix the bug.  Reporter gets pissed off and posts the information all over the place.  This is generally and widely regarded in the security industry as VERY good practice for bugs after you give the owner a chance to fix it and they don't.  Verant then bans the guy.<br>
<br>
This is why you don't see reports and titles roaming about.  No one trusts Verant to do anything but ban. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveldalina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldalina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 1:19:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: There were a couple folks ..</span><hr size=1> Wow!

Sometimes up to 8 hours of playing time lost sometimes only 10 minutes. This was very frustrating for him obviously. He petitioned told VI what was happening and VI said that there was no problem. So he duped a few K plat and then about a week later the problem went away in a patch.  He should have just gone hogwild dupped a million or so in plat and then shoved it in VI's face.<br>

<br>
There is a reason they demand you tell them upfront everything about the bug.  They dont play games, they always want the ball in their court... it already has them pissed that it has been taken out of their court by a bug (that they let slip no doubt).<br>
<br>
I have been playing EQ a long time.  During the first year, you used to be able to log in on top of people.  i.e., if someone logged into your account, you would not get the message someone was on, you would log in and take over where the other person was.  The original person would be placed in a state of limbo where they could explore the zone indefinitely (sorta like being LD, but not kicked off).  This was not a problem until a monk found a way to exploit this using FD and /q.  I do not remember the monk's name or the exact details, perhaps if you could find a MB archive that dates back 2 years you could find it =P  I assure you this did happen and certain some old skoolers can verify.<br>
<br>
This monk demonstrated it to a GM and emailed Verant like a good player.  The bug was fixed within a week, took that long because Verant had to do a reprograming of how the login server worked.  During that time, they did not give the monk his title, or even get back to him.  So he told Verant he wanted them to fulfil their end of the bargain.  Still no word.  He then gave an ultimadum that he was going to release the bug to the public if they did not fulfil what they promised.  Verant then replied they were confirming it and would indeed fulfil what they had promised.  So the monk did not release it.  Two days after he threatened, servers went down, the bug was fixed, and the monk was banned.  The monk told his story ex post facto but of course by then it was a moot point, as Verant had acted swiftly and connivingly to keep the info secret until they could fix it... and then spite the person that made it known to them just because he wanted them to uphold their promise.<br>
<br>
Maybe he should not have threatened, maybe Verant doesnt give a damn, both probable reasons.  The fact is that there have been many dupe bugs.  It is inevitable, and Verant is not the one that finds them, players do.  This leads me to conclude there have been a lot of people that found bugs, but I have never once heard Verant back that promise up with real evidence of a &quot;hero&quot; that helped keep the world in balance.  Nor have I heard of one on any of the boards I read.  <br>
<br>
Of course, more than likely, if these people's names were released, they would be drug out into the street and shot by the people that were profiting from it =P <p><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org"><p align="center"><img src="http://members.aol.com/lethron/ermoksig1.gif"></p></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uermok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ermok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 6:05:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/norokcarraig/druidtalon.gif height=97 width=99></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Dupe Bug?</span><hr size=1> Its the one Dominic is talking about, it happened right after they implemented a FD nerf where mobs over lvl 35 would have a chance of not believing it.

He was a major figure in the EQ monk comunity; he ran one of the two monk boards in existence at that time (the other being The Dojo).  He sent e-mail to every monk that ever posted on his board about how to do it. The details are a lot different than you hinted at, Ermok -- you're mixing up two different dupe bugs.  Here's the opening paragraph from the monk that was banned:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> On July 28th I have found a reproducible duping bug and reported it to  Erollisi Marrs GM Valtron. After inquiring about a reward for reporting the bug I was told that they have no policy to reward people for reporting bugs.  I have tried numerous times to speak with Valtrons supervisor or anyone superior to him and failed. After explaining to Valtron the seriousness of the bug and that if it were to get publicized it would hurt the economy greatly he accused me of threatening to publicize a bug/exploit and banned me. While I have not threatened to do such a thing, now that I am banned that seems like a good idea, so here goes<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->BTW, you're also mixing up how-to details of two different dupe bugs, Ermok.  Also, there were three more rather public ones that I recall, too.  VI's little assertion that there has only been one such bug is ridiculous, though they might be talking about only one known outstanding unfixed dupe bug and not one in all the history of EQ.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say that reporting a dupe bug is pretty much tantamount to deleting your account.  The &quot;prince of thieves&quot; guy I wrote about above didn't *just* report a dupe bug.  He was part of a group of dupers and turned in all his friends.  He said afterwards he was just feigning friendship to nab 'em all, but he hung out with them for ages before they duped.  Most folks regarded him as a slightly higher form of pond scum.  Another thing to note is that this &quot;prince&quot; guy that was awarded with in-game items and a title was a moderately well-known case and it happened well before the monk case.  I wouldn't put it past 'Q' to try a little GM extortion either, but I only knew him from his board.<br>
<br>
Don't trust VI to reward you.  Expect to be banned for your trouble.  That offer up there is &quot;bait&quot; for duper scum.  Please don't go off and try to dupe items with the hope that turning in the information will earn a reward or even a thank you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uermok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ermok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 7:56:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/norokcarraig/druidtalon.gif height=97 width=99></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: That was one of the major ones</span><hr size=1> Like I said it was two years ago =P  I just remember that a monk reported a major dupe and was subsequently banned.<br>

A message to do-gooders in closing:<br>
<br>
Yea, I am all for honesty and stuff, but if you find one, keep it to yourself.  There are those of us who want to use it. =)  Chances are the bug has been around for months before you came across it and the damage to the economy (whatever that means) has been done, so you arent really fixing anything.

Long story short this was a bug that allowed you to duplicate stacks of any stackable item in seconds without hacking the program. It started on Torv, my original server and as soon as this post was made everyone was doing it. The only person I had ever heard that was banned from it was the original poster.<br>
<br>
I posted about this bug a while ago in our soapbox, but quickly realized that the only way to keep more people from doing this was to not reveal any information about it. It's human nature to be curious, and I'll admit, I tried this bug with a mule account I have on Torv with some summoned bread. It worked. I closed that account and never returned to Torv. The market is pretty much ruined there anyways, people have stockpiles in the millions of PP.<br>
<br>
Stuff like this really makes the game boring. Half the fun is seeing new places and gaining new items and skills (the other half is the friends you meet and get to play with). By making items and money basically meaningless, you are cutting out half the fun of the game. Remember Diablo 1 and all of the cheats that came out for that game. Pretty soon everyone had a Godly Plate of Whales and was using TownKill to kill other people in safe zones. I quit because there was no reason for me to go into the tough zones on Hell mode. Game lost all interest. EQ would be the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1705<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 9:49:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: That was one of the major ones</span><hr size=1> I fekkin knew it.<br>
<br>
Everyone /wave a big hello to Kubrt &amp; Mekaklet, both of whom were selling near unlimited quantities of the things for 1K.<br>
<br>
They'd sell about 10 at a time.  As soon as those were sold, they'd immediately add another 10 to their inventory.  Repeat ad infinitum.  I can only guess this was done to avoid the suspicion of having 100 blue diamonds in your inventory at one time.<br>
<br>
Quaker Jack is sellin his blue diamonds in marketplace forum for the bargain basement price of 900 plat each.<br>
<br>
Mind you, this is all circumstancial evidence.  These people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> could</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have just farmed up hordes of the things (except Mekaklet, who's level 40ish).  Perhaps they made some great trade.  I find it unlikely however that they'd be selling them for such a low price, and that they wouldn't have been selling them previously (I've been watching the blue diamond market for the last couple months as I was preparing my cultural, and all 3 of these individuals just showed up recently, with stacks o' the things for sale).<br>
<br>
Anyways, glad they fixed the dumb bug.<br>

I've noticed that all the games I have on my computer that I downloaded a bunch of hacks and cheat for etc, I never play anymore.  They have lost the appeal in gameplay since I know the way to cheat it.<br>
(Though, Sometimes I don't wonder if I have more fun trying to figure out how to cheat, than I do playing the game itself!)<br>
<br>
But I enjoy EQ too much to want to screw around with it - so much that I refuse to go to certain places in Norrath, just so I have new places to go if I create a new character.  Still have never been to Odus, half the places in Faydark, never been to Velious or Kunark.  Just waiting so I have new places to explore.  Am I anal or what?<br>

A lot of nice people were posting they wanted to cash in on that promise and I don't want to see them banned for it.<br>
<br>
Do report it to Verant, just do it from a completely blind e-mail account.  Give them full details on the bug and zero details on yourself.  Give them one week to fix and patch the bug before you go public.  If not fixed in a week, go public.  Except for the bit about being anon, this is basically the standard method encouraged for reporting security holes in large and often unresponsive organizations; eg. like Microsoft.<br>
<br>
I guarantee the above method will both fix the bug and keep you safe from the near certain banning if you report it with your name and other details.  An in-game title just isn't worth getting banned over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 464<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 7:22:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1595.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm</span><hr size=1> I just found a dup-bug <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
