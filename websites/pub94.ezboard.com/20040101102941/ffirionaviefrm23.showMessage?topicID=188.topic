<br>
A deft side-step of the guards outside, and I am in -- only to find a number of Dark Elven women resting inside.  One of them wore the symbols of royalty -- a Baroness!<br>
<br>
Behind a wall, I prepare my Illusion: Dark Elf, and hope they don't notice me.  Now, I always assume that Baronesses don't hang around with skeletons unless they are after something specific -- and there is no way I want to be caught in the way.  So, I attempt to ask where she is hunting.  She looked at me confused, and, possibly amused -- my capabilities at the tongue of Dark Elves is gibberish with a touch of Qeynos.  Begging off at some deformity of the mouth, I listen to her tell me that she is heading down, and that I am free on this level.<br>
<br>
More speech occurrs, and, though I cannot understand it, I soon feel infused with magic and power.  Even Jobober becomes a seething beast!<br>
<br>
I bow, and head toward the nearest door.  Locked.  OK.  The next door opens, and I see the pet of a necromancer.  I wait, and am soon rewarded with a bit of the necromancer's robe peeking around the corner.  Mez on the necro, and Jobober and I take the pet first!<br>
<br>
Uh oh.  Friends.  There are, in fact, 3 necros, each with pets.<br>
<br>
I am doing well, with half of the 6 locked with mez (even channeling through some disruptions!), but not well enough...  However, the dark elven ladies hear the commotion, and assist -- keeping me alive with their blood magics and their blessings of Innoruuk.  Fact is, I survive -- but one of the enemy necros survives too...<br>
<br>
The dark elves return to their mission, and I begin my exploration of the southwestern wing -- when the necro (whose escape was missed in the confusion of the earlier melee) returns with a new pet, and several friends.<br>
<br>
It is immediately apparent that I am over-matched and without hope.  A quick summoning of flashing lights provides me a moment of confusion to escape.  As I run, poor Jobober slashes down one of the skeletons, but falls under an avalanche of rusty weapons that were meant for me.<br>
<br>
Even as I run, I try to scream a warning to the dark elves who so assisted me, but it's silenced by my fear, and fades in the back of my throat.  In my panic, all I am aware of is the direction to the exit.  (I forgot I had not made a hotkey, yet.  Spending too much time in WK, were I am alone in the zone 90% of the time.  My normal &quot;Scream&quot; hotkey was not there -- the sense heading was in it's place...)<br>
<br>
I feel certain that one who is a Baroness is easily capable of handling the mob of beasts that I brought out, but it is still a poor way to reward her help.  I never even caught her name.<br>
<br>
I hang my head in shame...<br>

&quot;You're gonna have to do better than that.  In Bristlebane's name, I myself have locked half the Iksar's Pit on my tail and ran like Innoruk's whole army was after me as I attempted to reach the portal to New Tanaan.  Well, I guess in a way a chunk of Innoruk's army was after me.<br>
<br>
&quot;My best advice to you is when you get the chance.  Apologize to the Baroness who did aid you.  Your words will be enough for you to gain some respectability back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I take it you have not lived many lives within any of the realms of Norrath.  You find the mistake you made while unique is not uncommon.  If anyone here is audacious enough to deny creating a train of demons, devils, or general yard trash ever then they lie or have lived fewer lives than you.<br>

<br>
Um, my dear Sir Mettlach...   You do realize that this was the poor enchantress we helped out All Hallow's Eve before our ceremony...  The baroness in question was probably Felicite (I believe she was the only baroness present, as my title is Lady, Ayeilia's Venerable, Jaranna's Mistress and Vivienne's was Sage..   I don't recall Furia's title, and Annahun and you are still working on yours...  Kandayin was too young to have such a title and I can't seem to recall Lady Yasyne being present....  I belive, Felicite was the only Baroness present.<br>
<br>
But I digress...  *smirks and pats the bard on the head*<br>
<br>
Lady Raethella<br>
<br>
It was most likely one of the Daughters Nocturnae that you talk of, and I assure you - we have no hard feelings and there is nothing to be ashamed of...  In fact I myslf, don't even recall the happening or it being mentioned....  My sister, Lady Ayeilia is the one that empowered yourself and your guardian.  <br>
<br>
Please, don't be upset.  Do not be ashamed.  *smiles*<br>

<br>
My dear Lady Raethella you have nothing to apologize for.  My own remembrance is we should apologize to you for the chaos we created.  We were in the process of killing (re-killing? *giggle*) anything that moved when you cleared your throat and asked if we were.. ah.. staying?  Since we were just toying with undead while waiting for the others, we were glad to step back, and to watch over you.<br>
<br>
I remember understanding your Human words clearly, and throwing back a gibberish of Elvish, forgetting that not everyone speaks Elvish. *winks*  And I remember you being overwhelmed in that narrow hallway, Lady Ayeilia healing and blessing you.. myself adding redundant heals.. purely for show compared to Ayeilia’s competent hands.<br>
<br>
But soon after we descended to find a site for our rite, and my only thought for you after that was a little smile to myself that now that we had moved down, you likely had a little peace and quiet. I am sorry to hear of your hasty retreat, and relieved that you escaped.  Minus one servant, but you and I have that in common.. expendable servants. *giggle* But, the evil you woke did not reach us, and you certainly should not be ashamed.<br>
<br>
Think no sad thoughts, d`anthe.  Any time you are in New Tanaan, feel free to stop by the Coven Hold (( Dogle Pitt’s bank area.. you will often find us there, relaxing )) and I will show you myself with a smile.<br>

I would be honored to accept the invitation to visit you all at the Coven Hold.  Before I do so, I will need to perfect my Elvish, and see if I can develop a fair approximation of Yukon Jack for Mettlach.  The Halas brewers will not share their secrets with me, but I think I can come close!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I shall need to taste-test...<br>

Perhaps we can arrange something for this weekend?<br>

To remind you of who I am, I was the lone human in the midst of all the Teir'dal in Befallen (unsure if Jaranna was there yet or not, but if she was, I wasn't the only human).  I was one with the flamey sword.  Any time I can be of help to you, feel free to ask (and I have some young enchanter stuff that you may find interesting that I have in my bank that you are welcome to if you want it)<br>
