I don't know you, but let me assure you, Siffo is far from greedy.  <br>
<br>
He didn't come here with his question about whether or not it would be an effective shield for a rogue and and admit that he rolled on the shield so that you could take it upon yourself to attack him as being greedy.   <br>
<br>
He did it because he genuinely wanted to learn whether or not he was justified in rolling on the shield and to get feedback on whether or not his thoughts on how he might use it have any merit.<br>
<br>
Trust me, if Siffo had won the roll and discovered that it was worthless to him, he WOULD NOT have put it up for sell in the bazaar.  He would have immediately done what was right.<br>

<br>
If the only restriction set on items is &quot;NBG&quot;, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> yes</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, a rogue can roll on a high AC shield if he keeps a set of AC armor in a weight reducing bag for the times when he has to act as tank in his cleric/druid heavy guild... and a warrior is entitled to roll on a high int item if he considers himself a professional blacksmith who's tradeskilling would be greatly helped by the boost.  They're not greedy for asking, they can actually use the item in question (even if not as much as someone else could).<br>
<br>
If you don't want the warrior to end up w/ a piece of hybrid armor, or a rogue to end up with a high AC shield, just lay that out in the rules before you start.<br>
<br>
Someone else said it in a different thread, but the best thing you can do is be clear about the loot rules from the start.<br>

On the other hand I was starting to have fun with him seeing how far he would go into who should have what and what he considers loot whore or greedy.<br>

<br>
Edity Bit: Syllestrae I agree, I was trying to stay far away from the other bits like needing Wis items because a lot of others wouldn't understand how important they are to tradeskillers. I have two backpacks in the bank that have nothing but Wisdom items I can wear so I stand a better chance of learning when I practice my tradeskills. Does this mean I would roll on Wisdom items? No. I leave those for others who need them for combat. I will however collect them when I can and use them with out guilt that there is some Wis user out there that could use them more. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiffo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siffo</A> at: 10/1/02 3:54:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1034<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 8:54:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   From what you said, Siffo, you don't ..</span><hr size=1> .. even own a bad shield right now.  That tells me right there that since you are unwilling to spend a wee bit o' cash on a bad one, the only reason you're rolling on a good one is because it's free and the loot team said it was OK.  I'd bet every pal/sk at that raid not only had a good 20+AC shield, but was likely using it during the fight.  Does that perhaps clue you in as to the meaning behind need versus greed and which side you were on?  At least Knorr had the class to admit wrong and undo it.  That's cool.<br>
<br>
Syll, need is always determined by utility over time for the character or class.  That shield may have all/all written on it, but as far as rolling goes, it should be pal/sk only.  Just like dragon bags are all/all, but are really monk-only as far as awarding (anyone else will just sell it to a monk and buy two tinks).  I've heard every song&amp;dance under the sun about how some character has some particular use that makes them special and thus deserving of rolling on an item that has obvious vastly greater utility for another class or character.  But, that's all it is.  Just singing dancing greed in sheep's clothing.  Well, maybe lamb's clothing.  It's a minor greed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW, I thought of an amusing way to do open raid loot the other day: put it all in one big pile and permit people to BUY it.  Then distribute the cash amongst all present at the raid; eg. CoF drops.  If you want it, pay the typical 75K market value.  Same for all the loot.  Subtract 'dot costs and then hand out the cash to all raiders.  Every raider would likely walk out with about 3-5k.  Can't afford it?  Do lots of raids, raise cash, buy it then.<br>
<br>
It would sure cut down on greed, too.  It's like a DKP system.  Suddenly you see that all those people whining about being restricted from looting incidental seldom used items better suited for another class are not spending any DKP on those and looting them.  It's &quot;Siffo'ism&quot; all over.  Unwilling to spend his own cash on a nice shield, but if there's a chance at a free one, he's all over it!  Why?  Because it doesn't provide enough utility to him to be worth buying and he knows it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiffo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siffo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silly old Rogue</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 10:55:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: From what you said, Siffo, you don't ..</span><hr size=1> Oh of course you are so right Bjond!<br>

I am so greedy that I didn't buy a shield I never even thought about using till then.

Need Before Greed means that you should not roll on an item that you will have only extremely situational use for when there are others present who would use it often or full time.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can put restrictions on which classes are eligible for an item, but the problem with that is that there might not be anyone present of the eligible classes who wants it, and in that case, I think it's great if it goes to someone who has a rare/tertiary use for it gets it... like using Bladestopper for the Rune clicks, or the torque for tradeskills.<br>
<br>
Of course, I guess it's not realistic to expect everyone to be considerate of other peoples' needs in light of their own need/greed.<br>
<br>
If you aren't sure if you would use the item in question very often, don't roll against people you know really want and would use it.  It's pretty simple.  At least that's how I feel. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

In that situation, if I grouped a lot, it wouldn't be &quot;extremely situational use&quot;.  It'd be pretty damn often.<br>
<br>
   Bladestopper is AC 25, +50 HP, +15 STA.<br>
<br>
   Clay Guardian shield is AC 25, +55 HP (costs about 600 plat)<br>
<br>
   The stamina on Bladestopper makes it a better shield than clay guardian, but a rogue can't use Clay Guardian due to the class limitations.<br>
<br>
   If a rogue said &quot;Hey, speaking for myself, I tank an awful lot in my guild because we only have a couple warriors and 500 clerics&quot;, I don't think that's being greedy.<br>
<br>
   A Paladin would get better use out of it for sure.  They'd use it more often, and they'd benefit from the stamina more.   I suppose I'm disagreeing with your characterization of anyone asking for an item that doesn't fit your idea of the optimal character to receive the item being &quot;greedy&quot;.<br>
<br>
   Speaking personally, I haven't ever had a problem w/ loot distribution here on FV.  In the one open raid I joined (/cheer Saurix) the loot rules were clear and concise.  Everything else has been grouping w/ friends and NBG and worked out fine.<br>

I am not interested in what your opinions are as to how well the raid leaders loot systems work. I am also not interseted in what your opinion is as to wether or not you have decided I am greedy for wanting to make use of the shield in question.<br>
<br>
What I am and was interested in was wether or not a shield with high enough AC would let me be a more effective light tank for working with lower level adventurers. And the reasoning why or why not. As I had never seen a shield with this level of AC that I could equip it had never occured to me that it might be effective till now. <br>

Given that this thread was started based on a loot dispute, I don't find it particularly strange or unacceptable that it's turned into a debate on what constitutes a fair loot policy and how a person should treat and interpret NBG loot rules.<br>
<br>
But to attempt to answer your question, I don't think that a 25 AC difference is worth the melee damage you're going to lose as a rogue by giving up your secondary weapon, unless you have a really lame secondary weapon, even if you are tanking.  Rogues make poor tanks overall anyhow, possibly the worst of all the melee classes, especially given the fact that their strength is damage output, and by facing an NPC toe to toe, a rogue is giving up a big portion of what makes him so effective (namely, backstab.)  Not to mention the aggro you are giving up by making fewer attacks.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in a situation where there is no other tank in the group, it would probably be better to attempt some other strategy than straight tanking.  Fear kiting, or taunt kiting, pet tanking, ect. or try hard to find a warrior, shadow knight, paladin or even ranger or monk to join the group to do the tanking.<br>
<br>
Will a 25 AC boost help you tank?  Of course (though there is a practical AC cap of 1200-1300), but as has been noted, you probably won't notice it without parsing.  The fact that you'll have to tank <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> longer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> due to your loss of dual wield or 2H weapon damage likely will totally offset the advantage you will have in tanking better due to higher AC/HP.<br>
<br>
At least that's how it seems to me. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
Saga is still relatively &quot;tank-lite&quot; though we have picked up a few rangers and another warrior or two.  Hence, the reason Siffo still performs as a tank on many occassions.<br>
<br>
Bjond, <br>
<br>
Again I don't know you, but I would like to make an observation based upon the commentary that you have made here.  It seems to me that you have singled out Siffo for no apparent reason and decided to tell him that he is greedy.  He may be lacking in knowledge as to what is the best gear for his class, etc, but he is not greedy.<br>
<br>
You really should give individuals the benefit of the doubt before you assume that everyone is just like you in level of knowledge regarding Everquest.  Many of us are still learning.  I think that overall you have made some excellent points about how loot distribution could be handled more effectively during raids, and perhaps folks who lead raids will take those suggestions under consideration in future.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that is what you should focus on instead of telling Siffo that he is greedy, or referring to the opinions of those whom you think are greedy as &quot;Siffoisms&quot;.    <br>
<br>
I was proud to see that Siffo was able look beyond your name calling and re-establish the focus of his original question.  He is even receiving good answers to his inquiry thanks to Tukka.<br>

<br>
Thank you Tukka, I appreciate yours and Bippins answers. <br>
<br>
When I had asked the question about the sheild it was very obvious that the initial dispute was over. The fact that Bjorn wanted to keep it going by attacking my integrity clouded the fact that I was just trying to learn something about shields and armor and how viable they are.<br>
<br>
I use many forms of strategies to work with unconventional groups. A lot of times I have more AC than any warriors or paladins there and in a lot of places kiting doesnt work do to add cogestion or no one that can snare. If I had alternatives I would be using them but I don't, it is just me the rogue tank and I have to live with it. Then add a mutiple pull where I am trying to keep aggro of a few targets. Because I am the tank for the group I normaly get aggro first and unless they get real lucky in their hits I have to loose it intentionaly to back stab and once I do back stab I have to literaly evade and back out of the locale aggro range to try and get the mob to turn from me and even then the mob will often turn right back to me when I get close.<br>
<br>
So I figure I need to increase my AC and lower my aggro some this should allow me absorb more damge and still use my evade to get backstabs.<br>
<br>
Like I said it is unconventional but then I still solo sometimes at 47 which by common opinion rogues can't do either,<br>
<br>
Maybe it will work maybe it won't since no one seems to have tried it I guess I will have to and see how much difference it makes. That silly shield would have answered the question and if it hadn't worked, well I do know some young paladins that would have used it.<br>

<br>
I have to say that one of the great things about Saga is the fact that we often have folks fighting in less &quot;ideal&quot; groups and we still do reasonably well.<br>
<br>
Give me an unconventional group anytime over your standard &quot;dream group&quot;.  I find experimentation, uncertainty, and near death experiences much more entertaining than knowing that you and your group have little chance of death.<br>
<br>
Examples of a recent groups:  A bard, two paladins, two druids and a rogue in Kedge.  Fun! Fun! Fun! <br>
<br>
Or 4 druids, a bard and a rogue in The Grey acting as a group.  Ah...nothing like it. <p><img src=http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/Tuppensig.jpg>

In general, if you don't know you want it and deserve it over others, don't roll or ask for it unless it's been thrown open as a tradable/sellable.  If you don't want to hear that you've done something greedy, don't ask if something you've done fits that description; ie. don't ask questions in the soapbox when you want reasurances and not answers.  And especially don't go looking for a fight when you don't get the reasurance you wanted.  You'll get beat black and blue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1425<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/2/02 1:27:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh, Tup ..</span><hr size=1>    If everything you said is true, that the shield would give him no additional benefit in combat, even when fighting monsters ~10 levels lower than him, at best it makes him uninformed, not greedy.

IIRC, you're a bard.  Would *you* roll on it over a pal/sk?  You could use the rune.  Assuming monk is on the class list, I could use it.  More AC/hp helps pulling.  I use a rainbow at times for resists during pulls.  You don't need to do damage as a pulling monk.  That's all VERY situational.  The whole point is that if you have doubts that your usage would not be among the top of those on the raid, you shouldn't be rolling.  I know I'd never roll on it unless it was open as a tradable.  Likely you, too.  We'd never really use it enough to make keeping it worthwhile.  C'mon, would you even THINK of rolling on a contested item for purely speculative experimental use?<br>
<br>
Whether it's greed or not is all based on how much extra weight you put on your own desire for an item versus how much basic utility the item provides to you and others.  If it provides little utility to you, but you're rolling against those that it has great utility for, that's greed.  When you don't know the utilities, you're just admitting all you have is desire and you aren't considering the utilities at all.  Sure you might be uninformed, but that doesn't make it any less greedy.  It just gives you a nice opening for appologizing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utuppentangledroots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuppen Tangledroots</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/icon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/2/02 2:02:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/tupsface.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh, Tup ..</span><hr size=1> Thanks for making the point, Syll.<br>

<br>
   On bladestopper, no.  Fekk tying up my off-hand with a shield.  I keep a sword that gives +15 AC in my offhand, but I'm not losin attacks to pickup AC.  Only shields I'd want are back slot ones like Lodizal shield, excepting maybe some really nice resist shield that I could pair off with drums of the beast if I acquired them someday (drums of the beast can be used in primary slot).<br>
<br>
   However, I did put up a fuss in a Permafrost group I was in once.  We had a group w/ a druid, a cleric, myself, a ranger, and 2 tanks.  A mammoth hide cloak dropped (little AC, nice chunk of +WIS).  The druid got it.  Then we got another for the cleric.  (I agreed with both of those decisions).  Well, a 3rd one dropped.  The Ranger claimed NBG, I felt we should all roll for it.  The ranger could get better use out of it, but we all knew it was a crappy ranger item that he'd use for like 2 levels then sell.  As it was, he put up more of a fuss that he needed it because he could get better use out of it (cuz rangers are wis casters), so we gave it to him...<br>
<br>
...I saw him selling it a week later.<br>

<br>
I will paraphrase.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I DO NOT CARE ABOUT LOOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We are talking about pixels and lines of code in a game, not real things. The issue this thread started on wasn't about the loot. It was that many consider it very bad form and without honor to take some thing won in a NBG roll and sell it a few hours later.<br>
<br>
If you knew many of the people from Saga you would understand. Sure an UBER STICK OF THWACKING would be nice. But the real enjoyment is getting it with guildmates and friends. Hell some of the guild members actually repel plat and we have to sit on them and force them to take items they can use.<br>
<br>
Your perspective is so oddly skewed on this because it doesn't occur to you that I really don't care about plat or loot any more than I would care about buying Park Place in Monopoly. It is all just bits in a game and mean nothing beyond the enjoyment of playing.<br>
<br>
If you could get past your fixation with greed and XP you would find a whole new higher plan of enjoyment in Ever Quest.<br>
<br>
It reminds me of what a Zen master once told me:<br>

Edity Bit: Thanks Syll thats a good idea if I find one that has a lower ratio I can lower my aggro some too or maybe if i put away the SCHW and put on heavy gauntlets that might work.
