<br>
&quot;The Bond between the Paracite and the Host is one of constant feeding. Almost a slave master relationship, but the master relying on the slave for survival.<br>
<br>
That is the essence of those who take up the art of Soul Reaving, an art that deals with the manipulation of a persons soul, the theft of their very spirits being this styles most prominate mark upon its foes. Such an art was lost however as it was interwined with Necromancy..<br>
<br>
Yes, It is a branch taken from the rotting tree of Necromancy much like vampirsum is. You should notice now many of your spells involve blood. Now notive how many of your spells involve souls. This discipline is a part of Necromancy, but again, its finer points were lost in the mix as Necromancy took the &quot;best&quot; qualities of Vampisum, Soul Reaving, Poision and the dead to become as it is. <br>
<br>
That is, until now.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The City Of Skyshrine, Shintou with his Corrupted Innoruuk's Curse.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Shintou, Vespa, and Zharra had taken to hunting within the Skyshrine .. for Slaying the Dragonkin there did provide great challenge and excitement for the three of them. They advanced throught the towers cutting down all forms of Wyvern, Drake, and Wurm. Shintou's blade was tugging at his very sprit energy..<br>
<br>
But it was nothing he couldn't handle.. so he felt.. <br>
However, a drake had gotten a lucky strike upon the sholder of Shintou, forcing him down as blood gushed out of his neck. A Deadly scrape if it were not for the quick hands of Zharra, healing the wound instantly as Vespa felled the Drake with one mighty swing..<br>
However.. Shintou knelt down, his breath heavy..<br>
And his body weak. Vespa ran over with Bandages as Zharra tried to heal him. .but she had no more mana left.. <br>
<br>
Vespa's bandages did nothing as Shintou fell face forward, his body going limp.. and also growing cold to the touch swiftly. He had died, right there before them. Not to the Drake..<br>
<br>
The Innoruuk's Curse finally claimed its prize. The Soul of its Host.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>~~~~~~~~~~~</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;When the Ronin Senshi took the corrupted Innoruuk's Curse as we planned, master, he did finally fall victum to the Soul Consumption. The Paracite has begun to feed off of the host, now all of his training will begin to show as he begins to progress in the art of soul reaving. This does please you, yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The red haired human stood before the Hatred emminating from the Avator of Hate itself. About 6 years ago (I'm guessing here), Shintou completed the quest to gain his Innoruuk's Curse, the weapon denoted to him by this same Red Haired Human, known as the Knight Yotoden Kimigami, to possess the correct properties to focus the Soul Reaving arts.  <br>
<br>
The Avator looked over several scrolls, of course Innoruuk could not be bothered with such menial tasks as watching over the files of all his Tier'dal children until he did find the record of Shintou. Yotoden spoke again...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You will see that I have been preparing him for such his entire life, from birth. The slaying of his natural born father after you possessed the Ranger with enought hatred to give his seed, the Slaughtering and desturction of his family via those Guards I conviently tipped off, the tourchure I granted him was his only childhood friend. Those things made his spirit able to withstand the test that would set him apart from the other Knights.<br>
<br>
I did not only hurt him and give his soul enought torment to keep him loyal and hateful in his service to you and the all mighty god you represent, but I taught him many things. The most important of them is to make his Harm Touch not just a simple burst of rage, but apart of his soul. He has done this, and as a reward he learned to channel this energy throught weaponry. Its all for show, of course, his energy is no stronger then any other knight.. however this also taught him how to manipulate his own soul. The first soul a soul reaver must learn to control is his own. <br>
<br>
After he learned this lesson and was able to focus his own soul into his Harm Touch, I gave him Valdria. Well, I can't claim credit for that, that happened by chance, but it did open up a good chance for him to prove mastery of his soul.<br>
<br>
Valdria took Shintou. Not sexually, for he still was too young to handle such a woman, but took his vitality. She was one of those vampires, her body was weakened by a state of childbirth. Gray Hateborn, one of the Clerics in your name, as well as Valdria held Shintou to his word of Service to one &quot;League of Shadows&quot;, and to offer his blood so that Valdria and her child would live. He did such, so she took him, his lifeblood drained completly from his body.<br>
<br>
Thats when my training of his soul first paid off. His spirit was strong enought to not only liquify and sustain his body in the absence of blood, but it gave him his first taste of soul. It was quite a scene to watch him struggle at wondering if he were a Vampire or not. Trying to tear at the necks of those Sprocs for blood when he did nothing but digest the substance. He'd lay many a corspe to the side in the Timerous deep, the very shore of that Sproc Island ran crimson with the essence of death. Some Druids wouldn't kite around him.<br>
<br>
He did figure out how to tug and take the souls of the dead however, and he did begin to gain in level of power again, finally. Taking the souls strenghtened him for his final test that would move him into more advanced lessons.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Avator listened to Yotoden's words intently until their was a point where it rose its nighty, blue green hand in a command for silence. Yotoden silenced himself as the Avator spoke.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You will take a break in your briefing here, Yotoden. Go, rest for the day. Return here sharply in the hateful morn of the marrow or face the diezens of this plane where you now reside. You have given me much to digest, and I will read over your written reports.&quot;<br>

He wore a hood that covered his black coals, his hooded jacket of sorts extending down to about his knees. He kept one arm out of this said jacket, keeping it in a sort of falce sling. He also kept his sword upon his back, an Argent Defender which he named &quot;Fujikuro&quot;. The Avator nodded to the Knight and they exchanged greetings and pleasenties. Not after long, Yotoden was allowed to finish his briefing..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Shintou had learned to steal the life force, the souls of things he had killed. It was limited to just that, he could not take the souls of the living, for he did have to destroy their life before he could perform the soul reaving. Their was one incident where he destroyed the unborn child of a Paladin. He took the soul and summoned an undead minion. He twisted the soul and placed it within his pet. Then he forced the mother to slay himself and the soul of her baby. You can surely see, this is a very powerful force we are dealing with when truly mastered..&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And the Avator nodded, somewhat impressed... it spoke, raising a question..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Such a thing .. would allow a man to play god, if it were. Giving souls new bodies, yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which is why his religion is so important. Shintou is loyal to a fault to his grand Father Innoruuk, he would never defy his will. Now, if you would allow me to finish..&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yotoden's reply, a bit sharp towards the Avator, his tone bordering on disrespect. The Avator paid it no mind however, information first, punishment second..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Shintou was activly stealing souls and adding it to his own power. He put the souls within Jars, and these jars would glow blue in power. In total, their were 10 jars, 5 were one fifth of the size of the other 5.. so five little jars would fit in one big jar. This is where Shintou stored the soul energy. The little jars would glow blue as the souls were put into them. When they got full, Shintou poured the souls into the bigger containers, which glew orange. After he filled the bigger containers, he would take all of the souls onto himself.. and gain a level of power.<br>
<br>
Shintou gained the 50th level of power in this manner. <br>
<br>
It was then when I confronted him. I ensured that he was training well, and I ensured that he got the Ghoulbane when he was younger. After showing it to me, I informed him that he would have to meet me in combat upon the Cobalt Scar. If he defeated me, he would gain my soul energy, and the 51st level of power. If he failed, he died.<br>
<br>
As you can see, I am dead. Yet I have my soul. I simply lied to the boy, he did not have enought skill to take my soul yet, but he does not need to know that I even exist still. He fell me by the sword and advanced.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And.. he gained the Innoruuk's Curse 10 levels of power later.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the Innoruuk's Curse, the paracite, took apart of his soul and used it to create an alter plane within itself. The Plane of Souls, is what I call it. He's a master of his own plane and doesn't even know it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why is the Curse important?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a Soul Edge, a blade able to mainuplate soul energy. I figured that, combined with the fact that it was foraged by Innoruuk himself would be able to magnify Shintou's powers to the point where he could master the art of Soul Reaving. He has done well, he now is able to take souls from the Living over time and use that to kill them. He could not do this with the Curse. <br>
<br>
As well as the fact that the sword stole apart of his soul. He is now bound to it for the rest of his days, if he were to not touch the hilt for an extended peroid of time, he would die. I think It would take a week of being seperated from it to kill him. The effects would start taking its toll on him after the fifth day. <br>
<br>
Also, do not forget what I taught him. Remember, I made him make his harm touch energy apart of his soul so that he can channel it throught weaponry. With a Soul Edge, the Innoruuk's Curse, in his hands he is able to perform the two mastery skills of the Soul Reaving profession.<br>
<br>
Soul Theft and Soul Desturction.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You will have to explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will. Soul Theft is just that, stealing souls. Remember, I told you Shintou can now steal souls from the living and use that to kill them. The acual techinque used for this is called the 'Soul Edged Slash' Three levels of this type of attack, that steal a large part of an opponets soul and gives it back to Shintou.<br>
<br>
The Soul Desutrction techinque has no levels that increase its power, but only its element. You have two Elemental Attacks.. Burning Soul Slash and Frozen Soul Slash, and the non Elemental attack, Final Soul Destructive Cut.<br>
<br>
Shintou has already unlocked the Burning Soul Slash, thanks to an Augmentation placed in the Innoruuk's Curse known as the &quot;Heated Blade&quot;. This attack doesn't steal an opponets soul, it completly crushes it, destroying its essence. .. But Shintou does not have it perfected, so they simply die and their soul .. whats left of it, returns to its bind point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Their is more. The sword has a mind of its own. Taking apart of Shintou's soul and converting it to its own, it blankets Shintou's mind. Shintou will never leave the sword, not because leaving it would result in his death, but because the sword has entranced him. He believes that their is no sword better then his Soul Edge, the Innoruuk's Curse.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Interesting. You also said it created its own plane? The Plane of Souls?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. The sword steals the souls of anything it kills. From Animals, and intelligent life. It stores the souls in the Plane of Souls, thus it gets stronger and strenghtens Shintou as well. Shintou also gains those souls as slaves.. he still uses his bottles mind you, but what is left over he keeps and uses them as his own personal minions. He injects them into his pets mostly, but he has found other creative ways to use his army.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Army?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. Shintou is collecting souls for a reason. His own legion of darkness because the Tier'dal just are not cutting it anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You WILL watch your tounge in these halls, Yotoden. &quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The human gave a simple jester as he continued talking. A Slip of the tounge it seemed..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;At any rate, Shintou comes closer to mastering the Soul Reaving Techinques by the day. Once he has them mastered, he will take his vengance, my vengance, and the vengance of all of Darkness upon this land. It may be a long time comming, but that is his true purpose. I know the soul of the one he needs still sleeps to attain true power and to truly understand what abilities he can attain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You do know I am not pleased with my children as of late. The entire Patheron will soon depart Norrath and reject them all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is no matter to me. He will survive on as he always does, until he is able to stand before the creation he was modeled after.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see. Your briefing on this matter has been, interesting. Innoruuk will command you what to do from here. You are dismissed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Short for words, the Avator had simply had enought of the Arogant human. Yotoden was dismissed, and sent off to the rest of his existance. The Knight had acomplished his mission, so he no longer had any purpose but to sit and wait. <br>

<br>
Shintou meditated in the Plane of Valor. Some foolish ranger got met with death for insulating that he would ever follow a way of peace and love because of the fact that Innoruuk no longer was there..<br>
<br>
He took the Rangers soul, for that was what the sword commanded, and in his mind, that was what was important.. Also within that twisted mind of the Reaver, he was doing his work to finalize Yotoden's work.<br>
<br>
This soul would be another of his subjects. The world within his blade twisted those souls as Innoruuk twisted the elven king and queen so long ago.<br>
<br>
He kept this to himself however, giving various speeches about how it was important to follow the dark ways as he went about gathering souls for his own army. His own creations. His own children.<br>
<br>
