<br>
Maybe rerolling is part of the solution, but he also needs to really understand what happened here, and getting caught is the least of his problems, in that sense.  He needs more contructive in-put than &quot;You suck, get the hell off our server.&quot;<br>

First, if you are going to give your account info to a brother who suffers from stupidity and insipid foulness, then you are as much at fault.   Sorry.  That's the way it goes.  Besides that, apology accepted...but how can I trust someone who comes from that bloodline ever again?  This is where everyone moves on and your Paladin learns to solo... <p><center>

<br>
of course, you'll all do what you think is best.  just seems obvious to me that this kid is playing mindgames with everyone in an attempt to make themselves feel good.  <br>

<br>
So the guy screwed up.  No harm came of it.  Maybe it really WAS his little brother...I mean, in grade school, how many kids don't do their homework and use the excuse that they forgot it at home?  That REALLY screws over the kid that really did leave it at home.  EULA violation, sure it's wrong, but how many parents are going to give a good god damn about EULA?  No, they're gonna think about their wallet and make the kids share.  It COULD happen.<br>
<br>
If he did do it, well, no harm was done.  Honestly I have to give him some credit for posting anything here...look at that Nabiki shit that went down.  Did he seem like he gave a damn what people thought of him?  No, not a bit.  At least here we have someone who, guilty or not, is trying to become a better member of society.  He could be trying to get in favor to scam someone else, or he could seriously regret what happened and wish to redeem himself.  If he didn't care what anyone thought, odds are he'd go back to Tunare and scam people out of rare items just to sell them on eBay.<br>
<br>
What he did was serious, true, but imagine if the first time you caused a group wipeout over something silly, someone came to the boards and whined about it.  Everyone overlooks the other parties' involved obvious stupid (and I'm talking DAMN stupid...who puts their EPIC in a trade window with someone they don't know from Adam?) mistakes and starts bitching at you and everyone blacklists you.  If you cared about being part of the community, you'd probably come here and try to get in good standing again.  If you didn't care, you'd move on to greener pastures.  The path of least resistance.<br>
<br>
I'd hate to have most of you on my jury if I got accused of a crime.  I'd get hung. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't know Valancer, and I don't care about who stole whose epic.  All I see is that someone is at least attempting to get back on people's good sides, and the bloodthirsty hordes are gathering to rip out throats and such. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udeuscopiarum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deuscopiarum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 2:50:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> bahm bahm bahm...<br>

It was an item he needed to obtain his epic, and one which required serious questing, but all epics are no-drop on all servers.<br>
<br>
Anyway, yes, he could be telling the truth; but most of us here doubt it, and I'm pretty sure he realizes that now. Also, there's a little inconsistency here; it was his account to begin with, and not his parent's. If he's old enough to be getting a masters, he's old enough to have a credit card, and it was his decision to let his &quot;little brother&quot; use his account.<br>
<br>
I am going to reaffirm the notion that your account is your responsibility, and no amount of &quot;it was my brother, I swear&quot; is going to get him out of the hot water he currently finds himself in.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also, he is by no means trying to repent for his deeds. He's blaming it on someone, who, more likely than not, doesn't exist. He's not trying to &quot;become a better member of society&quot; or &quot;get back in the good&quot; (sorry if that's a misquote). He's claiming that he wasn't responsible in the first place. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A> at: 8/11/02 3:12:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uattumadabeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Attuma Dabeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Heads</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 4:02:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> I cant believe you all!!! tell him to delete!!

<br>
sorry, i don't want to rip out his throat.  i haven't convicted him and tossed him in jail.  if i saw him, i wouldn't even bother sending him a /tell to say what a pathetic little jerk i might think he is either, which is a lot less than what some folks are probably doing every time he comes online.<br>
<br>
but personally i really don't think anyone trying to redeem a wrongdoing is going to show good faith by shouting out &quot;have you all forgiven me yet?&quot; across an entire zone.  who the hell cares if anyone has forgiven him?  he should get back to business and show that he's worthy of forgivenness, and then wouldn't have reassure himself by yelling.    <br>
<br>
if he's truly concerned about what happened, he'd keep his mouth shut and keep his nose clean from now on.  apparently, doing the right thing isn't really his concern.  boosting his self-esteem, or having fun trying to 'get over' or mess with people's minds quite possibly is.<br>
<br>
you've obviously never lived with children and seen their manipulative little ways.  saying 'sorry' and skipping merrily away doesn't fix what happened.  and he said sorry after the problem was already fixed by OTHER parties.  saying sorry is a very cheap way out of feeling guilt, but it does little to recompense anyone or re-establish trust.  <br>
<br>
if he wants to regain credibility, even (and especially) if it is for something he may not have done, that comes from actions and not words.<br>

Maybe he doesn't think of EQ as an alternate life, but rather sees it as a game, and when he does something stupid and people get all freaky weird over it, and the GMs zap the thing away, he can't fess up to doing it because he's too concerned with being 'cool' in the place he likes, which is this server.<br>
<br>
It's no secret that on most servers there's large groups of scammers with their own little tricks of the trade.  Their behavior is tolerated, even championed there.  Maybe he has been stuck around these types of degenerates and knows no better, much like the characteristic 'DING 2!!!!11!1' shouters who must suffer from the classic AOL 'Me Too!' -itis.<br>
<br>
I don't necessarily think everyone should forgive him, but those not directly involved taking on the mantle of righteousness need to be taken down a notch.  If you don't like him, fine, don't deal with him.  Inform others, if it pleases you.  But when he makes any attempt at all to return his reputation to dubious, well, you can at least return the favor by kicking it up to threatening.<br>
<br>
Blind hatred = blind stupidity in my book.  I'm just as sickened by some of the stuff I've read as by the foolish zealots who want to 'nuke the arabs'...<br>
<br>
I hear all of you say &quot;He shouldn't be shouting, he should be out there trying to prove his worth&quot; and blah blah blah...well what the hell do you expect him to do?  Especially when you offer NO advice on how he can regain that trust.  Might as well tell a blind man to walk a tightrope for all the good it will do him.<br>
<br>
And so it wasn't an epic, but rather an epic piece.  Big whoop!  You're still a moron if you go trying to give people reasons to screw you over.  If I have some important quest item, I'm not satisfied until the thing is in the bank, where if it disappears I can bitch at VI over it.  I most certainly wouldn't be letting people take a look at it.  If someone is concerned with the stats of something, kindly direct them to allakhazam's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 5:43:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> You would sound like a complete ass if you told someone to use a web resource to look at the stats of something rather than taking two seconds out of your time to put it up in a trade window for full inspection. Note that he didn't really mean to actually TRADE the Soulfire, but just wanted to show it off.<br>
<br>
The problem comes in when Valancer thinks of it as his, when obviously a borrowed weapon cannot be compared to the Soulfire. He was told that it wasn't an intentional trade, and he was asked to give it back. Instead of going along with this, he proceeds to gloat about his newfound fortune, and also rub it in the face of the previous owner.<br>
<br>
Again, I firmly believe that the previous owner would have never received his sword if it weren't for the GMs. And yes, it is quite amusing that all of a sudden the brother gets back from his vacation and makes a public plea for forgiveness on behalf of his &quot;mental&quot; brother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxadria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xadria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 7:40:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> I was there in CC with the Gm's and Valancer... I am here to say.. This guy is not sorry for what he did at all... <br>
<br>
While there the Gm's were discussing what to do about the situation... he was sending tells laughing about the whole thing... Then to top it off.. the Gm told him that if he camped the soulfire would be removed immediatly... <br>
<br>
After hearing Aaeb's side of the story and laughing some more in tells... what does he do... /q out of the game.. <br>
<br>
The very next day is in the bazaar asking people to see their equipment in trade windows... wtf<br>
<br>
This is not a person to be trusted, and he is not trying to change his ways... He loves it that people know him now, he even thinks he is popular in a sick sort of way... <br>

It's a 12 year old. You people give little snots too much credit. We were all (for the most part) demented little psychos at that age. This is par for the course for someone that age in a video game, and I have no idea why anyone expects/hopes for better. Yes, I am sure that there are plenty of kids that age who don't act that way and play EQ, but they're a rarity. He wants to stay, fine. He acts up again, chances are he'll get his ass banned, and that will be the end of it- and he'll probably move back to Counter-Strike or whatever. Just ignore the empty can rattling. It's just too bad he didn't screw up enough to warrant getting booted in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwiggibblet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twig Gibblet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 10:32:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> Yer missin' the point, folks.  This thread has about as much validity as a Soulfire does in the hands of Valancer.<br>
<br>
Two points.<br>
<br>
A)  Valancer DID act this way.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
B) Valancer's imaginary brother DID act this way.  If this is the case, Valancer is at much at fault as if he did it.  He is responsible for knowing his own brother, and ultimately, his own account.<br>
<br>
Either way, Valancer just plain doesn't exist anymore.  Re-roll or not, his guild will probably go down as well if there is a single sane person in it.<br>
<br>
Last point.  GM's saw this as a major grief.  We all know that it takes a lot to get any GM to act.  Obviously Valancer was way out of line.  Attacking Aaeb for making a simple mistake with the new UI is silly.  We have all put things up in the trade window to show an item to someone, and we all trust ourselves to not accidentally trade it.  Human error is common.  Whenever I do this my heart skips a beat...more so now than ever. <p><center>
