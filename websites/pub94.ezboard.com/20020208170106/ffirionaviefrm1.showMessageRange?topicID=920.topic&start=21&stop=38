It's really easy now.  See someone LFG, toss them an invite, voila.  Post 50, you need to get people, pick a spot appropriate for who you have, and get everyone there.  Often folks will have very strong opinions on where, which makes setting it up hard.  Or, you'll find all the clerics are in groups already and of the two that aren't, one is trying for the those last 3 points in blacksmithing and the other is off on one of the tedious zero xp epic camps.  Maybe a couple will have open spots, but not enough open spots for the people you've got so far, etc. etc..<br>
<br>
I love the small server aspect and I think there's some chance of it working out or I wouldn't be here, but post-50 is going to be a nightmare for the classes that can't solo while trying to get a group.  Also, the language issues are rough.<br>
<br>
I personally plan on grouping only casually until 19.  Then I'll max all the racials and really work on groups.  The 20's are also when classes start to take on definition and grouping becomes much more fun.  I'm hoping to meet and group with lots of people in the 20's and maybe join/start a guild then after I know many different people.  And, most hopefully, setup a regular group to play with up to 60.  Regulars are just amazing incredible fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 6:07:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Post 50 /roleplay a problem?</span><hr size=1> Hardly.

 <br>
Get to know them instead of relying on a crutch. Reputations should be the most important thing in finding groups here,anyhow.<br>
 <br>
The rules are fine as is-and to be honest,I could care less if people aren't staying. The ones that are seem to be just the kind of players I want on a server-polite,intelligent,and almost d00d free. If that's what the rules are filtering the place into,set em in stone!<br>

&quot;Lots of people are leaving in droves because they cannot ever find a group =( &quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know a single person who has left FV because of this.<br>
<br>
I know some who have left because they were Win95 users.<br>
I know some who have left because the new graphics/lag were too much to cope with.<br>
I know some who have left because the TLC can be a pain.<br>
I know some who have left because they wanted to try (x) race and (x) class.<br>
<br>
Yes, the post 50 game will be very different, I am sure.  But by that point, I bet we all know each other pretty well, (those of us that are left, eheh,) and this point will be moot.  We have a very small population now, and I expect it gets smaller, but all that means to me is that I am more familiar with people I meet and the humans that run them.<br>
<br>
As we are all stuck with one character here (2nd and 3rd computers notwithstanding, ehhee...,) the forced /anon policy will not mean much when we are all older.  You will know the people and guilds to group with and/or avoid much more easily.  I think this is a good &quot;drawback&quot; to our little server.<br>

I have always been a strong proponent of roleplaying, and fight for this playstyle on my own 99% non-RP server I play on most of the time. When I came to play on FV as well, I loved the new ruleset.<br>
<br>
I agree with the languages, the grouping restrictions, the /ooc removal, the range limit on /shout, and the single character per server rules wholeheartedly, as they promote this server and its distinct RP attitude and community.<br>
<br>
But even I, a stalwart of the RP aproach, find the permanent /roleplay setting, with no visibility of class/level, too much to bear. It is simply put, for those of us who do not want to be in large guilds, almost impossible to get balanced groups for anything, even at low level.<br>
<br>
This fact alone has made me more and more reluctant to play here, though I love this place in principle and the types who play here, because I can find groupmates on Lanys, even with my strict RP rules, far more easily than on FV, especially when I play (in European peak time, not American). I do not find being LFG and bored or soloing all the time fun AT ALL. I know very well, if this one thing were lifted, these problems would be wiped away.<br>
<br>
That is my take on this, anyway.<br>
<br>
Be well, everyone. And I will still be around (just more often on Lanys than here).<br>

<br>
What I said still holds true.  meet people.  make friends.  form groups.<br>
<br>
If you are one of the folks who chose to push all the way to 50 so fast, and are not in a guild that is mostly high level, then you won't have many options...  You probably soloed your way that far to find out that there aren't many out there.  If you didn't solo your way there... well you must have people to group with then...  It's like I keep telling my guildmates who are leveling much faster than the rest:  It's rather lonely at the top, would you rather get there and wait around, or find some folks to get there with?  And if your buddy is off camping an item for his quest, offer to help him!  Maybe he'll be there for you when you need a favor.  There are social aspects here other than the xp grind.<br>
<br>
If you want to group, stay with the pack.  Sorry I really have no sympathy for any argument about the lack of post 50 groups.  the server is 3 months old folks.<br>

<br>
Chat to people, get to know them and you will also get to know thier classes.<br>
<br>
Seeing people . . .<br>
Learn what armor/weapons people where, look at which pets they have up etc etc.<br>
<br>
By visual inspection you can recognize most classes if ya take the time<br>
<br>
Now on to the post 50 game.<br>
Two issues here<br>
<br>
1. Knowing which classes people are<br>
Why do you think you can do this on any other server, alot of classes spend a lot of time either /anon or /rp to hide their class i.e. Clerics, druids, wizards,enchanters, shaman. So hey you would not know what classes they where anyways <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In putting together say a hate raid you normaly have people /tell you with there class and lvl, you make a list and make the groups. It is not trivial but it is not that hard.<br>
<br>
2. Putting together balanced groups.<br>
Okay this is a pet peeve :-) There is so much complete BS about needing balanced groups post 50 it ticks me off :-) Ya do not need to have the &quot;right classes&quot; to play, enjoy and have fun post 50. <br>
<br>
If you have good folks that know their classes well and know how to play different rolls then its all good. My mage got to lvl 56 had had great fun grouping in chardok, seb, velks, sf and other places normaly in groups with no enchanters, no clerics. She also has a total of death count of under 12 for her whole life.<br>
<br>
Its a myth that you need certain classes. On the other hand, with the &quot;right&quot; classes hi lvl fights become trivial :-) Get a good enchanter and the fun of using paladins to park becomes trivial ;-) So I do understand the &quot;right&quot; concept but it is not the only way :-)<br>
<br>
I think the post 50 game will be just fine :-)<br>

I'm not talking about what 50 is like right now on FV.  I'm talking about what 50+ is like in general when the average player gets there.  Absolutely, a regular group and good guild go a long way to mitigiating these issues.  What I'm saying is that I had those on another server and it's still not enough.<br>
<br>
Groups need a way to advertise that they need people (ie. a LFP flag for group leader).  Almost no one turns on LFG.  So, the leader needs a way to hunt down people that hadn't thought to turn it on.  Perhaps having LFG default to on and you'd have to turn it off if you don't want invite tells would work, though removing /anon would be even better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umyrke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myrke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 11:29:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yes</span><hr size=1> May I butt in here?

It’s for folks who want the challenge. When you can’t stand the challenge anymore, go back to your old server, get twinked up, and powergame. When that wears off, FVie will be waiting for you. <br>
<br>
The wide open spaces and quiet zones have been wonderful so far. The few times I’ve actually seen a dark elf, it has surprised me (isn’t that what is supposed to happen?). Please don’t start petitions to ditch rules. If the rules are unacceptable, please go home to your old server. Leave the rule-stuff to Verant. They may tweak stuff and they may not, but leave it to them. I think they’ve done a wonderful job here. Yes, I know my bubble may burst later, but we’ll see when the time comes.<br>

Huh? This is in line with saying &quot;people are leaving FV in droves because they can't find a group.&quot;<br>
<br>
I use it all the time.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Perhaps having LFG default to on and you'd have to turn it off if you don't want invite tells would work&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I really hate this idea ... <br>
<br>
Just because someone is too clueless to turn on /LFG, too anti-social to strike up a conversation and make lasting friends, or too lazy to explore areas in order to find a group, doesn't mean the rules should be changed to accomodate them.<br>
<br>
Granted, I'm only level 19/20/19, but I've never had a problem finding groups in areas where I want to hunt. As I've leveled up, I've found good groups in most zones appropriate to my level: Crushbone, EC, WC, Nro, Oasis (of course) WK, SK, EK, HP, Runnyeye, Unrest, even Kurn's Tower (with other light elves) at level 15 while I was in Kunark picking up my Breeze spell. The only really consistently deserted place I've been to is Befallen. I'm guessing Najena is pretty empty -- but then again both of these places are always empty on crowded servers too.<br>
<br>
I'm not concerned. Do yourself a favor and learn to adapt to the new rules. They're fun.<br>

I aslo agree that it is a pain to put together a &quot;perfect&quot; group on other servers. For a short of time I would spend hours working on getting people there, getting the right classes etc.<br>
<br>
Then I realized that I never used to care about which classes I had and voila, it became easy to put together groups, we had a lot of fun and succeeded not due to having totaly superior firepower but due to good tactics. Very rarely died.<br>
<br>
The &quot;perfect&quot; group is not needed. Learn to cope with what you have :-) No class is needed I trully mean that.<br>
<br>
Almost any group of 6 can be made to work, with better mixes of classes there are even many groups of 2 or 3 that work in hard places.<br>

Sure, we could say, &quot;everyone should turn it on&quot;, but I assure you that any strategy that starts out &quot;if everyone would just&quot; is doomed to failure. What I'd like to see is more help in the UI for those that do make the effort -- the ones that use strategies that work; ie. people that say &quot;If *I* would just ..&quot;. The forced /anon makes grouping harder. If too many find it more pleasant to be asked (or to ask) class/level when hunting for a group, then let's keep /anon and find another way.<br>
<br>
A default LFG-on would help a ton. I'm not talking about a forced LFG, just a default for when you log on or when you leave a group. You could always turn it off again if you're a die-hard solo'er that never wants to group or to ever be invited into a group. Better still, put the default in the .ini file and let people customize it (start it out as on, though).<br>
<br>
If you are fighting in a partial group, you don't have time to check around for lfg people and lfg people have no way to pick you out as having spots open.  So, what I would dearly love to see, is a way for a group leader to put up an &quot;LFP .. looking for players&quot; to fill out a group. A searchable tag with &quot;/ all lfp&quot; would be a nice start, but details would be nicer eg. lfp 2 x 44-46 bard/sha/enc. <br>
<br>
A method to link up multiple groups for tells and xp during raids would be awesome, too.  If you've ever led a raid, I'm sure you've heard the&quot;my group isn't getting xp&quot; song from first one group then another as you try to balance things out. That and the inter-zone chatter can be hard to parse amidst all the other things going on. Pure-guild events help out a lot on that, but it tends to make the guilds very insular. It's also rough when you end up with 7 or 8 friends wanting to group. Be nice if you could tie them all together.<br>
<br>
EQ is so much fun for a group that a little effort in the interface toward promoting grouping would be an incredible win for everyone. I think it could be done with little effort and could be done in a way that satisfies everyone's RP concerns. Most importantly, it would help out all servers, not just FV -- the only changes that stand a hope of ever happening are those that would help everyone.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrayhateborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gray Hateborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/20/01 1:01:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not talking about ..</span><hr size=1> &lt;chuckles&gt; If you got a group complaining about not getting XP on a raid you got some people that dont know what a raid is.<br>

I had a very pleasant chat with Phiste on this subject and told him at the time that I wouldnt support this change.  With the benefit of added thought and standing back a bit - I still wouldnt support it.<br>
<br>
This server is ABOUT rp and rp is relationships - people who need pick up groups are people who dont form relationships.  People for whom a guild and a list of 20 friends and friends of friends are a wasteland.  <br>
<br>
Here and on my home server (where I am post 50) I group with my in-character friends and guild. I have been in pick up groups when I was in my 20s and 30s and still making those friends - and those were all organised through shout - not LFG - after those levels I didnt pick up at all.<br>
<br>
Phiste argued that it is hard to form guild groups with /role on - which really worried me about the level of community and communication in Resolution, as I told him at the time. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
All that said the sad fact that people left because the combination of anon and languages made finding groups very difficult is absolutely true.<br>
<br>
However - people leaving for that reason has definitley tailed off recently.  Still going on, but less so.<br>
<br>
Also I am seeing a sudden upturn in guild applicants - and the League now has a good balance of the available grouping classes.  I beleive things are settling down and we will have a low population and wonderful server to play on. <p>Lord Regent <b>Gray Hateborn</b><br>

My definition of a perfect group.<br>
A group full of fun people who know their roles. Idealy exp happens while you are having fun and you do not even think to look at the yellow bar because you are laughing or working too hard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think the more variety, the better. with 40 almost identical servers, it's nice now to have a *choice*. <br>
<br>
Also, all of the rules make perfect sense and are realistic. The purpose of /w is only to know who is in the zone. You don't recognize a name, why in heaven's name should you know his class or level?? You see him run up to you, you can now guess both from /con and his equipment/pet/etc. But still you can't be certain until he tells you. And what if he lies? Tough luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  His reputation will suffer. And yes, without being able to log out and 'hide' behind an alt, your reputation really means something here.<br>
<br>
I love the small population. I see the same faces almost every night. I always stop to chat with them, regardless of level differences. I've grouped with ridiculous level differences, just for the fun of exploring.<br>
<br>
I actually wish they would make it even more realistic and make /g listenable by all. I've always found it odd to come across a well-organized, effecient group, and not hear a single peep from any of them. Just silence.<br>
<br>
More difference is good! The quirks of this server will grow on you, eventually you'll log onto the 'normal' servers and find THEM odd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Was thinking on your post. Ya right, it is totaly insane to have every dungeon packed to the gills, with people sitting on the zone line waiting to join this spawn or that.<br>
<br>
Hell it is possible to work your way through a dungeon on FV without runing in to person after person whose insane cry spiked with greed drives you on &quot;Its my spawn, my spawn, go away GO AWAY&quot;.<br>
<br>
It has always bothered me when people shout camp check. Destroys the &quot;reality&quot; of going to a dungeon and hacking your way in to it, killing things that where there and did not just appear.<br>
<br>
Day dreamed about a way of stoping poping but damn its hard, any semblence of reality (mobs say coming from a keep) would just end up with people camping the door they come out of :-(<br>
<br>
So yes I love the low server population. Getting to attack monsters who normally never even get to exist for more than a second :-)<br>
<br>
I love FV.<br>

Well, the people i group with are about level 45-60<br>
and I know roughly 40 of them.<br>
<br>
Sure, removing anon for LFG would help getting more.<br>
but it would remove the flavor.<br>
<br>
Maybe making it optional to show class and level ?<br>

I think if someone comes to this server &quot;alone&quot; and does not join a guild is going to be at an extreme disadvantage unless they play one of the classes that can solo easily.<br>
<br>
Those of us that came with a group of friends (or whole guilds) or joined a guild are going to have much more fun because we will have less trouble finding groups. And yes, do go out and meet people, make new friends. The normal tools verant gave us to find groups don't work that well on FV.<br>
