Some memorable events that came up... <br>
<br>
** Disclaimer: All of these events took place within the first few months of EQ going &quot;Live&quot;. GM's were perhaps given more flexibilty back then when they wern't being abused so much ** <br>
<br>
1. A GM broadcast on Tunare encouraging players to play enchanters because no one realized how cool a chanter could be. <br>
<br>
2. I once lost my body to a bug in the mino caves in Steamfont. A guide and kept us company (for like 30 minutes) until a GM came and gave me my &quot;Leg up&quot; kit. This was a genuine bug that affected many players. <br>
<br>
3. I once &quot;misplaced&quot; my body in Dragnor's Cauldron and a GM couldn't tell me where my body was because it was in a &quot;player accesible spot&quot;, but he kept giving me &quot;hints&quot;  <br>
&lt;&lt; &quot;No, cold, cold..warm, warm HOT!!&gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
4. This one is pretty cool. I was to perform a marriage ceremony in the Elven tree city but missed the boat at the FP docks. I (not knowing any better as a newbie) /petitioned and explained the situation. I got a responce from a GM in like 10 minutes and he actually tported me BB!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5. The first Griffon being killed on Tunare and the first SG being killed. A guild known as the Stormravens organized a big hunt and slayed the first griffon in the EC tunnel. We had a GM turn out to watch (as well as tons of other folks) and cheer us on. The Stormravens went on to slay the first SG (i think) on the server too. Its funny because the event was so similar to a &quot;big raid&quot; but had much more drama surrounding it. Ahh to be a newb again  <br>
<br>
6. GM's that used to broadcast when dragons were slayed on a server for the first time. &lt;&lt;Guild &quot;so and so&quot; has slayed the mighty Vox! Three cheers for &quot;so and so&quot;!&gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
Anyways, I hope others can add &quot;happy memories&quot; to this thread. I'd luv to read them. By the way this isn't a slam against the GM's and guides. I fully understand (and sympathize) that they must follow rules themselves and must grow a thick skin to endure the constant abuse. <br>
<br>
That being said, please don't post any &quot;unhappy memories&quot;. I kinda want to keep this a positive thread. Thanks! <br>

<br>
I remember being so impressed by the items that the female elf GM wore who retrieved my corpse.  She was omnipotent a true goddess.  I would have died to get just one of the items she wore on her.<br>

<br>
Anyway, that's a positive story.<br>
<br>
The only other interaction I had with a GM was when I had to reinstall and I forgot to download the Warrens patch and I zoned into warrens and got stuck in the 'cat and numbers room' until a GM could get me out.  I petitioned, but since it was on the weekend during an odd time, About 3 - 5 hours and a couple camps later I got out.  It was a interesting room though.<br>

<br>
2. later on in life.. with the same character.. i was in befallen.. and gynok spawned and went to zone, killign evryone.. i ran to the zone, but i didnt zone.. i walked through where you hsould zone into a room filled with pictures of cats on the wall.. i petitioned.. and a gm came.. he then took me to the qeynos cat box.. i have no idea why..  but i had fun.. and got a free tp to a part of the world ive never been.<br>
<br>
3 when i was around 35ish.. i was going through sro on my way to guk. i came across the AC.. /w resulted in only 5 or so .. so i went to see if anyone had engaged him him.. he wasn't being killed, so i rooted him, and began nuking.. then some level 50ish necro comes over and sends his paet at him, and begins casting all sorts of spells.. I start /oocing for people to help me.. it turns out a gm was in zone.. he came over and moved the necro to a safe point in the zone.. which was far away. =) i got my jboots later<br>
<br>
4. during my agonizing camp for lord bergurgle.. i used the<br>
Deep&quot; exploit, so i could solo the camp easily.. before i got the hang of it though.. deep kept chasing the goblins away./. and i couldnt use her to my advantage.. i petitioned and a gm moved her back.. he did this a few times.. then we just hung out there.. we had a nice conversation, his real name was scott.. <br>

The GM came back with some line that there was a GM quest in the zone and that I had missed my chance to join it and get some uber loot of somekind. Later after a few tells, he admits that it was a hoax and said &quot;well GMs have to have fun too&quot; Fun like my boot up yer sorry ass?<br>
<br>
When I was camping ragefire for the last piece of my cleric epic, It took me 2 weeks of pure frustration to get naggy killed due to the lvl cap on killing him. He finally dies and just as I finished clearing the next FGs and start my camp, the lead GM comes in and broadcasts that the zone will be repoped due to some problem at the freeti. Naggy included. I begged and pleaded with him to leave naggy down, since I had spence a huge effort to get him killed, course I got a NO reply. The very next day as I was preparing another attempt at killing Naggy, the lead GM strolls up to my guildleader and asks if he wanted naggy depoped. I later learned that the GM and my guildleader had a great time together at one of the EQ conventions.<br>
<br>
GMs are like tits on nuns. Or like a one legged man in an ass kicking contest, you pick.<br>
<br>
Sorry Quil, but my dislike of GMs knows no bounds, and If i have ever had a &quot;good&quot; experience with a GM, I sure cant remember it.<br>

I think it was on the LT server. I was playing my enchanter and needed to buy some gems to fill an order. Unfortunately, the npc in the guild in Freeport was standing at the door instead of her usual spawn point further inside. When hailed, she replied she was busy so I /petitioned the problem. Not long after that, the GM shows up, a high elven lass in armor wielding a wicked looking sword. She said she had to kill the NPC to get it to repop and proceeded to attack it. The NPC gave the usual &quot;High Elves like you need to be dead&quot; message and killed the GM in 3 hits. I stood there stunned and sent the GM a tell asking what the hell just happened. She replied &quot;hehe, forgot to turn on invulnerability :P&quot;. I took a few screen shots of her corpse and sent them to the server's website for laughs. Lesson learned; GM's are human too. <br>
<br>
I have had nothing but good interactions with GM's, though I have seen more than my share of other's copping an attitude with the GM when they appeared and the GM getting annoyed. Personally, if you act like a spoiled ass, you should be treated like one. GM's have way more patience than I do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 10:27:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=972.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Far as FV is concerned....</span><hr size=1> GM's and guides alike have been reasonable and prompt as possible in answering petitions.<br>

<br>
Some GM's did not react so well to this. There were even a few instances of GM's abusing there powers. So, a set of guidelines was created for the GM's to follow and today most of them pretty much stick to those guidelines.<br>
<br>
I would really appreciate it if we could keep this thread positive. If anyone else has any good GM experiences they would like to share I'd luv to hear em.<br>
