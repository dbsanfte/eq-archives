This movement was largely started by the druid population, which thought that their class was useful for nothing but soloing and ports and started a very noisy campaign to get their class “improved”. This movement was termed “class balancing” and it is, I believe, responsible for many more problems than it sought to solve.<br>
<br>
The Vision (TM)<br>
<br>
The first major issue is that what VI and later SOE calls “The Vision” has changed so many times through the years noone really knows what the vision is anymore. It used to be known that there were soloing classes and there were grouping classes. The soloing classes could get good XP at the sacrifice of not being as useful in groups at higher levels. Likewise, grouping classes would find XP much harder to obtain but had the benefit of being needed at higher levels. This was the way it was – you chose your character with these attributes in mind. At some point the vision was changed. Some feel-good PC executive decided it was only fair that each class be able to log in and get XP in a short time by soloing or choose to group up and be desired in a long-term group. More about this philosophy later but this change in vision, I believe, is single-handedly responsible for a lot of the disparities we still witness between classes even though class balancing has been around for years.<br>
<br>
In the Beginning….<br>
<br>
VI created Norrath – they created the waters of the sea and the land and set the sun and Luclin to move above it. They set upon Norrath every manner of beast to kill to get phat XP and a wide variety of classes to play – each class distinct in its purpose and abilities. If you were around before the whole “class balancing” started, you would remember that each class was fairly well defined – Druids had nukes, ports and other spells, Shamans had slows, Mages had pets and nukes, Necros had pets and nukes, Wizards had nukes but better than anyone else’s…etc. Above this, each class had abilities and spells that were very different from each other. For example, Charm was the realm of the Enchanter as were mana buffs. Shamans were the kings of stat buffs. Necros could Lifetap. Mages had really wild pets. You knew if you chose a class that you would be really good at doing X but not be able to do A, B, C and D. With class balancing, that was about to change….<br>
<br>
Noone wants us….<br>
<br>
After a while, a cry was raised in the Druid and Ranger communities that their classes wasn’t very desired when it came to raids and guilds. They contended that their powers were so weak or so unnecessary that they were often overlooked for the holy 3 – Cleric, Warrior and Enchanter. The cry went up to improve their classes by granting increased effectiveness to their abilities AND new abilities. And so class balancing began…..<br>
My take on the subject is that the reason Druids and Rangers were finding themselves left out was not because they were designed so weak, but because everyone and their brother was playing them. Druids were always the Jack-of-all-trades class. They could do a lot of stuff but nothing really well – this appealed to many people right away, but when these people got higher in levels the fact that they were, infact, master of none really irked them. Rangers were drawn up to be the best class since sliced bread in the original EQ – track was such an appealing skill, I think Ranger was the #1 class people new to the game started. Sooo, with everyone playing Druids and Rangers, guilds had to put limitations on how many to take or end up being a guild full of Druids and Rangers.<br>
<br>
But I want to solo too…..<br>
<br>
From the beginning there were always solo classes and grouping classes. But at some point, someone decided that each class should have the ability to advance in the game by only committing a short period of time to playing and also without the help of anyone else. No matter that this went completely against the idea of an Online Multi-Player game where you would interact with others – I also feel that this was largely profit driven – to bring the game to working adults or busy people who could only devote an hour or two at a time to the game. So the idea was formed that each class should be able to solo to a certain extent and also be desired in groups. This was a change to the philosophy of many of the traditional solo classes and I feel really did more to disrupt class balance than it did to fix.<br>
<br>
I want it all…<br>
<br>
The idea to allow all classes to both group and solo well bred a way of thinking that would also make its way into each classes spell selection. For example – just recently, many people were complaining that, often, their guild or group was being held back by lack of Clerics (for the CHeal) and Shamans (for the Slow). For whatever reason, people weren’t playing these classes as much as others. So the solution was – instead of improving the abilities of those needed classes to entice more people to play, they passed these abilities off to other classes. Druids and Shamans got a gimped CHeal and Enchanters and Bards got a slow. To me, this seems ass backwards. You need more of class X in the game because of the abilities they provide so instead of focusing on improving class X, you just improve class Y and Z by giving them the abilities everyone needs. So you still haven’t solved any of the problems of why people aren’t playing class X and now you have 2 other classes that are even more desirable.<br>
<br>
This idea of “spreading the wealth” I think is the ultimate downfall of class balancing. Instead of having separate and distinct classes in the game that are valued for their unique abilities we now have classes that are almost exactly the same except for a couple things that make them special. Instead of balancing the POWER of each class to equal proportions and keeping them unique, they have effectively balanced each class to be almost exactly the same as one another in what they can do. Take pets for example. Used to be Necros and Mages got effective pets and chanters were just given a wimpy pet shield. Then Shamans were given doggy pets because everyone wanted pets back then because everyone thought they were cool. Later on, Druids complained and got their bear pet, later, Wizards complained and got familiars and their swords. Now, instead of having 2 pet classes that those who wanted a pet could choose from, now each class gets a pet – yay, pets are now not a defining factor for a class.<br>
<br>
My plea to Sony….<br>
<br>
STOP trying to balance the classes. That’s right – just stop. For a period of time, reevaluate the vision you have for each class – what makes it unique, what makes it fun, what makes it desirable or powerful. Once you decide this – run with it. Instead of seeking balance seek UNIQUENESS – each class desired because of its unique abilities. The POWER of each class must stay in balance but this can be done without creating classes that can do exactly the same stuff but on a sliding scale of who does what best. When I log on I want to play my Shaman, not my Shaman/cleric/mage/necro hybrid. If you want classes to be exactly the same just divide the world into 3 classes – melee, nukers and priests and be done with it. On the other hand, if you want variety, make each class unique again.<br>
STOP listening to customers and what they want out of their classes. Some people actually DO want it all – they are the ones that want to be the Fighter/Mage with Psionic Abilities and a Pet Tiger in paper RPGs. But this screws things up for the rest of us who accept our limitations and learn to live with them and enjoy the class for what it CAN do not what it CAN’T<br>
DO THIS NOW – before you get too far into EQ2. If I get into EQ2 and find the classes are the typical single player RPG characters that can cast spells, wield weapons and control pets – basically do it all – I for one am going to be very upset.<br>

<br>
Classes were Balanced pretty well Pre-Kunark, they have been struggling to adapt to their own changes ever since.<br>
<br>
Lower levels are still pretty Balanced, until you factor in the Gear that is available to them.<br>
<br>
Overall, all 'balancing' that has been done in the last year or two is just about extending EQs shelf life, and in that respect they have done a decent job.<br>
<br>
The main problem, im my opinion, was the Paradigm shift they made at the Kunark expansion when they changed from Class Ability balance to Equipment Balance.  Although they have continued to tweak spells and such, it is really through equipment that they have focused on.  In part because the Item Acquisition part of EQ is a good player retntion strategy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=plisklis>Plis Klis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.pacbell.net/m0rganj/smile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/24/03 11:52:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3087.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class Balancing = Failed</span><hr size=1> I admit i didn't read the whole 100 line essay her wrote above, but...<br>

<br>
When EQ was launched, the class balancing was done with .. exp.  Warriors had no special abilities, nor was their additional hit points as big a factor as today.  Everybody was playing hybrids as a result.  Heck they were so slow to understand it that they considered the addition of berserker rage (which was not doing critical hits / crippling hits - just an added ability to hit mobs successfully which was and is still barely noticable) to balance.  Then they added critical hits, more hit points, higher skill caps, with kunark they added defensive (although we can safely bet that it wasn't designed to be such a class staple as it is).<br>
<br>
Necromancers were king.. groups of 5 necromancers level 20 could kill sand giants in Oasis because dots landed no matter what and the pets were tougher and faster to cast than today. They got nerfed big time.<br>
<br>
Rangers in kunark were really gimp as they had very very low defensive skill (forgive me can't remember numbers) and they were getting aggro too easily, which made them unable to tank, also had the same offensive values as warriors.. basically nobody wanted to play one. They increased progressively defensive, offensive, added jolts, etc. In fact they were so off track that at first they just added jolt..<br>
<br>
Lacking time atm to go further but basically all classes went through this, today's the result of all this messing around and I believe it's fun even if very very very different than the game back then.<br>
<br>
Just a fast correction: Enchanters always had slow, they gained the spell clarity though as a compensation for the nerfing of &quot;Whirl till you hurl&quot; - and back then only bards had mana regen ability. <p>--<br>

Everyone could pretty much solo to a certain degree, and the xp patch was rewarding groups with stronger damage mitigation, making a low dps class like clerics more desirable in groups. Druids could substitute as a healer in most situations with their new CH, and pretty much everyone could play an important role. <br>
<br>
Grouping was rewarded, since if you wanted the very best xp you had to go deep in a dungeon such as juggernauts in sebilis, mines in chardok, castle in velk, cazic thule, rats in dragon necropolis etc... The mobs there were numerous and social, hard hitting and most summoned, making grouping pretty much mandatory. At the same time, &quot;imperfect&quot; groups and soloers could still operate effectively against low blue mobs.<br>
<br>
PoP totally changed that by destroying the solo ability of any class that can't solo without taking hits... but with mobs with low MR, giving insane xp, rootable, snarable, non summoning, it totally changed the grouping vs soloing balance that existed right before PoP, i.e. there's no point in grouping except for fun if you can solo, and if you can't, then you have to allocate at least 30 min and usually a lot more to get anything started.  <br>
<br>
In order for balance to be restored, first, minimal soloing ability must be restored for every class. I don't mean that every class should solo the same - not at all - but that everyone should be able to get &quot;reasonable&quot; solo xp in a gaming session. <br>
<br>
As far as grouping goes, there has to be a point for grouping. I don't know how to do this since basically 95% of what a group can kill in PoP can be easily soloed as well. One idea might be to revamp some zones and make them a lot tougher on the soloers by removing outdoor flags, make all mobs summon, make all mobs immune to harmony and lull, increase aggro range, and then double or triple the xp return.<br>

This might have been a witty comment if I had anywhere suggested what I wanted out of my class. What sucks about my posts is you actually have to read them.<br>
<br>
Anyways, for those that bothered to read, my gripe is more with the shift away from unique classes to classes that are patently the same with one or two special abilities. I do agree there are some power balance issues that must be fixed - but FIXED is the word. The current trend is to just heap on a few more additional abilitites and call the situation fixed when the original issue was never addressed. It's like trying to fix a shitty dinner with a second helping - quantity does not equal quality.<br>
<br>

<br>
-Druids, heh I think you are dead on here. The fact is that Druids and Rangers did, and still do make up the largest percentage of players, and thus their voice was certainly the loudest. Which other class could claim direct acess to the developers through their class forums ( as well as responses posted by developers in said forums ).<br>
<br>
-It is quite clear that the lack of Clerics along with Druid complaints regarding their usefullness in raids and groups led to Shamans and Druids receiving the lesser Cheals. This was also supported by most of the community who were frustrated by not having enough Clerics for raiding.<br>
<br>
-Kunark fucked things up good for a lot of classes, and really forced the developers to start taking class balance more seriously. The Necro class almost died out after Kunark. No one wanted to play a class where all you were good for was being a twitch bitch.<br>
<br>
-The problem with your idea of Uniquness is that there is only so much uniqueness that each class can have while still expanding the game. I still think PoP was the best expansion yet as far as implemenation and balance of new class abilities.<br>

Bah! I say to that. And Bah!, again.<br>
<br>
Why just last week I was in Qeynos Hills chatting with a level 2 ranger when he was attacked by one of those many wandering gnolls.  A very low level enchanter walked by and politely offered to mezz (or whatever it's called at that level) the mob so that the ranger could escape certain death.  <br>
<br>
Well I, being the ever-alert warrior that I am, immediately targeted the dying ranger and smashed my &quot;bind wound&quot; hotkey. And since I am not only ever-alert, but also obsessive about practicing my skills, a single bandage was able to heal all of his hitpoints!  BADDA BING!<br>
<br>
The enchanter, having seen this amazing display of healing power, says to the ranger, &quot;Oh, it seems you are in capable hands&quot; and to me, &quot;Many pardons, sir, I did not realize you were a healer.&quot;<br>
<br>
To all of you who doubt that warriors are balanced I say this, &quot;Bow down to my healing powers! and you, too, shall be saved!&quot;<br>

<br>
I understand what you’re saying Deldrach and I have been thinking about it also. As the game expands people want new stuff. You can’t have classes that have been around for 4 years only being able to cast the same 30 spells – eventually you have to expand or the class will grow stale.<br>
<br>
But it seems the way things are now, one of the ways SoE uses to “expand” a class is to grant that class abilities that overlap with other classes. To me, that is a double negative – you not only make both classes less unique, but the “new spell” you are getting is actually just a less-effective recycle of some other class’ spell. It gives the appearance of being something “new” with a minimum effort put forth in coding. I feel it is possible to keep the classes unique AND bring in fresh content by branching out into new concepts. These are the changes to a class that I would personally enjoy – being able to do new things that were still unique to my class. But I think this is one of the limitations of SOE when it comes to new things – not being able (or willing) to put more thought into design and concept. After all it is cheaper and easier to take a few spells, lower the effects, change the names and give them to another class and call them “new spells” than it is to actually design new spell concepts.<br>

I've seen far too many dumbass clerics getting group after group because hey, they're a cleric to think that making clerics the only class in the game capable of handling healing chores is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Required classes really only creates a game of haves and have nots.  You get groups based on the skills given to you by default in character selection, rather than on your own ability to play the game.  if you didn't happen to chose a character that has one of the oh so important required skills, then tough luck.  You'd better hope one of the golden classes feels pity on you and takes you in.<br>
<br>
IMO, the criteria that should be used in judging if classes overlap too much is if there are any classes that basically play the same.  ie, Paladins and Shadowknights play pretty similarily meleeing with the same type of weapons, tanking, and using spells to hold taunt and affect combat.<br>
<br>
How many other classes in EQ play as similarily as Paladins and Shadowknights?  Not really all that many.  <br>
<br>
Shaman, Druids, and Clerics can all complete heal, but do they all play the same way?  Not really.  Shaman are more buffers/debuffers, druids are more nukers, and clerics are your mainline buffers and healers.<br>
<br>
Shaman, Enchanters, Bards, and Beastlords can all slow, but do they play the same?  Not even close.  Bards don't play like any other class in the game.  Beyond slowing, shaman, enchanters, and beastlords fulfill fundimentally different roles in a group, and despite the similarities in role that enchanters and bards have, the way they execute it is vastly different.<br>
<br>
You can go on and on down the line, from nuking classes to DoTing classes to buffing classes to pet classes, they all play very differently.<br>
<br>
IMO, allowing players to have greater flexibility in their classes is a benefit, not a drawback.  If I want to play a healer, I can play one of three different types of healers.  I'm not just locked into being a cleric.  If I want to play a nuker, I again have the option of three different types, Wizard, Mage, or Druid.  If I want to play a tank, I can be a Warrior or Paladin / Shadowknight and get a different style of play as well.  The game doesn't pigeon hole me into a rigid template like Diablo did with its 3 character classes.<br>

<br>
a few people get together at a zone line and want to start up a group.  If classes are very specalized and unique, the odds that the group has everything they need in order to do the zone successfully is alot lower than if the classes have specalizations but can also fulfill other roles in a pinch.<br>
<br>
I think it's bad to have a mass of people having to stand at a zone line doing absolutly nothing because certain classes haven't shown up and they can't be successful without them.<br>
<br>
The clerics I knew were burning out on EQ because they were necessary and unique.  They knew that if they took a day off of playing, their group was hosed.  They knew that if they logged off early, the entire group was done for the night.  They knew that if they didn't feel like raiding, noone was gonna raid.  Anything that takes that kind of pressure off of the players is good, in my opinion. <p>-----------------<br>

Frankly, I haven't noticed a rarity of clerics on the server.  50+, after druids and rangers, I would posit that cleric is the most populous class.  That is not a scientific survey but is just based on what I have seen.  Perhaps I happen to know a lot of clerics.  They seem rare because every group always wants one.  There are 15 classes yet only 6 classes can be in any particular group.<br>

There is not a single thing in the game that references DPS, XP Penalties, % XP per Kill, or any of that crap.<br>
<br>
Players, in their quest to be bigger, stronger, more efficient, to kill and level as fast as possible, created the disparity.<br>
<br>
It was PLAYERS that created the Concepts of Camping, Pulling, Adds, Single Pulls, Feign Death Pulling and Chain Pulling.<br>
<br>
It was PLAYERS who decided that THIS was the way that EQ was to be played, and the Classes that fit that model, the so called Holy Trinity, were lauded, while others were left to the wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br>
<br>
VI, SOE, and the Devs, have made changes to the game over the years, in an attempt to make other Classes work in the PLAYER DERIVED strategy.<br>
<br>
Do you know why Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other P&amp;P RPGs don't have this problem?  Because the DM would bitch slap anyone who tried.  But EQ is a Game where the GMs are absentee landlords and the PLAYERS decide how to run the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 2379<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/24/03 2:59:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3087.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class Balancing = Failed</span><hr size=1> I should point out that the holy trinity was not cleric warrior enchanter.

<br>
Also, the classes pre-kunark were not balanced.  No one played rogues because they were so bad... no evade, backstab got agro every time and didn't do much extra damage anyway, couldn't sneak hide.  If you wanted damage, you got a wizard.<br>
<br>
After Kunark, rogues were overbalanced as they got those abilities, and evade removed them from the hate list entirely.  In addition, the rogue epic was introduced... suddenly everyone and their mother wanted to be a rogue.<br>
<br>
In Velious things were pretty balanced all in all... I'd say velious was about the golden age of class balance.<br>
<br>
In Luclin, suddenly rangers took off as a damage class... rogues dropped far behind.  Wizards could chain nuke with mod rods with impunity, while the boss mobs mitigated melee damage down to nearly nothing.  Focus effects shot damage up as well.<br>
<br>
In PoP, AoE rampage was introduced, and the pendulum had swung back to the pre kunark days, with casters ruling the show.  Often now rogues can't even get into the fight, as Rampage kicks them back to shooting with bows for minimal damage.  Currently, the 62 mage pet outdamages an average geared rogue at that level.<br>
<br>
The pendulum will swing back someday... it's just how balancing works.  But for a caster to say stop class balancing now... remind me to pickpocket ya!<br>

The main one is that VI/SOE seems to have designed the concept of the Cleric around the idea of a fat old Vicar who parks his butt on his horse at the back of the group drinking the ceremonial wine until it is time to roll up to a sitting position and see if he can focus on his prayers long enough to completely heal the main tank.<br>
<br>
(Yea I know – most of you Clerics do more than that – I’m just trying to be dramatic and a little funny here)<br>
<br>
I don’t know about you, but before EQ I thought of Clerics as holy warriors – silver mail gleaming in the darkness, wielding a gilded mace and banishing undead left and right with holy might while healing and protecting his comrades with prayers and spells of protection like that cleric in the Pools of Radiance book (man I read that such a long time ago too).<br>
<br>
I also think the way Clerics are described also contributes to it. It seems like the #1 class new players flock to are Rangers or Druids – my first character was a Ranger. The idea of being a powerful melee class and being able to track my enemies just sounded too cool to pass up (this was before Druids and Bards were given tracking). But just for comparison, I was reading up on that new FPS online RPG that people are beta-testing now (I forgot the name but it’s the one where you can drive vehicles around and man base turrets and form up in squads and stuff) – when I heard the “Cleric” class defined as someone who can go around the battlefield mending wounds and even putting people back together, I thought “Is that it? Boooooring….”. I think EQ suffers from the same – not very good press given to the priests and not enough that they can do.<br>

You are smoking crack.  Crowd Control was considered essential in Original EQ and Kunark Eras.  Old Sebilis groups were built around Enchanters.  Even in Lower Guk in ye olden days, it was all about Mez and Stack.<br>
<br>
Rogues became the Jacks added to the Queen/King/Ace of our Royal Flush, as melee power and Rogue damage surpassed the Mana fettered Casters.  Then once the 32K HP caps were lifted in Velious, Caster Damage became trivial in the long fights, and Crowd Control became less of an issue.  The Rogues surpassed the Enchanter, who once again became a Haste and Buff class.<br>
<br>
But indeed, the wheel is constantly turning as the masses decide who is to be loved and who is to be reviled.  Wizards got a repreive with Kunark, as their Lures were essential in encounters like Venril Sathir.  But all things pass and change as Players adapted new ideologies meet the new challenges.<br>
<br>
But it is Players who are responsible for this, because they are the ones that decide which strategies are used, and consequently, which classes are needed for that strategy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gherethfv>GherethFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#009900>Draconic Mod</font><br>
