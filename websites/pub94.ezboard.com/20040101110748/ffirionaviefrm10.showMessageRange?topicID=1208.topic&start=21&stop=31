The Necromancer entered a cave barely noticable from the outside world. In that hollowed out tunnel of cold stone and ill wishes, Morcrin approached two special &quot;assistants&quot; of followers of the Plague Lord: men without faces. The servants had cut away all the skin of their features, leaving only facial muscle and the maddness in their expressions. The blessing of the Plague Bringer kept them from dying of infection or from being hindered by the self mutilation. These two men were hunters and assasins for the cult of the god of disease and decay. <br>
<br>
&quot;Find the woman whose blood comes from this bottle.&quot; Morcrin said, as he let a drop fall onto the held out palms of the two assasins. Both of the faceless men closed their fists as if feeling the essence of Minru through her blood; their eyes closed while using their unusual abilities to track their prey. &quot;This woman may become....an unfortunate liability, one I cannot afford. Watch for her to leave her home. She has too many allies to attack her within the temple of shadows, although if you can find a way to enter unknown....then mutilate her quietly.&quot; Morcrin looked at the two ghastly men for a moment. &quot;You know the binding of the Plague Bringer keeps you from revealing any information should you be captured....&quot; the Necromancer paused. &quot;but if anything should happen to where you are captured alive....then you know what silent spell to cast to make things more...interesting for your captors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Out of the cave ran two horrid men, hunting for a dark elf woman by the essence of her blood. Two silent, faceless men with no fear and no compassion. Two men seeking not to kill Minru but worse, to cut away her sight and voice with magic blades and mystic disease. Disease no cleric could cure; a special &quot;kiss&quot; from the Plague Bringer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysticlioness>MysticLioness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Demon Damsel<br>

The feel of steel against her shoulder...<br>
The ungodly pain as the disease entered her body...<br>
<br>
Minru had gone out of the League of Shadows hall on her way to try to make contact with Meledi to gather more information on the state of her brother.  She had not gotten but a couple hundred yards away from the doors of the Shadows, just out of sight of the guards, when two hunters jumped at her.  They had the element of surprise, with one catching her shoulder and scratching her with the disease ridden blade.<br>
<br>
Holding herself up with every ounce of concentration, she turned to face the two, sending her spectral minion against the one that cut her, while draining the life from the other to sustain herself as the painful disease coursed through her body.  Vaguely aware of what was going on around her, she watched as the one that struck her ran with her minion giving chase.  She staggered back to the guildhouse, just in sight of the guards.<br>
<br>
Tears running down her face, she gasped...<br>

<br>
Minru!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*Her poxed eyes swirl as she searches the night, her left arm trembling madly as she stumbles out further, sniffing at the air...Skills inherited by her Father live within her plagued blood, aiding her to search...To track...To find.<br>
<br>
It is not long before she sees her...The one who has walked her through much since her own return to the shadows, and she runs over, crashing down upon her own knees crudely, looking over the body of one, watching as Minru gasps in waves of pain...*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Minru...What has...HIM!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*Her eyes widen in near horror, her mind racing as the other scent reaches her nostrils, her plagued body shivering in delight a moment, then thoughts of what is within the one laying before Katomi strikes her senses.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Come...I cannot watch you here, too many eyes are about...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*She picks up Minru, leaning her own head back and outstretching her trembling arm, mindful no part of herself that is consumed by the plague touches Minru's flesh, wary of the scent she has already picked up from this one. Keeping her as close as she can, she stumbles past the gates, hissing at the guards who try to take what she holds. Seeing the marred form of the plagued Tier`Dal, they back off...The stench alone from the plague warning enough.<br>
<br>
Carrying Minru's increasing weight as the plague takes over her form so unused to such tortures, her blood growing thick, Katomi knows she needs to work quickly and soon...Else Minru will perish. Daring a glance down, she can see the pox working over Minru's eyes...<br>
<br>
Faster! She stumbles faster down corridors, rushing down past the waterfall, hugging Minru tight to her...<br>
<br>
The guards have learned long ago to not keep the bars down as she approaches...The decay and pox heavy upon the air, burning their lungs long before she nears, the gates already being cranked open...Their dread of HIS touch mightier than the fear of the Hatred of the Dark Prince.<br>
<br>
Up over the waters, down and to the left, then a quick right...Minru's body begins to reek of the pox, nothing as strong as that which resides within the Backstabbing Poxbringer, but enough that it should damage Minru permanently if it is not aided quickly.<br>
<br>
Ducking into a seldom visited building, she falls into a wall that is guised for what it truly is...For what Katomi needs to do, she needs cover of silence and noise alike, a place where others seldom tread.<br>
<br>
The air is dank and thick with condensation, and chills come up her spine and that of Minru, who is beginning to be overcome by the shock to her system. Katomi looks up, poxed eyes swirling as the waterfall that hides them roars throughout the dying night. She lays Minru down crudely, searching for the mark...*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Pox upon them...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*She spits beside Minru's head...Steaming poxed blood splattered onto the cold, wet and slimy rocks. Something...Or someone...Has dared to take HIS name in vain and strike down one who has guarded over her for so long...One who is akin, if not by blood but only by name, to the Lord and Master.<br>
<br>
Fabric tears through tiny breaks in the waterfall's angry roar, as she uses her good hand to tear open the robe upon the mark. The wound is ugly to the sight, but to her...It is beautiful beyond belief. It resembles the earlier stages of her own pox, but she knows the stench, she knows what this will do if not properly removed. Her left arm trembling, she takes her stiletto out from it's sheath, steadying her arm with a prayer to HIM, her chewed and bloody tongue rolling over words that only shadowwalkers truly understand.<br>
<br>
As she speaks the incantation, shadows swirl around the blade, unseen by most eyes, steadying the blade. It is with this that she has been able to strike so true in the hunt with her hand in such condition as it is...Her two-fingered-thumbed hand holding the blade in an odd, yet strangely powerful grace, she plunges it down deep, as shadows swirl out and tear open Minru's wound.<br>
<br>
Minru's body arches back and the poxed blood sprays out, the moss-covered rocks being covered in a thin film. Bending down, nearly vampiric in motions, Katomi leans down and bites into the bitter darkened flesh, ignoring the gasping screams of her friend and ally as she begins to take the newfound plague into herself, taking deep draughts of the venomous brew.<br>
<br>
Her own back arches, but snapping sounds as bones crack, the frailty of her own body eminent as one of HIS plagues is passed into her, rushing through her own body, mingling in ways HE had not yet intended. As her arm begins to shake more violently, she tosses down her stiletto, taking deep gasps, her breaths nearly matching Minru's as she continues to lay there, exposed wound bleeding freely.<br>
<br>
Pulling Minru up to her, leaning her own back against the slick walls, she lets out a slight whimper, as the fresh welts upon her back begin to split, burst and bleed anew. She tightens her grip about Minru's form, her plagued arm wrapped about Minru's waist tight as it drips furiously of her own plagued blood. Taking her good hand, she brushes Minru's hair aside and continues the feasting of the poxed blood. Her teeth, long ago sharpened to points, tear more of Minru's flesh, while within the mind of the Poxed One, thoughts concentrate on shadowed words as tendrils come from her, carrying a very deadly plague, mixed with her own blood and that of...Something else. The tips of the shadowed pox drives into Minru's form almost like needles, driving deep as they seek their prize.<br>
<br>
Nails from her plagued hand dig deep into Minru's right side, as the arm continues to shake violently, her grasp deadly, knowing she cannot stop or her friend's life shall be forfit.<br>
<br>
The shadowed pox that drove down moves quickly within the fallen Tier`Dal's body, wracking her in ways seemingly deadly...The plague which HE, HIMSELF infected Katomi with, literally flies through Minru's shivering body, eating away at the plague that she was cut with.<br>
<br>
A scream sounds from this unseen place, sickening to it's very core. Through thousands of miles, the scream can be felt...Not merely heard...Momentarily stunning any shadowwalkers. Any who have ever passed her, smelled the stench of her plague, can feel her now, before the shadows become chilled, stilled...and bring the decay and death scents into the air.<br>
<br>
Katomi's head whips back as a burst of magics fly from her body, her skin tearing as the plague rends her nearly asunder, the dark magics that bind her Mother's blood to give her the form of the Tier`Dal are torn from her, her Half Elven form stretching and cracking as Minru's weight holds fast down upon her.<br>
<br>
Her own eyes open, and thick rivers of blackened ichor from both ends, as she tries to blink away diseased puss, so that she may see...Blinking through the mass, she sees Minru's body has become nearly gray with the pallor of the loss of so much blood...The plague has nearly been removed...But at what cost?<br>
<br>
Her head sinks down again, lapping at raw flesh to break open new vessels, taking draught after draught, her entire body begins to shake, and further blackened veins begin to riddle her own body.<br>
<br>
At one of the longer draughts, Minru's eyes flash open, some of the pale violet colour shining out like amethyst ice, a gasp coming to now parched lips which are nearly the pale colour of frosted spirits.<br>
<br>
Katomi holds still, biting down hard, a bone within Minru's collar splitting open as she draws deep of the final remnants of the plague...When the last drink has been taken, Minru's body falls into her, unusually light.<br>
<br>
Whimpers of pain come from her in the darkness...She MUST save Minru...She MUST keep to the Vows she once spoke to the Lord and Teacher Morgrist as she swore herself to serve, undying, to the League of Shadows, and it's Lord and Master...Gray Hateborn...<br>
<br>
Leaning back down, she swallows hard, letting all of the plague she has manifested and drunk trickle down...She then spits hard, trying to clear her mouth of all of it's remnants. Taking a pained, deep breath, she then bites down hard upon her own right cheek...The side not yet infected by the plague. Her mind spins, her world turns upside down and she bites down again, her mind a whirl of incantations and chants...Dark magics HE has not wished her to know, but somehow, tapped as the new plague rushes through her veins and body.<br>
<br>
Clean blood pours into Minru, bittersweet in the affects it brings to the Half Elf as her body trembles even moreso. Faster, and faster, the incantations fly, the shadowed words driving her clean blood into Minru, Fier`Dal and Tier`Dal alike being infused into the fallen one's body, sending reverberations down through her spine, up into her brain, the synapses nearly exploding as life rushes through her broken form.<br>
<br>
As seconds pass by like hours, more and more of Katomi's untainted blood pumps into Minru, the shadows working deep within her, mending diseased flesh into that of the unmarred Minru's form slowly becoming again something even Dominion couldn't resist...Else he find what brought Minru back to her former self...<br>
<br>
Another cry rings out, and Katomi's body flings back, the seizures of the plagues dancing wildly within her body, mixing, overcoming her as her clean blood weakens in the fight. As her own body is flung back, Minru's rolls to land near the edge of the waterfall, her struck arm dangling within it's ever-flowing downpour. What remains of any diseased blood flows down easily into the waters...The fish within the ponds twitching, then burning...So little of the plague doing so much. Spines begin to come from them, tainted, deadly...Diseased. The foolish Leatherfoot who continuously swims there gasps for air and begins to choke, a mass of bloodied spit pouring from his mouth as he takes a dangerous breath beneath the murky waters.<br>
<br>
Those within the Blind Fish watch in horrified awe...A bartender in training drops a 20 year old red wine that he was to take to To`Biath, as he watches the display of the venomous fish rip into the body of the treacherous Leatherfoot who cries out in the silences of the diseased depths...<br>
<br>
Back behind the waterfall, Minru begins to heal...As another, one who tries to strive for anything that will appease HIM and the Shadows, falls back, the seizures taking full over her now...Black veins offshooting all over her. No more screams come from her, the disease that was to torment Minru now in full effect in Katomi's failing body, a voice that was once sung out against the Light is voiced no longer...<br>
<br>
The stench of the plague quickly consumes the Commongrounds of the Dark City of Neriak...Guards and Guild Masters alike choke for breath from the very being of it...Some, those who worship HIM, nod slightly...Knowing HIS touch well.<br>
<br>
As Minru's body begins to repair and retire into a deep slumber of rest, Katomi's is shaken again as beasts from shadows begin to rise, lifting her violently thrashing body into the very wall itself, mumbling in words no one can understand.<br>
<br>
Minru rolls over, a pained moan escaping her lips from the torments of the eve. Katomi is nowhere to be found, the stench of the plague now only coming from the now poxed waters that border the Neriak Commons.<br>
<br>
Footsteps near...Another approaches.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><CENTER><TABLE>

She hurried to her side seeing the wound, she quickly looked over the rest of her body seeing if she was hurt anywhere else. Her silver orbs grew bright, scared she may loose her friend, she quickly bared her fangs and ripped open the flesh on her arm. Holding her arm above the wound letting her blood pour into the wound. Her mind raced...what happened? Will she be alright? Will my ancient vampric blood heal her wound enough? She shook her head trying to end her doubts. Her voice soft, warming and comforting she whispers~<br>
<br>
Minru, ussta abbil. Please respond...do not leave us. ~she held Minru close to her as she watched her wound begin to heal. A sigh of relieve that it had worked or at least helped some. Her wound closed and she gently brushed Minru's hair from her face, knowing Minru is still too weak to talk, she held her rocking~<br>

He stops to speak to one and learns that some sickness has the Priests busy this evening.  He nods and moves on.  While passing over the bridge he stops and looks down into the waters for a moment lost in thought.<br>
<br>
A sight catches his attention and he spies two women down by the water, holding one another.  He shrugs for its not uncommon for two lovers to meet near the waters like so.  He turns away only to stop when he hears...<br>
<br>
&quot;Minru, ussta abbil. Please respond...do not leave us...&quot;<br>
<br>
Minru!?!  He turns and stares intently at the two women... one wears a white robe... the one laying in the arms of the other.  He jumps down to the rock ledge and makes his way quickly to them, his booted feet upon the stone alerts the woman holding the prone Minru... Ezentari?  She looks up to him, blood dripping from her mouth and her arm torn open.  Minru lay unmoving, a slash in her shoulder... her face pale with a light layer of sweat and blood covering her.<br>
<br>
Ikatsui looks to Ezentari and then back to Minru.  He summons the divine magic of the Father to heal Minru.  Though the wound itself heals over... the magic seemed unable to penetrate the deep parts of the cut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Help me with her, we must get her to the Temple, there we can look into this wound and be away from any remaning danger here.&quot; With that he picks up Minru carefully holding her close.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Carry her and I will watch over you both from the shadows.&quot;  Then Ezentari slips into the shadows quickly vanishing from sight.<br>
<br>
As Ikatsui passes the gate guard to the commons they stand alertly as he looks to them hatred written across his features.  He ignores them as he makes his way to the Temple.  Along the way he watches Ezentari slip from the shadows behind a commoner who strayed to close to them, his body left in the rocks... only a husk of his former self.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the Temple he carries Minru to a small chamber with a bed and table.  He summons an acolyte to find the High Priest and to being fresh cloth, water and a robe.<br>
<br>
Turning back to Minru he pulls off her robe to look at the wound.  When the acolyte returns he cleans the wound and the area around it as Minru begins to stir.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any pain you feel Minru will be as easy as I can make it for you.  I wish to make sure the wound is not poisoned or festering inside.&quot;  He begins calling upon the divine for the magics needed to purify the body of poisons, of disease, of curses... as he finishes he tenderly looks over the wound.  He looks up, knowing that Ezentari is with them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something is not right... this wound has the marks of a disease that I do not believe I could have cured... but it is gone now.  Her body is healed though... but she will still be weak.  We need to find what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
Standing he moves across the room as the High Priest enters.  They speak softly then Ikatsui turns to Ezentari who slips from the shadows.<br>
<br>
&quot;I must go.  I am going to seek out some answers to this.  The Priests here will watch over and protect her and any here with her.  Ezentari... we will find out what happened.&quot;  Leaning in close to her he whispers... &quot;There are some components that the Priests will need in case this is the touch of the Lord Bert... of the Plague.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he leaves them be as the acolyte moves in to clean Minru and dress her in a clean robe.<br>

The dead do not tire. <br>
The dead do not waver. <br>
The assasin leapt up onto the branch of a nearby tree, hearing the hiss of the undead abomination below him. The assasin, his skinless lips curled into a smile in the face of his death, leaped onto the skeletal beast. Bone clashed against steel blades. Undead claws raked through skin and into bone. Maggots poured out where blood should have been. The assasin's ribs were cracked and ripped from his body as he still fought...laughing in the face of the skeletal death. His blades carved through bone and magic holding the servant together, but his skills were not enough. <br>
Maggots crawling; flesh tearing; insane laughter of the assasin echoed in the air as he died. The skeleton's bone hands crushing his throat. The maggots crawled up the boney frame and began to devour. The undead servant looked at it's own hand, swarmed with small, white worms eating away, with a form of curious intelligence, as it's body was eaten by the magic of the assasin, by the maggots he had for blood. In the stillness of the moment, bones no longer supported by Minru's magic, turned to dust. The maggots, the life blood of the assasins, faded away as if from a living dream.<br>
<br>
Dreaming in the darkness. Memories or delusions of a life &quot;better lived&quot;? <br>
Honor. <br>
Nobility.<br>
 A light shinning inside, equal to the rays of sunlight falling through yellow and brown leaves. Now a light dimmed and swallowed by inner darkness. The past is just a dream. Sometimes a nightmare for those who know they can never go back.<br>
Morcrin awoke from his sleep in the dread of the underground lair. His grey eyes still seeing the faded memories of a past life. A life he knew existed....but as a fairy tale in the back of his mind. A sad song haunting him. The darkness and night was his life now. So many dead because of him...and he felt nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dreaming again...&quot; said the low, gravely voice of Malga Syn, the troll who should never have existed; could not have existed, yet there he was. Real as any horror who ever lived. A troll who learned the arts of the Necromancer. Not a Shadow Knight but a true Necromancer. <br>
&quot;Is your ..failure...to convince Minru that &quot;We&quot; were the threat, to make her confide in you....distressing you?&quot; The troll smiled with yellow, shark-like teeth. His tone was not too sarcastic. He was far more powerful than Morcrin yet gave the younger Necromancer a small, only a small, measure of respect. Morcrin had the ideas, Malga Syn, Black Vach and Pretty Mary were the power. Although this time, Malga argued about the plan. He considered Morcrin's plan to manipulate Minru, to be too difficult; too involved. Malga preferrred simple plans with the red of blood added in.<br>
 <br>
&quot;...No&quot; Morcrin said simply, his voice low. He neither cared nor could be concerned with anyone's idea of him &quot;failing&quot;. His opinion of himself was all that mattered to him, not other's ideas. The young Necromancer arose and cleaned himself from a nearby waterbowl. When he looked up; water running down his face and long, grey hair; his eyes were distant. &quot;Only dreams...&quot; Morcrin put on the funeral shroud he used as a cloak and hood. &quot;Tell Black Vach that he must hurry and use the blood of Minru to find out more of what she knows. Any link, whether by blood or by association, is a link to be used...&quot;<br>
<br>
Black Vach took the vial of Minru's blood into a ceremonial chamber of bones and cracked, dry, earth walls. Unaware of the poison within the blood of Minru. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A> at: 12/11/03 1:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysticlioness>MysticLioness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Demon Damsel<br>

Darkness surrounds her as she fights for each breath.  Confusion, distortion, pain, fear, and constant agony are her only companions.  For a moment, she is vaguely aware of another holding her, of knives and teeth, of blood flowing freely away from her.  She slips from consciousness back into the void as she experiences the white-hot, searing pain.<br>
<br>
Dreams come in this fitful state, or perhaps nightmares.  She sees herself standing among the stars, a vast purple rolling horizon ahead of her.  Lightning flashes in the sky and the rain beats hard upon her.  She lives in this dream as a servant of the Plague Lord, wracked in pain.  Boils cover her body, puss flows from her, as the skin begins to crack and bleed.  She hears him calling her name, beckoning her to his side.<br>
<br>
The crack of the bone in her collar brings her back into consciousness; she screams and nearly passes out from the pain.  Colors and images flash and blur in her mind… the darkest black… the comforting arms of death… deep reds… a pool of blood… complete whiteness… a sacrificial altar with her upon it… deep purple… someone, a friend, helping somehow.<br>
<br>
For the slightest moment, there was clarity in the confusion.  Katomi was here.  She was helping… healing her somehow, in ways that did not make sense.  The pain lessens, but the deep sense of coldness remains.  Sleep overtakes her, as she focuses on the sounds of the waterfall.<br>
<br>
Others come to her mind, but whether in a dream or in the flesh, she does not know.  She hears Ezentari’s soft voice asking her not to leave.  She hears Ikatsui speaking of a temple and healing.  There were others too, speaking words of concern, of caring.  People she holds dear to her… they were there with her, if only in her mind.  She hears Kazanti… Megwetch… Mycen… Persephoria… she wants to return to them.  She even hears voices of people she does not know, speaking of finding who did this to her.<br>
<br>
She awakens from the void, weak and trembling, in the temple under the care and protection of the Priests.  She sits up slightly and whispers as they look on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Katomi... where... how... is she?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysticlioness>MysticLioness</A> at: 12/11/03 4:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=persephoriafv>PersephoriaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Malevolence<br>There are two kinds of<br>Pedestrians...<br>the quick and the dead<br>~Magically Malicious~</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/03 6:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams in the Dark </span><hr size=1> The still form of Guard D'Vrinn lie in her arms, his flesh damp as the fever seeps from his pores, the pox struggling to keep him firmly within its diseased grip. How weak he seems, stripped of his armor, his weaponry; shaking like a newborn kit as his poxed eyes flicker into Persephoria's clear amethyst gaze, imploring her to help him. Her fingers dig painfully into the hard muscle of his upper arm as she holds him, for she holds now the very bastard who brought her the false news of her husband's death.<br>
<br>
D'Vrinn's head in her lap, her arm about his shoulders, cradling him as she stares into his young face, wondering who has corrupted him at such an age.. filled his naive mind with dreams of power, prestige, and then, betrayal. She exhales heavily as her fingers find the edge of her gown, parting the folds, seeking out the slit along her thigh. Her fingertips brush against her smooth skin and then onto the hardened leather strap of the sheath which holds her dagger. The very dagger her husband had gifted her with right before his disappearance. As she begins to draw it out, she hears familiar voices carried to her through the hallway.<br>
<br>
Ikatsui.. she was not surprised when his voice reached her ears. He often served alongside her within this very Temple. However, what was Ezentari doing with him? Curious, she moves her hand away from the hilt of her blade, smoothing her gown back into place and lowering the head of the the sickened guard to his pillow. Ignoring his cracked lips parting in a plea to her to ease his pain, she rises from his bedside and starts for the door. She pauses, her hand on the knob and looks back to the dying guard as his body began to twitch, the pox taking stronger hold. She smirks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I will deal with you later.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Passing through the doorway and out into the hall, she follows the sounds of Ikatsui and Ezentari's voices, leading her deeper into the Temple. She turns a few corners as she finds herself in the wing leading to the High Priests themselves. And then, she can hear the voices no longer. Have they gone? She continues on, searching. As she rounds the last bend, she spies a familiar form upon the dias. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Minru!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Upon closer examination, Persephoria notes that her friend has been prepared for a great healing ritual, no doubt by the Acolytes of the Temple. Her eyes travel along Minru's prone body, taking in the arcane runes placed about her, the ceremonial gown. As her eyes travel upwards along the pleats in the robe, and into the face of the young bone dancer, she sucks her breath in sharply. The pox! HE has done this to her. But why? <br>
<br>
She crosses to Minru swiftly, wrapping her arm around her shoulders in much the same manner as she had so only recently held the traitorous guard. However, there was a difference in the embrace, this one kind, loving, if she could yet be capable of such a thing. She brings her hand to Minru's face, lying it against her cheek for a moment before smoothing back her dark tresses. Noting that Minru is struggling to speak, she leans in closely, bending her head so her soft voice carries easily to her ear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Katomi... where... how... is she?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Oh no.. not Katomi. Closing her eyes, she sighs heavily, trying to comprehend just what was happening to those she cares for a great deal. Minru.. and what had happened to Katomi? Where was she? And, how was she? She does not have the answers, and so she simply frowns, squeezing her hand gently and shaking her head.<br>
<br>

Looking over at the weakened form of Minru, he silently prayed for her recovery.  He'd not strayed far from her side after hearing of her injuries, and cursed himself that he could not prevent it.  Twice he'd changed her bandages as she slept, and healed her wounds further with his own essense.<br>
<br>
As she awakens he places a gentle hand on her shoulder, letting her know of his presence, a look of deep concern on his face as he feels her trembling. <br>
<br>
He smiles softly and sighs in relief as Persephoria entered and embraced Minru, bowing his head in greeting.  He looks over at the altar of Innoruuk and sinks to one knee, giving his thanks before returning to her side... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1208.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1208.topic&start=41&stop=50>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1208.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1208.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=31><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
