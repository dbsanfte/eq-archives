It was a dark forest much like his home, it was full of dead elves and confused youngsters. The journey here had been nothing short of harrowing and he truly resented having to hide below decks when the ship had docked at Sister Isle. The journey back would not be as difficult.<br>
<br>
He moved carefully an invisible predator looking for prey. It did not take him long to find it.<br>
<br>
Shantira was playing with her friends. They had traveled farther than they had intended, but even at their tender age they knew enough to keep the Orc scouts at bay and the pixies had learned to flutter away as quickly as possible when they saw the gaggle of Woodelven youths descend from Kelethin.<br>
<br>
The danger of moving out beyond the borders of Keletin proper was intoxicating. The tales of danger and adversity hammered into them by their parents seemed unrealistic and childish. After all they knew better than to get too close to Crushbone where true danger lay.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately a very old danger had come to the Faydark on this day.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was frustrated. He had wanted a high elf, their skin was so perfect, so white and without blemish, but his mother had informed him that particular skin was reserved for royal correspondence. He had been patiently following this gang of brats as they stumbled through the forest. At first he had feared the retaliation of the guardsmen, but he learned from observation they were too intent on the dangers they could see, the wasps, the pixies the orcs.<br>
<br>
This group had slowly moved away from the guardsmen and their platforms, it was time to strike.<br>
<br>
Shantira saw the Teir’Dal appear out of nowhere, at first she thought it was one of her friends playing a joke and she laughed. Her other friends saw it too, they ran screaming into the woods, scattering like a flock of starlings surprised by a hungry cat. She tried to run, but she couldn’t. Fear rooted her to the spot.<br>
<br>
“You will do fine.” Maelgroth said in Teir’Dal. He had acquired a body bag in the Plane of Knowledge particularly for this caper. He stuffed the mesmerized child into the bag and disappeared with a flicker of magic.<br>
<br>
“Whats in the bag?” Poyson asked laconically. She was also a newer recruit into the League of Shadows, though she was a much more accomplished necromancer. She had spotted Maelgroth as he gated back to the League’s headquarters.<br>
<br>
“Something I picked up for an experiment.” Maelgroth huffed, he was tough for a Teir’Dal but his guest was beginning to shake off the effects of the spell.<br>
<br>
“You can find entertainment here in town, you don’t have to go out for it.” Poyson replied, twitching her white robe so it better complimented her charms.<br>
<br>
“Well, I will keep that in mind…” Mael replied hurriedly. He had considered visiting the slave marts, but was afraid house D’Vir would be watching them to see who procured an envelope of the appropriate age. Paranoia was the master of convenience in this case. He hurriedly slung the twitching bag over his shoulder and shuffled off to his quarters in the basement.<br>
<br>
His new quarters would serve him better than he expected. He had learned there was a large suite available in the basement. No one wanted it, mostly because a Shadow Knight of Bertox had held it for her quarters for years. Mael had no idea what to expect when he opened the door. It was surprisingly clean, except for a few lizard scales near the wardrobe. Still he threw everything out, and had servants wash the walls down with boiling water.<br>
<br>
“Look what I have brought you!” Mael shouted as he entered his quarters. The family chest had attatched itself to one of the corners. He heard his mother coughing in the back. He headed towards her position in the small laboratory he inherited, many of the beakers were made in Qeynos and were quite sturdy, but they did lack the delicacy of the work done here in Nektulos. It would suffice.<br>
<br>
He reached into the bag and dragged out the terrified girl.<br>
<br>
“Be glad, for on this day you will aid in our rebirth!” Naelaelayle whispered in elvish.<br>
<br>
Shantria screamed for help. This was her worst nightmare, captured by Teir’Dal. All the childhood tales, cautionary stories really came back to her. The two elves, the young male and the old female laughed uproariously.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth moved to strike her, but was prevented by his mother.<br>
<br>
“You must not bruise the skin. I has been a while and I might need a lot.”<br>
<br>
The elderly Teir’Dal turned to the captive. “If you do as we say, my son will return you to your home.”<br>
<br>
Shantria had heard about Teir’Dal mercy. “My mother is a famous ranger, she will track me down, she will kill both of you.”<br>
<br>
“How nice.” Naelaelayle said distractedly. She was looking for a particular flaying knife, one developed specifically for this kind of work. “Strap her face down on that table.”<br>
<br>
Shantria fought as hard as she could but the Teir’Dal were too strong for her. Soon she was immobile on the table.<br>
<br>
“Let me clarify, I am old, and this will be hard enough to do without you twitching all over the place and ruining my work.” Naelaelayle cut away the back of Shantria’s dress, revealing her unblemished back. “If you are a good girl, you will live and have an interesting story to tell your friends. If you are a bad girl…” She held the knife in front of her like a sword.<br>
<br>
“I will do nothing to help scum like you, when my mother gets here, I will be sure to have her let you live so you can always remember who destroyed your family!” She heard the young one casting a spell, then recalled nothing.<br>
<br>
“I will restore the spell as often as necessary, mother.” Maelgroth growled. The girl was rigid in her bonds, her mouth open in a silent scream.<br>
<br>
“It is a shame we will have to do this work without music.” His mother replied. She removed a tiny skin drying rack from the family chest. Carefully she began to stitch the girl’s back to it. When she was done it lay flat tiny threads reaching from the bone rim into the skin between her shoulders.<br>
<br>
“Hand me the crystal knife and the ink.” Naelaelayle’s voice was taut with stress. This would be the most difficult part. Delicately she began to make tiny incisions into the skin, pulling the freshly cut flap back and then inking the wound. The knife which began the process as clear crystal, absorbed the blood like a sponge, slowly turning a dark pink color.<br>
<br>
The tattoo process took hours, interupted occasionally by the screams of the girl or his mother having to take a break for her aching hands. The work was exacting and after a few characters she would have to stop to keep her fingers from trembling uncontrollably. <br>
<br>
“Now comes the tricky part.” Naelaelayle panted. She tightened the threads on the rack, pulling the girls’ skin taut. Carefully she cut the patch of skin loose from her body. The properties of the knife were such that the flesh did not realize it had been cut. Blood pulsed through the patch on the rack, now adorned with the reply of the Waes’Harventhars to house D’Vir.<br>
<br>
Shantria was in agony, the elaborate torture the two elves put her through was terrible. At least the pulling sensation on her back was gone now. She was startled when the young one released her from the table.<br>
<br>
“The spell will last as long as she lives, be sure that she lives long enough for the letter to be delivered.” The old one hissed. She was carefully scraping away at the skin on the rack in front of her. As the crystal blade stroked the hide, Shantria felt a peculiar scraping on her back.<br>
<br>
She turned about in horror, unable to see what had been done to her.<br>
<br>
“You wish to see?” Maelgroth said eagerly. He held up a mirror.<br>
<br>
Shantria saw her back, it was missing a patch of skin about four inches square, the skin was just gone, exposing the bone and the flesh underneath. She knew she should be crazy from the pain, but instead all she felt was the pricking on her back, in time with the work the old Teir’Dal was doing with the rack.<br>
<br>
“What have you done to me!”<br>
<br>
“You are a note, isn’t that special!” the old one enthused, turning the rack so she could see the writing on the patch of skin. Her skin.<br>
<br>
“Well that makes this next part easier.” Maelgroth said, stuffing the unconscious girl back into the sack, she had fainted on seeing the RSVP.<br>
<br>
“Remember if she dies, the note is ruined.”<br>
<br>
“I have already taken care of the details. She will be found by some of the lightbringers who hunt the guards in the forest.” Maelgroth replied, cloaking himself and shadow and shuffling out of the room.<br>
<br>
The next day a package was delivered to House D’Vir. It caused quite a stir. It was, however, delivered to Nystyre unopened. He could tell just by looking at it, what house had sent this reply. Carefully he picked up the note. Other houses had sent theirs, occasionally accompanied by small gifts, written on parchment, vellum and rarely tanned wood elf skin. This one stood out from all the others. It was still warm to the touch. <br>
