<br>
Going to call you Zid just for the sake of making it easier on myself...<br>
<br>
Zid, one thing honestly worries me and I hope I can convey this message somehow.  The fact that you know EQ is a social game, with real life people on the other side of those toons you steal from in no way deters you from stealing from them.  The fact that even when you become aware that these very same people are upset in a real life manner does not stop you from further thievery.  That alone speaks volumes to me.  Your argument that it is just a game morally ends when you discover that real life feelings are being stepped on.<br>
<br>
Not only do you not seem to care for these real life feelings, you laugh at them, hold them up for ridicule and tell the world of Firiona Vie that you are better than those people who you are hurting simply because you hurt them.  You tell everyone who reads this forum that it is ok to steal from them because it is a game.<br>
<br>
You seem to be very intelligent, and this actually bothers me... you are intelligent enough to understand that anything that creates real life feelings to the extent that your actions have is, indeed, a real life action.  And simply because you do not feel it is wrong does not make it right.<br>
<br>
I think that is the true key... you have yet to develop a sense of truth that lets you know that you are not right about everything...that there is much in the world you do not understand, and that morally you are responsible for the feelings you provoke in others.<br>
<br>
From what I have read I understand that you have a religious tendancy.  I struggle with your ability to cut a clean line down the middle of  what your God would approve of. and what He/She would not.  I am not certain what god you follow, or what beliefs you have (other than you feel homosexuality is wrong)... but for the life of me I cannot imagine a God who would approve of hurting these innocent people regardless of if it is pixels or not...the feelings are real, the person behind the toon is real...the thievery is real in that aspect if in no other.<br>
<br>
At some point in your life you have to stop hurting people for your own entertainment...it is truly morally depraved to gain enjoyment from anothers pain when the other person is not gaining the same enjoyment.  I find that a common sense rule in life.<br>
<br>
You have a thick skin, the insults from these people tend to roll right off your back. You may even feel some sort of superiority to them.  I see the truth of it though...and if you want to talk feel free to send me a message.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about the logic behind believing you can separate morals from here to there, the common sense behind believing God doesn't care if you cheat this person because it is only a game.  Personally I see no logic or common sense in those beliefs.  I try to live on the Golden Rule, and I certainly would not want someone trying to rip me off in game or out.<br>
<br>
On you Role Playing a &quot;bad guy&quot; ...sorry, I have to say that you have crossed the RP line if that was your intention.  I play an evil character...she steals, enslaves, lies and cheats to get what she wants.  But I have never actually stolen anything from someone in game...it is all RPd out.  I have never actually cheated someone...it is all RPd out... you get the idea I am sure.  RP is what most of us enjoy, many of us have been RPing in one form or another for many, many years...and what you are doing is not role play...I stand strong on that belief.<br>
<br>
Please, think about things...you are hurting yourself whether you know it or not.<br>
<br>

Ok, so tell your sister to come here so I can have a friend of mine here see if she knows jackshit about biochemistry, you still cannot prove that she is, so let's see some proof.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I could go cite you the link or photo copy my scores with my name or cite the article where my sister got published, but #1 stalkers = bad #2 you wouldnt believe me #3 I dont care what you think, I simply present what I am to you to prove you wrong on your biased assumptions of who I am, and your disbelief proves me correct.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

*cough* Or I could just run the search engine from the college board here at my college dumbass and look up SAT scores from Corona is it?  Let's see, Corona scores of 1300 with the 67 and 63 you got , and your first name:  Answer 0, no finds at all dumbass,explain that one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh BTW you mentioned the 35yr old live in mom's BASEMENT, needle dick etc so the burden off proof on that is on YOU.  Oh so is the dumb and ugly thing. Go for it <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I never said anything about 35yr olds , and neither did you.  You live with your parents, nobody said anything about basement except you.  It's clear that you're compensating for something and keep bringing up manhood so there is my proof for needle dick.  Oh and the dumb thing, the proof is in the posts dumbass.  The ugly thing: You posted your fucking picture dipshit.  There's my proof asshole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You guys sound like a broken record <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

We may very well sound like one, but so do you.  You feel the need to lie constantly about your life, and when we ask you to prove it you cannot.  But you just keep bringing it up like we're supposed to be impressed?  My gym socks are more intelligent than you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well you keep replying obviously you do care.

<br>
You keep replying too, or did you not notice that?  And you aren't venting, you're just being a dipshit.  You can laugh all the way to hell for all I care.<br>

You are morally bankrupt.  You do not roleplay, and you certainly do not roleplay the bad guy, you roleplay the village idiot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Im straight edge.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Obviously a dull blade.<br>
<br>
And finally, let's have your sister answer some questions for me about biochemistry?  Hmm? If she has any sort of college training in the field she should be able to answer the following quite easily.<br>
<br>
What role do calcium ions play play in the conversion of electrical impulses into chemical signals in the synapses?<br>
<br>
What is the base structure of the most common mammal sugar?  And what enzyme is used to break this structure down?  And which operon is the coder for this enzyme?<br>
<br>
Explain Excitatory and inhibitory synapses touching on why EPSP is called EPSP, as well as IPSP on the flip side.<br>
<br>
What was the hershey-chase experiment, and upon what did this experiment touch topically?<br>
<br>
What is the modern basis for gene therapy, i.e. what structure is used to execute the process of genetic therapy.  How is this technique possible, and what has been the most recent development in this field?<br>
<br>
There, I'm sure you're sister can answer those if she has university level biochemistry training, even more so if she has been published.  <br>
<br>
And for those that read this, you get a cookie.  But not you Ziderax, you get a swift kick in the ass.<br>

<br>
What you do is violation of the play nice rules. You do not play nice.<br>
<br>
Saddly as Ssivari said you do seem to have some intelligents<br>
unfortunatly being intelligent does not make you smart, and you have proven time and time again in your posts that you are not smart.<br>
<br>
You claim that you steal harmless pixiels in a game therefore it is not really stealing and you are not causing harm, you are full of shit. You are stealing peoples time, real life time.<br>
<br>
Not everyone can play hours on end, some people can only play a half hour a day, that plat/pixel that you stole from someone may have been saved up over a course of months,<br>
<br>
It is not your right to judge what that person choose to do with THEIR time in order to play the game fairly and aquire those pixels, like myself you have NO RIGHT to decide what another does with their time.<br>
<br>
Time is real, you steal it from another you are a REAL thief.<br>
The setting does not matter.<br>
<br>
Your actions and posts prove that you are a piece of shit.<br>
<br>
You have put yourself into this community of us that play Everquest on the Firona Vie server, no one invited you.<br>
You are only what the community sees and judges you as, by your actions.<br>
<br>
Look around you have been judged, you have been found guilty of being as they say here in the soap box as a fuckmitten, your arguments are weak and elementry.<br>
<br>
Everyone in this community agrees that you are wrong,<br>
not the cliques, not certain people, EVERYONE.<br>
<br>
You cannot supply one person who will say that you are in the right.<br>
<br>
No one will stand up for you, you are not wanted here.<br>
<br>
If you are truly what you say you are, a good person in real life<br>
and are intelligent enough to undertsand that WE the community do not agree with or support the actions that you do in OUR community in anyway, go look in the mirror and ask yourself why do you bother.<br>
<br>
It makes you look small no matter how you argue it, it makes you come across as a sad person full of denial. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/tgsuicide/rebelle.jpg "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--> <br>

However, saying that, people such as Rebelle and Ssivari ROLEPLAY the evil in their characters, you just state you play a bad guy to justify to yourself what you are doing.  Your character is just a manifestation of the things that you cannot get away with in your small, sad and truly pathetic life. <br>
<br>
We create our characters to consciously or sub-consciously express some portion of ourselves.  We imbue that character with traits and qualities that enable us to express that portion and then we act according to the nature of the character we have created.  So, tell me, moron, what does that say about you?<br>
<br>
You scam people, with no though or regard to how they will feel afterward and then you laugh about it..... You do not get much lower then that.  As for EQ being just a game, true it is, but the people you scam have spent a lot of time and effort getting the pp to be able to get what they want for their character, just to have some fuckwit who would be better suited to life as a unintelligent, inanimate object come along and take it. This in itself points out the amoral and sadistic side of your nature.  Amoral = you have lied and stolen from the players of FV.  Sadistic = you have then laughed in their faces and boasted about it, causing them anger and grief.<br>
<br>
You are a disgrace to the FV server and to this board and as has been mentioned previously, are a walking pile of useless DNA.  I do hope that natural selection starts working again (it seemed to have missed you) and that any misbegotten offspring you have either die of shame at having you as a parent or don't actually make it to birth.<br>

Apparently you don't realize that you cannot keep your scores private from the College Board, they administer the test, and provide your scores to colleges world wide, i.e. I can go to the UoB admissions office computer, and look at your scores, and the scores of your family members if they have taken it, since you have already given me all your RL information.<br>

<br>
Answer #1:  Calcium Ions act to stimulate the synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and spill the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft by excocytosis.<br>
<br>
What is the base structure of the most common mammal sugar? And what enzyme is used to break this structure down? And which operon is the coder for this enzyme?<br>
<br>
Answer #2: C6H12O6, in mammals commonly found in lactose (glucose+galactose), the lac operon is the coder, while the enzyme is commonly called the Lac Enzyme.<br>
<br>
Explain Excitatory and inhibitory synapses touching on why EPSP is called EPSP, as well as IPSP on the flip side.<br>
<br>
Answer #3:  An excitatory synapse, the neurotransmitter receptors control a type of gated channel that allows NA+ to enter the cell and K+ to leave the cell, because the driving force is greater for the NA+ than K+, the effect of opening these cannels is a net flow of positive charge into the cell.  This depolarizeds the cell, moving the membrance potential closer to the threshold voltage and making it more likely that the postsynaptic cell will generate an action potential.  Therefore the electrical change caused by the binding of the transmitter to the receptor is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential, I.E. EPSP.<br>
<br>
An inhibitory synapse, binding of the neurotransmitter molecules to the postsynaptic membrane hyperpolarizes the membrance by opening ion gates that make the membrance more permeable to K+, which rushes out of the cell, or to C- which enters the cell due to a large concentration gradient,  These ion fluxes push the membrane potential to a voltage more negatice than the resting potential making it more difficult for an action potential to be generated.  I.E, inhibitory postsynaptic potential, IPSP.<br>
<br>
What was the hershey-chase experiment, and upon what did this experiment touch topically?<br>
<br>
Answer #4:  A: Mix radioactively labeled phage with bacteria, the phage infects the bacterial cells. B:  Agitate in a blender to seperate phage outside the bacteria from the cells and their contents. C:  Centrifuge and measure the radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant.  <br>
<br>
This experiment demonstrates that it was DNA not protein that functioned as the phage's genetic material.<br>
<br>
What is the modern basis for gene therapy, i.e. what structure is used to execute the process of genetic therapy. How is this technique possible, and what has been the most recent development in this field?<br>
<br>
Answer #5: Introduction of genetic material.  Virus's.  By introducing genes into viral material and introducing the virus into the human blood.  Most recent development was pertaining to cancer, and a virus that could be used to introduce anti-carcinogens into the human blood.<br>
<br>
There you go Tormalin.<br>
