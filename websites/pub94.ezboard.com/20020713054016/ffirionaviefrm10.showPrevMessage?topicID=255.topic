The body may have changed somewhat, (he wondered if the scar was still between her breasts) but the flicker of excitement still gleamed in her eyes. She was crouched on her knees in front of him as she had been earlier when he had threatened to take her head, and again when her throat had been cut and cast into the pool.<br>
<br>
“Who do you want me to kill?’ Valkiri said breathily. The flicker of excitement replaced by a steady glow of energy.<br>
<br>
“You will do something more difficult than simple killing…you are to lead a third of our forces during our attack on the Tower of Frozen Shadow, you must keep them alive until we reach the wedding.” Gray watched carefully for a reaction.<br>
<br>
“I cannot accept this honor. The last time I was given an order to protect a member of the league I failed miserably.” Valkiri said flatly. She remembered well that battle, placed in Sarhea’s bodyguard, a brutal fight, a flash of light and it was over, her ward dead. It did not matter that a paladin and a ranger had fallen to her during the battle, she had failed in her primary duty.<br>
<br>
“We all failed in that battle.” Gray said quietly, he too carried scars from that fight. “We underestimated the hatred the other Iksar have for Gore, we shall not make that mistake again.”<br>
<br>
“I will lead if the others will follow, your word shall be my law.” Valkiri said firmly.<br>
<br>
“Be at the tower then in one week, I shall have your team selected then.”<br>
<br>
“As you wish my lord.” Valkiri stood fluidly and strode to the door. She looked back to see Gray busy at his large mahogany desk. <br>
<br>
As soon as he heard her footsteps descending the stairs, Gray took a musty old scroll out of the desk. It was in the Old Erudian script from before the civil war, but it looked to be a translation from Teir Dal. In it certain lost rites were described, one of which detailed a ritual that involved immersion in blood. Several places had been named in the crumbling document, Qeynos, A Tower of Shadow and one other place. The last word was lost, that part of the scroll decayed beyond repair.<br>
<br>
He knew that the reaction the pool in Quenyos had was beyond the expectations of the Priest of Bertox. It would be a good chance to test the growing skills of League and if the opportunity came to have Valkiri bathe in yet another pool of blood, this time the experiment would be one of his own. He chucked grimly to himself. <br>
<br>
A week later Valkiri was standing in snow that rose to her knees. The metal armor seemed to soak up the cold and transfer it directly to her bones. The pain was delicious. Gray was shouting out names and League members moved quickly to obey his will.<br>
<br>
“Valkiri, you will lead, Spartax, Maladominus, Didi, Slaadya and Xzorsha!”<br>
<br>
She watched as her team gathered quickly and efficiently. Spartax and Slaadya were old companions, Didi she knew from several bouts in the arena, she had died well. Xzorsha was an unknown but her eyes burned with resentment at being ordered to follow a mere human. At least her hate shall keep her warm enough to fight. Maladominus was…well Maladominus, he would be fine as long as his alternate personality didn’t flare up. Valkiri dismissed an image of the leather clad Maladominus charging down a hallway with an oversized dagger between his teeth. <br>
<br>
“Your task will be to keep Sarhea alive!” Gray ordered. He enjoyed the look of shock that flitted across Valkiri’s features. “If any additional creatures attack her group while they are fighting, it shall be your task to handle the problem.”<br>
<br>
Val offered Gray a stiff armed salute by way of acceptance.<br>
<br>
“I will do my best.” The female Shadow Knight said to Sarhea who was busy arranging her group.<br>
<br>
“See that you do!” The female warrior laughed.<br>
<br>
If anyone had been watching the approach of the League from the tower, they would have seen a wave of darkness flow over the snowdrifts towards the entrance. The constructs placed in charge of defending the perimeter proved to be little challenge. With a flicker of energy the League invaded the first floor.<br>
<br>
Pandemonium reigned inside, Shadowbone Skeletons and Gnollish guardians attacked in waves and died like flies. The battle was confusing, it was difficult to lead her forces against the correct target, still her forces did well. <br>
<br>
Maladominus’ spells blasted the Skeletons into dust, while Spartax, Didi and Xzorsha made short work of any Gnoll foolish enough to attempt to flank Sarhea’s group. Slaadya was able to enter the fray and quell her bloodlust, her capacity as a healer unneeded since the enemies of the League died so quickly.<br>
<br>
Eventually they came to a huge library, ghosts still reading the moldy old tomes. Bloodbringer charged out repeatedly and returned with the spirits stalking her. The fighting was quick and brutal. Magic swirled around the combatants like a poisonous tide. A single misstep and one would be in over their head and drowned.<br>
<br>
It took only a moment, Valkiri was holding her group in reserve as yet another undead librarian descended on Sarhea’s group. It was important that they strike as a unified whole, since they were not as powerful as the group they were protecting. A short howl of rage was the only warning received as Xzorsha was slain by a vengeful spirit. A ghost had attacked on the left flank, rising up from under the floor ripping the life force from the young Teir Dal. Before it could retreat Didi and Spartax both released their black hands. As it writhed in pain Slaadya stunned it with a spell, giving Maladominus time to draw out its remaining energies.<br>
<br>
As her team rushed over to the left flank, Valkiri looked around wildly. The ghosts were becoming cunning, Xzorsha’s death attested to it. A flicker to her right was all the warning she needed. Her Crystallized blade rang as she drew it from the sheath and her shiny brass shield gleamed in the torchlight. Three Students were closing on her position. Her team had been decoyed. Cursing herself for a fool inwardly, while bellowing orders outwardly, Valkiri charged into their midst, hoping to buy enough time for Sarhea’s group to counterattack.<br>
<br>
The human Shadowknight’s blade bit deep into the ethereal flesh of the first student. She could see the surprise in its ghostly eyes as its energy dissipated. A blow from her shield knocked the second one back, but the third reached her, his hand passing through her breastplate, skin and ribcage. A cold hand gripped her heart, she felt the delicious languor of death spreading throughout her body. Her sword fell with jagged clatter to the ground as she brought her hand up and caressed the side of the students face.<br>
<br>
The power of the black hand drove the ghost back. Her team as well as Sarhea’s was shoring up the flank, but they would not get to her in time. Back in Qeynos the high priest of Bertox had impressed upon her the importance of not being raised by priests who were not followers of the plague bearer. Valkiri carefully, and with some dissapointment, gathered the fatal damage that lingered within her chest and forced it to the surface of her body. A roaring in her ears, much like the one she got from releasing the Black Hand was the only obvious indication that she was casting a powerful spell.<br>
<br>
The Teir Dal dancers of the Maiden’s Fancy had often referred to experiencing the “little death” with some of their more talented customers. A similar wave of extasy washed over Valkiri as her heart stopped and she crumpled to the ground with a groan. This time her spirit remained caged in her body. <br>
<br>
The ghosts paused in their attack and circled her body curiously. The ghost on her right was caught up in a barrage of eldritch energy so intense the stone melted underneath it. The second one was unable to cast a fresh spell as Opious, Maladominus, Slaadya, Sarhea, Spartax, and Antoin fell upon it in a storm of whrling blades. In a moment all that remained was its homework that fluttered to the ground.<br>
<br>
Dissapointment flashed momentarially in Gray’s eyes when Valkiri stood up and dusted herself off. Still he had Xzorsha to work on and he set to the task of restoring her with a will.<br>
Valkiri watched him closely as the spell was cast and energy flashed back into the fallen Teir Dal’s body. This triggered a memory, or was it a dream she was not sure, but an image of Gray standing in the temple of Bertox in Qeynos popped into her head.<br>
<br>
The League continued their assault on the tower, animated suits of Armor, and undead household staff were dragged to their death by Juonar. Didi squeeled with delight as he brought her victim after victim.<br>
 <br>
After a particularly long fight, Spartax suddenly bellowed. “I grow in Power! I feel the Blessings of Innoruk!”<br>
<br>
A few battles later Didi echoed his cry.<br>
<br>
It did not take long for the denizens of the tower of frozen shadow to cease to resist the League and Juonar led them through yet another portal where the danger increased yet again.<br>
<br>
Ghostly voices began to be heard, their presence seemed to agitate Shintou immensely, he collapsed to the ground trembling. A strong voice spoke of honor, loyalty and betrayal. Challenges were made and accepted and on this day the fate of the League was set in a new direction. <br>
<br>
Invisible enemies attacked from every direction and all three groups were hard pressed to control the situation. Shintou attacked furiously, drowning out the tormenting voice with the shrieks of the fallen. In a particularly confused battle, Valkiri lost track of Maladominus, she knew he was meditating behind her his spellcraft having made the difference in more than one battle. They were fighting in a very enclosed space with the casters behind them safely tucked away in an alcove. Suddenly she heard a shout behind her.<br>
<br>
“Arrrrggggg!” Maladominus bellowed.<br>
<br>
Dreading the return of the pirate persona that had dogged the little necromancer since his accident in the Rathe Mountains, Valkiri turned, hoping to bash some quick sense into him with her shield, before he ran off to find some booty. <br>
<br>
She found a huge pulsating mass of goo greedily absorbing the body of the gnome. What she had thought was the return of the pirate personality had in fact been a death scream.<br>
“Die!” the female Shadow Knight yelled, energy rippling the length of her blade as it slashed into the sticky mass. The cascade of physical and mystical energy that descended on the goo was truly impressive as the entire League force directed its wrath towards the assassin, it simply boiled away into an orange vapor, leaving the slightly singed corpse of the gnome behind, curled up in a ball.<br>
<br>
“He is mine,” Slaadya hissed at one of the other League healers who had begun the rituals of restoration. <br>
For the first time Valkiri detected something other than altruism in the eyes of the healers, and she wondered if these clerics got something in return from their gods for restoring the dead. Until her second bath in the bloodpool in Qeynos, she had often felt that Gray had been watching her, but she had put the thought off to simple confusion over his motives for bringing her back from the embrace of the void.<br>
<br>
“Thank you Slaadya.” Maladominus said, as he stood back up, his eyes still had the flicker of eldritch energies, a remainder of the spell that had restored him. Valkiri turned her gaze to Slaadya whose eyes seemed, for a moment, to flicker similarly, but it could have been from the magics of the battle raging around them. Before she had time to think on it more, she had to summon her team for the final assault on the wedding itself.<br>
<br>
It appeared that someone had taken offense at the marriage and slain the guests, who still stood in an appearance of readiness. Their ornate clothing and decorations had long since moldered away to rags. <br>
<br>
Once again Juonar distracted the inhabitants of the tower and led them to their doom, the battle picked up, first the ushers, then the guests and finally the wedding party themselves. Once again the mysterious voice murmured in their collective ears, telling a tale of anger and betrayal, Mayong Mistmoore’s reach was indeed long to stretch across the sea from Faydwer to the frozen wastes of Velious. <br>
<br>
The wedding was over, of course it had been over for centuries but now the energy that bound the guests to their aborted ritual had been dissolved by the power of the League.<br>
<br>
As the League carefully entered the chapel where the wedding was taking place Valkiri noticed Gray watching her carefully. As she walked down the isle, sword bared and shield braced for battle, she thought herself the most unlikely of brides. There would be no groom waiting for her at the end of the isle. <br>
<br>
As she passed the last set of pews she saw a shimmer of red behind the altar. Her careful walk became a stumbling run. There, behind the altar to some nameless god lay a pool. It was a pool of blood. The similarities between the one in Qeynos and here were unmistakable. <br>
<br>
Many League members had unceremoniously plunged into the pool to celebrate their victory. To her left Squishems and Snappy frolicked, happily splashing Juonar who was watching Cellestia do a very bad froglock imitation.<br>
<br>
Grays eyes did not betray his ire at his experiment being thwarted by his followers. They had more than earned their victory. <br>
<br>
“Its time to return to Antonica! We have done well, let this display of our power serve as a warning to those who lack the wit to fear us!” Gray shouted. A soft chuckle seemed to fill the air in the chapel, but it could have been a noise from the blood pool as the League exited it, causing the liquid to slosh about wildly. <br>
<br>
The League left the tower in the same order they had entered it. Main assault force, Sarhea’s battle group and finally Valkiri’s bodyguard. As the last of Sarhea’s group left the tower, Valkiri approached the pool. <br>
<br>
Once again the surface was placid, unmarred by waves, and looking down Valkiri saw a reflection in the water. It was herself and yet not quite the woman who stood before the pool. She kneeled down at the side and tentatively began to reach down towards the surface, the reflection in the pool smiled back and also reached towards her. <br>
<br>
The shadowknight’s fingertip broke the surface of the pool and energy coursed into her body. A feral grunt passed her lips as she felt power flow into her body. A vision of impaled corpses and dancing figures began to swim before her, she had never been to this place but knew it by sight, Kelethin.<br>
<br>
“They are coming back!” Slaadya screeched, raising her hammer.<br>
<br>
“Time to go!” Spartax barked, grabbing Valkiri and dragging her away from the pool forcibly. Energy burned his hands, much like his Vampiric Embrace spell did to his enemies during battle. He ignored the pain and dragged the semi conscious human from the pool. <br>
<br>
The group pounded down the hall towards the gateway, behind them a wave of restored wedding guests howled for their blood.<br>
<br>
“Arg, what did the missy do at the pool!” Maladominus asked in the throaty brogue of his pirate persona.<br>
<br>
“I know not, but only a fool would stick around to find out.” Xzorsha hissed, pelting past the shorter legged gnome and leaping through the gate.<br>
<br>
“Aye, that be the truth of it.” Mal growled as he threw himself through the portal. <br>
<br>
“Push her through!” Spartax ordered, turning to exchange a quick flurry of blows with the Ushers.<br>
<br>
Didi and Slaayda groaned with effort as they unceremoniously shoved the human female out the gate.<br>
<br>
“Why do I always end up dragging some stupid human out of a nightmare.” Slaadya grunted.<br>
<br>
“Well, I think it has something to do with the fact that she has all the loot.” Didi chortled as Valkiri vanished.<br>
<br>
The three of them jumped through the gate together barely escaping the talons of the undead. They milled around the portal for a bit then returned to their own positions, waiting expectantly for a wedding that would never happen.<br>
<br>
A tall female Dark Elf shimmered into view. “Dammit, Gray was right!” Celestia hissed as she entered the gate, eager to be gone from the tower and its pulsating pool of blood.<br>
