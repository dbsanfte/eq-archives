Of course there is some wild conjecture out there, and the debate will go on and on, even long after the classfied documents (in whatever form they are allowed to be revealed) become declassfied in 2023 or so.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I'm curious as to the opinions held by folks on this board.<br>
<br>
My personal belief:  Oswald did not act alone, and in all reasonable probability didn't even fire a shot.  I base this on the trajectory analysis of the multiple bullets that struck JFK and Governor Connally, which rule out a single marksman firing from a single position.  <br>
<br>
This can be determined simply by viewing the Zapruder film - where, after receiving a bullet the wounds him in the throat, you can see JFK being shot in the back and then receiving the fatal kill shot on the right side of the head, that had to come from a forward position.  Further research supports what the Zapruder film shows you in vivid colour.<br>
<br>
The lack of a lone gunman then leads to a cyclone of potential organized conspiracies - some of which are wild and outrageous and staggering to consider.<br>
<br>
Who and why?  Who knows but it makes for good conversation.<br>
<br>
I'd like to hear of other folks' opinions, particularly you Rollen, and kinda hope that this thread won't disintigrate into name calling.<br>

I hate to disappoint, but I have not been a student of the Kennedy assasination, but here goes.<br>

If you look at all the presidents of the U.S. you will see that JFK is the only catholic. It is possible that the Ulsters were behind the assasination. <br>

<br>
For us ignorant laypeople (as we'll never know the inner workings of the US intelligence circle) I guess the best way to approach this crime is to look at motive.<br>
<br>
JFK was a peace activist and it was no mystery that he was not on the best of terms with his military cabinet over the Bay of Pigs, his peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missle Crisis and finally his movements towards withdrawing US actions in Vietnam.<br>
<br>
However, as Luce points out, Papa Kennedy had his hands in a lot of peoples' pies and there we liaisons and ties to a very long list of shady organizations.  So aside from the US military hatching some plan to remove JFK before he could pull the US out of Vietnam (and as a result concede a victory to Communism, not to mention the billions of dollars in arms business that would evaporate) there were a number of other potential suitors for his assassination (the mob, Fidel Castro or the Russians).<br>
<br>
I personally feel that his death is tied to the aforementioned military conflicts - yes I know what a can of worms that opens.  However the motive is there AND if you look into Oswald's history, aside from his involvement in the military (marine radar operator) his associations and very peculiar stint in Russia reek of intelligence handling.<br>
<br>
As for the mob connection, that is where Jack Ruby (the fella who shot Oswald) comes in.  Ruby appears to have had deep underworld ties, possibly in a capacity as an informant/asset for US intelligence.  There are *numerous* eye witness accounts that Ruby and Oswald associated with each other on a social level, which makes Ruby's execution of Oswald even more startling.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on and on....but the inescapable bottom line is this:  JFK was killed by a well orchestrated plan operated by a group of people powerful enough to cover it up such that even today, the public doesn't have a clear idea of what really happened.  Although, part of me thinks that deep down, most people realize something very rotten occured and just want to forget that it ever happened. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twotribes>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 763<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/2/03 3:50:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=396.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: JFK</span><hr size=1> Who in the &quot;Military&quot; conspired?

We havent got a system that lends itself to the &quot;military&quot; assinating anyone. While the CIA might have been able to conspire to do it, I personally dont believe that either. To much to lose not enough to gain for them to do such a thing.<br>
<br>
As for Viet Nam, maybe you need to check some things out, JFK got us involved in Viet Nam. Whether he would have escalted is another question, but he started the ball rolling on troop commitment. We had been in Viet Nam since the end of WW2, we effectively paid for the French war effort there since they had no money. After the French left we sent advisors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=carlluce>Carl Luce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/2/03 4:44:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=396.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Finishing up thoughts</span><hr size=1> I actually did a paper on this in college.<br>
I think my conclusion was other than the foreign killers hired by the mob to murder him there was no influential outside hand in the JFK assassination.<br>
And despite the desire by some to link organized US military and/or intelligence services to JFK's killing the most likely culprits were (as I said before) the Italian Mafia.<br>
I think people would be surprised how much influence the mob had in the early 60's.<br>
When Robert Kennedy then as attorney general began cracking down on organized crime for political purposes a sense of betrayal emerged in the high ranks of the mob (especially considering they manipulated the Illinois election for JFK) and mob justice ensued.<br>
/shrug<br>
I still wonder about the mobster insiders in the govt. though. Who they were and what kind of help they got from the military/intelligence community if any before the killing and the cover up afterwards.<br>

I could see certain US military/intelligence interests &quot;cooperating&quot; with a mafia plot to assassinate JFK, as it would suit the military interests I highlighted above.  In fact, that scenario is more plausible than a direct military/intelligence operation because if the shit hit the fan, the intelligence directive could just pin the whole thing on the mob, prop up a couple of &quot;corrupt&quot; intelligence rogue operatives and snuff out those gangsters who had dangerous knowledge...I mean who would miss a couple of mobsters after all.<br>
<br>
The US military/intelligence, the mob, or a combination of the two makes a lot more sense than a lone Oswald, cranking out a minimum of 3 on target shots in 6 seconds with an Italian rifle whose bolt action is less than smooth...not to mention that one of those shots had to fly past JFK, do 180 degree rotation and hit him in the face. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 2405<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/2/03 5:06:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=396.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Finishing up thoughts</span><hr size=1> Well, there's no way to be certain of course, but here's my random conjecture.<br>
<br>
I would say that a group of people in the CIA decided to kill Kenedy, maybe over the Cuba thing, maybe for other reasons... who knows.  At any rate, Oswald was either really a patsy, or just the only one to get caught, who knows.  He was then assassinated to keep him quiet by someone who likely didn't know much about the rest of the plan and was threatened into doing it.  The reason I suspect a rogue group in the government is the Warren Commission cover up... the outcry against the CIA would be incredible if it were known about.<br>
<br>
But of course, it's impossible to know... we don't have the details.<br>
<br>
