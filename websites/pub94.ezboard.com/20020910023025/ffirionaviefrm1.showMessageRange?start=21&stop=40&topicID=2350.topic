Misunderstood your comments regarding the uselessness/crappiness/cheapness of the gloves as being dismissive, not as being explanatory. I thought you were trying to say they weren't worth enough for the situation to really matter, rather than saying that their low value indicated that he didn't understand the situation.<br>
<br>
To anyone else who mentioned the relative value of the gloves to illustrate his cluelessness, I also apologize. To anyone who thinks it is not that big a deal to take these gloves because they are cheap, my comments stand and you are just plain wrong.<br>

But I'd ask everyone here to - for a minute - put yourself in this guy's shoes. Suppose it was you who rolled on those gloves, and you had no idea what NBG was, and you had no idea how everything worked. Suppose you didn't know, and you were too <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> embarassed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to ask, because everyone already knows all of this stuff, so why shouldn't you? <br>
<br>
And suppose you tried to apologize for your mistake. How would you feel if the whole community of this board continued to rake you over the coals?<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think the reparations listed above our generally outrageous. I really can only see two options: <br>
<br>
(1) Buy the gloves back and give them to the raid leader. If the person who bought the gloves is like most people on FV, they will understand the prediciment and gladly take the cash in return of the gloves. <br>
<br>
(2) Give the proceeds from the gloves to the raid leader. <br>
<br>
Any of the other suggestions seems unfair and cruel. <br>

just put him on probation or something... make him donate whatever $ amount he made off the gloves in peridots for the next raid. <br>

<br>
Politeness has nothing to do with justice, nor with punishment. Those are three totally different concepts. <br>
<br>
He apologized, he gets forgiven, by me at least. That is polite. Does it mean he profits monetarily in this one instance? Yes, thats a price inherent in being polite. If his apology wasn't sincere he'll get bit by it in the future. <br>
<br>
The community will be seeing more of my name in the future (Spynayl). I run lots of events on Povar, where my char is a 48 enchanter. I run open raids, open roll. I don't care who your guild is. I don't care why you roll for items on my raids. The only items I reserve to folks are quest drops - and then everyone who can use it (i.e - kedge cave crystal, all druids roll) rolls. I don't care if you roll on the item to give to your dog, to sell, to destroy - none of that matters, if your roll is highest, thats all I'm interested in.<br>
<br>
Anyway, being 23 now, this won't be a big deal for me for some time to come.<br>

/Kudos to this player for stepping forward and making an apology.<br>
<br>
/kudos to his guildleader for stepping up and trying to help make sense of it.<br>
<br>
Sorry, guys. My apologies to Yakman too. I didnt see the other post. I only saw this thread. It seemed from this thread, that this fellow and his guildleader were not available to deal with this and so they were &quot;dodging&quot; the bullet. Clearly this is not the case since both have come forward and made comments addressing this issue.<br>
<br>
Its great that they have made an apology. In my opinion thats a great start, but there needs to be something more done. I would ask that he track down the guantlets and purchase them back so he can return it to the raid leader for re-distribution.  Barring that, he should take the proceeds of the sale and give to the guild leader for raid componenents.<br>
<br>
The bottomeline is that we shouldn't allow this sort of behavior, accidental or not. Even if we all agree that this was an accident we cannot allow people to use this as an excuse in the future. There must be a penalty imposed not because I want to see this player punished, but to protect future raids from seeing this kind of thing happen again.<br>

No matter what is said, this should not be a reflection on his guild.  I do not know Bobmato too well, but he was greatly respected by our last leader, Rhael, and therefore is a honorable person in my book.  I think he held himself well through this issue.<br>
Also, I think this is a matter for the public, since it needs to be known which players out there have caused problems on previous raids.  The open guild leaders need to be informed of questionable behavior.  For example, Nueelien is leading a raid today for which Errico has signed up.  I think that Nueelien would have been hestitant to accept him (just my speculation) without Errico's apology.<br>
Since this is in the general forum, I'll keep my opinions on the matter to myself.<br>

Not a problem at all, Elly.  I didn't explain myself when I made the initial comment, so it's very easy to have gotten the impression (that I thought people should let it slide because they weren't worth that much compared to other dragon loot).<br>

Point is.<br>
Who cares what he says. What did he do with the Gauntlets? Did he give them back to you, did he give them to the person that was second in Order to win them?<br>
<br>
Or is he laughing all the way back to the bank? If he's really sorry, then he should give them back, you think? <br>

And if he's already sold them, then he should refund the transaction and get them back. If he can't, then tough break. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>

So...<br>
<br>
1) He might not be on vacation.<br>
2) He might be on vacation, and is coming back in time for the raid.<br>
3) He might be on vacation, and is gonna miss the raid.<br>
<br>
   If he shows up, just ask him to make amends by using the money he got for the gauntlets (he already sold them) to buy a few stacks of peridots (they cost about 210 plat per stack) and give them to the raid leader to distribute to the clerics for Symbol spells (HP buff), and then call the issue resolved.

Kind of like those RL court verdicts where some criminal is told to serve 2 months and pay the court $5,000. Great... nifty... but the guy who had his business vandalized doesn't get anything? The court gets the money? What? Shouldn't the criminal have to serve 2 months and pay to repair the damage he did?<br>
<br>
Or how about those classic cases where some guy embezzles a few million, and then serves a couple of years at the federal non-voluntary country club, but gets to keep the stolen millions! Damn. Talk about NOT discouraging future theft.<br>
<br>
In this case, the folks who were wronged were primarily the people who rolled on those guantlets and lost them. Not the next raid leader.<br>

If not, then you can't really know who was rolling against him.<br>
<br>
There are two parts of this:  punishment for the wrongdoer and reimbursement for the victim.  If the victim cannot be identified, then reimbursement is a moot point.  That only leaves the punishment to be decided.  Since the two can't be tied together because of lack of identity of the true victime, then I like the idea of the money going towards expenses of the next raid.  Either way, the miscreant should have to forfeit the money gained from the transaction.  Actions must have consequences if they are not to be repeated.<br>

<br>
First of all, I'm 52, I'm rather well equiped, and I use these gauntlets (I won them on my first Naggy Raid, and I still wear them).   I wear them over Crystal Chitten due to the fact that in raids I need 7 sta, 7 disease, 7 dex, and 7 poison  more than 10 ac (I don't get hit much, I'm a rogue... but I need all the HPs I can get, and those saves are quite nice).  These are quite good gauntlets here, so let's not pretend this was some Crystaline Spear here.<br>
<br>
Two, in an open raid situation, you can't make special cases for people.  This wasn't a guild raid, you can't just watch this person in the future.  You NEED to post their name to warn other open raid leaders, and you NEED to make an example of them so that it doesn't become common place, otherwise it becomes a slippery slope, where you forgave the last one so you have to forgive the next clown who pulls this stunt.  I don't buy ignorance.  You walk into a raid where loot distribution is clear, then pull this... no way.  I know people don't listen some times... but if there's one thing I know well, it's that everybody listens to the loot arangement, especially people who are active on the sellers' market, which this person obviously is.  <br>
<br>
I would not take this person on future open raids, ever.  If they returned the money they got, I would forgive them, yes... but forgiving and forgetting are two different things.  I may not dislike them if they do what's honorable after making the mistake, but I still wouldn't let them back on the open raids... perhaps that way others wouldn't make the same mistake.<br>
<br>
This may seem hard line or unforgiving... but in cases where money is concerned, even virtual money, there are people who will take advantage of any loop hole or advantage, and letting someone off the hook cause they said sorry is a huge loop hole that I wouldn't want opened up.<br>

If he is not willing to do that, how can you say he is really sorry?  <br>
<br>
As has been mentioned previously, the one thing about raids that everyone (and I mean everyone) has an understanding of is LOOT.  People will skip through or barely parse over strategy discussions, background information and group alignments but the one thing that folks always hone in on is loot distribution.  That is what motivates people to spend several hours of their time to raid.  You are honestly telling me that a guy who is active on the market didn't have any idea how loot distribution worked for this raid?<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am too cynical, but I don't buy it for a second that this guy did not know about need before greed or what it meant.  Particularly someone who knows about the marketplace here and has an offer to sell those gauntlets the very day after the raid.<br>

Let the guy make amends to show how sorry HE is, not just show that he can fulfill some punishment that is imposed. It's his name that has to be cleared, and if I where in his shoes I think I would start coughing up everyway I could think of to clear my name.<br>

<br>
Secondly, Saying sorry is easy, right then, its a damn shame so many people both in RL and EQ never manage to say sorry. You got it folks, most folks do not say sorry, many people in this position would of been more likely to f*(&amp; you than sorry.<br>
<br>
I agree with many that sorry is not eneough, but thats because of how I would react. God I would be so guilt ridden if I had screwed up this way, well I would be a pain to be near :-)<br>
<br>
As to folks not knowing what NBG is, alas many do not, have run raids where person X rolls on item Y and its obvious that X will not use Y, I tend to have a little chat and normaly people get it.<br>
<br>
A suggestion, when awarding items have a quick look at the person before you hand it over, that always works well.<br>
<br>
Another better solution is the update trickle down method. When person X get equipment a which replaces equipment peice b they have to offer b to the raid. If b is worth too much for them to offer than maybe they should not roll and get a . . .<br>
<br>
This is how many big guilds do it. This way, 1 win becomes a win for many folks.<br>
<br>
Without this, lets say a kael bp drops, warrior with cobalt bp upgrades then sells cobalt. So they get 2 wins. Now if the trickle down works then the cobalt goes up for roll, someone with hate bp gets it, hate bp goes up for roll, someone with crafted gets , person with crafted bp well if no one wants maybe it goes to raid organisers to be sold to cover dots and ports etc.<br>
<br>
Honestly I am amazed and impressed that less of this sort of thing has happened on the open raids here, says a lot about the folks here that this does not happen all the while.<br>
<br>
Often, stuff that happens on open raids is what leeds to one of the justifications for guilds :-)<br>
<br>
Personaly, loot wise, by randomly giving items to everyone who can use you slow down the speed at which the raid group can move forward.<br>
<br>
Equiping the main tank with the best armor and weapons makes a lot of sense. Never been anywhere near the top of the food chain in terms of equipment on any server but the idea is sound.<br>
<br>
Lets say it takes 1 month per place to get 1 suit of armor and assume we have 6 tanks.<br>
<br>
With the give to main tank method  you will be fighting at the 6th lvl place after 6 months. (6th lvl means 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 etc. 6th place is alot harder than the 1st place. 1st place normaly hate.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the armor the tanks have<br>
<br>
Main tank has full set from 6th<br>
Second full set from 5<br>
third full set from 4<br>
etc<br>
sixth tank full set from 1st (hate)<br>
<br>
Now lets do the random method. After 6 months, everyone is still in hate and all the main tanks now have stuff from hate. Time to move on to next dungeon . . .<br>
<br>
Oh crap I digressed, sorry :-) spent alot of time (way way too long) on another server that did not do the equip the main tank method and so spent for ever in hate :-) (I was a mage so I was not after stuff :-)<br>
<br>
Sorry for the digression.<br>
<br>
Kudos for the chap appologising, I think he should continue until everyone tells him to shut up already :-) but thats just me. Some folks apologize once and thats IT end of story.<br>
<br>
