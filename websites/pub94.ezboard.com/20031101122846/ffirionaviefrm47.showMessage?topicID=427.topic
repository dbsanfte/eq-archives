I am posting this to see how much interest there would be in a guild or association that would fill this niche.<br>
<br>
I don’t think guilds or associations that try to be all things to all people work very well in the long run (usually even in the short run). Therefore this would be rather focused.<br>
<br>
I think there are probably a goodly number of people that are now in their 50s and would like to experience upper level content but don’t want to or cannot make the commitments that a full on raiding guild would require. They want a family like atmosphere but want to push themselves at times too.<br>
<br>
1) Everquest is a game. Games are about having fun and experiencing things you otherwise could not. First and foremost, we are looking to have fun.<br>
<br>
2) Good attitude is crucial. It is expected that we will behave both as a group and as individuals honorably (camps will be honored, etc.) It is to be expected that things can and will go wrong. If you can’t take a death in a good natured way, this isn’t the group for you.<br>
<br>
3) A mature attitude is required. That isn’t measured by someone’s age but how they act and speak. There are adults that act like children. There are children that act like adults.<br>
<br>
4) Speech is expected to be kept clean and free of sexual innuendos.<br>
<br>
5) Played time will be based around Eastern Standard Time (GMT-5) or Eastern Daylight Time (GMT-4) whichever is currently in effect. Activities will be primarily from just before 9 in the evening until about 11:45 on week days and Sundays. We will try to do something a bit more major on Saturdays usually starting around noon. This doesn’t mean people from other time zones are not welcome. It simply means these are the core hours we are trying to service. If you are from another time zone and play those hours, great!<br>
<br>
6) Planes of Power will be required. There are several reasons for this: the raid window, easy quick travel, and access to the PoP planes.<br>
<br>
7) Role play is encouraged but not required. An appropriate emote here or there during a raid or group session can help keep things fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Minimum level is 50. Minimum may be raised from that on a class by class basis depending on what is currently needed. It will not be lowered below 50.<br>
<br>
9) All classes and races are welcome. We are dedicated to doing good, not evil, but even necromantic abilities can be used for the furtherance of good. Role play justification: As agnostic mages, enchanters, and others have realized for a long time, the power that we use is not in fact granted by the so-called gods, pitiful as they are. Instead that power comes from within us. OOC justification: the way EQ is setup, it is possible to raid without necromancers or shadow nights but they sure are handy for doing things like corpse retrieval.<br>
<br>
10) Grouping within the guild/association is strongly encouraged. Yes some classes might get a little better exp soloing. However, we need to learn to work well together. There are also many things that simply cannot be accomplished alone. It is understood that sometimes you will want to do something by yourself to get cash or experience. However, if you truly are a loner, this isn’t the right set of people for you. The goal would be to have groups doing things like the PoP planes every night of the week (unless we are doing a full on raid, epic piece, etc.)<br>
<br>
11) Attendance on raids, etc. is NOT required. It is encouraged. It will be a factor in what we raid and who gets loot (but it will only be one factor among others, see below).<br>
<br>
12) Loot: This causes so many problems and friction. First and foremost, the purpose of this guild or association will be fun, not loot. If you can’t agree to that, then this isn’t the right group of people for you. During raids, loot will be handled by a loot council. People will indicate if they want an item that dropped. The council will decide who gets it. Only those who can and WILL use an item should ask. It is required that the person will surrender the current item that is being replaced. The only exceptions will be items that have significant clicky effects or that are no drop. These may be granted an exception by the loot council at THEIR discretion. Factors considered by the council will include but not be limited to: a) Attitude (including things such as fun to be around, lack of begging, helpfulness, fun role play, etc.)  b) Attendance c) who would benefit most d) what would benefit the group the most e) How long it has been since someone got some loot. Complaining about loot is a great way to be told you are no longer welcome. We will try to be fair. We ask you to respect that. If no one wants an item or a hand down, the item will be sold and will be used to fund things like spell components, coffins, etc. Note: one advantage of a loot council is that sometimes people have to leave before an event is finished. Having a loot council means that they still could get an item. This will help with those who want to raid but have a real life that needs to be balanced in as well. Note2: If we become a guild, there may be occasions where someone outside the guild who comes often will be awarded loot. If they help us, we need to occasionally help them.<br>
<br>
13) Leadership: leadership will be kept small and tight. A large pool of officers should not be necessary given the focus on play times. Leaders will be hand selected by me. They will be expected to: a) serve b) be even more selfless than others. This doesn’t mean they will never get any loot but does mean they shouldn’t expect that their position entitles them to it in any way. Also, This WILL NOT be a democracy. The leadership will of course take into account the feelings of its members. It is a very poor leader that wouldn’t since people join guilds/associations of their own free will and can leave of their own free will.<br>
<br>
14) It is anticipated that we will use a chat channel for setting up groups, etc. This will allow others to check us out and decide if they like what they see (and if we like what we see). It will also help in the short run until we get the critical mass needed to actually become a guild. It will also allow people to join us who want to be in an association such as this without leaving their current guilds and friends.<br>
<br>
Ok. Well anyway, that is quite a list of starting principles and ideas. It may be specific enough that nobody would be interested. The way to find out is ask. That is what I am doing. If you might be interested in such a guild/association please post your name, class and season. To start we are not asking anyone to leave there current guild. We can do a lot just using a chat channel. If we hit critical mass I can see a guild being formed out of this but this could be successfully done never even forming an official guild. What a guild would give us is a little more ownership and feeling of responsibility to each other and the group.<br>
<br>
Thanks for considering this. I know it is a VERY long post but I think clarity of vision and ideas at the start is important.<br>
