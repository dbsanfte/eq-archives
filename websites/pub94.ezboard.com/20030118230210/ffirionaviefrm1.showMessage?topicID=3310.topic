<br>
There are three major factions on Velious.  Claws of Veeshan (dragons), Kael Drakkel (giants), and Coldain (dwarves).  Each faction offers quest armors to folks who have proven themselves allies to thier cause.  CoV and the Coldain have a loose alliance against the giants (meaning, when you kill a giant, you get positive faction for both dragons and dwarves).<br>
<br>
From a purely gaming perspective (RP aside) your best bet is to be on Coldain faction (the dwarves).  The drops needed for their quests are much more easily obtained as the quests from the other two factions require drops from the Temple of Veeshan (scary place).<br>
<br>
To the best of my knowledge, a vast majority of the guilds on this server (at least the non uber ones) are on Coldain faction, as it's easy to raise and their quests are more easily obtained for the average player.  However, it should be noted that in most cases, the Coldain armor is slightly inferior to the others.<br>
<br>
It all depends on your level and plans for the future.  For most folks, Velious armors are part of the natural progression of gear upgrades.  And if someday you get to the level where Temple of Veeshan is an option, it's certainly not impossible to switch factions, though it should be noted that it's very time consuming and boring.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, that's my take.  I'm sure someone will be more than happy to correct me on anything I might have left out/gotten wrong.  Hope it helps ya.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ninluine Ravenshade - Rake of Kelethin</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

There are 2 coldain factions, 3 Giant factions and if you count Yelnik 2 Dragon factions. Generally doing anything to raise coldain faction hurts giant faction and the same with Dragon faction. Though I am told you can have giant and Dragon if careful, dont ask me how, I dont know. But I suspect you cant have King Tormax ( Giant King) faction and Dragon.<br>
<br>
If you worship Rallos Zek you are Dubious to the main area faction of the Giants, but you wont be able to buy and sell in Kael Drakkel without sneak or faction work. Every starts off at least apprehensive to Coldain, meaning you can buy and sell there.<br>
<br>
If you venture into Kael Drakkel with just basic faction, dont go on any of the side trails as some lead to the Storm Giants or Royals and you are probably KOS to them until you do faction work. The other faction is the Frost Giants. You get both Frost and Storm killing coldain I believe, though I am not sure, I am on Dragon/Coldain faction. Not sure how you raise Royal faction ( King Tormax), maybe something in Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
The two Coldain factions are basic and royal faction (Dain faction), like I said you start off at least apprehensive so you can buy and sell. You have to do quests I believe ( or kill King Tormax) to raise Dain faction. But killing Giants and their pet wolves will raise basic Coldain and Dragon faction. Best place to raise Dragon faction ( well and Coldain too) is in the arena of Kael Drakkel. There is a bigger faction hit there or at least it seems that way.<br>
<br>
The Dragon faction can be raised both by killing Giants and by doing several quests that require parts from Giants ( helms and toes) to be turned in in Skyshrine. You will be KOS to Skyshrine until you do some basic work on faction. Yelnik I dont know how to raise. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twotribes>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/15/02 5:12:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1748<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/02 9:15:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3310.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The typical trend for people to follow ..</span><hr size=1> .. in Vellious is Coldain, CoV, Kromzek.  Mostly that's because those are the easiest to the hardest to obtain quest quest armor, but partly also because it's the way your faction will tend to end up as your guild's raid strength increases, too.  SS armor is prefered by casters (ally CoV faction).  Kael armor is prefered by melee (ally Kromzek).  Thurg is prefered by newbies (kindly Coldain).  Eventually, you won't care and will end up KoS to them all.  It only takes 8-16H to get the ally faction needed to finish a quest and on FV you can always have a friend with faction complete the quests for you.<br>
<br>
The only truly hard faction to raise is Yelinak.  You have to kill KT about 5 or 6 times or do a phenomenal number of helm hand-ins in SS to raise Yelinak to ally.  Killing KT isn't so hard -- it's not taking the negative Yelinak hits from your guild's other kills during the one to two months you're killing KT for faction that's hard.<br>
<br>
IMHO, Kael/SS quest gear is a lot better than Thurg.  It's enough better that there's not much point in working on a thurg set.  Certainly xp/faction in Kael and if you get a lucky drop, use it.  But don't stay there forever.  Aim at Kael/SS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 1822<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 12:53:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3310.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The typical trend for people to follow ..</span><hr size=1> There are two different main giant factions, plus the Tormax (king) faction.

The Frost Giants are heavily against the dwarves... killing dwarves raises faction with them a lot, and killing them gives a lot of dwarf faction and a miniscule amount of dragon faction, with a minor hit against the Storm Giants.  Killing Storm Giants gives a respectable hit for Circle of Veeshan, a hit against King Tormax, and a hit against the Frost Giants.  It is possible to be on Frost Giant and CoV, or Storm and Dwarves, at the same time.<br>

Otherwise it's most likely going to take some real work with the guild you later join to get faction to one direction or another high enough. I wouldn't worry about that. Usually guilds first hunt in Kaels -&gt; you need coldain/thurgardin faction, then move to hunt in Halls of Tests in ToV -&gt; you need CoV faction. Both of these factions come from hunting in Kaels (arena/royals), and come pretty fast there too. Elsewhere it's a lot slower.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse you loose the ability to do business in Thurgardin if you kill giants (but gain the possibility to do some limited banking/shopping in Kaels instead at somepoint). But well there's the PoK book.... If you just want to play max safe, then kill the giants and buddy up with the coldains of Thurgardin. Personally I wouldn't really pay so much attention to that faction issue, but that's me. Velious faction can always be fixed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Exactly.<br>
A piece of advice from a fellow Ogre Beastlord, would be to kill those pesky dwarves, since the Giants follow Rallos Zek just like you do.<br>
If you kill the Coldain Wolfmasters outside Thurgadin, they some times drop Coldain heads. Save as many of these as you can, and turn them into Sergeant Bvrellos (I think his name was) near the bank in Kael Drakkel. Each head gives faction towards all three Giant fractions. <br>
But be sure to hunt the Wolfmasters early on, because the Heads are magic and will TLC on you, if you are too high level.<br>
<br>
And if you are looking for a guild, you can take a look at the League of Shadows.

<br>
The dwarves are on two factions:<br>
<br>
Coldain - these are basically all the dwarves except for the dwarves at the bottle of Crystal Caverns and some of the mobs in the Icewell Keep. Raising coldain is pretty easy, killing any frost giant (the big giants with white long beards) will raise coldain faction. The armor they give (thurg armor) comes from kael, which can drop very rarely off any mob and is most common in the Kael Arena.<br>
<br>
Statswise, Thurgadin armor is comparable to Plane of Growth (PoG) armor. Personally PoG is more rewarding, especially for an ogre beastlord, i mean what evil force would not like to defile the plane where the goody-elves come from?<br>
<br>
Dain Frostreaver IV -  this is probably the most annoying of all factions IMO. It acutally doesnt serve too many purposes other than a few quests (though most you can do at dubious anywys). The mobs are all in Icewell Keep so if you are kos to dain you won't be ambuhsed by any mobs in Thurgadin provided you are at least dubious to Coldain.<br>
<br>
The giants are on three differnet factions that represent each of the types of giants. The giants all worship Rallos Zek, the Warlord. There is a great temple that only giants can visit (the mobs there are kos to all) but otherwise the rest of Kael is safe other than mobs on Tormax faction.<br>
<br>
If you worship rallos zek, you should be dubious to the two main factions:<br>
<br>
Kromrif - these are the giants that patrol the Eastern Wastes side of Kael Drakkel. They have long white beards. They are the Giants who fight the Coldain. Hence, killing Kromrif raises Coldain faction, and a very very small raise on Claws of Veeshan faction. These should start dubious to those who worship the warlord.<br>
<br>
Kromzek - these are the storm giants. They have no beards and are in the shinier armors. They inhabit the western side of Kael, and with good reason. The Storm Giants are much tougher than the Frost Giants and fight the Giant's main adversaries - the dragons. Killing these results in a raise in Claws of Veeshan faction. These are non-kos to Rallos Zek followers.<br>
<br>
Tormax - this faction is for King Tormax and a fwe of his guards. They inhabit only to the very south of Kael Drakkel. The first mob you wil see on Tormax faction is Dlammaz Stormslayer (or his PH which is named &quot;a storm giatn warlord.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Luckily they are across a bridge and you can con them from afar. Tormax faciton mobs start off kos to all, even rallos zek followers, for he does not trust any non-giants until they have proven their worth.<br>
<br>
The dragons, the enemies of the Giants, are on two (tho technically 3) factions:<br>
<br>
Claws of Veeshan - this factoin makes up almost all dragons and dragonkin in Velious. Almost every dragon is on this faction. Killing these results in a rise in Tormax and Kromzek faction. All wyverns, wurms, drakes, and dragons are on this faction except a few. Everyone starts off KoS to the Claws of Veeshan (though iirc veeshan worshipers actually get better faction and may be non-kos to begin with to this one).<br>
<br>
Yelinak - only Yelinak and a few mobs have this faction now (after Skyshrine revamp at least). He is very hard to raise, but you only need him for one purpose : quests by turning in Tormax head. Tormax is a very nice yelinak hit and yelinak is at the very top of a very huge zone (skyshrine) and so you don't have to worry about him.<br>
<br>
Now the third faction of dragons, though you can never raise is:<br>
<br>
Guardians of Veeshan - they start kos to all for they defend the sacred northern shrine of the Temple of Veeshan. Dragons do not believe anybody but dragonkin belong there and they will kill any intruders. This faction cannot be repaired in any known way. Do not worry about this faction, however, for you will not see it.<br>
<br>
Here's a small factoin table ((at least off the top of my head, i dont remember it completely)):<br>
<br>
Killing Coldain faction mobs:<br>
+Kromrif<br>
+Kromzek<br>
-Coldain<br>
-Dain Frostreaver IV<br>
<br>
Killing Dain faction mobs:<br>
+Tormax<br>
-Coldain<br>
-Dain Frostreaver IV<br>
<br>
Killing Kromrif faction mobs:<br>
+Coldain<br>
+Claws of Veeshan<br>
-Kromrif<br>
-Kromzek<br>
<br>
Killing Kromzek faction mobs:<br>
+Claws of Veeshan<br>
-Kromrif<br>
-Kromzek<br>
-Tormax<br>
<br>
Killing Tormax faction mobs:<br>
+Dain Frostreaver IV<br>
+Yelinak<br>
-Kromzek<br>
-Tormax<br>
<br>
Killing Claws of Veeshan faction mobs:<br>
+Kromzek<br>
-Claws of Veeshan<br>
-Yelinak<br>
<br>
Killing Yelinak faction mobs:<br>
+Tormax<br>
-Claws of Veeshan<br>
-Yelinak<br>
<br>
Faction raising for Kael is quite easy. Collect coldain heads which can drop off of Coldain wolfmasters, expendition guards, and other assorted coldain in the Eastern Wastes and the Great Divide.<br>
<br>
Turn these into Captain Bvellos in the bank in Kael.<br>
<br>
If you are dubious, he will not respond to hails, but turning in coldain heads DOES WORK.<br>
<br>
The faction hit is very nice. IIRC 60 or so heads can get you non-kos to tormax really easily, and can raise Kael faction to indifferent with kromzek and kromrif.<br>
<br>
Bvellos is the best choice for raising faction. Turning in kobold paws (or other items) also results in faction raise, however coldain heads is the best.<br>
<br>
Later on if you recieve Dragon heads you can return them into Dlammaz Stormslayer (Tormax faction, might need warmly iirc) for some nice items in return (cloak of hte maelstrom and others).<br>
<br>
Advantages/Disadvantages of factions:<br>
<br>
-Claws of Veeshan faction means you are non-kos to basically half of the continent. You can also use the Wakening Lnads portal as the port-camping dr00d dragon Wuoshi won't attack you as soon as you zone in.<br>
-You are also non kos to most of ToV (other than the Halls of Testing and NorthToV cept hatchlings) and also most dragons in Western wastes and all dragonkin in Cobalt Scar.<br>
<br>
However, CoV is very annoying since hte majority of creatures you kill in Velious will end up on this faction (NToV) and the hits are pretty bad there on the named.<br>
<br>
Like others stated, however, at that point, you will probably have trashed all three factions.<br>
<br>
For armor...<br>
<br>
There is no true advantage to either kael or skyshrine IMO.<br>
<br>
Skyshrine has a lot of good pieces statswise. Its ac is lacking compared to Kael, which is true, but it more than makes up in that its pieces give more resists and hp, which are pretty important.<br>
<br>
Certain pieces are better than others definitely though. A warlords BP is better than a Myrmidion BP imo, but a myrmidion gauntlets with +90hp far outweighs the 3ac advantage on walrords gauntlets, and so on.<br>
<br>
Luckily, on FV, since you can get either armor purchased or have a person with ally factoin do the turn in for you, its not a big deal.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
edit: oh yea just wanted to add that imo velious was the most interesting of all the expansions (cept maybe pop but i havent done much in that yet) especially with the faction wars and waht not, wish vi had more creativity as it did here<br>

Like I said above, I will be raising Giant faction initially. Faction after that is a long ways in Abzook's future and he will deal with it when it comes up.<br>
<br>
One thing, it seems to me Rallos Zek faction(s) should start out kos to all since Zek is the god of war and you have not yet proven yourself. As you kill Zek faction(s) more and more, Zek begins to take notice and you begin to earn his respect (and that of his minions). To attain ally with Rallos Zek, you must be part of a raid and kill him in his plane. That would be more in line with what Ogres believe anyway (or at least this ogre).<br>

In my first incarnation I did the dwarf armor quest armor first, then headed to the halls of testing in the temple of veeshan.<br>
<br>
The Kael armor has superior AC to dragon, and a good deal better than dwarf.  However, the dragon armor has generally better resists/stats (and the AC certainly is nice), and as was stated above, the dwarf armor is the easiest to obtain.<br>
<br>
As a practical matter, Kael/Dragon armor is only obtainable by fairly high end raiding guilds.  Dwarf armor is obtainable by small guilds (and even pick up groups).<br>

<br>
This is mainly for being able to travel around easier and because kael is much easier to raid than ToV.<br>
<br>
Most guilds that went on Kael faction on other servers were often the top guilds on their servers when Velious was first released.<br>
<br>
On pvp servers, imo cov is the definite choice as most of velious is either dragon or coldain, few giants.<br>
<br>
That being said, however, Kael is not a bad choice. Your Thurgadin equivalent as i said above is Plane of Growth armor which is very good (and looks damn good too w/ velious graphics on).<br>
<br>
Also, on this server, faction isn't as huge as other servers.<br>
<br>
And just a FYI, the Temple of Veeshan is very overrated.<br>
<br>
The keys are honestly a 60 + tank (to hold agro), a 60 slower, malo and/or mala, and a siever.<br>
<br>
Honestly speaking, a group of 6 can easily farm most of the halls of testing. Monk, Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman, damgedealerhere. Thats the &quot;ideal&quot; group.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't advise doing it below 55 due to resisiting AEs are much harder below 54 and will soak up healer mana. With a bard however its not too hard.<br>
<br>
Once you get ToV down its very very easy and definitely rewarding.<br>
<br>
Oh and Kael armor can drop in NToV also i believe so some guilds who clear up there often get these pieces, so its not a big problem if you don't raid WToV at all until North. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeldfv>ZeldFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/02 6:22:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3310.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oh yea</span><hr size=1> Oh yea just to add onto something.. here's a few examples of armors from the factions:<br>
<br>
For instance, the Warlords Breastplate (kael):<br>
+59 AC +16 Str +10 Sta +7 Agi +7 Dex +6 vsMg +10 vsCold +90 HP<br>
<br>
Compared to the Breastplate of the Myrmidon (skyshrine):<br>
+54 AC +15 Str +10 Sta +7 Agi +7 Dex +10 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +10 vsDis +90 HP <br>
<br>
The Warlords AC is a bit higher, similar hp and sta, but the BP of the Myrmidion gives more resists.<br>
<br>
Compare the Warlords Gauntlets:<br>
+30 AC +5 Sta +60 HP <br>
<br>
to the Myrmidon Gauntlets:<br>
+27 AC +8 Dex +90 HP <br>
<br>
The Myrmidon gauntlets are definitely on top IMO, though both give the same hp in the end for a warrior at 60 (5sta = 30 hp or so at 60), the pure raw hp is much better on the CoV armor.<br>
<br>
Besides, if you aren't tanking, you might as well go for resists and hp so you can avoid AE's / take AE damage more often.<br>
<br>
The general trend is pretty similar, most Skyshrine pieces are superior for casters to Warlords and have more resists and stats overall, but Warlords has a lot more ac and pretty much the same hp in the end.<br>
<br>
PoG vs. Thurg armor is pretty even / balanced, though i prefer PoG look :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1756<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/02 8:10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3310.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> There is a way to raise GoV</span><hr size=1> It's not pratical, though.

Same for Melalfen, he only drops Disciples of kerafyrm and CoV faction (huge hit heh) and thats the only &quot;odd&quot; named i suppose that gave +GoV.<br>

Either way its still inpractical and the new rogue sneak AA can allow you to explore basically all of NToV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=3310.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=3310.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3310.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=3310.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3310.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3310.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
