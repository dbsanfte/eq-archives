With the help of some Iksar :P</span><hr size=1> /ooc: Hi, I play Flippus, a Gnome Necro of Tinker's Pride.  Below is a three part story about the event in the Arena. Hope everyone likes it.<br><br>---<br>A ragged voice called out, &quot;Flippus! Do you hear me fool? FLIPPUS! I should strike you down for ignoring me!&quot;<br><br>The small figure bundled comfortably on the bed began to stir. &quot;Not yet Ma, just five more minutes!&quot; he begged.<br><br>&quot;MA?!&quot; the voice shouted, &quot;I am far from your mother fool! I am your Lord Bertoxxulous! No get up and listen to me!&quot;<br><br>Flippus slowly opened his eyes. As the cloud of sleep lifted, Flippus pulled his blanket off and sat up in his bed. Opening his mouth wide in the first of the days many yawns, he rubbed his eyes then scratched an itch on his leg. The voice muttered something impatiently and Flippus looked toward its source.<br><br>&quot;Good morning Bert!&quot; Flippus beamed, waving at the large plague rat sitting on his table. &quot;Would you like some breakfast? Or maybe a glass of fish wine?&quot; Flippus walked over to his wash basin and proceeded to his morning routine, completely aloof to the fact that Bertoxxulous was sitting in his little home.<br><br>&quot;Curse you Flippus! My NAME is Bertoxxulous! Not Bert! I tire of reminding you of this!&quot; the rat stammered, snarling at Flippus (who had just finished brushing his teeth and was now flossing)<br><br>&quot;But it's too many syllables to say your full name! Besides, I think it's kinda cute, having a pet plague rat named Bert!&quot; Flippus turned to the God sitting at the table and beamed a perfect smile at him.<br><br>Bertoxxulous began to stutter in rage, &quot;P..p.pet?! I AM MOST CERTAINLY NOT YOUR PET, GNOME! I am the Plaguebringer!&quot; The rats eyes began to glow a bright red, &quot;I am the Disease that strikes at the very essence of all Norrath! I am..&quot;<br><br>&quot;.. the giant talking plague rat at my breakfast table!&quot; Flippus finished for his God, waving his hands dramtically in the air, bowing with a flourish.<br><br>&quot;Yes yes! I am the giant talking pla...&quot; Bertoxxulous paused and eyed the gnome before him. Flippus had turned to his closet and had begun to get dressed. Bertoxxulous sighed, &quot;I think I'll have that glass of wine now.&quot;<br><br>Flippus finished dressing and proceeded to pour two glasses of wine. He then made himself a rat ear sandwich and sat across from Bertoxxulous. &quot;So what is it that you needed to talk to me about?&quot;<br><br>Bertoxxulous quickly downed the glass of wine then began to speak, &quot;Innoruuk has broken the Pact.&quot; Flippus munching on his sandwich was about to say something, however Bertoxxulous quickly cut him off, &quot;It's rude to talk with your mouth full, now shut up and listen.&quot;<br><br>Flippus shrugged and continued to listen while he ate breakfast. Bertoxxulous explained to him that the Gods of Evil had long ago formed a pact amongst them. A treaty of sorts that allowed the Evil gods to pursue their own desires, so long as they did not interfere with the others own machinations. This treatise had served them well and on more than one occasion had united them against the Gods fo Good. But being evil, it was obvious that the treaty would not last. Bertoxxulous then told the gnome of an ancient ritual. He kept the details secret, but informed the gnome that should the ritual be succesfully completed, it would bathe Norrath in Hate, destroying it completely.<br><br>&quot;But isn't that what you want Bert? To destroy the world?&quot; Flippus inquired.<br><br>&quot;Yes, but in my own way and in my own time. Cazic-Thule agrees with me on this and even now, he speaks with his most loyal of followers.&quot;<br><br>Flippus smiled, &quot;So I'm one of your most loyal followers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you are not. Nor are you anywhere near my most powerful,&quot; Flippus began to pout. &quot;You are perhaps however, my most.. &quot; Bertoxxulous paused in thought, &quot;.. entertaining. You make me laugh Flippus.&quot;<br><br>Flippus' frown quickly turned into a wide smile, &quot;Really? I make you laugh? That's great Bert! Thank you so much!&quot; Flippus stood up and hugged the plague rat.<br><br>&quot;Hey now!&quot; Bertoxxulous said, pushing the gnome off of him, &quot;I don't do hugs! I DON'T DO HUGS!&quot;<br><br>Flippus let go and apologized. Sitting back in his own seat, Flippus asked, &quot;So why are you telling me this? What do you want me to do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's rather simple really. I need you to go to the Arena in Lake Rathetear.. and stop the ritual.&quot; the Plaguebringer said matter-of-factly.<br><br>&quot;Wow! Really? I'll get going right away!&quot; Flippus jumped from his seat scrambling to get his gear. &quot;I'll need this.. and ooh, some of that, I wonder if it'll be cold. Hmm, I better pack an extra sweater.&quot; He looked over his shoulder at the rat and held up a pair of x-ray goggles &quot;Do you think I'll need these?&quot;<br><br>Bertoxxulous shrugged and said, &quot;Well, I suppose there will be a lot of female dark elves there.&quot;<br><br>Flippus giggled mischieviously, &quot;Hehe, yer right! There will be!&quot; Flippus finished packing and slung four backpacks over his shoulders. He reminded Bertoxxulous of a pack mule.<br><br>&quot;Well, I'm ready! Thanks for everything Bert!&quot; Flippus grabbed the plague rats paw and shook it, &quot;I won't let you down! I don't run very fast, so I'll get going now. You can stay here and help yourself to more wine. Bye!&quot; Flippus waved good bye and ran out the door.<br><br>Bertoxxulous poured himself another glass of fish wine and watched as Flippus ran into the distance. He couldn't help but laugh as he saw one of Flippus' backpacks dropping bone chips behind him. Drawing heavily from his glass, Bertoxxulous had a final thought, &quot;I hope he doesn't get himself killed.&quot; Putting the glass down, the plague rat then disappeared in cloud of green smoke.<br><br>/ooc: I wanted to add my tale regarding the rp event from sunday (which btw was a blast! kudos to sarhea and gore and everyone else that attended). But I also wanted to tell how Flippus came to the decision to go against the side of evil even though he's a necromancer himself. Thus, the story above. Part two follows... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uflipus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flipus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/9/02 4:11:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part 2</span><hr size=1> The ritual was planned for tomorrow evening in the Arena of Lake Rathetear. Flippus was still in the mountains of Steamfont. Quite a distance for a young gnome to traverse on his own. But Flippus was up to the task and promised Bert that he would be there. <br><br>As he left the safety of Ak'Anon, Flippus went through his mental checklist of supplies. Rations, water, bone chips, x-ray goggles. Yes, everything a young necromancer needed to survive in the wild. Flippus looked up at the sun and guessed that it was still early in the afternoon. He had the better part of the day to travel and if he needed, part of the night. He ran done the path towards the Faydark, waving at the Watchman as he passed. Before he entered the trail that would lead him into the Faydark forests, Flippus cast a spell, gathering the shadows around him to hide his form.<br><br>Flippus raced through the Lesser Faydark without incident and entered the forest of the Elves. &quot;Ah, the woodelves,&quot; Flippus mused, &quot;I used to like them..&quot; his normally cheerful face turning sour, &quot;that is until they stopped liking me!&quot; Looking towards the right fork, Flippus stuck out his tongue and offered a rude gesture towards Kelethin then proceeded down the left road towards the Spires.<br><br>Now everyone knows Flippus' theory on the High Elf Luclin Conspiracy and the associated scandal between the gnome and the King's &quot;secret harem&quot;, so it was not even a consideration for Flippus to take the &quot;magical gate&quot; to &quot;the Nexus&quot;. However, when Flippus reached the Spires he paused to watch so many others making use of its abilities. So what if the Nexus was an incredibly elaborate High Elf scam? It still cut great hours worth of travel time to mere minutes. If Flippus could gate to the North Karana Spires, it would save him an immense amount of time and energy. So he dropped his spell of invisibility, startling a Pixie in the process, and obtained the shard from the Nexus Scion. Regathering the shadows around him, Flippus sat beneath the small tree within the circle and waited. After about a minute, the boredom set in and Flippus began searching for something to do. At first, he thought that he might talk to the female Barbarian warrior, or perhaps the female Vah Shir, but thought better of the idea. Instead, he fished out his x-ray goggles and proceeded to make sure they still worked properly. He looked at the tall Barbarian, the lithe Vah Shir, and the dainty Scion. &quot;Yup, the goggles still work!&quot; Flippus giggled.<br><br>The wait time went by quickly after that, and soon Flippus found himself in the Nexus. Deciding not to press his luck, he removed his goggles and headed straight for the Antonica Scion. There he sat for only a minute or two before he was transported to the Karana's.<br><br>Running north towards the Gypsy Camp, Flippus made magical contact with Teder who was also in the area. They met at the camp and after Teder bound Flippus there, the two proceeded to hunt willowisps to kill time. It was soon discovered however, the Flippus was quite the wisp magnet, and unfortunatly Flippus was allergic to them (The multiple deaths of Flippus during this hunt is a great story in and of itself - but must be shared another time). Eventually, the two parted ways and Flippus journeyed south towards Lake Rathetear.<br><br>When Flippus crossed the bridge into the lands of South Karana, he re-cast the invisibility spell and marched south. This was the first time Flippus ever journeyed through this land and so was intrigued to see a huge gray beast with a long nose walking towards him. Thinking it was doubtful that the creature would see through his magic, Flippus walked right up to it. The creature was oblivious to his presence and so Flippus poked at it. Still recieving no response, Flippus climbed up the beasts side and proceeded to scream into its ear. This action solicited response and the elephant promptly grabbed Flippus with his nose, gently placed the gnome on the ground, and sat on him.<br><br>Flippus awoke in the Gyspy camp, naked and cold. Always willing to share his experiences, he proudly told everyone in his guild that he had been squished by an elephant. Getting up off the ground, Flippus ran back south across the bridge to collect his equipment. Once again gathering the shadows around him, Flippus continued his journey south.<br><br>Carefull to avoid any elephants, Flippus unknowingly ran right over the entrance to Split Paw. Luckily for him, there were many adventurers in the area hunting the gnolls. Passing into the area known as Lake Rathetear, Flippus &quot;hugged the right side of the cliffs&quot; until he reached the entrance to the Arena (ooc: that's the instructions someone in the zone gave me to get to the arena, thus my instructions to you Teder  )<br><br>Outside the entrance, the Aviaks seemed oblivious to the great Evil that was taking form behind them in the Arena. Looking up at the sky, Flippus surmised that he was about an hour or two early, then went into the tunnel. <br><br>Flippus had expected to see quite a few people there, but instead he could only sense the presence of five or six. As he continued down and out of the tunnel, Flippus had to cover his eyes from the sudden sunlight. As his eyes adjusted his jaw dropped open. Anyone who has seen the Arena can recall their initial reaction to its gargantuan size. Flippus was in awe. Running around the huge structure, he spotted the others. It was Sarhea, Gore, and three others. Flippus was too late. They had completed the Ritual and Flippus was the only one left. &quot;Bert will be angry..&quot; Flippus thought.<br><br>In actuality, Flippus was just too early. Sarhea and the others were merely preparing for the ritual, lighting candles and incense, reading out of the Necronomicon, and soaking their bodies in pigs blood (well, not really, might have been chicken blood  ). Gore took notice of the little gnome and instructed him to leave the area, for they could not be disturbed during the preparation. Atleast, that's what Flippus THOUGHT Gore might have said. It sounded like human, but Flippus was terrible at understanding human. Shrugging his shoulders, Flippus returned back to the entrance and summoned an assistant. This time, the temp agency sent Jabobaker. Flippus instructed him to guard him and to wake him up in an hour. Flippus then took a nap.<br><br>(/ooc: actually, i did get there early and i think gore did tell me to wait outside. so i decided to take a nap in RL. I set my alarm clock to wake me up in an hour - which was when the event was scheduled to start - and fell asleep. My next installment will be the actual event itself, for which i woke up late and was in a small panic lol)<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uflipus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flipus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/9/02 4:13:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=194.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part 3</span><hr size=1> &quot;Wow! It's like happy hour at Irontoe's!&quot; Flippus said out loud, describing the scene before him. Races from all of Norrath (and a few from Luclin) were running past him, heading towards the Arena. Flippus could hear the beginings of battle and he didn't want to miss a single moment of it. <br><br>He had woken up late, which was odd considering he had asked his skeletal pet to make sure he was woken at the top of the hour. Flippus looked quickly around for his pet and found it tucked away in the corner, snoring loudly in a puddle of its own drool. Shaking his head, Flippus grabbed the skeleton's leg bone and used it to conk it's skull.<br><br>&quot;Hey you! Wake up! We're late!!, Flippus yelled. &quot;I told you to wake me up! Aaargh!&quot; he continued to rant, knocking on the hollow skull. The skeleton brushed Flippus' hand away and continued it's nap. Jabobaker was not going to go anywhere.<br><br>Flippus sighed (clearly disappointed). With a wave of his hand and an evil glare, Flippus dismissed his servant. &quot;I really should stop going through that temp agency.&quot; Turning back towards the tunnel exit, Flippus made a mad dash for the Arena.<br><br>As soon as Flippus emerged from the tunnel he called out to his guild, &quot;I'm here! Don't start without me!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Flippus!!&quot;, cried out Karizma, &quot;Get your sexy butt over to the entrance!&quot; (ok, she didn't say 'sexy'.. but she was thinking it *nod*) <br><br>&quot;Who else is here? Is there room for me? Wait, I need a bind! What are we gonna do?!&quot;, in his excitement, Flippus began to ask questions in a rapid-fire fashion. Flippus finally reached the entrance and met with the others, &quot;Where are we gonna go? Who should I try to kill? Can someone give me a bind?&quot; he paused, &quot;Why are there so many Iksar?&quot;<br><br>He saw Snumpkin running up to him, &quot;Snumpkin! How have you been? Who's the leader of the group? Can I join? Is there room? Wow, what kind of robe is th..&quot;<br><br>Snumpkin covered Flippus' mouth, &quot;Calm down! Xianya is the leader. She's headed back this way to get you. Now be quiet!&quot; Flippus nodded silently as Snumpkin removed his hand.<br><br>Xianya suddenly appeared behind Flippus, &quot;There you are! Come on! Let's go!&quot; She grabbed Flippus' sleeve and began to drag him towards one of the decorative pillars behind the entrance. Snumpkin followed behind them, picking up the bone chips that were falling out of Flippus' pack.<br><br>As they all gathered behind the pillar, Snumpkin revealed his plan, &quot;What we'll do, is levitate over the wall, to one of the inner pillars. Then we'll swoop down from the sky like Gnomish paratroopers!&quot;<br><br>Gneen raised his hand, &quot;Umm, what's a paratrooper?&quot;<br><br>The other Gnomes all shrugged, but that wasn't what was important at the time.<br><br>&quot;That's not important at this time,&quot; said Snumpkin, &quot;What IS important is that we stop the ritual!&quot; The gathered Gnomes all cheered.<br><br>One by one, as the levitation spells were cast, each Gnome climbed up the first pillar, then crossed the open air over the Arena wall and climbed to the top of the second pillar.<br><br>&quot;You know Snumpkin, this is pretty sneaky.&quot; Flippus commented when he finally reached the second pillar.<br><br>Snumpkin grinned an almost Necromancer like grin, &quot;I know, I used this tactic to get into a G.. nevermind what I used this tactic for.&quot; Rubbing his hands anxiously, &quot;Get ready. Summon a pet and use it to attack someone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooh! That's a great idea!&quot; Flippus said, quickly sitting down and opening his li'l black book, &quot;Now where is that number to that temp agency?&quot;<br><br>While searching for the proper spell, Flippus failed to notice that everyone had left him. It seemed that they were moving on to other parts of the Arena. When Flippus finally stood up, he found he had lost his friends. But more importantly, he had lost his levitation.<br><br>&quot;Whoa, I'm pretty high up!&quot; Flippus gulped, looking down at the Arena floor. He could barely make out anything from this height. &quot;I guess I better climb down a bit.&quot; Flippus slowly inched his way down the steep incline. As he neared the bottom, he lost his footing. With arms flailing and bone chips flying, Flippus slid down the rest of the pillar and came to a sudden and painful stop on the Arena floor. Luckily, he only took 301 points of damage.<br><br>Meanwhile, the other Gnomes were spreading out, picking targets and causing the general mayhem that only Gnomes can. Someone had brought a clockwork rubber-band gun and was using that to blind a few Dark Elves, while another was slinging flaming bags of poo into the melee (OK, it was me that was shooting rubber bands and throwing poo.. what did you expect from me?)<br><br>Suddenly Snumpkin cried out, &quot;Who killed Flippus?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Flippus killed Flippus!&quot; shouted a naked Gnome, running through the Arena with a corpse in tow. &quot;I didn't die from someone in the Arena. Do you think they'll mind if I come back?&quot; asked Flippus.<br><br>Everyone was too busy to answer Flippus, which was just as well since he had already begun to put his clothes back on. After he finished dressing, Flippus gathered the nearby shadows and began to circle the platform. Running along the wall, hiding behind pillars to catch his breath, he met up with Xianya. She appeared to be fighting an Erud, so Flippus took the time to summon a pet. The act of placing a call to a temp agency however, dropped the invisibility spell. As soon as his pet showed up, a rather sour looking Dark Elf came running towards them. Flippus barely had time to shoot a poisonous bolt at the Elf before his sword plunged into Flippus' chest. As Flippus fell to the ground, he grabbed at the Darkelf's ankle and bit him. Then the cold darkness surrounded him.<br><br>When Flippus awoke again, he was outside the Arena entrance. He was naked and cold. He looked around for a familiar face and saw Karizma sitting near the Iksar. Running over, he plopped down next to her and quietly said &quot;I died..&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>kinda in character: at this point, I just watched the battle. From what I can recall, the rest of the battle is as how the others have already described it. There is a point where Gneen and I head towards Lake Rathe to get the Cavalry (Teder). Ultimately, Gneen heads out to get Teder while I stop to talk to Damast at the tunnel entrance. Damast is one of the chosen, and he was apparently waiting for his cue to come in. I told him I died, and he consoled me. He said he would have preferred it if I didn't die. I guess Bert told him how entertaining I can be  I went back towards the Arena entrance at this time. Sarhea appeared just to the right of the Arena entrance and ran in to the fray. I saw Gore come out to meet her, and that's when all heck broke loose. All the Iksar charged in and pretty much beat everyone senseless. In fact, there were a few of us Gnomes gathered outside and when the Iksar charged, we ventured back into the Arena just to get a better look. So all these Iksar were running around killing things, while a bunch of naked Gnomes followed! I thought it was a very funny sight.<br><br>After the battle, I talked to Sarhea, Jaelyn the Ranger and some hot Dark Elf chick. I don't think any of them noticed that I had my xray goggles on *grin*<br><br>--<br><br>ooc: Again, it can't be said enough how great this event was!  Even though I died quickly, (and quickly again)  I still had fun interacting with everyone!
