For the benefit of those who haven't read the other thread, I'll recap.  He was a new player, and didn't know a lot, and knew absolutely nothing about the trade skills or how they can benefit him.  He didn't know Raw Silk existed, or that any armor better than Cloth could be bought and was affordable.<br><br>So, somewhat shocked, I went a-spider hunting, and sewed him up an almost complete set of Raw Silk (his guild had given him some better pieces of armor here and there).  Charged my usual rate for it, and he was grateful.  (Raw Silk is, by the way, trivial to me, and Giant Spiders are, too.  Need to go find some of those Crag Spiders I've heard of.)<br><br>Then I told him about stat-boosting jewellry.  He had no clue.  He kept asking &quot;Where do I go to buy it?&quot;  I said &quot;just watch the /auctions for people selling jewellry and contact them&quot;.<br><br>I think, to some extent, we who do the trade skills have dropped the ball on outfitting younger adventurers.  I know many of these &quot;lesser&quot; items are trivial to us, and don't get us the money that the &quot;big ticket items&quot; do, but lots of low-to-mid-level characters are ecstatic with their first +2 ring/earring, their first piece of banded armor, or their first piece of raw silk.<br><br>So, those of us who are more experienced need to do one of two things: either meet the demand (and, believe me, it's there), or teach these younger members the value of the trade skills so that they can provide the supply for the &quot;lesser&quot; items.  Remember, a lot of them are completely new to the game.  All they've encountered is hack-and-slash and the items they pick up from that.  At the low and mid-range levels, sometimes the craft-made items are better than what they're picking up.<br><br>Lasgalen, decent tailor, terrible blacksmith (damned metal bits; damned studs) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/22/02 6:57:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1169.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where Have All the Traders Gone?</span><hr size=1> There are alternatives through quests and mob drops that provide stat boosting jewellery. If the player is new they might have some trouble figuring out the +3 int earring quest (not lore) in Qeynos, or the +3 int, 10 mana ring (lore) quest in Qeynos. Then of course there's the GBS int item (+10?) that drops off a rare near qeynos... wow, thats +19 int from mobs a level 7, 5 and 12(?) respectively can do before TLC gets them.<br><br>Hmm, course they would all be TLC'd (he's 16th you say?) so he couldnt get to them anyway. Maybe he should restart his wizzie in Qeynos.. they seem to have the TLC advantage for young casters.<br><br>Bottomline is I would have to agree with you. It'd be nice if the tradesmen on this server could somehow organize a day of the week to help out the younger casters. Not that they would have to lower prices etc...just make themselves available.

I'm not sure of the numbers, but I had trouble selling a pair of splitpaw gloves (that I aquired in a trade) to a young druid because he was saving up for AGI gear?  When I told him he was better off buying the gloves for 10p because they gave decent druid AC + wis, he asked what wisdom does. I have people looking at me and saying things like &quot;wow, excellent armor, sire&quot; (I'm in banded and leather).<br><br>I feel new, and very old on this server. Because of my experience I was able to roll up my new chars, and by levels 9, and 7 make one of them a master smith (I really enjoy tradeskills). But, what I find is that even though there are many  people running around in leather, there is no real market for banded (due mostly to Naivete). <br><br>A few experienced rangers and warriors are grabbing for the stuff (and there is never a real, or long term market such as there is for jewelry), but I feel it may be weeks if not months before the general population of this &quot;wave&quot; begin to know about such things-at least the new folks.<br><br>So yes, we need to educate as many, and as often as we can.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udreks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreks</A> at: 1/22/02 11:01:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 4:29:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1169.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where Have All the Traders Gone?</span><hr size=1> Dreks:<br><br>I saw you in Kelethin today.

I'll admit, we don't have anyone sitting around in any cities auctioning raw silk and 2 stat rings, but really, where does one ever see that anymore?  If you need any trade, or want to know what any particular trade can do for you, feel free to run a /who all Starspun and ask someone to put you in touch with an appropriate trader.  I'm sure whoever you get will be only too happy to help.<br><br>Valquiss <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1169.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1169.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1169.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1169.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1169.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1169.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
