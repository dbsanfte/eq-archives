<br>
As you have already ventured from Ak'Anon and across the Ocean of Tears, I presume that you also know that you have been assigned a &quot;guardian&quot; of sorts.<br>
Being as inquisitive as always, I have managed to round up these two letters from drawers of our honourable King, concerning this Stoppelton that you are supposed to meet in Freeport. <br>
Do not worry, these are ofcourse not the original ones, but only a copy of them, so on one will know that I have sent you these letters.<br>
<br>
As you can read in the two letters, I am not sure which is more dangerous, your guardian or the dangers you will face on the journey. But I shall pray for your wellbeing in our Church, and encourage you to take caution, and not rely on anyone but yourself for protection. <br>
You have already learned much in the ways of Magic, and I hope that they will be enough to complete your mission and bring you back safely to our home.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
May Solusek Ro grant you the power to complete your mission.<br>

<br>
It is with a certain joy that I can inform you, that our &quot;thirsty&quot; and &quot;slightly enthusiastic&quot; friend of the Deep Muses, has been sent off to Halas.<br>
As you agreed, I had him understand that he is now the General of the 1st Clockwork Expeditionary Force, and that he would serve Ak'Anon in an honourable and meaningful way. So that clears the problem we had discussed earlier.<br>
Having him stationed in far, far away Halas should keep him occupied, which will leave us free to restore the pride and reputation, that the Paladins have lost due to this person, over the last year or so.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

You have obviously &quot;assigned&quot; this drunkard Starkweather to assist us in our efforts to rid ourselves of the Ice goblin tribes. An honourable deed, I am sure, if it were not for the fact that this drunkard is causing us more trouble than the goblins.<br>
<br>
At first he has been trying to exercise his &quot;authority&quot; as a formal envoy of Ak'Anon...And I assure you, that any Gnome from the Steamfront Mountains, holds no authority in these lands.<br>
In addition to that, he has been rambling around Halas, completely drunk and causing more destruction, than a stampede of wild Mammoths could. Not to mention that he bores us all, with his obviously fictional war stories.<br>
 <br>
Thus I call upon you to withdraw him to your own lands of the Steamfront Mountains, or we shall exercise our swift justice upon him, and be sure to &quot;repay&quot; your favour.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
It is with great pride that I can inform you, that the King himself have assigned me to assist and protect you in this mission you have undertaken to visit the Erudites of Odus, or whatever it is you librarians of the Eldrich Collective are up to. <br>
Being the General of the 1st Clockwork Expeditionary Force, I can assure you that I am quite capable of protecting you from whatever dangers we might find on our way. Except, maybe, from the hordes of young maidens that always follow in my wake.<br>
<br>
I have somewhat recently been assigned to assist the Barbarians of Halas, in their endeavour to rid the lands of the Ice goblin clans. They have been most pleased with my service, so pleased in fact that they have reached their goal within a matter of weeks after I arrived. <br>
So it seems that our King, have seen fit to assign me to this new mission.<br>
<br>
I look forward to assisting a member of the Eldrich Collective, and I am certain that you will be pleased with my swordsmanship, in addition to my many stories and anecdotes, which are most interesting and entertaining. In fact, I am sure that by now, the League of Antonican Bards, sing and tell tales of my bravery, valour and achievements. But then, I presume you have heard the legends already.<br>
<br>
At the docks of Freeport, I will await you, so we can start our trek across the Antonican continent and we should reach Odus within a week. Don't forget to bring your walking stick!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At ease, Soldier!<br>

**********<br>
The Clockwork Army<br>
<br>
From out the gates of  Ak’Anon,  a clamour, shrill and loud,<br>
The Clockwork army marches, a daft unruly crowd,<br>
From Odus to the snows of Halas, where ever they will roam,<br>
From Calabis to Luclin, hear the cry of “Go Home Gnome!”<br>
<br>
With a drunkard for a general, they march in quest of wars,<br>
But some how their success rate is far more in finding bars,<br>
A raggle tag , a motley crew, a joke in poorest taste,<br>
Please shout a zone wide warning, they are in the Eastern Waste.<br>
<br>
In Halas, hailed as heros, if you listen to their tale,<br>
In fact the General did impress them with his endless thirst for ale,<br>
And as the MacQuaids bounced him, they wrote on his small and shiny dome<br>
In bright blue woad and ashes, just one plea, to “Go Home Gnome”.<br>
<br>
The Clockwork Army marches, quick! Put the clerics on alert!<br>
The clanking legend once more rides, someone will sure be hurt,<br>
Their eyes are red and fired up, is it the elven wine, or zeal?<br>
My sides may split from laughing, please throw me one more heal!<br>
<br>
So I’ll sing a song of valour, and I’ll sing a song of cheer,<br>
And if you need a merry giggle, I’ll sing for you to hear,<br>
Of the Clockwork Expedition, in truth a very funny poem,<br>
And please join me in the chorus as we all chant “Go Home Gnome!”<br>

I have completed my tasks in the Erudin Library, though I must say not without incident.  It seems my 'bodyguard' made quite a ruckus while we were in there, and some High Man named Sergian came in, quite irate with us.  I didn't think we were as loud, nor the dilemma as bad as he insists, but it seems he has deemed it necessary for us to redeem ourselves (I doubt this possible in his eyes).  I am afraid he is taking us off somewhere now with him, but where I am not sure.

<br>
I have traveled to our first destination with this fool Sergian, and now my suspicions of his lunacy are confirmed.  We traveled to the lands of Velious, told that we were going to 'meet someone'.  Sergian apparently ditched Stoppelton in one of the bars of 'Thurgadin' and took me alone off.  I'm not complaining in that regard.  However, the company we sook was far from what I expected! <br>
<br>
At the entrance to Thurgadin, we were greeted by none other than an Erudite Heretic and two Tier'dal!  The horror!  Picking up quickly on Sergian's alias and simply not acknowledging my connections to the collective, I traveled to a set of caverns with them, nervous all the way.  <br>
<br>
It became clear after some time in the caverns that 'Littany', the Heretic, did not believe for a minute Sergian's alias was who he was, though Sergian seemed in denial that she could flush out his real identity.<br>
<br>
I'm writing this letter to you from Froststone, a lost Coldain city in the bottom of the caverns.  I shall keep you updated as long as I can, or until I'm killed because of an Erudite's mistake.<br>

<br>
I have been following my mission to the very brink of perfection, and even though this dusty librarian of the Eldrich Collective, seems to be hell-bend on running head first into mortal danger, I have been more than successful in keeping him alive and well.<br>
I have still not grasped exactly what his mission is, but it seems to involve alot of travelling, and listening to the inane ramblings of two airheaded Erudites.<br>

But at any rate, I merely wished to notify you that everything is going accordingly and I hope that we can ditch these Erudites and come home soon. I cannot wait to stroll through the gates of Ak'Anon, while the hordes of Gnome cheering and praising the return of the Clockwork Crusader.<br>

<br>
Rather it is a package from one Kyri, of the League of Shadows. It is addressed with a flourish to Lord Gray, Guest within the League of Honour.  From the various buzzings and smell of the package, and the way it jitters independantly on the table, it would seem perhaps wise to not deliver this. Quietly, Meledi takes out a quill, and marks on the box... insufficient postage, and puts it in the bag that is bound for Neriak.<br>

If you thought Sergian's lunacy was questionable, think no more.  I am now in possession of certain proof the man is insane.  He has apparently started a conflict in the city of Paineel, and it is there that I will travel next.  I fear only that the Tier'Dal and the Heretic I met already know of my plans.<br>

<br>
I write in regard to one Zippus Maximor, a wizard of your school.  <br>
<br>
I cannot praise this gnome enough!  Although at times he seems overly cowed by a couple of erudites, when not in their company he is a cheerful, diligant companion.<br>
<br>
Recently he fought with us against evil in the city of Paineel, and actually defeated an heretic priestess of the League of Shadows.<br>
<br>
I hope you do not mind that he has elected to stay with us for a time. I consider the loan of his skills to be one that puts the League of Honour in your debt.<br>
<br>
Yours Sincerely<br>
Meledi Weaver<br>
League of Honour<br>
