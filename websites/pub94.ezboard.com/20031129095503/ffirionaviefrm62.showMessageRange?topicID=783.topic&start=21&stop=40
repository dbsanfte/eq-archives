<br>
Being an acual Eagles Fan...<br>
<br>
McNabb is slightly better then say, Randall Cunningham.<br>
<br>
Does he get more Hype then Rich Gannon? The fact that I had to pause for a second to acually remember the Quaterback that took the Raiders to the Superbowl kinda proves that, but again I'm biased since I basically grew up on eagles football.<br>
<br>
Rush didn't use poor judgement or any of that bullshit, the world is just too god damned lame to handle a white guy saying the word black. Please, get the fuck over it.<br>
<br>
McNabb's good. He does more then just run and toss. I still would put him in the top 5 QB's of the League.<br>
<br>
His stats aren't that great, why? Cause our number 1 Reciever is James Thrash. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Acually, its looking more like Todd Pinkston but at any rate, give the man Jerry Rice and I'll give you the Black Steve Young.<br>
<br>
Still with Subpar Recievers (average at BEST), he took them to two back to back NFC Championship games. <br>
<br>
But he has a problem. McNabb is the master of the Choke. In both games he sucked horribly, thus he choked it for us. <br>
<br>
When you follow a Team that hasn't been to the Superbowl since 1981 (BTW thats when I was frikken BORN, 2 Months AFTER the eagles got stomped by the Raiders), you get kinda miffed that he choked both times in the big game. (well, to us being Philly Sports fans)<br>
<br>
I think he's right, personally. Not to the Degree that Rush thinks I'm sure, but their is a little here, and a little there. McNabb is good, hell, he's great, but he's not Rich Gannon. Rich is a better QB.<br>
<br>
McNabb may overtake him some day, maybe all he needs is a reciever that can catch.. but thats a different rant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So in closing, get a fucking grip. These problems will continue to exist as long as the US fears race.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, I'm not done yet.<br>
<br>
WTF is with all of the people who are trying to Lynch Rush verbally now. Its like everyone of color is trying to lynch the guy now. WTF, Its like we're trying to get back at them or something, and thats really lame.<br>
<br>
Taken out of context, very confused by a public shocked by a 5 letter word that shares the color of my text. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roninsenshi>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia<br>Jihad on that ass!</span><br>  Posts: 2296<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/03 4:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Limbaugh vs McNabb</span><hr size=1> McNabb DOES have a little problem with his Accuracy. <br>

You guys are not explaining where the racism in the comment was.  You are assuming something to be the case that is not the case.<br>
<br>
Here is a good article by Slate, not exactly a riproaring conservative paper:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2089193/">slate.msn.com/id/2089193/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I do not like Rush Limbaugh.  I think he is loudmouthed and arrogant and don't agree with most of his views.  That said, in the case at hand, I don't see any racism at all.<br>
<br>
His only comment with respect to race was that the media wanted a black quarterback to do well and that is why he got extra attention.  The Slate article above shows a statistical comparision between McNabb and Johnson.  It shows how Johnson, someone no one is claiming to be a superstar but is white, has fared better than McNabb with nowhere near the hoopla.<br>
<br>
Over the last few of years watching pro football closely, I had thought the exact same thing that Limbaugh articulated.  McNabb is a decent quarterback but not as good as the hype he gets.  I would be excited to watch the Eagles play to see him in action only to see their defense carry the day for them.  People can talk about the impact race has on our lives without being racist.  Making that observation isn't racist; it reflects reality.<br>
<br>
There are many reasons for folks to dislike Limbaugh but there wasn't any racism in his comment.  <br>

Rush focused on his race being the reason. His comment on the positive attention was negative. I don't think if it was a white person that was being discussed it would be negative. Racism in these days is more subtile than ever before. A common factor in racism these days is that if any positive attention is paid to a particular race, it seems like people of other races are quick to jump in and criticize it. It's a jealousy. It's a jealousy based on race, and I would consider that racism.<br>
<br>
Trakon, I appreciate your sincerity in asking the question. It's difficult for us of different races to see and appreciate what other races experience.<br>

But what if was a white Liberal quarterback?<br>
<br>
But seriously, now you making assumptions that can not be proven.  You may be right, may be wrong, but in the end that doesn't have much bearing on what he DID say.<br>
<br>
What Limbaugh said was stupid and inaccurate... but not anything racist.<br>

However, I think that Limbaugh's track record does contribute to people taking borderline comments and reading them that way, and that is his own fault.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kebkin>Kebkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/03 10:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Limbaugh vs McNabb</span><hr size=1> Statement #1:  <br>

African-Americans are not suited to play QB in the NFL because their intellectual capablity is below that of a white QB.  African-Americans are better suited to play positions such as RB, WR and defensive back where their speed and quickness are more important than their thinking ability.<br>
<br>
Statement #2:  <br>
<br>
Some players in the NFL get more media hype because they are African-Americans.<br>
<br>
Statement #1 is an example of racism.  Anyone who says something like this should expect to get some flak from it.  <br>
<br>
Statement #2 is an observation on the current state of affairs.  It is either a correct observation or an incorrect observation.  If it is a correct observation (i.e. can be proven by facts) pointing it out as an existing condition is not a racist action.  If it is an incorrect observation (i.e. can not be proven by facts), then the person making the statement is guilty of making an unsubstantiated claim.   <br>
<br>
Lets put Statement #2 through another test.  If an African-American football commentator made the same exact statement, would it have gotten the same amount of attention?   I think the answer is resoundingly No.   So if that is the case, then how could it be classified as a racist comment?  <br>

Personally, I don't see it as being racist.  It's just bad football analysis.  But Rush was the one that interjected the idea of race into the discussion - and with his reputation he knew exactly what would happen.  <br>
<br>
If he had said that Donovan McNabb is overhyped by the media and the Philly defense carried that team the last few years, fine.  That is a legitimate discussion.  But HE added the bit about the NFL's &quot;social concern&quot; which was pretty assinine IMO.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't surprise me a bit if he was really happy with the way things have turned out, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he had every intention of getting kicked off the show at some point to get him some publicity.<br>
<br>
Now, the painkiller issue - I'm not so sure he's happy with that kind of attention.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It may be substanciated or not substanciated, but nothing detracts from the fact that he made the claim based on race. I also don't know of any African American football commentators that would make such a comment, because most people that are sensitized to racism, either through life experiences or just plain learning, would never make such a statement. I consider the statement to be racist. It's glaringly apparent in my eyes. But then, it's not like I've lived a discrimination free life either. I don't hold it against anyone else if they can't see the statement for what it is. Your own personal life experiences will dictate how you view things. Just as I don't hold it against you for viewing it the way you do, you should not hold it against anyone for feeling that it was a racist comment.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

I recieved Vicadin(sp) after my gum surgery and all I can say is WOW. Thank goodness I don't have easy access to these drugs and I am not willing to get them illegaly.<br>
<br>
It isn't that they make you feel good it is just that you don't feel all those everyday pains that you never even knew they were there until you didn't have them any more.<br>
<br>
I'm suprised that the Anti-Drug control contingent isn't all over this as just another example of why the war on drugs is a shame and bogus.<br>
<br>
I am disappointed in Rush for a guy that has been smart enough to do so well in the entertainment industry to have set up getting illegal drugs in such a slip shod way is just sad.<br>

On the other hand he will probably have some incredably capable lawyers and because he is in the entertainment business not much will happen to him.<br>

There is a double standard or maybe to put it clearer there is this common situation that if a white male makes any statement that can be in any way construde as not pro minority then it is because they are a bigot.

No, they're not.  They bill themselves as serious &quot;political commentators&quot;, and there are hordes of people who believe they're speaking the gospel truth in terms of politics.

I don't think Rush (and Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, etc) are &quot;just entertainment&quot;.

Nowhere in that quote was it said that Rush Limbaugh is around purely for entertainment purposes.  Entertainment is a huge part of his job, though.  I listen to Rush in the car.  I don't listen to NPR.  Know why?  Rush is infinitely more entertaining.<br>
<br>
Rush has amazing political pull.  Hannity and the rest do, too.  And, yes, some people do take what they say as gospel truth.  I don't think these are the people that the afore-mentioned personalities want associated with their shows, though.<br>

However, I have an almost eidetic memory for things I've read.  I can't always remember exactly what was said, but I can certainly remember who wrote what and where it was written.  And I have a vast personal library.<br>
<br>
So...  you ask &quot;what studies?&quot;<br>
<br>
From Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We just concluded a study of 360 people, whom we watched watch the health care reform debate for nine months.  And at the end of that period, we took the people who said they relied on talk radio, and by this we mean primarily Rush Limbaugh. . . . And we asked them how well informed they felt. . . .  Of all the people we watched, they said they were the best informed.  And of all the people we watched, they were the least informed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The study was conducted by asking people a number of questions of objective fact, such as &quot;Which groups (the elderly, poor, middle class, etc.) are most likely to be uninsured?&quot;  Limbaugh listeners were highly likely to give incorrect answers to these questions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/03 2:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Limbaugh vs McNabb</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is a double standard or maybe to put it clearer there is this common situation that if a white male makes any statement that can be in any way construde as not pro minority then it is because they are a bigot.

<br>
In my mind, there was no question that the statement was racist. In your mind, perhaps it was not. I will take a huge leap and venture to guess that you're not in a minority group. There is a subtile difference in what Rush said as opposed to other sports commentators in regards to the race issue. And I'll give you two really good examples of this.<br>
<br>
Chan Ho Park- One of the few Korean baseball players in the major leagues. A lot of attention was paid to him, but it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>positive</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> attention. He was admired for making the major leagues despite the obstacles that were placed before him. I personally admire him for such a remarkable achievement. I don't know where his career is now, but I do know he was praised for making it to the major leagues.<br>
<br>
Yau Ming- Chinese basketball player. You've seen him on commercials. A lot of positive attention has been paid to him  because he made it into the NBA. How many Chinese players are on the NBA? He's the only one that I know of, there might be more..but I really only pay attention to my Lakers. <br>
<br>
You never heard of any groups protesting the admiration that these two gentlemen have received. That's because the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>intent</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the attention was understood, and quite frankly, shared with the people whose communities they came from.<br>
<br>
Now you have Rush come along with his drug infested self and he makes a comment that attributes a ball player's attention to his race. He presents it in a negative light. Although I was offended, I certainly wasn't surprised. People that are racist, and it matters not what race you're from, eventually let the verbal diarrhea flow and they show their true colors. This is what happened to Rush.<br>
<br>
Arguing that minorities make outragious statements is not germane to the question posed, which asked us why we felt the comments were racist. That's a broad charge to make, doesn't identify the individuals involved, and basically lacks merit on the face of it. I'm sure people of all colors make outragious statements. We were asked to comment specifically on what Rush said.<br>
<br>
I'm sure it's not easy for the Conservatives on this board see Rush go down in flames as if he was shot down by the &quot;B-1 Bomber&quot; In my opinion, it's about damn time this idiot was exposed for what he truly is, which is a racist, hypocrite, liar, drug addicted, drug traffiking moron.

<br>
Running Quaterbacks are just more exciting to most people then one that stays in the pocket. Steve Young got his share of kudos as well, because he could run, he was tough, I think McNabb and Steve Young are pretty much the same type of QB, only difference is that Steve had Rice and Rice just makes QBs, hell, Jerry Rice MADE the West Coast offense. But the failure of the West Coast offense is another rant for another day.<br>
<br>
The point can be made back and Forth, is the media more friendly to Black QBs? I personally do not know, and I think it can be called both ways.. some times I do notice the Media giving Mike Vic, McNabb, and Culpepper a bit more credit.<br>
<br>
But I don't think its grossly overplayed. Hell, Culpepper';s out and Gus is in, hes getting a lil hype. Gannon gets his.. I guess.<br>
<br>
I am biased however, I do live in Philly.. well I did before the army crap. Of course I'm gonna see McNabb and such.<br>
<br>
Also, do you fail to realize that the Eagles Defence is pretty much all Black? Ever since Timmy Hauck left, I havent seen a non black guy on that defence. <br>
<br>
What else..<br>
<br>
You guys speak as if Rush was COMPLETLY off the mark here. I dont listen to Rush much, if at all, but I think he was closer to the truth then you all seem to realize.<br>
<br>
I also find it funny the timing of his little drung propblem that surfaced happened now. Sounds like the Arnold Syndrome all over again.<br>
<br>
The statements were about race but not racist. They were in fact calling the Media racist. He did not insult the playing ability of McNabb. He just said that the MEdia said he was better then he really is. Which is his opinoin, which he has a right to that opinion, and he has the damned Right to SAY that opinion on ESPN.<br>
<br>
He did not say black QBs suck at the position, that all black QBs are running QBs and what the hell ever sterotypical statement you can come up with.<br>
<br>
I personally think that the reason McNabb and such gets alot of kudos is because the Running QB is exciting to people. Brings up raatings because its unexpected. When he goes, its unexpected and shocking!~ WTF the QB can't do that! Thats why McNabb gets the upbuff by the media, its not race related. Steve Young got the same kind of thing. Hell, David Akers gets the same kinda thing, the Eagles kicker, for being a Kicker that can ACUALLY TACKLE. Of course a Kicker doesnt get the same attention as a running QB.<br>
<br>
Thats why McNabb and Johnson, while their stats are the same, McNabb gets better er.. attention I guess.<br>
<br>
And the hell with Johnson, damn Bucs, next year that ass is ours. But oh well, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . They won the Super bowl.<br>
