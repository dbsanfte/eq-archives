His eyelids, fluttered open ever so slowly revealing the whites of his eyes.  Slowly, the pupils sank down and he became more and more aware of his surroundings.  He was lying on his back, strapped to a large block of wood.

Tendrils of what looked like yellowish green smoke were drawn from the gnome's flesh, drawn into the growing ball of sickly yellow light.  Flacon's back arched so quickly and so violetly that both his lungs collapsed.  He tried to scream, but with no breath all that came out was a sickening gurgle of black blood.  Avhi's hand, now fully encompassed in the essence she took from flacon, trembled with the power and energy that it contained.  Avhi's eyes gleamed with resolute satisfaction as she moved her hand towards her stomach.
