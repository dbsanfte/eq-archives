In EQ as in some P&amp;P RPG's you must kill to advance. A Thief dose not become more powerful by practicing her art, no the must go outside and kill things on the monster path to reach the next level. How dose killing things make you a better Ranger Wizard, or Shaman? <br>
<br>
<br>
Secondly I wish there were zero no nada static spawns, or re occurring spawns for that matter. Sorry but it's just weird to have Fippy Dewpaw die and re-spawn under that tree every fifteen mins.  Wondering encounters sure, but lets make them somewhat unique.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
also (This is not a huge problem on FV, but it dose exists.) A chat filter. It would be great if someone typed w00t and it came out Tremendous! D00d as Friend, U as you. it would certainly add to the suspension of disbelief.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally how about major bad guys who were controlled by actual people, instead of predictable AI?  How much more compelling would this be if a Lich king was an actual GM or even player who could command armies, steal a lore item for his dark purpose?<br>
<br>
I know some of what I am wishing for may not be practical, but I think it would give EQ much greater depth, and after all this is a wish list right?<br>

There are just level-caps on the skills.  Your skills go up when you use them (eg. the more sword swings or spell casts, the more those skills go up).<br>
<br>
There are GM controlled creatures, or rather, there were.  They tried this back at EQ release with dynamic quests.  For the most part, it was a disastrous failure and Verant has pretty much abandonded GM v. player fights.  After attending a few of these, I now will go to extreme measures to avoid having anything at all to do with any GM-controlled fight.  The only good GM quests I've heard of involved a single small group of players fighting MOBs at the behest of the GMs, not fighting GM-controlled creatures.<br>
<br>
VI might run another of these someday.  If they do, I hope you're there to see it and I hope it works out.  Usually, they end up horribly lagged as countless kewl d00ds gate in en mas to try to kill the GM (even if the GM is just trying to start a dialogue for a quest and not a GM fight).  I think there's more chance of it working out right on FV than any other server, but l'm still not going anywhere near these things.<br>
<br>
BTW, I like the general idea of a GM-run quest or fight, but VI just can't get it right.  It really should be done on a sign-up basis.  Sign-up your group for a dynamic quest.  GM contacts y'all to fix a time/date.  Y'all show up and off ya go!  No crowds.  No lag.  No big rush to the suddenly announced quest zone.  No logging in when the quest is half-done.  And, best of all, no kewl d00d army screaming &quot;gank da GM, get dat phat lewt!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubalamoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balamoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 11:19:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=982.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> True..but</span><hr size=1> &gt;Actually, EQ is skill based.

<br>
Yes but to become healthier, more powerful you have to go out and kill things. Not that I'm a passive. The whole level thing seems a bit trite to me. I wish there was an alternate way. If you are a warrior of-course this is the best way to become more powerful, but a mage?<br>
<br>

I remember those actually. yes They failed. They failed because VI encourages Kewel D00ds. I was thinking of  giving  Norrath it's version of say The Warlock  Lord, or Saramon (SP?)  Huge  larger than life bad guys that effects the world around them. And it's pretty hard for a GM to have a kewel d00d Gank her when   she controls a Huge army of Gnolls, or Undead.<br>
<br>
The whole concept behind EQ was a living world where an epic story unfolded. GM's are now reduced to baby sitting griefers. They have given up EQ to the D00ds.  It's a shame because one day some company is going to come along and get it right . <br>

I once went from 40 to 50 without ever killing anything, playing an enchanter. I wanted to see if it was possible. The route I took was helping others for looting rights to aviak charms, make crafted gauntlets, do quest, sell gauntlets to vendor for huge monetary loss, then get back to helping folks again. It was a completely different game that way. People thought I was pretty crazy, since the amount of money I 'threw away' was large, but that's a matter of opinion, and if *I* had fun, and spent virtual money to do it, well, my choice. I financed the money by doing jewelcraft.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are other ways to do this as well, other quests, perhaps with less monetary cost, especially for lower levels. But anyway, leveling pacifistically *is* actually possible. Whether it is FUN or not or whether it is 'worth it' or not, well, that's up to each person to decide.<br>
