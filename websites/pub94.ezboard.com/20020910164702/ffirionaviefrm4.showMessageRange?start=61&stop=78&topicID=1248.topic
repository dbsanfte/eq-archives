Just randomly typing a series of words after every name that posted does not make you right. People are trying to give examples outside this game because people like you have no idea how to apply real life integrity to a game. Yes it is a game, but integrity still counts. Wake up and smell the ebay. <br>
<br>
And yesw tax evasion is a felony, lying on your taxes is not. The difference is in the scope, just like the example you have so flagerantly ignored.<br>

If you feel the need to abide by 'silly' rules, be my guest.  however, just because a troupe of lawyers in fancy suits want to 'cover their asses' (yes, this is what rules are for, rules are not there to protect you as the end user. they are there to remove any liability Sony and VI might incur through some odd set of circumstances).  <br>
<br>
Why did they implement rules governing transferrance of account info?  so they don't have to deal with hacked and recovered (ebay cheaters) accounts, missing items, etc.  Sony and VI give jack nor shit about the integrity of their playerbase.  <br>
<br>
The argument used to show how account borrowing is ok but selling is not is ridiculous.  You are either for sharing of account information or you are against it; whether an account is sold or not is not the point.  If you are for account sharing in any way, and do in fact practice such, you are in violation of the EULA and have nothing to gain footing on in any argument against the selling of accounts.  Sure there may be a difference (being morally objective here) between the selling of accounts and a simple sharing of accounts for random usage, but not according to the EULA.  So again, if you are against one you are against the other, there is no middle ground here.  With some of those things in mind, I choose to just not bother following suit after pressing that accept button.  After all, are they really going to bother with minor violations of their CYA license agreement?  Doubtful indeed.<br>

This analogy is stupid, and doesn't work.<br>
<br>
In this example they are asking you to specifically go out of your way to do something, whereas now they're only asking you to refrain from doing things. This is the way it goes for all EULAs across the board. You agree to keep the game to yourself.<br>

The EULA isn't silly, sorry. You seem to have a problem with the PnP as well, which I also don't think is silly.<br>

<br>
When you sell an account, you are selling property that is not yours, and, obviously enough, gaining a profit. When you let someone borrow an account, nobody is making or losing any money, and that is why it's not frowned upon as widely.<br>
<br>
And by your logic, I should say that you can't speak in any issue regarding game ethics, since you are an admitted KSer and trainer.<br>

This is exactly the kind of attitude we need less of, not only in the game, but in society in general. I can break the rules because they probably won't come after me. I can break the rules because they're small rules, and besides, everyone's doing it.<br>

EDIT: I changed the last line to be something of more reason.<br>
<br>
You break the rules just because you can get away with it. If the EULA was especially unreasonable, like the law in Idaho that states that you can't ride a carousel on Sundays under penalty of incarceration, I might be able to understand your reluctance to follow it.<br>

If you break the speed limit you have no integrities!!!!<br>
<br>
...<br>
(note: in this post, CAPITALS are used when a definition has been substituted for a word, so as to drive my point home)<br>
<br>
bog, my post is the dumbest thing you've ever heard? I guess I should be proud of myself. All I said was that by whatever definition of integrity you choose, the original poster (and many of the &quot;me too&quot; posters that followed) are using the word incorrectly. Instead of attacking their ADHERENCE TO A MORAL CODE (def of integrity) you should attack their COLLECTION OF BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG (def of moral code)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the anti-ebayers, you'd have to pick a moral code upon which to base your arguments. Here's a quick list of the popular ones: (note, these are dumbed down definitions, but should suffice here)<br>
<br>
Egoism: since this is a subjective belief system, you can't tell someone that ebaying is wrong because in egoism the person who's having the moral dilema chooses for himself what's right/wrong.<br>
<br>
Utilitarianism -- one should do what would most benefit the most people. Would it benefit more people to delete all the work put into the toon or to let someone else continue you it on?<br>
<br>
Hedonism: One should do whatever brings them maximal pleasure. Again, if ebaying brings you pleasure, hedonism would say to do it.<br>
<br>
I don't know the official name for this next one, I suppose it'd be like nationalism, but I mean the belief that one should do exactly as the law dictates. As previously shown, I don't agree with this (see independant thinking Jane) but I do recognize it as a possible moral belief. This would say not to ebay because it's against the eula, this would also say no account sharing, and everything else in the EULA. <br>
<br>
This is probably the most viable argument against ebaying, but these moral code falls victim to such examples as idependant thinking jane -- in other words, there are laws that exist that I (and probably you) would disagree with and we would not expect someone to follow them; thus our moral code is based on something other than law and alas our search must continue. (adding this in after rereading) This is the same as the jumping off the bridge because of the EULA argument, that's just a more extreme example. And the fact that jumping off the bridge is an action and not ebaying is an omission has no bearing on the issue. What if they were asking you to NOT play your favorite/highest toon? They're &quot;only asking you to refrain from doing things&quot;<br>
<br>
Existentialism: while not really a moral code in and of itself, existentialism would probably say something like &quot;If you are an ebayer, then to deny that you are not an ebayer by not ebaying would be to deny what you are, which is Bad Faith&quot; (on a side note: it's also bad faith to say that you are an ebayer, because you are that and more)<br>
<br>
We're now on to post what like 65-66? The original post was that people who stay in AS have no integrity. In my 'dumbest post ever seen' and this one (probably the second dumbest) I pointed out that it's not that they lack integrity, it's that they have a different ethical code than the poster. So far in all the posts we've seen there have been three reasons not to ebay<br>
1) It lacks integrities or something<br>
2) I wouldn't so you shouldn't either (I think Fuvi covered this one well)<br>
3) It's against the EULA (but that's l like, totally different from account sharing because like, I just ignore logic when it isn't like convenient for me) <br>
<br>
I'm sure there's something else I wanted to address in this post, but I've forgotten, so I'll stop for now and write more later.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53061">Aamorn</a> <br>Grandmaster</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fuvi>Fuvi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/02 12:23:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ask for beef, get wine</span><hr size=1> Borm, if you want people to follow the EULA because they are rules put in place, try following the rules of the board, no personal attacks.  It's already been cleared to personally attack me because I'm evil, but since we are supposed to follow the EULA which isn't enforced you should follow the Board Rules which aren't enforced to set an example.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  Lets say that we are talking about people who evade taxes, not like Enron, but just a single person. They claim more dependents, deductions, turn vacations into business trips. <br>
<br>
This will get you jail time if convicted in my country.  There is no oops I miscounted the number of children I have, was sure I had more than 2.<br>
<br>
If you want to give an example compare it to selling a Diablo saved game, recording movies off Pay-per-view or other things that don't involve jail.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't sell Fuvi, the possible monetary gain is rather trivial to me so I have no incentive to even consider it.  I wouldn't buy a toon, I can level any class to 50 in a month if I wanted to play a different one without having to deal with baggage.<br>
<br>
If someone (like original Eldraed) wants to sell his toon to pay his rent that month, buy a new stereo, upgrade his computer or get 20 cases of beer, good for him.<br>
<br>
Got the info from current Eldraed, the original spent about 2200h (allowing a fairly generous allotment of 70h for Eldraed II and III) meaning he actually made 23 cents an hour.  Money can't be the primary motivation for why Eldraed played the game for 6 months.<br>
<br>
Now that he has a copy of Dave Mirra with all the riders unlocked that he spent 2200h playing (a relevant comparison that doesn't involve police) he is no longer interested in playing, rather than sticking the game cartridge on the shelf he sells it to someone so they can play with the rare riders without having to invest all that time.  This is done with the motivation for profit, I have something others consider of value which no longer has value to me.  The fact that the item is then sold is not at all unusual in a free market system.<br>
<br>
If someone (like Eldraed III) would rather have a lvl 60 SK with 50 AA in a video game than $500 in his pocket, good for him.<br>
<br>
Personally it would take me 42 and a half hours, one work week, to get the $500 net.  In order to level an SK to 110 I would have to lose my mind first and then I would have to spend atleast 10 times that amount of time and that would require extensive grouping and some PL to get through the lower levels in order to accomplish.<br>
<br>
If the most fun I could have in the game was raiding with my RL friends and the sooner I could do that the happier I would be then my best course of action is to buy a character that can immediately let me do those things.  If the EULA was enforced and I could reasonably expect a bought toon to be banned this would not be a viable solution, but as it stands I can expect to buy a toon and play him as long as I want.<br>
<br>
A different real life person is now playing Eldraed, this has absolutely no impact on the server or any individuals on it.  The impact on individuals was from the original player of Eldraed leaving the server, you no longer had an in game means to contact him, whether or not the medium you had used to communicate with him is still in use or not has no real impact whatsoever.<br>
<br>
The impact on individuals will be how they deal with a new real person playing on this server, just go /ignore Eldraed and that impact on you is 0 assuming 30 other people haven't annoyed you to such a degree that ignoring Eldraed would place you at risk to get tells from someone else that you didn't want to hear from.<br>
<br>
The EULA has excessive standards governing the use of your account because they never intended to enforce it.  I don't have a problem with either Ichi or Scratchy playing both toons even though this is in violation of the EULA, if you have a problem with this your stringent moral standards will cause you more grief than gain I can assure you.<br>
<br>
I have no problem at all with a Necro (or SK) being logged on by someone else in order to retrieve corpses.  If you have a problem with this please explain to that person or those people how the EULA doesn't allow for account sharing and since the real person who is the only person entitiled to play the account isn't available atm you can't get your corpse(s) back yet.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with someone taking over the account of someone else to continue to provide the benefits that toon can to getting mobs dead on this server.  Because bottom line my fun revolves around things dying I can send tells, master a trade skill or learn languages just as well while doing challenging things that require 20, 30 and more people and the overwheling number of challenges revolve around getting something dead.<br>
<br>
Whether the person who has control of the account is motivated by friendship, greed or a sense of obligation it all comes out the same in the wash.<br>
<br>
You should actually want this too, the easiest way to get a group of people out of your way is by them getting stronger and wanting to try new challenges and leave behind old challenges that are new to you.  If you think it's a benefit to you if AS gets gutted because people in the guild are so concerned about what you think you're probably wrong.<br>
<br>
Hey I think we can handle Kelorek'Dar, no wait it's dead, lets go kill Lord Doljo, not up, lets go to PoG, oops AS in the zone.  But of course you could warm your heart thinking these guys used to kill Vindicator and now they are killing stuff I want and that's a good thing because....<br>
<br>
Oh sh!t it's not, I forgot I was supposed to be playing to have fun, I forgot that whichever of the 6 billion people on the planet is playing Eldraed has no bearing on me whatsoever, I forgot that the whole point of a massive multi-player game was it makes it easy to find people who match up to how I think and play and not to give me a glimpse of such a large cross-section of players I would be sure to see some things I didn't like.<br>
<br>
I'll remind you, play to have fun, address issues which affect your fun, post on the same thread as me it's a good idea to actually back up your opinions with facts or reasoning.<br>
<br>
The EULA is silly, no 2 ways about it, it was never written with the intention of being enforced.<br>
<br>

When you explictly accept the agreement by clicking on the corresponding button (labeled &quot;Accept&quot;), you are agreeing to the terms of the contract. Thus, we can conclude that everyone who breaks the EULA is a liar.<br>
<br>
They aren't giving you an alternative, folks. Agree to the EULA and click &quot;Accept,&quot; or disagree with the EULA and click &quot;Decline.&quot; I don't see a button between them labeled &quot;I agree to some of the rules, but not all of them.&quot; I'm not going to run about /reporting violators that I see. However, those of you who are standing in some &quot;gray area&quot; on this matter fail to realize that there isn't one.<br>
<br>
I don't hate the people that violate the EULA; I know several people that allow a close friend or family member to use their account from time-to-time, and I think that's reasonable. I still recognize that as a breach of contract. Whether or not the EULA would hold up in court (the general consensus is &quot;no&quot;), or whether or not the GMs actively enforce the EULA, is beside the point. There are rules. I did not create EverQuest, and I feel I am both morally and legally bound into following whatever guidelines have been set for me. I do not care if I'm the only one doing so.<br>
<br>
Paying $13 / month does not entitle me to doing whatever the hell I want to. It entitles me to play the game itself, and nothing more nor less. The rules come with the game, much like laws come with societies. It is not up to the individual to decide what rules are fit for upholding, and which ones are begging to be broken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usinnaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinnaji</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/02 1:58:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> I've never read th EULA, too long.

He spent a lot of time reading and replying to what YOU said, after all.<br>
<br>
BTW, here's my take on Fuvi noticing the loophole in my argument.  Yup, I agree.  About the only case where I've noticed that an ebay works out well for the server and the players as a whole is when a good concentious player uses it to switch classes, but keep playing with his friends at the level they're playing.  Out of all the ebay's I've know, I think about 3 or 4 fall into the &quot;it's a good thing&quot; class.  Most by far are a severe detriment to the server.<br>
<br>
For example, let's assume about 100 assorted level 60s sell their characters tomorrow for the rather small sum of $100 each.  A guild on Sullon Zek sees this and decides to snap up the characters and come over to FV to &quot;own da place&quot;.  And, they could.  A sufficiently determined raiding guild could kill just about every worthwhile spawn on FV before any of the current guilds got to them and there's literally nothing anyone could do to stop them.<br>
<br>
Public opinion carries no weight with the typical ebay.  He is not part of the comunity and thus does not care about it.  He only cares about what his friends think of him and he's having fun romping over everything with them.  Admittedly, this is an extreme example, but it shows one of the worst case scenarios.  Personally, if ebay ever becomes even a significant minority, I'm done with EQ.  Might as well play Diablo or some other short-term game with disposable characters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/02 6:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well, whether you disagree ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I've never read th EULA, too long.

Unlike Fuvi, I do not have the time to go point by point refuting his arguments, especially when most of them are based on his own flawed set of logical criteria. There is no way I will ever agree with his perspective, and there is no way he'll ever agree with mine, so I'm not wasting more time than 5 minutes in a silly &quot;logical&quot; debate over Ebaying in EQ. <br>
<br>
Some people argue a point to death just to argue, and that's what Fuvi does. I made my point, and I'm content with it. My view hasn't changed: You can't ethically sell what isn't yours, and your time spent playing EQ is for recreation, not to earn money. No one is forcing you to play EQ. You do so because you want to, so your time invested in a character is voluntary. PERIOD. Ha. I win again. PERIOD!!<br>

<br>
Most of the people on this server think that Ebaying is wrong, therefore it is a cultural more, or MORAL.<br>
<br>
Ebaying is against this servers morals. That's the community talking, something AS allegedly has no interest in. The community has also spoken and said stop it.<br>
<br>
If AS wants to continue this practice (and this isn't the only thing, they're pretty much as annoying as a guild can be, when it gets right down to it--come on, ASSOULS, shout some more OOC crap in zone please!), then they will be aggresively ignored by most of the server. No amount of arguing will change that. If they do not continue the practice, then they might gain some reputation (not hard--nowhere to go but up now).<br>
<br>
Assuming AS does not pull a total 180 and start kicking ebayers out, after this week anyone with the AS tag goes on my shitlist. I'm tired of making attempts to roleplay, I'm tired of giving them a chance. Honestly, do you think they will stop Ebaying because we ask them to?<br>
<br>
You don't want the negative reputation that being in AS gives you? Leave the guild or STFU. Debate the right/wrong of your actions all you want, but that's what it comes down to.<br>

You're right, this is from the IV webpage on the Kane Bayle server, pure power gamers.  If a guild came here in force and got a few dr00ds for PL by buying them or being like Geil and levelling them to 50 in 3 days and recruiting a few tanks, a KEI/Epic Enc, Oracle with Malo and 55 or higher epic bard they could do those mobs a lot faster than the whole 4 months it took the KB crew from scratch.<br>

&gt;&gt; I do not have the time<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; My view hasn't changed: You can't ethically sell what isn't yours<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; You cannot earn cash for what isn't yours. Period.<br>
<br>
Your view did change.  Now you're arguing the ethical implications related to playing a video game.  No chance you'll &quot;win&quot; at that point, you've lost, it's really just a game.  Save your ethical mores for abortion, the death penalty or living wills.  When discussing the game describe what isn't fun for you and how changing something would allow you to have more fun.  <br>
<br>
You won't be able to describe how Eldraed being sold can affect your fun.  You could always view it as Eldraed I selling his slave to Eldraed II who in turn raped him and then sold him to Eldraed III at a reduced price, but of course then they would be role-playing on the role-playing server and you're trying to paint their actions in a negative light because you forgot you play the game for fun.<br>
<br>
Jebbar &gt;&gt; How hard is it to get this? Has NOTHING to do with the EULA.<br>
<br>
Good, because I don't support the EULA, I go with Fun &gt; EULA.  Because it wouldn't be fun to have my account banned Sony enforcing the EULA wouldn't change that, it would just create the equation Long Term Fun &gt; Short Term Fun.<br>
<br>
Jebbar &gt;&gt; Most of the people on this server think that Ebaying is wrong, therefore it is a cultural more, or MORAL.<br>
<br>
So they head to Player Auctions to see what's for sale and read and post on these threads just to aggravate themselves but allow themselves the opportunity to say I am better than you because I follow the EULA.  Strange course of action.<br>
<br>
Jebbar  &gt;&gt; I'm tired of making attempts to roleplay<br>
<br>
I like to read big fat books with no villains, no wait, I don't.  I Roleplay a Powerful and Evil Wizard, I have Roleplayed with more people on the server than all but a handful, or I'm a power gamer on a Roleplay server.  2nd definition is more accurate, or I'm just promoting it in keeping with the first defintion, choosing to believe the first would allow you to have more fun.<br>
<br>
You can crusade against Awakened Souls OOC as you have done or you can add them into an ongoing storyline, although I'd advise against requiring an active part in the story, they may prove unreliable, on the whole they offer far more depth to FV than some 8 times re-incarnated Paladin of the Unsettled Mind.  Direct interaction for roleplay you will probably be more pleased with interacting with said Paladin.<br>
<br>
But if you don't want to have fun start discussing Eldraed in Saga /gu, it will be a boring one sided &lt;ooc&gt; discussions about morals, Yeah~!, I'm sure that's what people were hoping to log into.<br>
<br>
Game is for fun, try to explain to AS members how having a RL friend of a number of them join their ranks won't be fun for them.  If you can do that you stand a good chance of them opposing the buying of Eldraed, preach the morals of selling and you're preaching to the converted.<br>
<br>
As hinted at in the title I'm not trying to convince the people who post here by and large, I'm not even really trying to convince anyone to do something other than think.  If someone decides something on their own it's an opinion of some value, decisions based on one-sided arguments, tunnel vision and moral standards of a video game generally amount to nothing.<br>
<br>
FORSOOTH my lord, the seeds of uncertainty are planted, let them flower into the harvest of evil as doubt will in time conquer all faith and without faith all is lost, you may return again to tread the earth my lord, once again people will bow and scrape before....<br>

You can choose to follow the rules or not follow the rules in the eyes of Sony / VI. Again, there isn't a third &quot;I partially accept&quot; button on the EULA. Black and white, Fuvi. Not gray. Two buttons. Two colors.<br>

No, I'm not. You conveniently left out the line after that, which said &quot;I still recognize that as a breach of contract.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't let anyone use my account. Again, I feel that I'm obligated to follow the rules the moment I hit &quot;Accept.&quot; I'm not in charge of enforcing the EULA, and I am capable of seeing where some parts of it are a little too strict (one account per person being near the top of the list). I follow it anyway, because until I own 51% of Sony / VI, the rules do, in fact, apply to me.<br>
<br>
Following the rules doesn't mean you have to hate rule-breakers. My mother pushes the speed limit. Do I even remotely dislike her? No. But that's still speeding. If she gets caught by a policeman (read: GM), do I feel sympathy? No. She read the sign (read: EULA) and chose to ignore it anyway. Even if there was no victim, or if she was on a desolate road in the middle of nowhere (I see that as a reasonable place to speed), it's breaking the rules.<br>
