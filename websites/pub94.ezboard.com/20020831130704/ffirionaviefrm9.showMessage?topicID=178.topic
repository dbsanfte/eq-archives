Some of the anti depressants make a person tired, fatigued, bouncy, agitated, too happy, and well in those cases they need to discontinue that medication and try something else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
when you say ....anti-depressants.... do you mean the stuff doctors prescribed to legit patients to treat their disorder?  OR are you talking about er....drugs? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    there is a difference....<br>
*cough* so i've heard....<br>
<br>
If they're taking the legit stuff, they should behave normally if not slightly happier because doctors usually take into consideration their body's response to the drug at the beginning stage.  <br>
<br>
Now...if you are suspecting someone is taking the no-so-legit stuff....depending on their choice of &quot;medication&quot;....let's see....<br>
over active at times and dazed when they are resting....drinks ALOT of liquid (usually non-alcoholic), speaks in a slower and calmer tone of voice (to a point that it's very noticible for those who knows them), high response to loud rhymetic music, and in general in a very happy mood as it would seem to you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroawen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roawen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 1:17:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anti-Depressants and spotting them from a mile away</span><hr size=1> It really depends on if they are taking them for a legit reason. I dont have experience with the &quot;other&quot; reason...<br>
<br>
Depending on why they are taking them can lead to several reactions. There are all kinds of legit reasons to take anti-depressants... chronic depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, seasonal affective disorder (sp?)... <br>
<br>
Someone who is bipolar taking meds will not be on such a &quot;roller coaster&quot;. Someone who is chronically depressed will have a more positive outlook on life in general. Someone who has OCD will calm down about their routines, someone who has social anxiety will feel more comfortable in public places.<br>
<br>
You also have to take into consideration whether or not they have found, or are trying to find the right drug/dose. The wrong meds can turn a person into a &quot;stranger&quot; (acts like someone you've never met), too high of a dose can do the same thing. <br>
<br>
Though I will tell you this... you are looking for a way to tell if someone is taking medication. I would suggest before you do anything else, simply ask them. It has been my experience that if someone is taking meds for a legit reason, they will be happy to talk about it with you, for a number of reasons... they feel good about taking a step to improve their life, they need input from people around them every day to judge their reaction to meds.<br>
<br>
Granted this all changes if you suspect they are taking them as a means of &quot;getting high&quot;... and if you suspect that, then you're probably right. Your instincts are already telling you this person is acting different, and your intuition tells you its because of some mood altering drug.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallshadowstrife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vall Shadowstrife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 2:50:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anti-Depressants and spotting them from a mile away</span><hr size=1> Basically, it's a ladyfriend I'm trying to figure out.<br>

If she's someone you're close to, the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to just ask.  In fact, the ONLY thing I would suggest is to ask.  Anything else may be perceived as a breach of trust.<br>

Medication tends to leave people slowed down rather than hyped up. So if she's perky,it's not likely due to drugs-though if she cycles between really &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; it might be a good reason to get on them.<br>

<br>
I can tell you from experience that Anti Depressent medication isnt designed to make you &quot;happy&quot;. It is designed to correct an imbalance of chemicals so that a person can see the world from a place that isnt overly negative. <br>
<br>
Depression can be brutal. The serious type that requires medical (or professional) help is not a condition that one can simply &quot;shake off a bad mood&quot;. It is a condition that places a person in a state of mind where they are incapable (or nearly so) of viewing events, circumstances, and just general reality without it being close to overwelming, simple actions are viewed as overwelming events.<br>
<br>
I personally have never found an anti depressent that does more than help me fight the more severe aspects. I doubt that I will ever find one that will make me even consider life as worthwhile (no messages please, I will survive for now, been like this for all my life).<br>
<br>
Anti depressent medication is not designed to perk you up, or make you falsely happy. It is to allow enough chemicals to flow in your brain so that you may think and respond in a less depressed manner. And there is the problem... No one knows for sure exactly which chemicals cause exactly what. They do have many types now and it becomes a game of testing to see what one needs and how much they need.<br>
<br>
To further agrevate the process, most old line drugs and still most newer also, require several weeks (as much as 6 to 8 for some) to build up enough in a persons system to be properly evaluated. Also some people need more than one type of chemical. And some people simply can not be helped by medication (though most statistical studies indicate 80 percent plus can be).<br>
<br>
No responsible Doctor prescribes anti depressents for the purpose of making someone &quot;happy&quot;. That is a place an individual has to independantly find on their own.<br>
<br>
Though as noted, some more aggresive types of medication may cause a false sense of Euphoria if not properly administered.<br>
<br>
There are medications legally used to &quot;perk&quot; some one up. Though most have a side effect that can cause the opposite effect. I have taken anti depressents, mood adjustment medication, and medication designed to give one more 'energy&quot;.<br>
<br>
My experience is that if some one is not naturally &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;hyper&quot;, &quot;extreme&quot; or what ever term you want to use for higher than average... there is no Doctor that will actively prescribe medication to make them so. Anti depressents are not used to alter your reality, they are used to allow you to see it from a more balanced perspective. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Woodfella</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/31/02 5:00:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chances are ..</span><hr size=1> /agree with Twotribes. <br>
<br>
What is happiness really? I think it is different things to different people. Chemicals may induce temporary euphoria, but they aren't going to leave you happy. And if you were happy all the time, how would you know it? It would become the norm for you and then you wouldn't see it as anything special anymore. <br>
<br>
I think then that maybe happiness is fleeting and seldom, and it should be that way.<br>

<br>
If a person is able to function in society, they know the consequences of allowing others to &quot;see&quot; the heavy depression they can carry. So they play at the game of life, until they cant anymore.<br>
<br>
Cant , doesnt mean necassarily ending ones life. It can mean not being able to get out of bed, or to do any of the simply things in life, like brush your teeth/hair, take a shower, ect.<br>
<br>
Medication can make that mood of utter failure and uselessness easier to handle. And can even keep it at bay. But not for everyone, and not a simple process of going to a doctor and getting a prescription.<br>
<br>
Clinical depression and being &quot;blue&quot; are NOT the same thing. And there are situational things that can cause almost anyone to be temperarily depressed to the clinical level. <br>
<br>
Most of us arent gong to accept that someone is so depressed they need help beyond our telling them to perk up. It is not because we dont care, rather we cant accept or wont accept that the condition is that bad. It is frightening to not be able to help someone you love and it is scary to realize the morass of deep depression can hit people.<br>
<br>
There are signs, but like anything else, they can be misread or missed. No one is an expert at decyphering depression and its many forms and moods. And active attempts to hide it can lead to not picking it up either.<br>
<br>
Initial depression is easier to spot, because the person may not be adept at hiding it yet, and of course the very deepest also, since the person may be unable to hide how they really feel.<br>
<br>
Talking to someone about depression is not fun. Most people dont want to hear it. Dont get me wrong, not in a &quot; I dont care &quot; way, rather in a &quot; I cant accept&quot; way. Kinda like talking about death and your own mortality, most people wont carry a convrsation along those lines long.<br>
<br>
Depressed people are better equiped to identify other depressed people, if they want to. Even trained professionals can only guess or surmise at what is going on. Like I have to keep reminding myself....... No one can read minds.... so when I need help, I have to ask for it, or I have to survive as best I can without any.<br>
<br>
My sister's husband is one of those morons that tells her (when she is depressed and needs medical help) ohh, just pray and God will fix it. Or he tells her she doesnt accept God or she wouldnt be depressed. Praying is GOOD, and Believing in God is too, IF you can. Anything that helps you fight is good. Dont put blinders on though. Some people need medical help, it is that simple.<br>
<br>

My personal experience is with Manic Depression, both from myself and my father. While the term &quot;manic depression&quot; is generally defined as &quot;extreme highs and extreme lows&quot;. This is not actually the case. For me, manic depression means I feel &quot;normal&quot; for a while, and in the blink of an eye (literally) I can be absolutely hopeless. For my dad, that his manic depression mean that he would be VERY angry one minute, and &quot;didnt give a shit&quot; the next. <br>
Depression doesnt always mean someone is sad. More often than not, a depressed person will tell you they are not sad. They just have no hope of ever being happy. There is a difference. 'Cause if you're sad, there's something you're sad about, and that something can usually be pinpointed and eventually fixed... and when you're depressed you're sad about everything and nothing at the same time. Its not about sitting in the dark room crying because &lt;insert horrific tragedy here&gt; its about sitting in a well lit room watching your family and friends meander around doing thier daily normal things with a smile on their face, and you cant think of one single thing to smile for ... cause its all tainted by something dark.<br>
They are right about being masters of deception <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Cause it feels like no one can do anything about it, so why bother them with your problems. You dont want to ruin the smiles of these people, just cause you cant find one... that would be terrible, cause you dont want ANYONE else to feel the way you do... so why ruin them by telling them you're miserable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Happy Pills&quot; are not that. They dont make you smile, or give you a reason to smile, or even make you feel like smiling... They give you the ability to take a deep breath and only see the puzzle piece you're working on at that moment, rather than the three million random peices you have left, and the big empty space on the table that you're expected to fill with a picture, put together by all these pieces. Anti-depressants, (oh yeah um in my personal experience hehehe forgot that I am not the whole world /grin) give you the ability to take a step, even if it is a baby step... then you realize that the step wasnt so hard, so you can take the next one and the one after that... then you've been taking steps for so long you stop to turn around and realize you've walked around the block... and it was okay. It wasnt horrible, and it was kinda easy cause you did it a step at a time, at your own pace. They just make everything a little bit more bearable, so you can do it... ya might not be &quot;happy&quot; about it but you're sure as hell not hopeless....<br>
<br>
One more thing, then I'll stop <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
People who are depressed, CAN NOT &quot;flip a switch&quot; and be happy. There is something chemically wrong with the mechanisms in their brain (not thier mind) and it cant be done. The same way someone with a broken leg cant just &quot;decide&quot; to get up and walk. So if you're trying to help, dont bring flowers and ballons and big grin to say hey lets go &lt;insert super fun thing here&gt; 'cause it wont do any good. They will put on thier mask, cause doing the thing will make YOU happy and you dont have to know how they really feel. Eventually (and hopefully) the depressed person will figure out they need help, and if the avenues have been laid in place, they will ask for it. Your job (as the friend/loved one of someone you know needs help) is to say &quot;im here when you need me to be&quot;. And as sucky as it is to watch them suffer, that has to be good enough for you. &quot;Fixing it&quot; wont work unless the depressed person wants to fix themselves. <br>
<br>
(This is NOT in anyway to say if you know someone who is suicidal that you shouldnt do something about it. Someone who going to physically harm themselves, needs help as quick as possible, regardless of whether or not they want it.)<br>

Also sometimes its hard to understand how one person can behave the way they do when the only true way is the way you feel. I know people who can't stand still (bugs the heck out of me) and if they stop to talk to you they sway side to side. So I would say just keep an eye on things if she has major down times it could be other things she is taking to. I know when I went to college and worked I was on nodoz and herbal energy alot. And that stuff keeps you quite peppy.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=178.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=178.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
