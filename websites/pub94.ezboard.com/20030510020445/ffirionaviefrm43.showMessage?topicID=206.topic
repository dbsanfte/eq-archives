<br>
After starting EQ a year ago with my wizard and only fiddling with other classes once in a while on other servers when I get bored of quadding (playing almost all classes up to around 10 - 15th level, just to get a taste), I've recently begun to get serious on another server with a warrior.  Unfortunately, after playing a caster exclusively for so long, I've picked up habits and tendencies and bias about certain things that make adjusting to a warrior difficult, even moreso I think than if I had never played any other class at all.  So, I have a couple of question that I'd very much appreciate help with:<br>
<br>
1.  From what I've overheard (or over-read, actually) in the last year, damage/delay is NOT the end all-be all factor in determining the value of a weapon.  Because of dual wield, rules on damage bonuses, aggro control, procs, and other factors, a better damage/delay isn't always what is best.  What I've managed to learn, whether right or wrong (if it's wrong or right but with a significant exception I should know about, let me know), is that to hold agro, you want faster weapons over slower weapons with equal DPS, and a agro-causing proc is good.  I've also heard for pure DPS without regard to agro, you want a fast weapon in the main slot and a high damage weapon in your offhand (which kinda seems suspect to me because of damage bonuses only being applied to the main hand AND going up as delay goes up and the offhand weapon not firing sometimes because of dual wield and double attack skills missing, but I'm of course minimally educated about it).  I'd really like to hear thoughts on this and maybe have someone clarify what I want if I wanna hold agro and what I want if I want to maximize my damage output should I not be MA, and maybe something else I might need to know that I haven't thought about that's related to this subject.<br>
<br>
2.  Other than 1hs and 2hs weapons being more plentiful and easier to run into pretty much from newbieland to the higherst tier PoP zones than 1hb and 2hb weapons, is there any reason alot of people tend to focus on the former and let the latter catch up slowly or not at all?  I understand the stats and effect of damage/delay, etc are identical, and there is no damage type differences in EQ (like piercing, crushing, slashing, etc.), so I can't really think of anything.<br>
<br>
3.  I haven't experienced this yet, and being only up to level 29, I won't for a while still, but what do I need to know about high-level mobs and thier abilities like summon (which I DO know about because of my wizard...goddamn worst mob ability ever!!!), rampage, enrage, etc.  I've heard raid leaders tell people in briefing to stop attacking from the front in certain situations, and to stop attacking altogether, and such, and would really like to maybe get at least a brief explanation of those things.<br>
<br>
I think that's about all I'm concerned about right now.  I'm sure there'll be more that comes up, but I'll worry about that then.  Thanks in advance to anyone who posts anything even remotely useful.<br>

(Funny story...and true, too...<br>
I was in High Hold Keep when I was 25.  My pick up group was in the guard room and pulling mobs to the corner near the stairs up.  After a pull we were about to break mez on the last mob, and I heard you should taunt a mezzed mob before attacking it to help keep it from charging the chanter (I know a mob that low isn't all that dangerous and probably wouldn't have caused trouble should he have attacking our chanter right away, but I wanna get into the habit).  Anyway, I waited for a sec while the druid healed our ranger a bit cuz he was hurt enough to die quick should the mob attack him.  Well, I kinda spaced out for a quick second and evidently forgot where I was.  I hit 'taunt', then auto attack, then 'sit'. After getting hit and autostanding, I hit auto-attack again, and 'sit' again, wondering why I kept getting forced back to my feat.  After snapping out of my daydream or whatever was diluting my attention and hearing a bunch of things along the lines of &quot;what the fuck are you doing, dumbass?&quot; from my group, I started to laugh.  Too damn much stand-cast-sit in my days I guess.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2202<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/03 5:34:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well, the first thing you need as a warrior ..</span><hr size=1> .. is a cleric.  Once you get your cleric firmly soldered to your warrior's armor with absolutely no chance of her breaking free, only then should you begin to worry about your other points.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1. For dual-weilding, you'll tend to want a faster weapon in the main hand to take advantage of the damage bonus, which increases as you level up.  The best weapons for under level 33 are purely determined by damage:delay ratio, since there is no damage bonus.  The best weapon for the off-hand is always determined by damage:delay ratio.  Lower delay is better for taunt -- tends to keep a critter's attention.  Longer delay is better for avoiding riposte and damage shield damage.<br>
<br>
There's no hard and fast rule on main hand for what weapon is best.  There are a number of calculations you can try that provide a rough comparison (see steel warrior or monkly-business web sites for those).  In general, faster will provide better taunt, better DPS (in main hand at high level), and more skill ups.<br>
<br>
Once you get 60+, you'll start to find that 2H weapons can provide nearly as much taunt and that they also significantly reduce riposte damage.  This is for warriors and monks only btw -- only they get tripple attack and have a choice to dual or not.  When you fight creatures that hit for 300 on up to 900, you can see that reducing riposte damage can have a major impact on how much damage you take as a tank.<br>
<br>
2. There is no such thing as &quot;damage type&quot; in EQ.  It doesn't matter if it comes from a piercer or a club, melee damage is all the same.  The only reason you want to work on all of your skills is so you don't have to play catch-up on them to use a nice weapon you manage to acquire outside your specialty.  My dumb ogre warrior was able to max out every single weapon skill every level.  It's really not hard to do once you acquire some fast weapons (faster == more swings == more chances to skill up).<br>
<br>
3. Enrage happens when a critter gets down to where it would normally death-crawl if it didn't enrage.  What it means is that while enraged, the critter will automatically riposte on every single attack.  This is when at least everyone from the front needs to turn off attack or they'll quickly die (think 300-900 per hit with dual wield delivering up to 5 attacks per round).  Back row might turn off, too, to avoid a flip.<br>
<br>
Rogues often accidently flip the critter when they get a really nice backstab.  This is bad for the rogue, since he's now tanking a heavy hitter.  It's bad for the raid, since the back row is now open to ripostes.  If this is during enrage and back row is still active, said rogue can kill off the entire back row.  I always turn off attack during enrage, back or front.<br>
<br>
The other time everyone will keep attack turned off is so that the MT can build up an agro-lead that won't result in flips and more dead in the back row.  Typically this is only during the start of a fight, but you might also see it during MT transitions when the main MT dies or /defensive runs out.  Fights that rely on /defensive transitioning are typcaily some of the hardest in the game.  Moving agro from one MT to another without bouncing the critter around amongs the back row is not easy even when people do turn off attack.  It's nearly impossible when they don't turn it off.  Why don't they?  'Cuz they're lagged out so bad they don't know they're even being hit or that the MT died.  This is why heavy raiding guilds often have a &quot;cable modem required&quot; clause.  If you lag, not only do you die, but you can wipe the raid.<br>
<br>
Flurry is another trick some high level critters have.  Basically, it's a free set of about 2-6 blows from a critter that happens pretty much identically to a proc or a crit.  Crippling a critter will reduce flurries and procs.  What this does is cause the clerics to use a shorter CH interval than might be required just to account for potential flurries.  Either that, or you run a spam-heal group where several healers will all pop quick-heals onto the MT after every flurry.<br>
<br>
Vellious rampage is is pretty much an AE melee attack to the top of the agro list.  Luclin rampage is a seperate agro list entirely and once you get on it, almost nothing can get you off of it (not even camping out and back).  FD will prevent rampage from hitting you, but when you stand up, you'll be back on it again.  Fortunately, the rampage list is short.  How folks deal with this is they orchestrate the agro so that only those that can handle it best are on the rampage list.  They will typically have several CH'ers watching out for them and healing the rampage damage.  This is what people mean by &quot;rampage tank&quot; as opposed to &quot;main tank&quot;.  The fact that a couple end-game guilds were using monks for rampage tanks was supposedly the root cause of the monk nerf.<br>
<br>
I've not really done any raiding almost 9 months now, so no doubt some of the details might be a bit fuzzy.  Hopefully, some of FV's more regular raiders will stop by to correct 'em. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 2076<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/03 7:57:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, the first thing you need as a warrior ..</span><hr size=1> Rampage isn't AE until Planes of Power.  It's a single melee attack made at someone other than the current tank (but of course some mobs rampage a ton).<br>
<br>
Here's how rampage works, roughly.<br>
<br>
First, you know about the hate list.  Whoever has pissed off the mob the most is on top of the hate list, and the mob targets that person... other people are on the list too, just not on top.  The hate list is fluid... you are added whenever you piss the mob off, and then your position changes based on what you do.<br>
<br>
Rampage is totally different.  It is a static list, unlike hate.  It's set right before the mob rampages for the first time, and at that time it's a carbon copy of the hate list.  It doesn't change after that, though.  Mobs will always rampage the top person on the Rampage list who is 1) not on top of the hate list and 2) in range (note that rampage range is not the same as normal attack range... sometimes it's very very large).  <br>
<br>
After the list is set, it can be added to, but not subtracted from, and positions do not change.<br>
<br>
Note that Mem Blur and sometimes fiegn death can clear the Rampage list.<br>
<br>
Also note that if you die and come back, you're still on the list in your old position, usually.  However, if you die, and then someone new agros the mob before you are rezzed, it is possible for that person to be put in your old spot (thus kicking you off the list).  Non tanks should be careful to avoid hitting the mob right after a rampage tank goes down for this reason... if you weren't already on the rampage list, you'll be put in the ramage tank spot.<br>
<br>
Rampage tanking, then, is simple.  Just get a tank class to be second in agro at the point when the rampage list is set, and you're good to go.  <br>
<br>
Note that dexterity debuffs limit rampage and flurry, since they are treated as procs.  Thus, cripple and dex poisons are quite useful against heavy rampagers.<br>
<br>
And now I'm sleepy, so that's all on the Rampage ability for tonight!<br>

<br>
They changed it a while back because of insane agro problems in those zones, it used to be line of sight permanent agro for 20 mins on last agro.<br>
<br>
Aka: Rumblecrush would kill you, you get dragged to zone resed back, go back to pull Rumble and he ahro's you the second you get in range, prevously you could get in his line of sight but be out of range then hit a guardian and chain agro the lot but he would agro first and often kill you again before you saw them move... This doesnt happen anymore, thank god.<br>
<br>
Go test on Rhag's it's fun to be on rampage, Feign it to another sk then outtank the MA and  back out - noticing you are not back on the rampage list, get other sk to Feign and taunt like mad and notice that rampage goes down to somone else... you can get full agro but not on rampage list.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: you can make yourself lower in the list by Feigning but you cant move up on the list.<br>

Of course, some PoP mobs now AoE rampage, which is a whole other issue.<br>

The point of it is that 2H really doesn't shine until you're 60+, perhaps with some special AAs as well.  One part I left out is that it's really only the 2H weapons with delays larger than 28 that are nice -- the lower delay 2H weapons don't partake of the higher 2H damage bonuses.<br>
<br>
On rampage, are you sure it doesn't AE?  What ability am I thinking of then -- it's been a while since I was in a raiding guild.  I seem to recall a couple vellious-era critters that have an AE melee attack they unleash on the upper end of their agro list now and then.  Ah well, I was raiding a ton back then.  I could easily be confusing 'em with Luclin critters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nezmeron>Nezmeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/03 8:52:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Uh...heh...</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info on your first post, Bjond.  But to be honest, the first two questions are a little more important to me right now.  I have some time before the third really affects me, and while I'm getting really great info on the third, and I very much appreciate it (enough so that I'm printing it all out for future referrence ), I'm still a little confused on the first question in particular.<br>
<br>
Bjond...you said I don't have to worry about damage bonus until 33, but at 29 I'm already seeing a damage bonus stat when I inspect a weapon (I think I had it at 28 too, but not sure).  Does in jump at 33 or something?<br>
<br>
And I know strength is important for max weapon damage, so for now I'm just thinking the higher my strength the better pretty much no matter what.  But does strength affect only main hand damage?  I think I heard that somewhere, too.<br>
<br>
Actually...I've heard just about all factors only matter on main-hand weapons...is there anything that works with the offhand?  <br>
<br>
Oh, and Jarkell...out of the blue question:  what level did you're sneak skill allow you to move at normal run speed while hidden and sneaking?  Send me a tell in game one of these days, too...I think I have some questions for a grandmaster potter, and you're the only one I know personally.<br>

For taunt, lower delay is a bit better.  For avoiding ripostes and damage shields, larger delay is bette.  Basically, it's all ratio.<br>
<br>
For main hand, the damage bonus at the lower levels is pretty insignificant.  It doesn't start to really have a large impact until 50+ and especially 60+.  I thought I recalled the bonus being floor((level-30)/3), which would put 33 as the first level with a bonus.  It might be ceil((level-27)/3), which would mean 28 would be the first.<br>
<br>
I really would not worry about these issue much pre-50.  I'd just get fast weapons of every type and use 'em to max out all my skills.  For the lowbie levels, you'll be leveling so quickly and upgrading your gear so often that it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time optimizing your DPS and taunt.  Once you're 55+ and leveling starts to slow down a lot, that's when it makes sense to start thinking about gear a bit more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nezmeron>Nezmeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/11/03 4:23:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Perfect!</span><hr size=1> Thank you, Bjond!

Rampage is the only melee attack that hits people other than the current top of the agro list... but if your guild wasn't paying attention to how it was controlling rampage (with people moving in and out of range for example) it's possible for a mob to be rampaging all over the place.  However, there were no AE Rampage mobs until PoP.  You could be thinking of some oddball AoE spells?  I dunno.<br>
<br>
Nez:  Sneak speed increases from level 50 to 60, until at 60 you run at normal pace.  You always jump, sidestep, back up, and swim at the same crawl speed, though.  However, with Runspeed AAs I was going above normal run speed at 55, just from having run 3.<br>
<br>
Strength somewhat indirectly affects attack rating, which affects average hit.  Note that max damage doesn't change... that's always a factor of your level and the weapon damage stat.  However, higher attack rating causes you to hit for your max more often... lower attack rating causes you to hit for minimum damage.  Note that the actual comparison is your attack rating against the mob's &quot;mitigation&quot; AC.  The higher the mobs mitigation AC, the more attack rating you need to hit it for decent damage.  Luclin boss mobs are notorious for having way too much of the stuff.  The other kind is avoidance AC, by the way... the number you see on your screen is a composite of the two.  In beta you could see both, but players thought it was too confusing so they compounded to two numbers into one.  Avoidance AC affects how often you get hit, and is compared against the attackers level and weapon skill.  <br>
<br>
With all that said, even though one point of strength gives one point of attack rating, not all attack rating is the same.  You're better off getting 10 points of raw attack rating (from an aura of battle item like the belt of the great turtle, for example) than 50 points of strength, as far as damage output goes.  Kinda wacky.  This is why rogues love ranger buffs.<br>
<br>
The only differences between mainhand and off hand are that the main hand weapon isn't affected by duel weild skill (obviously) and that the main hand gets damage bonus.  The reason fast weapons are better main hand is that you get your damage bonus added to every hit... so if you use a delay 20 weapon instead of a delay 40 weapon, you hit twice as much and thus get twice as much out of your damage bonus.  That's why the lamentation is so much better than the Centi Longsword main hand at high level.  At lower levels (such as 28, where you get your first point of damage bonus... it goes up once every three levels) this won't matter so much... it's only 1 damage per hit.  But at high levels, getting an extra  11 damage per hit at level 58 matters quite a bit.  With that said the lammy is overrated, and overpriced on this server.<br>
<br>
But what Bjond said is accurate.  At low levels, max your skills.  Get a Wurmslayer, by the way... at your level the loss of damage bonus isn't so bad, and last I checked it was pretty cheap.  Questing for it is even cheaper.  I calculated it out... Wurmslayer outdamages a Lamentation until level 55 I think it was.  <br>
<br>
And ask your questions on the boards... I haven't signed on in a while... not sure when I will again.<br>

<br>
Secondly people were not moveing at all - as it was on rhag1 wich is perma rooted.<br>
<br>
Now there are two options i can think of..<br>
<br>
* Rhag is perma rooted so you get a 100% mem wipe on every feign or almost every feign.<br>
<br>
* You can move down the rampage list but not up it.<br>
<br>
Trying this on non-rooted mobs will bring same results.<br>

I know what i am thinking of, i was just filling in the gap you missed on rampage - appart from the bit you missed what you said was accurate.<br>
<br>
It's really really simple to test - go pull RC, in theory the puller should be the one on rampage.. you can feign rampage off permanently.<br>
