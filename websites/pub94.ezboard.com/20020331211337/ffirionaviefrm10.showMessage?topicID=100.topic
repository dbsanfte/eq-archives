Where would you get an Idea such as that! Fool, do not let those walking upon Norrath fool you like that. Do not be decieved, you have lost yoru focus. Damn that Genashai for weaking you, and now look what happened. However you did do well to try to kill him, but the fact remains that you Failed!&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
Yotoden seemed to radiate with anger as he spoke down upon Shintou, freshly summoned back into his reaml of Chaos. &quot;Love is needed to hate&quot;, presented to him from the very lips fo Shintou, and naturally, Chaos dismissed it with his own comments. And then he continued..<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;Love and Hate are on opposites on the scale. They are destined to forever be locked in combat, for they are complete and total opposites, much like Light and Darkness. To say you need both is just an excuse of the weak to indulge themselves. Do not be foolish.<br>
Look upon the earth, Watch them all, those foolish mortals as they walk about, thinking that love will power their hate further. They know not the true power of hate. Loveless hate, one cold stone with the ability to kill all without a throught. Is love needed? No, it is a waste of time and effort, and Women are devious.<br>
Think about it. Love is a simple tool. A Tool for controling the Weak.<br>
Do you see Velve, that Blade of Innoruuk. His heart is heardened, and his hate is true. Does he need love? Who knows, but he is on the right path.<br>
Females will be the undoing of any powerful male. Where their is am empire crumbled, their is always a female, trying to control and manipulate. Do not fall for their traps.<br>
That is all love is. A Tool for controling the Weak. Fight it with your strenght, and kill those that dare say those three annoying words. Let them cry, let their hearts shatter, it matters not.<br>
<br>
Just like you did with Genashai and that Ranger, you must do to all that dare attempt to get under what makes you strong.<br>
<br>
Focus your hate against this Love. This love screams of Weakness. And the weak must die.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And Yotoden leaned back against his chair, now a smirk commnig to his lips as he found a way to get his student back upon the correct path of Rage and Insainty..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In fact, I wish you to destroy this love. Destroy it, fight it with everything. Focus your hate against that, and you will see for yourself how powerful the 'Loveless' hate can be.<br>
Less you wish to be as weak as that one, Katrina. So wrapped in love in happyness, pathetic.<br>
<br>
That is what love does, it makes you weak. So be strong.<br>
That is all. You will return to Norrath to complete your mission after you reedicuate yourself in the blood of those down below in the Arena.<br>
Go now, fight, kill, and destroy without mercy. Thats all I wanted to talk with you.. no. Wait.<br>
<br>
About you and this Lanys T'Vyl person. She seems to be someone that can show you more about this Loveless hate, so continue to seek her out, and learn from a power that even Innoruuk could never grasp. Now that is all, begone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And Shintou stood up, bowing before Yotoden and that Sword, 'Soul Edge'.. Shintou still never figured out why Yotoden used such a monsterous blade.. ah well .. he had to leave for that Arena.. so he did such..

The Undead minions of Chaos were no match for his new level of skill.. and that new found rage to guide his blade.<br>
He stood right in the center of that Arena, the blood dripping from his hair, upon his face, stained upon his armor, and hardening upon his indigo skin. He looked up, pushing several blood soaken strands of red and gold out of his eyes to look up to the throne of the Arena, awaiting him there was Yotoden, the Soul Edge within his grasp and his form changed to that of the Being of Chaos.<br>
A Monsterious laugh as Chaos looked upon his student of the battle..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Now, did 'love' help you throught that battle? Slaying 25 men of the skill level of 17 is no easy task, even for one of your level of skill. Your hate and rage saw you throught the battle, ne?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yes, I understand.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Do not fall for the decieving looks of the females. They promice that if you love them you will be strong. All lies, sure, you shall feel a short burst fo energy when she is threatened, but that is all.<br>
In essence, being in love has made you a slave to her every desire. No more. Shintou, as I said. Every woman that dares utter those three words to you shall be lsain, reguardless of their faith.<br>
Understood?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yes. It shall be done.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
That is good. You will become stronger from all of this, I assure you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And Shintou bowed, then went to his knees, opening his mind and closing his eyes beginning his meditation peroid.

events. It had been a busy week, she’d taken the challenge of Shintou, and been <br>
victorious, she’d stood her ground with her swordsman Belick and defeated him too, she’d claimed the title of Ilharness of House Sel’quar as her own.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She let one word slip past her lips…</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Shintou…<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> her <br>
eyes narrowed to slits when she remembered how he had betrayed her. How he had <br>
lied to her, but then, she had lied to herself. She had fancied him, but love? <br>
No, not love. He had been a nut, hard and impenetrable, she had set about <br>
wanting to get inside, for the sole purpose of proving she had. To show him he <br>
was capable of love, and of being loved. She sighed, perhaps I shouldn’t have <br>
accepted his challenge. Perhaps I should have been the greater of us and turned <br>
away from his show of hate.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She remembered the words of that half- breed ranger in her <br>
ears, how could you raise your blades to him, and let that person carve a symbol <br>
on his head?? Why did she care what became of him if she didn’t love him?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I know why, because I hate to lose. I won the battle, but lost the prize. <br>
Morgrist was right, I squeezed it so tight it slipped thru my fingers and is <br>
lost. I have Belick though, and he is loyal and trustworthy. <br>

it on the gates of Freeport for all to see. The slave ran off <br>
to do her bidding as quickly as his feet could move him. She smiled and left her chambers and headed to the chapel. Kneeling down at the alter, hesitant because this was all still so new to her, she unsheathed her dagger and drew it across <br>
the back of her hand lightly. A small trickle of blood ran off and she held her hand out over the alter allowing a few drops to reach the surface.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Father, I thank you for the power to rule this house. Thank you for giving me strength in place of my weakness. Through this opening let my impurity leave, and your pure strength replace it.

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A heat filled the room, surrounding Genashai as she knelt in<br>
prayer. The blood on the alter steamed and was gone. The wound seared shut as though it never was.

She smiled as she recognized HE was with her here and had heard her prayer. She was strong in The Father, HE was with her.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
