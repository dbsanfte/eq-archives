<br>
The only thing that drops for the entire party are QUEST items, and only if every person in the party has triggered the quest and does everything for the quest up to the point.  This was done to foster cooperation, remove competition, and stop camp lists for quest mobs.<br>
<br>
There are no mob/creature ratios for dropped items like a FBSS.  All of those tables are randomized, as is looting, so everything in that regard is take care of.  If you kill a creature that drops a neat item as loot, then it is randomly distributed to someone when it is looted, so only one person gets it.  What they do with it is their business.  This is done with all loot that is DROPPED, but that is completely different than what you are referring to.<br>
<br>
What you are referring to are quest items.  Let me give you an example:<br>
<br>
I go to a keep and talk to an NPC that gives me a quest.  It says I must go to a graveyard and kill a creature to rid the town of his presence.  I show up at the graveyard and don't see the creature, but there is another person there.  I ask them if they've seen this creature, and they say they have not, but they too are looking for him.  A third person is there as well, but they are fighting and have never heard of this creature or the quest.  We send him off to talk to the NPC, but he cannot get the quest because he is still too young.  He decides to stay anyway, just to see what happens.  The three of us decide to group together and kill other creatures as we wait.  The wait isn't long and the creature appears.  We kill it.  <br>
<br>
I get a magic belt, as does the first person I spoke to.  The belts dropped directly into our inventories, it wasn't looted.  But the third person didn't get the belt, because he had not started the quest.   The creature also DROPPED some tattered chain gloves.  When someone loots the item, it falls into my inventory.  But I cannot wear the gloves and the third person can.  I give the third person the gloves (though I could have sold them) because he can wear them and in appreciation for his unselfishly helping us out.  (ps, this actually happened.  It is a very low level quest for a +1 or +2 belt in Albion)<br>
<br>
Now... the only auto-drop item that is 'given' to everyone is a quest item.  Not all auto-drop items are the actual end loot itelf.  In fact, it is usually just a component for a quest, and you have to return the item to actually complete the quest.<br>
<br>
In this regard, the quests can be made a bit more difficult in Dark Age, because they don't rely on you having to wait in line or /random off quest items.  In regard, it would be like every bard and warrior that had triggered their epic getting a red scale for taking down Naggy.  Except in Dark Age, they wouldn't make the red scale useful for anything else therefore it is a 100% quest component.  Verant relies on competition to make epic quests unique.  EQ's approach is a cop out, in my opinion.  An epic quest should require a personal task, not the luck of the roll and a lot of bitterness.  But with competition, they don't really have to make the quests as hard to accomplish (and if they can't make them competitive, they make them tedious like foraging an item that makes you sit on your duff and do nothing else for three or four hours or give up in frustration).  <br>
<br>
In Dark Age, they challenge you as an individual, but do their best to remove competition in getting those items.  They also make the quests more challenging and the difficulty correlates with the level the quest is given as well as the difficulty of the task at hand.<br>
<br>
But, no, creatures don't drop phat lewt for everyone in party, unless that item happens to be the end result of a quest and everyone has accomplished the quest up to that point.  Does that clear it up any?<br>
<br>
It's a far, far better system than what is in EverQuest, and actually encourages people to help each other instead of &quot;/shout Is Mob_X00 available yet cause I've been waiting four hours to get in on the phat lewt mob and I'm going to steal it from you soon if you don't leave&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uffejem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ffejem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/01 9:29:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't understand ...</span><hr size=1> Kaeliic - I think there is just a slight tweak to the multi-item drop in that it typically applies to &quot;quest&quot; items only.  So if everyone in the group has been given a certain quest, and they have to get an item from killing a Mob, when it dies, the item goes to all of their inventories.  It is not my experience that this applies to non-quest items/drops.  <br>
<br>
And it has certainly fostered more cooperation than having to compete for that Mob and kill it 8 times, than just grouping as 8 people and killing it once.  Anyway, just my thoughts on that topic.<br>

In static camps your group size determines how many you will pull reguardless of any pulling tactic. If BAF is activated (it's random, but basically just count on it), you will get the following pull:<br>
<br>
1-2 Characters - 1 MOB<br>
3-4 Characters - 2 MOBs<br>
5-6 Characters - 3 MOBs<br>
7-8 Characters - 4 MOBs<br>

I don't have anything to add to this post... I just wanted to post here.  Oh, wait, yeah I do.<br>
<br>
You know, Scrabble is a game too, just like Everquest.. but I bet none of you ever saw someone get heated and violent over a game like Scrabble.<br>
<br>
The solution to this problem?  X-treme SCRABBLE!  No, really, it's a game.  It's NOT YOUR LIFE.  For those of you who cry over Everquest, I just want to remind you that those people?  living in your house? are your family? duh?  And they really are people, and you should talk to them, even if they aren't wearing full planar.<br>
