(part 4)</span><hr size=1> I met Reyial again in the East Commonlands, on a day when many guilds were dueling, and there was talk of war. We sat, watching for a while, and talked.<br>
<br>
Reyial looks at Rhatha with a slight frown and then off into the distance.<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'You've long been my friend.. I am content to wait, and see what comes.'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'Aye... but I fear.. that friends no longer we will be after this night has passed.'<br>
Rhatha stares at Reyial in shock.<br>
Reyial avoids Rhatha's gaze.<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'You speak as though you go into great danger, from which you expect not to live.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'You've been nothing but kind to me...'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'I know, I know.. I know...'<br>
Reyial seems frustrated.<br>
Reyial scratches at his head and then sighs heavily.<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'I vow, that I would follow you into the heart of Neriak itself if need be! I do not abandon those who have journeyed with me, nor do I leave any Vah Shir to face danger alone!'<br>
Rhatha`s warder says 'My leader is Rhatha.'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'Rhatha.. No. You cannot follow me into where I must go, as I have sealed my own fate with a simple nod of the head.'<br>
Reyial`s warder says 'Following you, Master.'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'Where I go.. is in the hands of those who hold my soul, now.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'Would Shar Vahl stand today, if our race did not protect one another in times past? Would you refute the heritage of our people, the lore of the Jharin, and the pride and honour of the spirits themselves?'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'You cannot do it, Rhatha! ... You cannot protect me. If you try, you will end up dead; a corpse upon grey desert of Marus Seru. '<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'Hold your...? You hear the call of our ancestors' spirits as well as I. No one can hold the soul of a Vah Shir, without drawing their wrath... and it would be terrible indeed!'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'You must forget any sort of kindness that I've shown to you. Toss aside any debt that you feel that you owe me. Having those thoughts in your mind will only bring your downfall.'<br>
Rhatha thinks to himself - I cannot let this pass... something dark is happening..<br>
Rhatha thinks - Swiftclaw, you know that as well as I... we must go, even if we may not be seen.<br>
Reyial sighs deeply.<br>
Rhatha thinks - Spirits grant me stealth, for Reyial will not hear of my coming.<br>
Rhatha removes his helmet.<br>
Reyial glances over to Rhatha, watching him.<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'Well, then.. at least I will go to the Nexus with you. I will be in the Moor, perhaps, hunting the parts for Sonic Wolf Bane..'<br>
You say, 'I will be near, if you are in need. Remember that.'<br>
Rhatha thinks, my course is set now... we shall see what comes.<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'Nay...You must not be around me any longer. You are putting yourself in grave danger by doing such a thing.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'There are few things in Norrath that I truly fear, and the day I am not in danger, is the day I die.'<br>
Rhatha scratches Swiftclaw behind the ears.<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, '... Rhatha. '<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'If whatever hunts you now is more mighty than the creatures o Mistmoore, or of Luclin, then you cannot hope to stand alone...'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'I still do not understand!'<br>
Reyial says, in Vah Shir, 'You must leave this place, Rhatha... Go now.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, '.... If it must be, it must be... *sorrowful.. sighing* Very well then. May the spirits of our people protect you how they may, for I am not able to do so.'<br>
Rhatha sheds one last tear, then runs off.<br>
You tell your party, 'And so it must be..'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'aye'<br>
You tell your party, 'I am sorry to go, but great things await me on Luclin, and I fear I may be too late..'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'you herd ubout it my lofd'<br>
You tell your party, 'About what?'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'tqe war hehep np i ll qee you there ok'<br>
You tell your party, 'Reyial has troubled me tonight as well, that is what I speak of... he is going to Marus Seru, for a... ceremony, and has forbade me to come. Yet I must go, anyhow.'<br>
You tell your party, 'I go to Feydark now, though it may be too late by the time I arrive.'<br>
Dallron tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'take care friejd'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'aye my lord '<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'take care'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'no wait'<br>
You tell your party, 'I need to go to the Nexus... and do what I can, for he is a friend still, and in great need, though he said it may not be so on the morrow.'<br>
You tell your party, 'Aye?'<br>
Rhatha turns back, just outside Freeport.<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'to the north gate and you can get to the moon'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Swiftclaw, I need travel now with all haste. Return to the realm of spirit.'<br>
You tell your party, 'What? The north gate of Freeport? How?'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'dallorn ill be back ok'<br>
You tell your party, 'I am along the wall, in sight of the dusty lands'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'north gate will take you to moon is that were you going'<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Aye..'<br>
You tell your party, 'Aye, but there are no Spires there...'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'yes north karana'<br>
You tell your party, 'Are you speaking of North Karana?'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'yes'<br>
You tell your party, 'Is that not farther than going to Feydark? Perhaps not, and it would be faster... but it is not safe to go that way..'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'oik'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'sorry'<br>
You tell your party, 'I could go that way, but... I am not sure I know the route.'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'my portal takes you to the shires where you portal to the moon'<br>
Dallron tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'you will portav to the spires ik Nodxv Karana.'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'aye'<br>
You tell your party, 'If you would do such, I would be very greatful!'<br>
Dallron tells the group, in Human Tongue, '`hat w ll take auu atraight to nexuw.'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'np '<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'come close '<br>
You tell your party, 'Aye, but I dare not let him see me...'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'hmmm so what do you want to do'<br>
You tell your party, 'If you wil take me, I will go. I cannot abandon him.'<br>
You tell your party, 'I am behind a tree, to your direct east, I can see Graison from here.'<br>
You bow before Spellhawk.<br>
Spellhawk begins to cast a spell.<br>
You tell your party, 'If you are ever in need... call on me, and I will aid you as best I can.'<br>
Spellhawk tells the group, in Elvish, 'np my lord'<br>
You have entered Northern Plains of Karana.<br>
Dallron says, in Human Tongue, 'Hail, Rhahha'<br>
You tell your party, 'The spirits know we shall need it, if war truly comes...'<br>
Dallron tells the group, in Human Tongue, 'take care Rhutha'<br>
You say, 'I wish to journey to Luclin, and wish all haste!'<br>
Nexus Scion says 'Take this, Rhatha. You must stay inside the circle of the Spires, and keep this shard on your person. Should you need another, simply ask me. I do not think we will run out of shards any time soon! If you do NOT wish to travel to Luclin, destroy that which I gave you, or step well away from the Spires lest you be caught up in the portal. It will open soon.' <br>
Spellhawk bows before Rhatha.<br>
Dallron Bows respectfully to Rhatha.<br>
Spellhawk snaps at attention and salute Rhatha crissply.<br>
Dallron Humbly kneels before Rhatha.<br>
You say, in Elvish, 'Thank you my friend'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'I must be careful... I cannot let him see me, or even be in the same area for long.'<br>
<br>
You told Reyial, 'ooc: he won't give up, you know, not after the way Reyial has acted today...'<br>
You told Reyial, 'ooc: as all around him, he sees the world turning to darkness... he knows not who to turn to, save his own heart'<br>
You told Reyial, 'ooc: and he is very worried about the threat of war, among other things, and the many deaths in the guild of late..'<br>
You told Reyial, 'ooc: but to him, the worst is that he can do little to stop it'<br>
Reyial tells you, in Vah Shir, 'ooc: ..Yes, I know he won't. Which makes Reyial regret the choice he made even more. He wants so much to be like Rhatha.. but.. he keeps stumbling along the way.'<br>
<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'Ah well, I am well provisioned if I must be away for long, and I will be bound in Shadow Haven.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'I must be cautious, likely he will be there as well.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'If I arrive before him, I'll go to Marus Seru, and hide in the cave of the Queen Kvacnak.. else I shall trail them.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'But I must not let him see, scent, or hear me, until this &quot;ceremony&quot; is begun. Then he may be distracted.'<br>
You say to your guild, 'It is a lonely road I walk tonight...' <br>
You say to your guild, 'Aye... I follow an old friend, with a dark secret, though he bade me not.'<br>
You say, in Vah Shir, 'I hope he thinks I am in Feydark, that I could not follow in time.'<br>
You have entered Nexus.<br>
<br>
And so I traveled to Marus Seru ahead of Reyial, to see what is going to happen. <br>
<br>
And I sat, through the rest of the day, and the long, cold night. Reyial did not come, and there was no indication that he had been there. Was I misled? Did I misinterpret what he said? I do not know, but I fear that things are out of my control, for now.<br>
<br>
And so I returned to Shar Vahl, worrying over the state of the world. <br>
<br>
And today, I saw him again... things have gone beyond my control, now. I will not abandon him, but... he has allied himself with mine enemy, or so it seems. The Dark Affliction. What I will do now, I do not know. I can say nothing more at this time, the danger is too great, for myself, and for anyone who tries to help me. And so, I sit on the grey wasteland of Marus Seru, and think. And I make my decision...<br>
<br>
I will give him a chance to show me his view, for the tale is not complete without all sides. I vowed to follow him into Neriak itself if need be. I wonder if I will regret that in the days ahead...<br>
<br>
I can say no more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=155.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=155.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=155.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=155.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=155.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
