<br>
1. Compaq is considering changing the command &quot;Press Any Key&quot; to &quot;Press<br>
Return Key&quot; because of the flood of calls asking where the &quot;Any&quot; key is.<br>
<br>
2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard<br>
to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic<br>
bag the mouse was packaged in.<br>
<br>
3. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax<br>
anything. After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician discovered<br>
the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the<br>
monitor screen and hitting the &quot;Send&quot; key.<br>
<br>
4. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer<br>
worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his bathtub with soap and water and<br>
soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them<br>
individually.<br>
<br>
5. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged<br>
because his computer had told him he was &quot;Bad and an invalid.&quot; The tech<br>
explained that the computer's &quot;bad command&quot; and &quot;invalid&quot; responses<br>
shouldn't be taken personally.<br>
<br>
6. A confused caller to IBM was having trouble printing documents. He told<br>
the technician that the computer had said it &quot;couldn't find printer.&quot; The<br>
user had also tried turning the computer screen to face the printer-but<br>
that his computer still couldn't &quot;see&quot; the printer.<br>
<br>
7. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new<br>
Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the<br>
technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button.<br>
<br>
Her response, &quot;I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing<br>
happened.&quot; The &quot;foot pedal&quot; turned out to be the computer's mouse...<br>
<br>
8. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand new<br>
computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and<br>
sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen.<br>
<br>
When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked,<br>
&quot;What power switch?&quot;<br>
<br>
9. Another IBM customer had trouble installing software and rang for<br>
support. &quot;I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the<br>
second disk, and had some problems with the disk. When it said to put in<br>
the third disk, I couldn't even fit it in...&quot;<br>
<br>
The user hadn't realized that &quot;Insert Disk 2&quot; implied removing Disk 1<br>
first.<br>
<br>
10. A story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:<br>
<br>
CALLER: &quot;Hello, is this Tech Support?&quot;<br>
<br>
TECH: &quot;Yes, it is. How may I help you?&quot;<br>
<br>
CALLER: &quot;The cup holder on my PC is broken -and I am within my warranty<br>
period. How do I go about getting that fixed?&quot;<br>
<br>
TECH: &quot;I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?&quot;<br>
<br>
CALLER: &quot;Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.&quot;<br>
<br>
TECH: &quot;Please excuse me. If I seem a bit stumped, it's because I am. Did<br>
you receive this as part of a promotional at a trade show? How did you get<br>
this cup holder? Does it have any trademark on it?&quot;<br>
<br>
CALLER: &quot;It came with my computer. I don't know anything about a<br>
promotional. It just has '4X' on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point, the Tech Rep had to mute the caller because he couldn't<br>
stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load<br>
drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder and it had snapped it off the<br>
drive.<br>
<br>
11. A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer. The<br>
tech asked her if she was &quot;running it under windows.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman responded, &quot;No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good<br>
point. The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window and his<br>
printer is working fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
12. And last but not least:<br>
<br>
TECH SUPPORT: &quot;O.K. Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at the<br>
same time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen. Now type<br>
the letter &quot;P&quot; to bring up the Program Manager.&quot;<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER: &quot;I don't have a 'P'&quot;.<br>
<br>
TECH SUPPORT: &quot;On your keyboard, Bob.&quot;<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
TECH SUPPORT: &quot; 'P' on your keyboard, Bob.&quot;<br>
<br>
CUSTOMER: &quot;I'm not going to do that!&quot;<br>

Hilarious stuff.<br>
<br>
I did ISP tech support for 3 years.  My favorite call will always have to be the Well-Trained Customer.  She called me frantic about the fact that her monitor was 'broke'.   It wasn't an internet-related issue but I figured I'd try to help her out a little.  I asked her what was wrong with it and she explained that all of a sudden her screen had gone black but the power light was still on.  I then asked if she had done anything to fix it.  She said No; she wanted to call us first.  Okaaay.  I told her to try moving her mouse.  Voila!  Her desktop was back.  She thanked me a hundred times and I spent the next few minutes explaining what a screensaver was to her. <br>
