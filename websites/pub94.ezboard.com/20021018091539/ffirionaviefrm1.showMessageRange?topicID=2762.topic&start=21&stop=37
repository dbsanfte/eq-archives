<br>
In places where VI have implemented a more fluid situation - and the most obvious is the Hollowshade War - it has not met with general approval as people organise hunting parties only to find circumstances have moved on.<br>

I think to look for a moving story is a massively multiplayer RPG is too much to ask.

Yet, potentially, every player *could* be there to wake up the Sleeper, but the folks who are there at the right time and with the right numbers will do it, and many other players will complain about them doing so.<br>
<br>
The opening of Bloody Kithicor is another example of this... also the corruption of Lesser Faydark, and the plague in the Karanas were like this, although, Verant was inconsistent with the last two story lines... I don't think Karanas were ever under plague on our server, and I remember some servers had the green sky and some didn't.<br>
<br>
What's always odd to me is that the elves in the outpost on Kunark have never bothered to knock down all those iksar statues, or bothered to fortify that city in any way.  I always thought it would be neat if I one day roamed over to Firiona Vie City and saw new statues of Tunare and FV being erected in place of those massive lizards.  It wouldn't affect gameplay in any way.  It just seems silly that in however many hundreds of years pass in EQ time, that most things remain exactly the same.  Surely deserts will return to full bloom, jungles will thin out, lakes will dry up, and the like.  Aesthetic changes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarthur265.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arthur265</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 3:39:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What are the alternatives?</span><hr size=1> Yes, there are definitely technical difficulties with this type of game, and, yes, there is more that could have been done with EQ.

<br>
Asheron's Call had monthly updates that not only added things to the world, but changed it.  One day I logged in to find my hometown had been destroyed by Shadows.  One day it was there, the next it was a crater with a shadow spire hovering over it.<br>
<br>
Very cool.  They destroyed another town as well with that update.<br>
<br>
According to AC lore, Bael'Zharon had been imprisoned by 4 sould crystals.  One month, three new dungeons were added, the final &quot;boss&quot; of each was a crystal.  These dungeons were for different level ranges, as well, so the low-levels could actually do something worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Then the next month, another dungeon was opened, with another crystal.  The inside of the dungeon was a PvP area.  Not only did you have to deal with shadows and crystal shards, but there were also PCs defending the last crystal to keep Bael'Zharon imprisoned.  Eventually, though, the fourth crystal was shattered and Bael'Zharon was unleashed upon Dereth.<br>
<br>
Turbine really allowed players to affect the world in a way Verant hasn't.  I would love to see some of this make it into EQ2 or later updates of EQ, but I'm not sure if the game engine would allow for it. <p><P>Jaranna<BR>

Well, I am not saying that EverQuest's brand of questing is &quot;wrong&quot;, but I do think it's not as conducive to roleplaying as it could be.<br>
<br>
In a multiplayer persistent world, I think it's silly to have automated quest dialog that treats the player as if he/she is the only hero/villain/adventurer in it.  I personally would prefer somewhat more generic quests if they have better continuity with the reality of the game world.  Epic, legendary, once in a lifetime events should not happening every week.<br>
<br>
And just because a world may designed to be dynamic doesn't mean some &quot;essential&quot; services wouldn't be preserved through thick and thin.  Newbies will always need a relatively safe place to spawn and learn the game, and I would agree that a world that is so constantly in flux that it becomes difficult to run basic errands because you can't find a friendly merchant would probably throw the casual gamer for a loop.  However, with good design, you can provide these &quot;staples&quot; in a dynamic world and still have the world in motion.<br>
<br>
I would mainly point at two games that seem to take an approach I'd advocate for creating a more authetic, interesting, roleplay-friendly atmosphere: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shadowbane</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.gemstone.net"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> GemStone III</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
I haven't played Shadowbane yet (it's still in closed beta), but it appears to me that they are going out of their way to cater to the roleplaying element in a number of ways.  No, I don't hold any illusions that this is going to be a roleplayer's utopian mecca... but I do think that in several key areas, it will appeal to roleplayers on a level that EQ just isn't capable of reaching.  First, the game is being designed with one core principle idea in mind: the fate of the world shall lie in the hands of the players.  The boarders of kingdoms and empires, the welfare of each city, the economy region to region, all will be determined by player actions.  While this will certainly appeal to powergamers and others uninterested in roleplay, it also provides for an unlimited number of roleplayed scenarios that will be amount to much more than /duels and the occassional scripted ritual or wedding ceremony.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if you just read the background story and other information available on the game world, it is clear that they spent a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> great</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> deal of effort creating a rich history for the world, but not only that, an excellent explanation of the state of the world, the nature of life and death, each of the playable races, and an overview of the gods, while still leaving a lot of the story as an untold mystery that may or may not be revealed as the world ages.  The story is great, but what is more important than story in a virtual world is the backdrop, the setting.  It has to be rich and full of character, and there can't be crucial missing details.<br>
<br>
I think GemStone III does an excellent job of providing a tremendous backdrop for roleplay, and countless details that one can use to flesh out their character.  The world is relatively static, but the chances are fairly good that if you want to you can participate in minor events that may occur, like fighting off an invasion of orcs, or playing a minor role in the mystery and drama of a brilliant and eccentric halfling wizard and his dark dealings with a demigod of pain, or assisting the prosecution or defense of an alchemist who is being blamed for the difficulties that wizards everywhere have been having creating enchanted items.  Are any of these deeds particularly epic or memorable?  Maybe yes, maybe no.  I do know however that from such &quot;quests&quot; and events, many players have had their characters elevated to a certain level of fame and notoriety and in many ways, Elanthia (the realm GS3 takes place in) does have a living history despite the fact that lasting, major changes to existing game content (in the form of lairs/towns being sacked and taken over) are pretty rare.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is, so what if the vast majority of players are oblivious to the &quot;story&quot; behind the game?  The &quot;story&quot; that most roleplayers are worried about is the story of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> their own</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> characters, not Firiona Vie and Thubr Axebringr, and other characters and adventures they'll probably never play any direct part in. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

First of all, only a very idiotic game designer would make such an extreme change to the state of the world as to invalidate peoples' roleplay.  However, I do not even necessarily see how the &quot;extreme change&quot; that you use an example would be any more hindering to roleplay than a completely static world.  Alliances shift, moods change, new things happen.  Roleplaying a dark elf or high elf who clings to old prejudgices and holds old grudges, while the rest of his/her society is moving towards a more cooperative and accepting attitude, would still be a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  completely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> valid character to roleplay and in many ways it could only but open more oppurtunities and scenarios for you to enjoy as a roleplayer.

However the real thrust of that change (which I agree would take a complete imbecile in game design ) was that it forced a direction of change upon players that might not suit large numbers of them. I can think of many who would feel uncomfortable with large scale changes and making the majority of your paying customers uncomfortable in order to stimulate the few is  poor business.<br>
<br>
And there I am afraid is your larger problem. We struggle to keep RP alive on FV, one of 20+ servers. The blue server population would have screaming fits if Freeport disappeared or the like. It is bad enough if they change a spawn rate, let alone dispense with it altogether. If there were a growing number of RP-preferred servers then our constituency would be greater for such changes. Heck, they couldn't even keep &quot;dynamic events&quot; going on SH and they had folks paying extra for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/02 1:48:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.atlantic.net/~tukka/glowhand.jpg height=44 width=44></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Carthage</span><hr size=1> Well, my basic argument is that EverQuest was designed with little heed or consideration given to roleplay.  I think this is evident in zone design, character design, the game's backstory, the nature of scripted events, the nature of quests and the way the game has been marketed.<br>
<br>
People don't care about roleplay in large part because the game was not designed for roleplayers.  Even people who are inclined to roleplay (such as myself) have pretty much given up on it in EverQuest.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, there is very little they can do to improve the climate for RP without alienating the bulk of their customer base.  The original question posed was why people feel EQ lacks a coherant narrative, and I guess my answer is that the narrative that we all experience in the form of quests and general game environment is non-conducive to RP... it just serves as a adequate platform from which to launch various challenges.<br>
<br>
I know that by playing to the masses, Verant has pretty intentionally set down this road.  One of the rules of a virtual world is that the quality of roleplaying is inversely proportional to the number of players.   Oh well.  I'm not saying it's bad business sense, I'm just pointing out how this game is clearly not designed with roleplaying as a focus and how it is clearly lacking in this regard.<br>
<br>
I still think that there are things that they could have done (and they probably realize this in retrospect, hindsight is 20/20) to encourage and faccilitate roleplaying without alienating the masses, but it's too late to change things now. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

They used to happen quite often and there were some pretty fun ones. I missed most of the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; GM event line because I decided to take a break half way through, but it started out pretty cool. I remember lots of GM events &quot;back in the day&quot;. Killer Chickens in DL, Faydedar (or whatever his name is - that fish in TD) in the Lake of Ill Omen, Countless undead invasions of various zones, Scarecrow invasions, Mayong Mistmoore etc. Besides that Friday the 13th battle event, I haven't seen or heard of any other GM events in the couple months I have been back. <br>
<br>
Even though they were kinda lame, GM events used to be very cool. People would run half-way across the world to attend and all of the EQ fan sites would list them and the results after they happened. This was one way where VI could have kept a non-static content going but dropped the ball. It went the way of CS. Instead of enriching the gameplay of the product they had they put all of their energy into adding to it. If I had to choose between lame GM events where a bunch of killer chickens invade the Dreadlands and nothing, I would choose lame GM events.<br>

<br>
1. A fairly rich and detailed backstory that is learned in as bits and pieces here and there throughout the game.  Coupled with a game world that doesn't force you into any particular storyline.<br>
<br>
2. A website that details all the rich history of the world and which is basically required reading to understand what the point of the game is.  An on-going storyline which you will be thrust into the moment the game starts, and have no chance to affect.<br>
<br>
The second option is the approach Neocron, Shadowbane, and Asherons Call 2 are taking.  There's nothing wrong with that, but playing a forced role in someone else's story isn't how I want to roleplay.  It's too much like playing Diablo or Final Fantasy; no matter what you do, the story is going to proceed through a pre-determined and already-written plot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubreoghan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Breoghan</A> at: 9/28/02 4:17:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimjesta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GrimJesta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/28/02 1:15:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do people feel EQ doesn't have a &quot;coherent narr</span><hr size=1> So I read this post last night and went to bed thinking about it. <br>
<br>
I dont think its possible for them to have a coherent, connected plot that everyone is involved in. Why? Le,mme tell ya a story:<br>
<br>
Long ago (not really) Vampire the Masquerade Redemption came out. It had multiplyer capabilities, so I figured I would be getting some hardcore World of Darkness action going on. It had a build in die-roller, so you didnt have to use the crappy game engine, loads of maps and cool skins. They released the map editor too and loads of skin editors came out. I was excited.<br>
<br>
Until my first game. I honestly thing all the d00dz from the PvP EQ server bought Vampire:redemption and took over. EVERY game was basically the &quot;storyteller&quot; populating the maps like a video game and letting the characters run through killing everything and gaining XP. All were totally tweaked out. It was a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Then I found this one guy named Vandle. He told me he had about six other people that were into using the game engine for a persistent, hardcore, all roleplay game-world that actually followed the World of Darkness. <br>
<br>
Well, 6 people became 70 in no time, as every hardcore player wanted in. We actually had to start rejecting applications. Soon Vandle left and I found myself one of the people in charge. I was the main plot-writer and world-molder I guess you could say. I wound up creating this insane plot filled with intruiges and manipulations worthy of any Vampire game.It was hardcore. The other STs and admin read it and said, &quot;wow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Keep in mind there were only 70 players, not the near 500,000 EQ has.<br>
<br>
We introduced the story, set up the NPCs. We made it possible to not partake in the plot, but it would still affect the world around them. And unlike EQ, the only way top  gain XP is to RP. And people chose to ignore the plot for the most part. They all had their own agendas, their own reasons for doing things. Our plot, to many, was just the justification to introduce new NPCs or minor events for them to attend to.<br>
<br>
This is what I can see happening if the GMs ever went through the HELL (and yes, its a hell) of writing an online plot of any hardcore type. I can see the yellow text popping up from the GM's telling us of some new plot unfolding. New events would occur. <br>
<br>
And people would keep hunting wherever they are hunting. The events would hardly make it into roleplay because I am hardpressed to find roleplayers on the RP server. Aye, I knoiw theres a ton out there, but not enough to justify a major plot-line. The plot would go from Verant justifying new zones and NPCs to most players using it to justify new raids, NOT for roleplaying.<br>
<br>
It seems that everyone here is hardcore into roleplaying. But I have still met way too many on the RP server that were d00dz or WORSE. So it wouldnt be worth the GMs time to create this huge plot. The rewards would not outweigh the work.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion on it all. But it is an opinion based upon experience in GMing an online game.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can say is that it is up to us. Look at our real world. If you look at it from far away, like if there was a game manual for it, things here would also seem hardly connected and half-assed if you took the people out. But its the people doing their thing and creatuibng their own sagas and legends that makes it cool.<br>
<br>
So do the same thing in EQ. Sure, the backstory isnt all the fleshed out. But I bet YOUR story is! And I bet people you know have hardcore stories. And they know people with hardcore stories. So why not bring it up into roleplay. Mention places youve been to, but not as a zone. Mention it as a living breathing place. Mention people you know, but in a realistic way. Speak of events youve encountered. Aye they never REALLY took place, but who will condemn you for speaking of a small riot in the Freeport market district? Who would really complain if you spoke of strange lights in Greater Faydark at night. <br>
<br>
Its up to us. Verant/Sony gave us the tools. The computer is the canvas. WE are the artists. And Firiona Vie, being the RP server, is all the Picassos and Michaelangelos. Or we are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
So, what say you?<br>

<br>
Your experiences sound VERy similiar to the LARP experience I've had with Vampire.<br>
<br>
The difference, though is that people starting to RP Vampire start on roughly the same page.  There's a world history.  There's established relationships between the vampire clans and the other World of Darkness denizens.  I feel EQ is lacking in that.  It's not a question of GM running plots in the game, it's a question of having more collected and coherent write ups of past history, current politics and social order of Norrath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimjesta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GrimJesta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/28/02 2:33:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do people feel EQ doesn't have a &quot;coherent narr</span><hr size=1> I wonder if it would help if we all wrote alot of our own world experiences here? I mean if three of us are talking about that said riot in freeport, wouldnt it make sense to put it here, so that all can find out about it and talk about it. That might make it a bit more persistent.<br>
<br>
But youre right about the backstory leaving alot to be desired. Even the tabletop RPG leaves alot too vague and open. Hmmm. There has got to be a solution for this...<br>
