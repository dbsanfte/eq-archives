<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “To arms! To arms!” Littany shouted as she ran into the guild halls. “I have learned the League of Honour seeks to assault Paineel itself as we speak. We must defend the city! Hurry!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Shadows began stirring in the halls at the shout. Dreyk and Khurai both quickly followed Littany out the door towards Paineel. The League of Honour was rather clever in planning such an early assault, while most of the Shadows slept or were already hunting deep in the depths of Kurnak at the time. Kyri, however heard a faint ringing in her ears at the time and as it did not resemble the sound of coins, the sound took some time to seep through her sleep addled brain. Eventually it did and with a start she leapt out of bed and began tossing her armor on at the chance to kill some of the Shadows arch-nemesis.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At last I’ll finally get some use out of all this stuff.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she grabbed a dusty pack, one which she carried around for many times in case she found some lightbringers to kill. For once she would be able to break into her bag of tricks as it were, for victory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Running swiftly she arrived in the small courtyard, though small valley would be slightly more accurate by the terrain there. Dreyk and Littany had begun spreading the news they had picked up. Apparently the lightbringers sought to first sneak into the city one at a time as not to alert the guards as to their presence. Also the better to slip through anyone waiting for them as a lone traveler would be less likely to attract notice than a large war band.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Kyri slipped off to her assigned spot she sat and waited for a lightbringer to pass her by to ambush. Dreyk had mentioned that Nibbuls counted more in the assault force than the defenders had at the time as only Dreyk, Littany and Khurai had arrived for the start of the assault. Kyri didn’t bother asking how many. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A roar in the distance signaled that Dreyk, or at least Nibbuls had found someone. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah the first kill.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri reflected as the sounds of battle reached her. Apparently the lightbringer Kerys was Nibbuls' intended lunch, Kyri thought she was a shamaness but either way Nibbuls hadn’t eaten in a few hours so she wouldn’t stand a chance. At the first clash both sides began shouting from their places of concealment, both sides now fully aware that the other was present. Walkingwolf seemed to be leading the taunts from the lightbringers which of course Kyri had to respond to as the battle went on. Kerys actually had the nerve to offer Dreyk the chance to surrender, but the beast lord laughed in her face. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Besides Dreyk probably doesn’t know the meaning of the word surrender.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri added to herself- her own prejudices still strong despite repeated evidence to the contrary. As the battle took place Littany made sure to invoke the blessings of Cazic on this day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the end, Kerys sensed her weakening and began running to get some space to regroup. However a loud bear’s roar signaled that Kerys had fallen to Nibbuls’ claws. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bah the old lighty “running around a lot” strategy seems to still be practiced by them.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri noted as the race briefly brought the combatants by her place of hiding. Abandoning all cover Dreyk and Nibbuls stood in plain sight shouting a challenge for the next lightbringer to die to them. On cue, Meledi- the leader of the LoH stepped forth, hoping to save her followers from further residence in Nibbuls’ stomach. In this she had to pull rank on Walkingwolf who wanted revenge for the death of a fellow shaman. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Now I suppose he’s going to say Dreyk is afraid to face him or something I bet.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri figured as Meledi stepped forth to be the next course.<br>
<br>
 Idly Kyri noticed that Kerys’ body had vanished in all the excitement. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Curse their superior corpse recovery skills.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri swore <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>if Nibbuls would have had time to finish lunch there would be no way the evil lighties could have brought her back. Now they can.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Meanwhile down below Meledi again began the “running around a lot” tactics that Kyri noted before. But it seemed to end in the same result. Oddly Meledi wished to take some time out to teach Dreyk some dance steps… but Nibbuls was too hungry for that. Soon it seemed like Meledi wished to slay Dreyk by running him around until his heart failed him from so much exertion. In the end Dreyk gave up the chase and stood in one spot hoping Nibbuls could lure the bard close enough for him to strike. <br>
<br>
In honor of the bard who was much too busy to be singing, Kyri decided to fill in with this tune as the battle went on. “She bravely ran away in fear for she was Lady Meledi! Her armor soiled, the bear hungry, she ran away, tail between her legs, Lady Meledi will be dead again. For she was brave, brave, brave Lady Meledi!'  <br>
<br>
Oddly none of the lightbringers seemed to appreciate the song though it went over well with the Shadows. At this point Raires began taunting Dreyk, despite the far lower rank of the paladin, mostly for letting Nibbuls do all the work. Ah yes all the taunting of their leader’s tactics obviously rubbed the palascum the wrong way.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Prickly about honor and coward ness and such silliness. All that matters is who stands in the end foolish palascum.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri sneered to herself as she stood alert in case someone tried to slip past in the melee. In the end, the bard missed a note and Nibbuls had worked up quite an appetite running around so much and had leg o’ bard for a snack.<br>
<br>
Again the body vanished before Nibbuls could finish Very rude of these evil lighties, keeping a poor bear from finishing his meal and all. Kyri reflected to herself as Dreyk went around challenging others to battle. The taunt of having killed Meledi’s pet barbarian proved Kyri’s suspicions true as Kerys shouted out in outrage and demanded to be avenged. This time there was no stopping Walkingwolf from stepping forward and taking his place on the battlefield.<br>
<br>
As the two readied to fight Adar’s yawning voice could be heard as the enchanter was wondering what was going on today. Naturally Littany and Dreyk told him to get to Paineel, after two meals Nibbuls might be moving a bit slower so another Shadow or two might come in handy. As Dreyk and Walkingwolf began their fight Kyri heard a rustling in the leaves behind her and quickly she spun around to find a bow wielding Artanis standing before her. “Kyri I challenge you.” The ranger appearing Artanis stated formally. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Formal challenges? How could anyone pass up a chance to try for a quick backstab by announcing your intentions beforehand?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri asked herself aghast as she accepted. “Meet me in the clearing, then.” Kyri replied only to see Zippus and Littany already there. “Hmm OK after Littany kills the gnome, obviously not one of Cap’n Mal’s pirates.”<br>
<br>
In the meantime Nibbuls again fed on shaman meat as Walkingwolf fell to his claws, but now Littany and Zippus began their duel arcane. At first Cazic’s priestess took an early advantage and seemed certain to triumph. Then shockingly the gnomish wizard began to rally and both combatants took turns reeling from the other’s mystic bursts. Several times Littany called upon Cazic to restore her wounds and he did answer her, but then her reserves were drained. Both combatants knew whoever could land the next blast would triumph. Alas for the Shadows, Cazic grew distracted briefly and the gnome managed to land the fatal blow.<br>
<br>
As Dreyk quickly recovered the body before the lighties could get at it Artanis began walking down to the battlefield. “Be right there” Kyri added as she quickly reached into her bag of tricks and coated her blade with some rust proofing agents and chugged down another potion she picked up long ago which would create a fiery barrier around herself that would sting the ranger’s blades when he struck her- only fair since he’ll certainly have one up for me to pound on…damn thorns. Kyri thought to herself.<br>
<br>
“Ok ranger time to die.” Kyri declared as Slob could be heard in the distance awakening as Adar just arrived.<br>
<br>
“Ranger? I’m not a ranger.” Artanis claimed as Kyri felt hope surge through her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hmm he seems a bit more experienced than I am but if he’s a warrior then I might be able to pull this off after all. He’ll be taking extra damage with every hit and I won’t. Won’t have to worry about the ground coming up and holding me in place either now. Guess I’ll see if all that time getting beaten by Sarhea actually accomplished something.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Just as Kyri drew her weapons her foe suddenly shrunk on her as he drew his own weapons. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Copper!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri swore to herself at this move <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Damned warrior knows I won’t be able to backstab him as easily when he’s gnome sized.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> In the beginning the battle went Kyri’s way as her burning flesh again and again struck her foe with every strike along with her own blows. Constantly she tried to maneuver behind Artanis, looking for that clear shot to the back but the warrior wouldn’t allow it. Sensing he did not have the advantage Artanis quickly switched to a more defensive style while he tried to regroup as Kyri’s blows fell short of their mark. Many blows were missed as Kyri found her foe’s small stature more of a problem than she had expected. Not only did it make her backstabs more difficult- as she had yet to land one, but it also made it difficult to see the warrior when they drew too close. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Need some space.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as she backed away from her opponent. His screams of agony told her at least the rust proofing agents were having an effect on him though Artanis failed to succumb to the stunning nature of the agents.<br>
<br>
Walkingwolf- having been revived in the meantime was taken aback by the appearance of this rust proofing agents and wondered aloud what sort of magic was afoot- not realizing it to be another trick of the Lightly Armored Warrior Who Prefers To Strike From Behind trade. Just as Kyri grew confident of her victory, she suddenly noticed her skin was growing cooler. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Copper cursed hedge shamans!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri swore as the final hint of warmth faded. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Damn potion’s expiration must have past- the label said it would be good for three times this long. Wait til I find that ogre…</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
At the same time Artanis noticed he was no longer feeling pain upon striking Kyri and so the warrior- so inspired, redoubled his efforts and Kyri’s early edge was slowly whittled away as she more desperately sought the difference making backstab. Now Kyri was the one backing off trying to regroup, once in fact pulling out her bow and trying to whittle the warrior down from a distance. Unfortunately her shots came closer to hitting the arriving Slob at the gates of the courtyard than the warrior so she went back to her blades.<br>
<br>
Artanis was now on to her game and kept dancing around himself to ensure Kyri remained in front of him face to face- a move which clearly favored the better armored warrior. As Kyri took more and more hits while her own replies were fewer and fewer it appeared the warrior might win the day after all. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This certainly isn’t working</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as Artanis landed two blows for every one she did. The only thing in her favor at this point was that it seemed the warrior’s blades were meant for the quick strike rather than the bludgeoning blow so his repeated hits were a series of slashes and cuts and not the more deadly stabs so Kyri managed to stay on her feet even being hit more often.<br>
<br>
Finally fatigue set in and Artanis made his first mistake, in not turning around swiftly enough and Kyri drove her blade into his back. The first backstab she landed during the entire fight. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Damn plate.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri swore as the armor absorbed about half the force of the shot. As she backed away for a second stab, Artanis spun around with a glazed look in his eyes, a closer look showed a faint bit of foaming at the mouth. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That hurt him!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri realized. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The warrior’s going berserk, if I can keep from getting hit I should be able to take advantage.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Already this was progress as her battles with Sarhea in the past she never came close to making the late warrioress reach the berserker state. Unfortunately for her, Artanis’ rage was such that he began powering through Kyri’s defenses and Kyri tried to resort to hit and run tactics unsuccessfully. Meledi was bold enough to start asking for someone to answer Slob’s bellowing challenge from atop the highest point in the courtyard after Artanis had finished Kyri off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Finish ME off?!?!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri almost shouted as she heard the bard’s taunt and responded with a quick flurry that landed four cuts that the warrior barely noticed in his current state. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well at least I still have my rust proofed weapons.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She thought as Artanis screamed again only to notice the telltale sheen of the agency was no longer on her weapon. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Copper, copper, copper!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She swore as she realized that it had finally dried off due to being exposed to the air for so long. Whether she liked it or not Kyri was out of tricks and had to finish this the old fashioned way. At the same time the enraged Artanis landed a blow that nearly cut her in two as he took advantage of Kyri’s distraction. Trying to gain more space Kyri backed off but was struck several more times as both foes teetered on the brink of exhaustion and bleeding from dozens of wounds.<br>
<br>
It took a moment for Artanis to realize his foe was no longer in front of him and then charged up the small rise Kyri had backed up onto. Charging forward Artanis looked to finish the fight with one last mighty blow. Diving for her life, Kyri managed to cut him with her own sword while taking one in return, but keeping her head on her shoulders somehow. Then by instinct, Kyri shot her ragebringer forth at Artanis whose momentum had carried him slightly past Kyri and this time her blade struck true as with a final scream and the gurgling of blood Artanis fell to the ground, Kyri’s ragebringer driven through the back of his heart as she slumped over with relief.<br>
<br>
“Fatal backstab!” she shouted as the Shadows cheered, Kyri staggered off unsteadily, into a corner to heal before one of the lightbringers saw her and tried to take advantage of her weakness. A slight problem developed at that point as several Shadows had to explain to Slob that just because Artanis lost didn’t mean the lighties weren’t going to fight him as Meledi’s boast had proven to be false.<br>
<br>
While everyone was busy trying to explain this, Khurai and Adanus found their way to the battlefield, Adanus the slight more trained of the two while Raires began shouting for Littany’s death after the elders of Paineel restored her to life. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Boy I hope someone shuts that palascum up</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought while she bandaged up. Like a true enchantress, Khurai decided to let her minion Jareker do all the work and take the damage from the ranger’s thorned barrier. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Probably didn’t want to mess up her dress or something.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri added idly as she only half paid attention to the battle before her. Jareker must have gotten upset for in the end the enchantress stood over her fallen foe’s body. On the other side of the field Nibbuls found another victim to feast on but Kyri missed the particulars of who it was this time.<br>
<br>
Finally the shadows convinced Slob that it was ok to battle even though Kyri won so he went after the healer of the other League, Blayze himself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah good someone’s finally killing off the anti-Gray. I’d be more than happy to do it myself of course but…um…not today.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as she saw this next battle.<br>
<br>
On the other side a battle of the beasts seemed about ready to break out as Rrome and Dreyk sat growling at each other while Nibbuls and Rrome’s tiger companion stood and watched them. Slob was caught a bit unprepared by the flying hammer assault of the priest and despite a brief early edge in the end it was the priest Blayze who still stood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>At last, the palascum dies.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as Littany returned to the field to take on Raires. While Adar taunted Meledi mercilessly on how he would be killing her very soon the fight itself took place. Proving to Kyri the foolishness of all palascum she could not believe her ears when Raires actually asked Littany to be sure to hit him as hard as she could. Dreyk and Nibbuls were shaken from their own conflict to be to promise vengeance on the arrogant paladin if litany was to be harmed.  The battle began and Littany stood tall against the paladin’s blows as he shouted in disgust “Why won’t you die!” <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Stupid palascum thinks his godling is the only one who pays attention to his followers?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri wondered as the fight went on. Listening in on the shouting from both sides Kyri shook her head again. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Do all lighties think everyone follows Inny?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> As she heard  Blayze instruct Raires to send the priestess of Thule back to Inny. Alas for the Shadows Littany ran low on her magical energies and tried to gain some separation to gather more as Meledi taunted her for fleeing. Unfortunately the Shadows were very quick to point out how Meledi spent her entire combat running around though the lightbringers were quick to claim it to be sound tactics. Dreyk wondered aloud if being torn apart from behind is actually considered a sound tactic. Meanwhile, Raires managed to finally corer Littany and to Kyri’s disgust the paladin stood victorious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No sooner than that fight end did the two beast lords go for each other’s throats. Or more accurately watched their companions do all the work at first. Dreyk seemed a bit apprehensive at first as Rrome was of the higher rank…but Nibbuls had built up an appetite in the meanwhile. The two warders fought evenly at first until from somewhere Dreyk managed to shift the tide in Nibbuls’ favor. The tiger and not the bear proved to be the one to fall. Then without her companion to aid her Rrome soon followed outnumbered two to one as she was.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Adar sprinted out to the battlegrounds only to find Flamerge and Khurai already there. He wandered off muttering to himself about how the bard’s luck will run out soon and then she’d HAVE to face him. Instead the younger enchantress prepared for a battle of the casters as she faced the other League’s mage. This battle seemed to pass swiftly and again a Shadow stood in victory. As soon as the battle ended Adar sprinted onto the battle area ready to mesmerize anyone else who even thought of getting in there besides Meledi. Finally this rematch from High pass would take place as Nibbuls began wandering over to Blayze and sniffed him hungrily.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The battle began and Kyri was immediately stunned speechless. Rubbing her eyes she saw what she thought was truly unthinkable. Meledi was actually standing in place for almost 15 seconds. Again trying to fill in the bardic duties Kyri began singing “See Meledi. See Meledi run. Run MELEDI RUN… oops too late…” <br>
<br>
Only then did she realize that Meledi was standing in one place because Adar kept blasting her with stunning magic to keep her from using her favorite tactic. Adar appeared to have learned a few tricks after their last hour long battle for in relatively short time the leader of the League of Honour had fallen again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this point Littany realized, after being restored by the Elders again, that the guards of Paineel should be made aware of the lightbringers outside the city and hastened away to do that job and perhaps get a cleanup crew there to remove the blood drenched grass as the League of Honour was swift at recovering their fallen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Realizing the stealth approach was not working the restored Meledi quickly rallied her troops and prepared for a mass charge into the city as she came to realize the numbers favored them and the Shadows could not stop them all. However the plan was delayed as Blayze stepped forth to end Dreyk’s taunting and undefeated streak to this point. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the two prepared to battle Slob decided to visit the light bringer’s camp and test out his new noxious cloud spell on them. Soon Meledi was invoking Gray’s name in and effort to get us to “control” the ogre.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well why don’t you tell him next time you visit his bedchambers” Kyri sneered, her paranoia towards Gray not the least bit dimmed over time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “He lives as a monk within our halls. “ Meledi claimed and countered, “I fear our ladies have higher standards then some…”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ah their ignorance is truly astounding, as if I would ever let Gray get that close to me where he could more easily kill me. Obviously these foul lighties have no clue what he’s like. A gardener? Bah! Only thing he’d uproot would be a druidess or maybe a rangerette</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Kyri told herself as Dreyk exchanged unpleasantries with the lightbringers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again it was the bard who claimed Dreyk was stalling out of fear of facing Blayze, but there was a plan in the ogre’s head. As he sat exchanging insults- and ogres are very skilled when it comes to insults- he slowly but surely regained his mental powers after giving Nibbuls extra power for the fight ahead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Slob was making himself comfortable with the lightbringers- who accustomed to filthy rangers in their midst were not affected by bad smells- or so Walkingwolf claimed- Adanus began declaring that Slob too had been turned to the light. Shaking her head Kyri snuck into the lightbringers camp and whispered to Slob, “Slob these are the bad guys you’re on the wrong side again.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this point the battle began. Dreyk was quickly thrown off his game by the unheralded, devastatingly brilliant for its simplicity tactics of Blayze... Blayze stood his ground. Flaying away with his hammer the priest had Nibbuls seriously hurting. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Why won’t Dreyk heal Nibbuls, he’s getting pounded here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought nervously as Nibbuls grew weaker. Then with a final strike Blayze dropped Nibbuls to the ground only to turn around and find himself facing…NIBBULS!?!?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lightbringers were shocked by this sudden move of Dreyk’s. It seemed the beast lord could and would continue to call forth Nibbuls’ kin to battle on his behalf, just as the priest could call forth another mystic hammer with his own magics if the first was defeated. However the weakness of this plan was soon apparent, Nibbuls’ kinfolk, recently summoned to battle as they were- lacked the special protective and offensive magics of Nibbuls and proved to be much more easily slain. Despite all the beast lord’s tricks the tide of battle slowly turned in the priest’s favor- the greater healing magics at his command allowed Blayze to recover much more quickly than Dreyk could from battle wounds. A final blow to the head struck down the beast lord.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bah Dreyk got hit in the head too hard it looks like,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought, as the newly restored beast lord proceeded to compliment Blayze on his efforts. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wasted my perfectly good spin control on how Dreyk must have let Blayze win because he felt bad that all the evil lighties were being struck down by the valiant forces of darkness. Doesn’t he know the first rule of life? Never admit to anything!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri concluded as Dreyk slowly recovered. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this point the lightbringers made their charge into Paineel while the Shadows were distracted by Dreyk’s fall. Meledi had come up with a key to the secret entrance into the city <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Probably stole it, that bad singing rogue wanna-be.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as the Shadows gave chase only so see the lift lower before they could get there to stop the lightbringers. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>THIS is how you open a lock</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Kyri nodded to herself as she took out her lock picks and popped the lock getting the lift to rise up so the Shadows could pursue.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Inside the odd chase began. Few of the Shadows there had ventured much into Paineel and so were forced to follow the corpses of the fallen guards to track their foes down. At the gates of the Fell Blade, the Shadows were hit by a quick ambush of the lightbringers who obviously expected pursuit. The battle went back and forth for a bit, Kyri found time to stab Meledi a few times but they didn’t seem to add up very much, though the bard found herself in a spot where she could not run. Blayze then jumped into the fray unexpectedly and surprised by the move the Shadows backed off and the lightbringers did as well retreating into the Fell Blade. Both sides needing the time to regroup and reorganize and the skirmish did not go the way either side had expected.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then Meledi called out “Come Shadows, enter the Fell Blade and we shall finish this on their training grounds, once and for all. To the victor goes Paineel!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wordless the Shadows entered, finding their foes gathered on one side of the battlefield. Naturally taking the other, the Shadows looked over and saw they were outnumbered 9 to 5 by their foes, though some of the lightbringers were indeed far weaker than most of the Shadows there. An unspoken truce honored by both sides as enchantments were cast upon their fellows by both sides. Kyri looked a bit nervous as she noticed she was the only one actually wearing visible armor among the two enchanters, beast lord and shaman there though their better training actually resulted in Slob and Dreyk being better protected than she. Alas Dreyk still needed a few lessons in secrecy as he accidentally blurted out the shadows’ plan loud enough for the lightbringers to hear. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ogre and tactics, ogres and planning, ogres and secrecy, words that have nothing to do with each other.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri sighed as she watched her foes all gather protectively around Blayze who was to be the first target of the blurted out battle plan. Kyri’s efforts at misdirection here failed miserably as the plan was a bit too obvious to ignore.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again both sides taunted each other mercilessly as they rested up before all Hate broke loose. The grand debate of “running around a lot- great strategy or cowardly tactic” continuing as it had nearly the entire time of the battles. As the time to begin neared Nibbuls had returned and was hungry, unfortunately Adar happened to be the closest person to him so he began to ..um.. nibble on his arm which did not go over very well with the enchanter. Dreyk then tried to remind Nibbuls who he was and wasn’t supposed to be eating.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then finally, the battle began in earnest, as planned Kyri made a beeline towards Blayze, who’s standing still while healing made his back a perfect target to strike at. Soon she found the lightbringers took a page out of her book and put protective magics upon themselves which made Kyri cringe in pain with every blow she landed. However it seemed the rest of the Shadows were unable to rally against the priest. Dreyk joined in the fight against him but the two enchanters were hard pressed and Slob was forced to divert his healing powers three ways. Kyri managed to dance about unnoticed for the most part save the harm she was inflicting on herself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Time and time again she managed to resist the harmful magics the shamen were trying to cast upon her until finally a swarm of insects enveloped her. By this time the enchanters were down and Dreyk was hard pressed by the full assault of the lightbringers. Kyri continued to futile attack Blayze who seemed to have one shaman devoted to keeping him healed as the numbers of the lightbringers offered them more versatility at this point. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kyri jumped up in pain as a blast of fire struck her from behind. Spinning around she saw Flamerge standing calmly off to one side, away from harm, picking his spots to strike. Sensing the mage to be weaker than she, Kyri gave up the hopeless task of beating Blayze down and set off after the mage. The mage unaccustomed to facing drawn blades valiantly tried to hit and run with his rain magics while Kyri continued to chase after him, wounding herself on the mages protective shield more. In the end the weakened mage was so intent on evading Kyri that he found himself staring right into Nibbuls’ face and the bear tore the mage to shreds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking around, Kyri tried to figure out who was next. Looking up she saw Raires was still standing. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Finally I get to put this palascum in his place.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought gleefully as she leapt into to face the paladin. As that battle began nearby Blayze blasted Dreyk with a mighty blast of magic which weakened the beast lord to the point where Artanis could finish him off. Now only Slob and Kyri stood for the Shadows and only the mage and the gnome had fallen on the light bringers’ side. Kyri continued the fight with Raires but now she found Walkingwolf had joined in to help out the paladin while everyone else joined to take down Slob.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Continuing to hurt herself with every blow Kyri tried to remember some of the tactics she foolishly forgot to utilize earlier. Once, twice she sent Raires' two handed sword spinning from his grasp, but Walkingwolf was there to ensure the paladin had time to recover his blade before Kyri could take advantage. That weapon did strike some heavy blows against her, forcing Kyri to back off a few times and redouble her efforts to take such a damaging weapon out of Raires’ hands. Behind her Walkingwolf was nipping away at her health but Kyri would not be distracted from finishing off the paladin, who had managed to avoid letting her slip behind him the whole time. Finally with one last strike Kyri struck the paladin's sword from his hands and finished him off before he could recover it, but realized Walkingwolf’s constant blows, the paladin's own strikes,plus the magics which still weakened her left her very vulnerable. With Walkingwolf in pursuit, there was no chance of sitting out and regrouping as earlier tests proved he was wise to her trick of evading combat to recover and made sure he enchanted his eyes to reveal such tricks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slob was forced to a pure defensive role to remain alive himself so Kyri knew there would be no aid from that quarter. However Kyri did see Kerys slightly wounded from earlier fighting and so she decided to go after her next. Unfortunately a healer noticed as well for just as Kyri leapt to attack she found her foe’s health restored. With Walkingwolf still on her heels Kyri thought that perhaps by keeping the two shamen busy for a time she might buy Slob some time to do something to pull off a victory. But Kyri’s blows grew weaker as the poison seeped through her veins, one of the shamen’s wolves now decided to attack her but as Kyri drove one last blow past Kerys’ armor, her limbs grew leaden and unresponsive, the weapons falling out of her numbed hands as she slumped down to the floor, her final sight being that of Slob forced into a corner with five lightbringers bearing down on him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When she was restored by the elders some time later Kyri found all the Shadows had fallen, save Slob who fled against such overwhelming force when the last of his magical powers had left him and the lightbringers celebrated their triumph. The Elder was not sure what plots they had set forth in the city but that after a time they had all fought their way out slaying several more guards. The town watch was in chaos as the attack and the townsfolk were nervous now that their hidden city had proven vulnerable. <br>
<br>
The Elders did thank the Shadows for their efforts in trying to stop this though Kyri noted the contempt in their eyes. This is the result of relying on non Erudite outsiders to do our work. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Such failures are almost certain when lesser beings are sent to do an Erudite work.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The Elder mused as the shadows slowly regained their wits and gear. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No matter soon these inferiors shall depart and we shall reconsicrate the temple after defilement from lesser races. What does Littany see in such rabble anyway?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Kyri looked around the room after the Elder had left only one thought crossed her mind at this second defeat in a row she witness at the other League’s hands. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Next time you evil lighties. Next time will be different.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
