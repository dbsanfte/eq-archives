I'll turn the bad word filter on for this one.<br>
<br>
You're right. If this was like, Innoruuk or some other Server, I couldn't tell you how to play. Innoruuk is a server (And I'm just using Innoruuk for an example, for I can pretty much point to any other Server and say the same thing) where you go and have uber loot and do this and that, its where its supposed to be done.<br>
<br>
But this is different. This is the Roleplaying Server.<br>
<br>
It was made for Us. It was made for Roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Now for Powergamers. <br>
<br>
You come about, chanting that crap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Epics are Hard Work, epics are Hard work!&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay.<br>
So, let me go to ol.. lets say Everlore.com.<br>
Humm. Let me click on Quests..<br>
Hey! ShadowKnight Epic!<br>
Click!<br>
Hey! What is this! Is it TELLING ME HOW TO DO IT?<br>
Yes. Why I think it is.<br>
So let me go out, bring like.. I don't know 20 or so people to each event. Point to the epic Monster. Hit A.<br>
Go get a soda. Come back in about 5 Minutes. Epic Mob is dead, all is happy.<br>
Because you know what? Thats all I did on Epic Mobs.<br>
Even doing things to work on my epic (Which I didn't FEEL like getting) was just a big Yawn.<br>
<br>
I fall asleep on Planes raids. Why? Because its not hard work, its flat out Boring.<br>
<br>
Its like an EQ Scavenger hunt. Go around. Pick up pieces of a Quest. Turn it in, recieve your prize.<br>
Is it FnF or any Powergamer's fault its like this.<br>
No.<br>
But one thing for sure. Don't come at me OOC and say an Epic is Hard work, because in reality, its not.<br>
<br>
You need one thing and one thing alone for Epics.<br>
Time.<br>
<br>
You say, you have the right to play on this server.<br>
<br>
I say you are just manipulating Verant, who really worded this server incorrectly, because they don't want to admit that their other servers failed them and their Vision.<br>
<br>
I say you don't, Quxx.<br>
Do I have friends on FV?<br>
Yeah, I'm sure I have some.<br>
Are some of them playing Good?<br>
Yes sire.<br>
Am I powerleveling/assisting them?<br>
Nope.<br>
Are they assisting me?<br>
Nope.<br>
We RP. We fight. Then when all is done, and EQ is off, we go outside and have a soda or somethin.<br>
Thats no excuse.<br>
<br>
RP. Its a time honed skill, but it does require two things.<br>
Effort and an Imagination.<br>
Its hard not typing in short hand.<br>
I know it for a fact, because sometimes I'm suspect of it a little.<br>
Its just little things, like CT instead of Cazic Thule Temple.<br>
Or MM instead of Mistimore.<br>
Or OMW instead of On My Way.<br>
<br>
And you know what? I really don't care if you use Arcos. I'd perfered if people didn't, but their are some people that are Learning how to Roleplay.<br>
<br>
And more power to them.<br>
<br>
But Guilds like FnF? I'm sorry but I just don't buy it. <br>
Now Qixx, you said you don't want to be that 'I'm Uberer then thou.' Attude?<br>
<br>
But, what are you really saying when you broadcast an epic?<br>
<br>
&quot;Lookie at what I got. And Lookie at what you don't. /flaunt /flaunt /flaunt Bow to me!&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
because I can look at an Everquest Cheat Page and Follow Directions.<br>
<br>
By the way, www.innoruuk.com does it too. Just look at the Entry Page.<br>
<br>
Share your loot?<br>
Come on? What am I, a poor underprivagled EQ Toon? If this was the other post, I'd tell you where you could put your loot.<br>
<br>
Its over. Enought is Enought. Pack up your little things, and go to an server that suits your needs.<br>
<br>
And they are Generous now. Sure I bet you they are.<br>
<br>
Wait till the Secont Uber guild pops up and starts competing for Space.<br>
And the Third, and the 4th!<br>
<br>
Soon, the Roleplayer will be snuffed out on this server.<br>
We'll be mocked. Pointed at, told how much of 'Gimps' we are just because we do not want to Powergame.<br>
Everquest is much more then you seem to relize.<br>
And that will be a shame.<br>
<br>
Uniting Roleplayers for the Cause of Enjoyment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Games are fun. Games become unfun when someone walks in on everyones thats playing Pinoccle, and forces them to play Spades.<br>
<br>
I'm playing Pinoccle. I like having 2 Aces of Spades.<br>

However there are two things to consider. <br>
<br>
First, these are your perceptions based on your style of roleplay - clearly you &quot;get into it&quot; and quite enjoy it...however I didn't get a How to RP on EQ servers guide with any product I bought from Verant.  Thus, we all have different styles of RP, some of us may have played pen and paper, some may have played Final Fantasy as their roleplay background...and some of us may not wanna RP at all.  FV is a roleplay PREFERRED server - end of sentence.<br>
<br>
Second, you do not own the server, you do not have any special status on the server and you don't have the right to slander or harrass other player because they don't fit your vision.  You're looking at things from one angle my friend - someone in Fire and Fury posts that they got their epic and all you think is they are flaunting, all you can think is that everyone in Fire and Fury...or who doesn't adhere to your ideal of rp on this server is a greedy, powergaming, lewt whore...  <br>
<br>
I'm not a defender of Fire and Fury or any other guild (me and my friends do our own thing on this server) but what I am a defender of is my right to utilize this game, for which I pay a subscription fee, any way that a choose, provided it doesn't violate the user agreement.  <br>
<br>
Qixx posts a very innoffensive message and you railroad it.  Man just chill out and realize that while this may be a game, attitudes like this cause a LOT of problems in this world...and it starts in places like this.<br>
<br>
Live and Let Live,<br>

To be honest I also believe that eventually we will become like that as well.  It starts out with one uber guild, then a second pops up.  Often these two will work together, but then a third shows up and decides they need to farm Venril Sathir for legs and screw the rotation...  What I do think is that this will take a long time on this server.  It took 8 months to get ugly on Luclin, it took a year on Torvonnilous to get real bad.  It could be two years here.  And i think we will never have the population of 60's that most servers do.   Many of us have been in the high end game on other servers and we came here to start fresh.  I am not in a hurry to get to those levels again, and I will never again be a serious raider.  Plane raids  = watching paint dry, like Shintou said.  I think the thing to really get from Shintou on this issue is that a certain amount of vigilance is needed.  We should't and can't bar people from playing here, nor tell them how to play with their money.  But While is FV is the (Roleplaying preffered) server, it really is the (doods discouraged) server and with luck the rulesets will keep out much of the trash. It seems to have worked in the low end game, perhaps it will also in the high end game.  I am bothered by posts that say things like &quot;remove anon&quot;, or &quot;TLC petition&quot; because though painfull this is what really keeps us the way we are.<br>
<br>
Shintou has good points but they can't be enforced.  Do your part to discourage non rp behaviour even if its as simple as a hotkey like this if you can cast Spirit of the wolf....<br>

<br>
Here. You can post that so and so got their epic on YOUR homepage and YOUR Message Board.<br>
Thats fine and Dandy.<br>
Here, you are just flaunting.<br>
And you know what? Why should I not think that? I see no FnF member comming out here to calm it down, in fact, I think they are very behind 'Epic Flaunting'.<br>
<br>
Shintou-Vie<br>
<br>
Sorry. I didn't mean to make it seem that I owned the Server. <br>
This is our server.<br>
Our server, as the Community of Roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Non Roleplaying and Roleplaying just does not fit together. Its like trying to use Legos and Generic Blocks together. It doesn't work.<br>
Non Roleplayers just have to go.<br>
<br>
Fronicia-Vie (Roleplaying Preffered)<br>
<br>
I don't have the acual text with me, but when Verant described the making of this Server.. I remember one single quote<br>
<br>
&quot;...We believe all of our servers are Roleplaying servers...&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did they call FV a (Roleplaying Preffered) server?<br>
Verant doesn't want to admit that Ubers have taken over the rest of their Server Base.<br>
Verant had 100% intention of making this a straight up Roleplaying Server.<br>
That is why. Not because Verant wanted to make this a nice Cozy home for Powergamers.<br>
Anyhow, Why do you not go on ((Well, since I keep bringing it up I minus well)) Innoruuk. See how it is for.. oh.. 2 hours.<br>
Its not a Roleplaying Server.<br>
<br>
This is the Roleplaying server. I don't buy this &quot;Preffered&quot; thing at all. Its just a word to allow Verant not to face the Powergamers on their other Servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't tell people how to RP.<br>
I just want people to RP.<br>
<br>
I, as well, do not want to see ANYTHING change with this Server's Ruleset.<br>
TLC is great, it FORCES you to explore places that you would never go at a Level where it is a Good fighting experence for you.<br>
<br>
The Language Barrier is another thing that is fun to Roleplay with. As is the different Alignments.<br>

<br>
Becase they like you are part of this comunity and I like to hear what is happening in my community and congratulate those that succed at things.<br>
<br>
Yes this server still needs work before it can come into its own and be a great RP server.  However it will be some time before that happens and just becase one or even a few people don't fit a certain mold is no reason to chastise them.<br>

Shintou, listen to yourself...telling people who don't follow your ethos to leave the server?  Telling them not to allow their accomplishments to be displayed on this message board?  <br>

I'm quite sure that if you attained your epic (regardless of the method) and all these people were posting &quot;Congratz&quot; messages, that you'd be somewhat happy over it.  <br>

Maybe you need to start your own game or run your own message board where your Spetznaz officer moderators can quash ideas that conflict with your own.  <br>
<br>
Chill out,<br>

I am exteremly proud in helping 3 people get thier epics. <br>
This was a lot of work from a bunch of people over a long time period. So yes, speaking for myseld (not FaF) I am flaunting that we did something very difficult.  No shame here in having pride.  I am exteremly proud of being a part of the first Cleric epic on this server which was very difficult to obtain. <br>
<br>
  I do not agree that this is non-roleplaying behaviour. I (most of FaF) do not try and step on peoples RP toes. I will post congrats on the next epic achieved also, regardless of which guild the member is from. Every person playing this game is thier own hero, if you achieve something grand, be proud and shine. Where in the roleplayers rule set does it say:<br>
Only the humble shall be considered role playing?<br>
<br>
Would you not tell people in real life when your first son is born how proud a papa you are? Acknowleding an accomplishment, and reconizing others pride is called being sociable in my eyes. Roleplaying or real life. If your of the view that pride is wrong,  that is a whole different issue, totally seperate from EQ and roleplaying.<br>
<br>
A lot of what is going on here is  plain and simle:<br>
                      anti-social behaviour<br>
<br>

<br>
Is it roleplay preferred? Yep, sure it is.<br>
<br>
Does the word prefered mean they absolutely have to? Nope, not at all.<br>
<br>
If folks truly want a roleplay server I would suggest the test server. Great people there. All of them will roleplay back with you if you roleplay with them (most of those folks are GM's, guides, beta folks and some folks that are physically challenged). Low server population too, under 800 as I last saw. Either that or wait for Neverwinter Nights to come out. Then you can create your own world and enforce whatever rules you have in your little ol noggin. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

will try to keep it down to the facts this time.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying Preferred is a shortening of the sentence &quot;We would prefer it if you would roleplay here.&quot;, which is also a shortening of the very formal &quot;We would prefer it you would roleplay here, but we are not going to insist upon it&quot;.<br>
<br>
They do not mean &quot;You must roleplay here&quot;.<br>
<br>
They did not create this server for roleplayers to have their little haven, and exclude others who prefer to roleplay less.<br>
<br>
They created it as a place for people who like to roleplay to have a better chance of finding someone who also likes to roleplay.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was made for Us. It was made for Roleplayers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;so far so good... youre on the right track.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now for Powergamers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not yet even arguing logistics of who is and who isnt a powergamer, show me where it says &quot;Not for powergamers&quot; on the server description? It in fact doesnt say anything about who shouldnt be here... just who should come.<br>
<br>
&quot;You come about, chanting that crap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Epics are Hard Work, epics are Hard work!&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay.<br>
So, let me go to ol.. lets say Everlore.com.<br>
Humm. Let me click on Quests..<br>
Hey! ShadowKnight Epic!<br>
Click!<br>
Hey! What is this! Is it TELLING ME HOW TO DO IT?<br>
Yes. Why I think it is.<br>
So let me go out, bring like.. I don't know 20 or so people to each event. Point to the epic Monster. Hit A.<br>
Go get a soda. Come back in about 5 Minutes. Epic Mob is dead, all is happy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you had read what happened when we were killing the cleric epic mobs, you would have seen that we got incredibly close to a major disaster. Through the efforts of some valiant souls, we slew the fiend and attained this most holy of weapons. Also youre complaining about the reality of eq websites and cheating the system and the failures of the roleplaying environment INHERENT in everquest on every server there is and ever will be. To say that anyone who doesnt discover an epic on their own is not roleplaying is convienently forgetting the fact that you die many times, you slay the same monster with the same loot and 30 min later he comes back with the good old &quot;A magical sword 01.&quot; The everquest world is filled with inconsistencies... What if i got a magical map that told me a quest that needed solving, with all the pieces that were needed... Then i would be able to go and get it... a treasure map as you will... Well i have found a treasure map that shows me how to get a mighty weapon of the monk. The celestial fists. Oh and btw... if all it is is pressing q for autoattack grabbing a soda in 5 minutes and then coming back, why are you getting so worked up about roleplaying?<br>
<br>
You need to find some medium between incredible roleplay and the flaws inherent in every mmorpg. (this is in my humble observation of the problems we face)<br>
<br>
another post... to completely reinforce my first point, the meaning of this post is this. EQ is not a job, it is not life, it is not my well being, i play eq for fun. I think i speak for many others when i say this<br>
<br>
I saw a server that was new, uncorrupted by lvl 20 ogre shadowknights in full guardian weilding 2 lammys. One where i could be proud of myself because i was one of the mightiest beings alive. One where i would not be called an &quot;idiot&quot; for checking out a iksar female in roleplay atmosphere. One where, when the situation arrived and i was in the mood, i could roleplay the troubled iksar, the sullen monk, few of a dying order, trying to find spiritual guidance in the combat and death he sees around him. One where i would NOT be yelled at for having fun.<br>
<br>
And again.<br>
<br>
I am having fun right now. Thats what games are about is having fun. I slew spiders made of crystal last night. The powdered remains of their bodys is a gritty reminder of the blood i shed to cleanse the caves near thurgadin. <br>
<br>
We (us labeled uberdoods) have little interraction with you. We try to give you your space so that you may have fun. We dont attack you on the board. Any time that we tramp on your rights lmk. ill be right behind you.<br>
<br>
&quot;I say you are just manipulating Verant, who really worded this server incorrectly, because they don't want to admit that their other servers failed them and their Vision.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;all i have to say is are you mad at verant or me?<br>
<br>
&quot; I really don't care if you use Arcos&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;then please dont post another word on this issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its over. Enought is Enought. Pack up your little things, and go to an server that suits your needs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;this server suits my needs for fun fine.. thanks for asking though.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait till the Secont Uber guild pops up and starts competing for Space.<br>
And the Third, and the 4th!&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;theres an uber guild? damn i missed it... where?<br>
<br>
&quot;Soon, the Roleplayer will be snuffed out on this server.<br>
We'll be mocked. Pointed at, told how much of 'Gimps' we are just because we do not want to Powergame.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I will always value you for your devotion to roleplaying. When i am 60 and you are still 35, (for example) you will be no more, no less than me. for we choose different paths, neither are better or worse, just different.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everquest is much more then you seem to relize.<br>
And that will be a shame.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;it probably is, but such is life. If you claim to see more than i see in everquest, then from me this is a personal apology, i am sorry that i cannot see what you do, but i can only go about things and enjoy them as i see fit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uniting Roleplayers for the Cause of Enjoyment.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Preach on brother. Im right behind ya.<br>
<br>
&quot;Games are fun. Games become unfun when someone walks in on everyones thats playing Pinoccle, and forces them to play Spades.<br>
<br>
I'm playing Pinoccle. I like having 2 Aces of Spades.<br>
That is all. &quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Youre missing the point. Enter the metaphor. We're playing in the same room as you, on the table next to you. We may be talking loudly, but so are you.  i suggest that we both keep our voices down. We're having fun playing Spades, so if youre having fun playing pinnoccle then were both having fun.<br>
<br>
If i can take a look from your point of view... and the way you seem to come through on the boards.<br>
<br>
&quot;There should be no high levels, because this means you are not roleplaying because it should be hard to find a group, and you should be hostile towards everyone thats anti-you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You should have no items because you had foreknowlege of the loot that the monster dropped and that is the reason you came there was to get the loot&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you make friends with someone of a different alignment, you do not belong on this server&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Verant should make Everquest more like real life&quot;<br>
<br>
And lastly... your arguments are too many and intermingled to successfully understand. <br>
Perhaps if you labeled 1- through whatever for the problems that you have &quot;With Fire and Fury killing Venril Sathir on Firiona Vie&quot;.<br>
<br>
Then we could understand what is making you so angry.<br>
<br>
Please do avoid posting problems with verant, mmorpg, other players, leet talk, and other servers, as this tends to confuse the issue. <p><br><img src="http://www.huffnet.net/guild/Roster/qixxlt2.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uqixxfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QixxFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thats not my tail</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 6:11:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=218.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Just thought id say.</span><hr size=1> DAMN that was a long post... im a damn idiot.. its 3 in the morning.. and im tired... but one more thing... <br>

A. Most everyone roleplays if you give them the correct situation. <br>
<br>
B. I can play on this server if i dont roleplay.<br>
(if you dont believe this just watch me)<br>
<br>
C. I came to this server because it would be more fun. And it is.<br>
<br>
D. You (shintou) are advocating tolerance towards roleplayers on other servers and ridicule of non roleplayers here.<br>
(sounds a bit hypocritical)<br>
<br>
E. Im no leet dood.<br>
<br>
F. I can explain just about everything that happens in a roleplaying atmosphere, depending on how creative and imaginative i get.<br>
<br>
G. This issue is dead. You are You. I am Me. We are different. Try as you might, i am not leaving. Try as i might, you are not quieting.<br>
<br>
H. I know what letter comes next<br>
<br>
I. Stop laughing.<br>
<br>
J. The posts under soapbox should be policed by thread deletions rather than locking plz unless pr0n is involved. <br>

<br>
1) IC: Well, VS is kinda Evil, and for a guild that claims to be just using its Neutral's.. <br>
OOC. No problem at all. Knock yourself out.<br>
<br>
Problems I have with FnF peroid.<br>
<br>
1)It all stems from a single act. Powerlevelign. I was Tolerant. I was quiet. Live and let live, but I willnot allow Powerleveling on the server created for us.<br>
<br>
You say that seeing Dante there powerleveling that Bard has NO effect on my RP whatsoever?<br>
First of all, I left the Duengion. I had planned to fight a bit in Cazic Thule.<br>
Second of All. You think my character is just going to shurg off seeing a Darkelf assisting a Woodelf, No matter what Guildtag floats over his or her head?<br>
<br>
No. He's not.<br>
<br>
You've effectivly changed the misison of my Character now, from going into Cazic Thule and Training, to seeing this horrid thing infront of him.<br>
<br>
Guess what, you've just effected my RP.<br>
<br>
I really should stop saying that this is my last post, because it never is.<br>
<br>
Look. This is starting to get ugly. ((Is not partically fond of the RaceCard being smacked in his face))<br>
<br>
So I'm going to ask you a single Question.<br>
<br>
First off, let me restate some things.<br>
<br>
I have NO problem with what level FnF is. I never did. I RPed a ShadowKnight from 1-level 55. Verant made 60 levels in this Roleplaying game for a reason.<br>
<br>
I have NO problem with FnF getting Epics or 'uber' loot and being happy cause they got them. Hell, I would like my epic too someday. THe only problem there was just Flaunting it on these Message boards. Keep that crap to your Website, and your forums, everyone can congradulate you the same there.<br>
<br>
I have NO problem with the fact that you use Guilds like Starspun to attain things you might of lost durning TLC. In fact, having accociations like that between Neutral guilds opens up the Possibility of good Roleplaying.<br>
<br>
I DO have a problem with Powerleveling, espically OOC. I'm sorry, but its cheating, and really makes you look like an Uber guild just looking for a class you are missing so you can raid more effectivly. I want it NOW NOW NOW is not acceptable on this server, created for the Roleplayers.<br>
<br>
I DO have a problem with Powerlevelers hiding behind perferred. You know this Server was Made for RPers, they know this Server was made for RPers, I know this servers was made for RPers. Cut the Fn S.<br>
<br>
And I DO have a problem with the fact that Fire and Fury does NOT roleplay.<br>
<br>
Their are two solutions.<br>
Pack it up, force this Guild of huge porpotions to pack it up, and leave.<br>
Or Roleplay.<br>
<br>
Tell me, what is so wrong with Roleplaying that you do not want to do it?<br>
<br>
And I don't mean that Half ass RPing, I mean 'Casual' &quot;I'll RP when I feel like then I'll become an Twink Whore when you aren't looking&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
Why do you have to come here, and pretty much punch it in our faces that you are NOT going to roleplay? Why?<br>
And don't say you didn't, I remember the posts. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">Shintou Shinai, A Follower of the Life, and Words of Lanys T'Vyl.
