Why Fuvi would *want* to be an asshole is a mystery to me, but it seems to be something he's proud of. <br>
<br>
See, in Fuvi's little analogy, a decent person *would* have cleaned up the shit or at least apologized for not noticing it out of respect for Kurley and his fiancee. Clearly, Fuvi lacks that sort of respect. Someone who does not respect others has very little credibility in my eyes. Being an asshole because you strongly believe something is one thing; being an asshole because you can is just pathetic. <p><b>Isharra Moonsong</b><br><b>Property of Voskor Oth</b><br><b>Slave to the Empire</b>

Bottom line is this: it's obvious to everyone except Kzan that Fuvi meant no genuine harm with the email. Kzan thinks it was intended harm because he's the complete opposite of an asshole, and maybe so much so that the concept of being an asshole is alien to him and he can't comprehend it, or discern it from true evil. <br>
Bako et al used this email as ammunition to remove Fuvi from the guild because Fuvi pointed out the MANY short comings in the leadership of FaF. Why dd Fuvi do this? Didn't like Bako? Possibly, more likely he wanted the guild to function as well as it could. Anyway Bako's pride was hurt so he manufactured reasons to remove Fuvi, the email being one of those reasons. <br>
Now that Bako has no one to tell him how to run the guild, should be interesting to see how quickly things fall apart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukiyannfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KiyannFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 7:26:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> *stomps her feet at Attuma*<br>

<br>
You can't provide any substance to refute what I said.<br>
<br>
You imply the quote is in-accurate when it was the policy of FaF at the time it was posted, it's Bako's entire post copied first to Notepad and then to this board.  It's not editted, Bako making policy on Sleeper in a thread on Sleeper is not out of context and the quote is indeed accurate.<br>
<br>
--At any rate, the only reason I'm posting is because my EQ name and an incident involving myself was posted above in a white washed/&quot;from the hip&quot; manner.<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA<br>
<br>
--Here's an excerpt of an email exchange between us where I bring up the issue<br>
<br>
Kurley calls me a liar saying I'm trying to undermine the guild because..... I invited Bend to my group on a Hole raid even though his name had been called to another group.  He calls me a liar 3 times in quick succession, I tell him to f*ck off and but him on ignore.  Placing in context when this email was sent.  There is considerable elapsed time and he brings up something I still consider completely trivial to this day.<br>
<br>
--I gave you my email to faciliate easy communication with someone who I view as having good EQ knowledge and ideas<br>
<br>
Another lie, you gave me your email because you wanted my thoughts on Bako so you could cut and paste them to leaders, I was quite willing to cut out the middle man so never had a problem with it.<br>
<br>
--Then you pull a stupid prank and send an email hoping my fiance will read it.<br>
<br>
No, I send an email with a little twist to it.  If I had gotten an email back from your fiancee shortly after I sent it I would have told her I really don't even like you fiancee and I just sent that as something off the top of my head instead of Test.<br>
<br>
--Explain to me how anyone should perceive your gesture as anything else?<br>
<br>
If someone sent my husband an e-mail saying &quot;I'm in love with your husband,&quot; I'd be laughing my ass off. I'd read it for the amusement, because I'd be quite sure it was only a joke.<br>
<br>
The impact of your email on my end was mildly amusing.<br>
<br>
--Explain to me why I shouldn't question what kind of person you really are, to try something like that on someone you hardly know.? <br>
<br>
Because it's not a big deal no matter how often you bring it up, regardless of the fantastic world of what if where you can pretend this makes the Cuban Missile Crisis look like deciding what you want to order at McDonalds it really means nothing.  I'm wearing navy socks atm, question what kind of person I am over that instead, it's as productive.<br>
<br>
--I can forgive something like that<br>
<br>
Another lie.<br>
<br>
--My subsequent negative opinion of Fuvi thus culminated from &quot;the email&quot; in conjunction with a number of other instances (involving other people/issues), his reaction and justification to which painted the portrait of the type of RL (not EQ toon) person whom I don't like to interact with.<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
--Some may think people are making mountains out of molehills here<br>
<br>
Truth, congratulations.<br>
<br>
--some folks don't take anti-social behaviors lightly when forced to deal with them on a frequent basis<br>
<br>
Forced to deal with the behavior, once in 9 months.  If it was a problem to be forced like this you shouldn't have sent me an email again and told me not to send you anymore emails.  You forced Kzan and every other person you talked to about the incident to deal with the behavior when you would discuss it with them.  And you did so often and at length, putting them in an uncomfortable position while playing a video game for their amusement.<br>
<br>
I used a message forum and occasionally email to relate my ideas to others, I very rarely brought up anything in game, I named all my posts Hihi for an extended period of time so people would have 2 visual clues to not click on the thread if this would aggravate them.  If people want to log off a game, go to a message board, click on a thread named Hihi, started by Fuvi, read the entire post and then get upset by it they certainly weren't forced.<br>
<br>
Same as here, if you are getting upset reading this you SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE THESE WORDS, go have fun somewhere and don't cry to me.  I realize you were suckered into reading the first post, maybe got through the first page but by now you should have seen a pattern and if that pattern brings you unhappiness discontinue your behavior rather than expect everyone you might have incidental contact with to moderate theirs.<br>
<br>
--Fuvi, please note that I am trying not to throw sh!t your way <br>
<br>
Another lie~!<br>
<br>
--In fact, I did not inform anyone of the email until your behavior in-guild was escalating to the point that the officers were forced to talk about you<br>
<br>
Another lie~!<br>
<br>
--Regardless, that relevant morsel of information was discussed with a few people in the officer circle, as were other, unrelated instances of your behavior that some guild members and some guild officers didn't really dig.<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
--You'll also recall I didn't sling a pile of mud at you or anyone else<br>
<br>
You posted something like Fuvi I hope you choke on a festering pile of whale hungus you are a parasite.<br>
<br>
--but check your own recent motives &quot;truthfully&quot;.<br>
<br>
I posted Fire and Fury's guild policy to wake the Sleeper once they were done with ST in order to create a public fuss against them which could encourage them to change the policy to avoid a public backlash.<br>
<br>
I started a 2nd thread to point out that I don't lie, I stated up front I'm an @sshole to avoid the discussion falling astray in that direction, simply dispute honesty, so far I see nothing to dispute my honesty.  <br>
<br>
When you came along I took the time to make fun of you because I really think you caused yourself so much grief for no reason and then screamed about having fun.  You're a lost cause but it might help people in the future to realize that attacking a school-mate, co-worker or neighbor regardless of how sure you are in the right isn't something that is likely to provide you with any benefit.<br>
<br>
--he could have used any number of other examples to try to prove his point<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
--The way you presented that email and Bako's Sleeper post, were of course accurate in their elements (those are indeed the quotes and words used in those instances), however not truthful, except from your point of view, for your purpose. <br>
<br>
Another lie~!<br>
<br>
--bothered you enough to attempt to spin it into something less valid <br>
<br>
A dog taking a crap on your yard, a 4 line email that doesn't even maintain it's seriousness to the end.  I weigh them the same, neither is an ideal behavior, neither incident should be re-hashed at a later date.  Let's make a closer analogy for you.  I close the email with a joke :<br>
<br>
What do you do when the dishwasher stops working?<br>
<br>
Hit her.<br>
<br>
If she reads this she has to wonder why someone would think you would enjoy that joke and would take the time to send it to you.<br>
<br>
If your fiancee attacks you for me sending that joke your relationship to me is a total farce, I mean come on, get a woman that atleast has some level of trust or respect for you.  But in a perfect world that email would never be sent to me, well it's not a perfect world, get over it.<br>
<br>
--being an asshole is going to garner you a few enemies.<br>
<br>
I know, but I'll tell you something really important, people lie to their friends far more than they lie to their enemies.  Because the people involved in the game are people I only know through the game and only want to know through the game.  None of them will truly be my friends.  People trying to be my friend will be more likely to lie to me though and I don't want that.  I would rather people be honest with me, the price of their disdain I'm willing to pay for the benefits truth provides.<br>
<br>
Do I have any problem dealing with you, not at all.  How about my chat with Ramel, it's harder to black and white that one.  Because I respect Ramel, he may not be my friend, but I certainly respect him.  I'll take the time to listen to what he has to say, but like I've done I'll my life I'll make my own decisions and live by them.<br>
<br>
--And that, not the email that we're discussing, is what lead to your deguilding<br>
<br>
I know Kurley and it hurts that you spent all the time trying to get me kicked out of the guild and that you didn't accomplish a thing for all the grief you caused yourself.  I understand your pain, maybe this is part of the healing for you, good luck.<br>
<br>
--However that particular email was by no means the linchpin in my overall opinion of you. It was just a reaffirming piece of the picture, that was your consistent pattern of comments and actions towards others, which you should well know I have plenty of examples of.<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
--If I mess with the brakelines of your car, and you don't run into a situation where you're required to slam on your breaks, then it was harmless and I have nothing to apologize for.<br>
<br>
Kurley if you don't understand the difference between putting someone's life at risk and that email....  nevermind no point finishing that, just give your head a shake.  If there was harm in the email it would have been dealt with within 24h by your fiancee sending me an email and my reply.  The risk of her doubting you for that stretch of time didn't give me enough reason to simply send a Test email.<br>
<br>
--it would be much harder to play damage control on an email like that as well, wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
No it wouldn't, because I wouldn't have sent it from my own email account, it would have been from anon_user@mailboxesetc.com.  But I wasn't trying to disrupt your relationship, I was just sending you an email to test the channel.<br>
<br>
--At this point, it's pretty much just you and me reading all of this tripe I would think<br>
<br>
Actually it's not, there is a counter for views, realize people even slow down for car wrecks.<br>
<br>
--It's only after observing aspects - I'm not painting you entirely with this brush - of your interaction with the guild we belonged to and certain members, clear instances of practiced manipulation (again, feel free to refute), and the venemous disdain you practiced against specific members of our guild, did I reconsider your original intention.<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.  (There might be a pattern here)<br>
<br>
--You know that I am not the only one to have had a negative reaction to the way you conduct yourself at times.<br>
<br>
Same could be said of every single person on the planet.  Sorry I don't live up to Mother Teresa, leading to the point that :<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
--By attempting to pin your &quot;villification&quot; and deguilding from FnF on me<br>
<br>
No, I'll make the point again, you failed to get me removed from the guild regardless of your efforts, a number of people who couldn't be bothered to talk to me about concerns you raised don't like me, oh well.<br>
<br>
--I suggest you reread my previous posts in this thread<br>
<br>
I did, didn't help any, you run around in circles too much and this Kurley guy analyses your posts and really tears into you, I don't think Kurley likes you.<br>
<br>
Post 40, describes what you do so well Kurley.<br>
<br>
If you can take the time to attack yourself I guess you have too much free time, involve yourself more with the wedding plans, it's not only the Bride who should plan the wedding.<br>
<br>
You're right Isharra I don't respect Kurley. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 11:06:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Bottomline is this.<br>

If I feel like it I'll start a thread on why I was booted from the guild, I specifically point out in this thread that everything that Kurley did didn't get me booted from guild but thanks for the confirmation.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this you lied over and over again on a thread now sitting in the dead horse forum.  Your &quot;friends&quot; finally pulled the plug on you and Veloxia and admitted that my cut and paste was accurate.<br>
<br>
You're a liar Kzan and that ends any point of talking to you because nothing you say means a thing.  Just lean forward and bang your head against the keyboard next time you want to type a message because everything a liar posts has no content.<br>
<br>
Because I know Isharra will ask, no I don't have any respect for Kzan either, never had.  He spent a great deal of time spamming the FaF boards without ever offering an opinion because he wasn't sure who's @ss he might have to kiss next.<br>
<br>
You actually have no capacity to bother me Kzan but I hope by now you have sincerly apologized to Lyns, someone you knew for how many years for that outburst in Cazic Thule and the key reason that apology is needed is you didn't attack Lyns, you attacked the player, you attacked someone who was once your friend just because you died in a video game and thought it could have been prevented.<br>
<br>
Gore I guess you don't know as well, but again you didn't attack Gore did you, you attacked the player of Gore, made him quit the guild.  I know there are other factors but he went from a pep speech to the guild to removing and the main stopover was having to listen to you.  He probably deserves a sincere apology as well, not just typing out something because you have to.<br>
<br>
What would truly amuse me is if Gore said he would come back to FaF if they booted you from the guild Kzan, maybe that would be something that would make things sink in for you.<br>
<br>
Glad you responded to the thread and cleared things up Kzan, oh wait you didn't, but thanks for dropping by. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 868<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/28/02 1:35:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Hehe didnt bother to read your reply.

Yes I am friends with Fuvi.  Do I agree with everything he does?  Hell no but hey I disagree with most my friends.<br>
<br>
I will say this much however.  You will not win an argument like this by typing out statements.<br>
<br>
Logical arguments can always be twisted around if someone is good enough and from reading Fuvi's statements its obvious that he is good enough to twist just about anything you say around Kurley.  <br>

But you can't understand why when I'm challenged to make a thread because Kzan is so sure this will prove oh so much to everyone that I indeed make that thread and defend myself.<br>
<br>
Don't care who likes me, I know the clerks at the corner store closest to my house better than I will ever know any of you and I don't even like them.<br>
<br>
I'm not in FaF and never will be again, at some point it's likely I'll make a thread about that, but everything related to my removal has been brought up by others to prove that I'm an @sshole, something I freely admit, and have done nothing to dispute my honesty.<br>
<br>
--Logical arguments can always be twisted around<br>
<br>
Congrats on reading all this, even though you didn't have to, and still miss the point.  You go and post implying that I'm a liar.<br>
<br>
--You will not win an argument like this by typing out statements<br>
<br>
How else do you want to discuss anything on a message board than by typing out statements?  Well there is Option B and that's what Kurley does :<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
If you want to twist something you do so with the smallest possible audience, something Kurley did by sending tells to people about the &quot;e-mail of doom&quot; you can immediately tailor your arguments to that person.  Take things to a public forum and you lose that ability to twist things, why things Kurley tells you in game make so much more sense than his posts here.<br>
<br>
18 lines including this one on my resolution, who won?  Wait you were lying about that too, nobody wins.<br>

<br>
Good question, simple answer.  We have several email accounts on the same ISP for various reason, mainly to help keep things organized between our businesses and personal stuff and to stem spam-mail.  The account in question is a general account used for general online enquires/services, again to limit spam-mail.<br>
<br>
Fuvi:<br>
<br>
Pointing out all the lies, misrepresentations and flaws in your statements would take a lot of time - you work a couple of days a week (unless things have changed) and I work 7 days a week...but I'll focus on some highlights:<br>
<br>
&quot;Another lie, you gave me your email because you wanted my thoughts on Bako so you could cut and paste them to leaders...&quot;<br>
<br>
- It's very easy to reverse engineer after the fact to prove your point.  I gave you that email address because at the time, you and I were having some lengthy in-game chats about general EQ lore (mobs, loot...) and I really hadn't formed my own opinion of you at that time.  Here's the sequence:  talk in-game, provide you with email, have one or two exchanges, you send &quot;the email&quot;, then you begin sending a number of emails flat out flaming Bako's leadership moves and otherwise insulting a couple of other folks that I like.  This in conjunction with your famous, rambling posts on the FnF message board.  That fact that some of the officers began discussing your antics and that I had plenty of examples is fortunate.<br>
<br>
&quot;You forced Kzan and every other person you talked to about the incident to deal with the behavior when you would discuss it with them. And you did so often and at length, putting them in an uncomfortable position while playing a video game for their amusement.&quot;<br>
<br>
- This one is juicy.  I talked about this, in any depth, to 6 people:  Kzan and Tasker (they're RL friends), Bako, Restoria and Rosiel (who were fellow officers and we were discussing all of your antics and their impact on the guild in an officer chat) and Humle (long after I'd left and he asked me what had happened, and I mentioned it).  I have no control over 3rd hand gossip beyond that point.  More recently, since this was dragged onto the message board, a few people have asked me about it, and I refer them to this thread.<br>
<br>
Now as for this little gem &quot;putting them in an uncomfortable position while playing a video game for their amusement.&quot; - the only word that fits is hypocrite.  Anyone who has had the displeasure of reading your more infamitory Hihi post archives on the FnF board (which you agree have content and a tone that have upset many people, hence your &quot;easy identification&quot; labelling technique), can attest to how comfortable you've made many people and how you've impacted their enjoyment.  <br>
<br>
You can deny their existence, but within many of those threads have comments by guildmembers saying things such as &quot;You make this game less fun for me Fuvi.&quot; or &quot;relax a bit&quot; or just plain &quot;stfu&quot;.  Not eveyone plays this game as seriously as you do, and not everyone views a loot allocation, or mob scheduling as a life or death issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was just sending you an email to test the channel.&quot;<br>
- Just a bold faced lie - we'd already had an exchange or two prior to that one.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just sent that as something off the top of my head&quot;<br>
- Yeah, shows what's lying underneath. <br>
<br>
&quot;All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims. &quot;<br>
<br>
- The use of this quote:  I've written the majority of this to you and presumably you're aware of the conflicts you've had with the relevant parties.  I'm not going to cut and paste posts/logs/screenies involving people who may wish to stay out of this sh!t.  In fact, had that consideration been afforded to me (/points at Kzan...yeah you!) then we wouldn't even be having this stimulating discussion.<br>
<br>
However the patterns of your behavior and the resulting effects are totally obvious.  Shortly after I joined FnF, you were booted out of the officer circle - I guess I had a hand in that too didn't I?  Bitter and angry, you continued to wage a campaign against certain members of the leadership which resulted in you receiving a warning by the officers (for various matters) and then a couple of months later (as in recently) you were booted out of the guild.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kurley if you don't understand the difference between putting someone's life at risk and that email.... &quot;<br>
<br>
- Your reading skills suck.  I prefaced by saying...&quot;Here is an equally absurd interpretation.&quot;  You presented a weak example to butress your arguement...however the generally accepted moral of these arguements is that doing any of them exemplifies poor social interaction.<br>
<br>
&quot;If your fiancee attacks you for me sending that joke your relationship to me is a total farce&quot; and &quot;people lie to their friends far more than they lie to their enemies.&quot;<br>
<br>
- You've stated before something to the effect of &quot;It's easy for me to be good at EQ:  I work a couple of days a week, don't have a girlfriend or even a pet.&quot;  That probably explains your narrow understanding of healthy human interaction and your desperate reliance on false axioms such as the ones you cling to above.  If you think that everyone in the game who doesn't like you is honest with you, you've perpetrated a huge lie upon yourself.  Obviously you're so far down the well that it would take cutting-edge research therapy to make you understand the nullity in this approach.<br>
<br>
But you're happy as an unrepentant prick/@sshole.  Presumably you've grown accustomed to coming across that way, and this framework of thinking allows you to find happiness in the mess - good for you.<br>
<br>
&quot;get a woman that at least has some level of trust or respect for you.&quot; and &quot;involve yourself more with the wedding plans, it's not only the Bride who should plan the wedding.&quot;<br>
<br>
- You pride yourself on your high sense of intuition - you learn a few facts about someone (in the normal course of human interaction) and then use that information to paint out scenarios that support your negative attitude.  Furthemore, you use limited information, ply your limited intuition, and make lame assumptions to wildly stab at someone's personal life...wtf is the matter with you?  <br>
<br>
Let's use that tactic against you:  daddy didn't love you, he called you a prick at an early age, it stuck, you're too lazy to figure out it's not a great way to live, so you remain an unapologetic @sshole and use your manipulation of the truth to justify being such.  Golly, that's what I call a fun way of thinking about and treating other people.<br>
<br>
Responding to your inventive counter-claims is easy, as at times it's been funner that plowing through work.  But ultimately it's a waste of time because of the simple fact you readily accept:  you're an @sshole.<br>
<br>
Rant away, I'll let you have the last word so that you can find your version of satisfaction.  Lol...enjoy staring out of the prison that you call a monitor.<br>

<br>
You gave me your email and asked me to send you my thoughts on Bako someone you knew I didn't like, Bako knows I don't like him and for that matter most people by that point knew I didn't like.  You obviously weren't expected to see flowery comments, you got what you wanted them and used them.<br>
<br>
Bako at one point finally asked me if I respect him, I said no, you have done nothing to earn it.  Your relevations from the emails didn't actually enlighten him.<br>
<br>
That's what the will send you more info later is referring to, you asked for my thoughts on Bako, gave me your email address but when I logged off wasn't in the mood to type a long email.<br>
<br>
But you can lie all you want Kurley, if people choose to believe you because you're a nice guy or they liked your newsletter or you ported them that's fine.  Obviously I can't prove you are a liar, that's why credibility is important, which is once again why I made the thread.<br>
<br>
Kurley is lying to me about who he told or other people are lying to me, going off credibility Kurley is a liar.<br>
<br>
--putting them in an uncomfortable position WHILE playing a video game for their amusement<br>
<br>
-- the displeasure of reading your more infamitory Hihi post archives ON THE FnF BOARD<br>
<br>
Yes Tasker posted reading the Hihi posts made him unhappy, yet he continued to do so.  Flashing back to the quote that made me dislike Tasker and nothing improved my opinion of him since he claimed &quot;I only want what I deserve&quot; well if you read something you know will aggravate you and you get aggravated you got what you deserved.<br>
<br>
Now because Tasker is so sensitive and fails to take care of himself I'm not going to stop using a message forum to communicate my ideas.  I did apologize to Tasker for my behavior but he continued with his behavior and can be unhappy all he wants.<br>
<br>
No one made them read, they were posted in General because my access to Leaders Forum was revoked because Bako didn't like me telling him how I thought he screwed up to an audience of 5 so I had to post to an audience of 30 to 40, none of those 5 or 30-40 were required to read anything I posted.<br>
<br>
Kurley, that was the first email I ever sent you.  Your fiancee deleted it, trying to piece through the lies you told me I think that's what happened, and you may have gotten other emails before finding out about that email but that's the first one I ever sent you.  Read the actual email, it's in post 1, it clearly describes itself as a first email &quot;Just adding you to my address book for now.&quot;  How much clearer do you want?<br>
<br>
--I'm not going to cut and paste posts/logs/screenies involving people who may wish to stay out of this sh!t.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to post a picture of you having sex with a goat out of feelings for the goat.<br>
<br>
See how easy it is to lie like Kurley does.<br>
<br>
--Shortly after I joined FnF, you were booted out of the officer circle - I guess I had a hand in that too didn't I?<br>
<br>
No you didn't, you didn't have a hand in booting me out of the guild either so the word too is extremely out of place.<br>
<br>
--you continued to wage a campaign against certain members of the leadership<br>
<br>
I continued to wage a campaign against decisions made by leadership, that's the difference you continue to miss out on, personal attack - against the person, stuff I rant about - related to in game elements.  But this is getting into the why I was booted from the guild which has nothing to do with either of these threads.<br>
<br>
--the generally accepted moral of these arguements is that doing any of them exemplifies poor social interaction.<br>
<br>
You're still trying to compare the email to an action that could kill someone.  Dear god Kurley, listen to yourself.  I sent you a 4 line email it has absolutely nothing to do with trying to kill you.<br>
<br>
--If you think that everyone in the game who doesn't like you is honest with you, you've perpetrated a huge lie upon yourself.<br>
<br>
No I don't, you don't like me, you are lying to me.  Well not entirely true you are lying to a broader audience, your posts aren't in truth directed at me.  Someone is more likely to lie to a friend though, really.  Because you are more concerned about what your friend as opposed to an enemy wants to hear.<br>
<br>
Well that's the last word from Kurley, no evidence of me lying, is Kzan banned yet? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/28/02 7:02:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Okay ... in reference to my previous post.<br>
