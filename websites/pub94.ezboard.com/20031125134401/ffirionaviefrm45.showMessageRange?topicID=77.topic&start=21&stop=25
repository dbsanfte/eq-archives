<br>
Like someone above mentioned, you have one way to get some DPS.  Keep the shaman potions around... I see from your magelo you're 63.  Another huge piece of advice is get level 65, and get Spell: Mark of the Righteous (it's 65).  Yes, it's a magic resist based spell, but it's got a resist adjust of negative 55, meaning, it treats your target as if it had 55 points less magic resistance.  If you lead with annul magic (can dispel 4 buffs), you might also get the necro's shielding spell which has about 32 sv vs magic, and other resist buffs.  Pumice is maybe a good idea, but it's no longer instant, and you might just want to use Annul.  Anyway, mark that pet with Mark of the Righteous, and it takes 34 damage every time it hits you.  I guarantee you you can outheal that pet, while it chews itself to bits on you.  Your main worry then is keeping up with the taps and dots.  I really think Supernal Remedy for healing (1522 heal, 400 mana, 1.75 seconds) (and maybe Pure Blood, for curing DoTs) will help you out.  The darkness and funeral pyre type spells won't get cured by Pure Blood, but Radiant Cure will handle them, or just outheal them if the necro recasts after Radiant Cure.<br>
<br>
The ratio on Supernal Remedy before any AA points or Improved Healing is almost 4 to 1, whereas lifetaps are going to be significantly less than that.  Even if you use a damage shield potion, and the necro dispels you, he's probably not going to dispel his pet, and in this case, the pet's haste works against it.  Grab whichever of the armor pieces that Ragefire drops that casts the 9 point damage shield, too.  That gives you 9+32(potion at 65)+34(Mark of the Righteous) = 75 damage taken every time it hits you.  Even if he heals the pet, he's burning too much mana on keeping the pet alive, and eventually, he'll have to start deciding.  Meanwhile, get your hammer pet on him (it will use your resists).<br>
<br>
Oh and if you want to root, try Greater Immobilize or something like that, which also has a resist adjust (negative 30 I think).  So it'll land more often than root (but still might not land if his MR is high enough).<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and pets are undead... the (Verb) Undead line of spells should work, and that line resists a lot less than spells like Judgement/Condemnation.  You can always try that to help get rid of the pet.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure if you have to be grouped, but if you happen to have Bestow Divine Aura, you could do a test to see if you can hit someone else's pet with that to prevent it from attacking.  If it works, it might be a good trick to give you 18 seconds to cast stuff.<br>
<br>
So, I guess if it were me, I'd probably do this:<br>
<br>
1) drink shaman potion asap, cause it's a long casting time.<br>
2) annul necro<br>
3) MoR on the pet<br>
4) summon hammer at the necro (channel it)  Mostly just to slow him down.<br>
5) melee the pet with summoned hammer... yaulp 6 for haste and procs<br>
6) use tab-1-tab to heal myself with supernal remedy.  (crits are nice too)<br>
7) pure blood myself to get rid of dots, then radiant cure for the fire/dark dots.  He may recast them.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  when pet's dead, get on the necro asap in melee (and bash) to prevent him from summoning a new pet.<br>
9) consider mark of karn/mark of kings.  Probably kings due to his resists... that's if he has a damage shield up.<br>
10) probably can't root him, but if it's a fight in close quarters where you've agreed to fight to the death, it's your mana vs his.  If your resists are nice and high, lifetaps might partial.  Might be worth keeping up DA and DB too, to make one or more spells of the necro's be wastes of mana.<br>
<br>
I can't think of anything right now, but I'd have to duel a necro or two to get some more ideas maybe.<br>

1) Necro pets 60+ are unfearable. No resist will ever be used as they can't be feared (though blind, if it sticks) will act as a fear,<br>
2) Lifetaps gets a -200 (!!!) resist modifier to MR, I hope you can reach 350-400 in MR to resist them.<br>
3) Necro are bad boys to play with. Remember that the shaman potions just remove 8 counters of disease or poison (if I recall correctly) so removings DoTs will take soime cast of them. Pure Blood is your friend here.<br>
4) Debuffing the necro will : lower his MR, lower is AC (lol) and lower his HP.<br>
5) Try to get a see invis buff/potion with you. If he decide to go invis you will lose him as a target. This would be stupid against a cleric as it would kill his pet, but on PvP server, some necro uses this tactic : DoT you to death then go invis and look you die slowly. As clerics are the best guys around to clear DoTs, this would be stupid, but who knows.<br>
<br>
These are the words of the wise.<br>

keep jboots in slot one and a junk buff in two . . . delete junk buff in two <br>

Keep pumice stone in hotkey slot<br>

When dot hits in slot - hit pumice stone<br>

when pumice stone erases two slots on buffs (jboots and dot) reapply jboots<br>

<br>
Send pet<br>
While cleric is busy dealing with pet I annul him twice(gets rid of that pesky symbol/virtue)<br>
Then I try debuffing his poison,fire and disease once<br>
Lifetap<br>
Then a few dots some real gems here, a nice disease dot, then 2 fast acting dots, then a lifetap dot. Which basically means, cleric has to spend the time to clear 3 dots before he can touch my hp. If I have the time I will snare him, 70pct movement reduction, means he is not going anywhere fast.<br>
<br>
Your only real chance is getting resists to absurd high levels, 350+ then lifetaps is mostly resisted, disease and poison dots at that resist level is nearly usesless (the debuff is poison based so would not land)<br>
<br>
There is other tactics that can be employed by a sneaky necro, eg buffing you up against cold to fill a buff slot in an attempt to have the dots land at the end of your buffs.<br>
<br>
Oh and the arena is a bad place for a duel, littered with corpses of sk's, wizards, mages. Necro wake the dead aa ability will wake one of these corpses up to burn you to the ground. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gravely>Gravely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/23/03 3:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely_face_60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics Dueling Necros</span><hr size=1> Curious, but does Banishment of Shadows work on wake the dead pets?  Might not due to a level cap but who knows.<br>
<br>
Radiant Cure 3 is your friend in necro duels, I think, because of all the counters of stuff it cures, plus it can cure snares, dots, etc that you'd use pumice stones for otherwise.<br>
<br>
My advice when clearing DoTs would be hit yourself with Pure Blood til all the stuff with poison and disease counters are gone, then radiant cure, that sould clear snare, fire dots, and resist debuffs.<br>
<br>
Also, the more unbuffed hitpoints you have, the more time you have to react, and the more efficient your heals.  If you have 3k+ unbuffed, and have tons of healing AAs, then Supernal Remedy is going to heal something like 1800-2100 hps before crits, and up to 3915 or so on crits (with Improved Healing IV).  I would get your unbuffed hps up to the point where you can tab-SR-tab at 40% and get a full 1800+ heal every time.  With mana efficient cures for DoTs, huge damage shields, and such, you really just need to raise your mana efficiency significantly above the necro's (since they regen so much faster with lich).<br>
<br>
Sv Fire would be good for funeral pyre, too.  It's n100 resist adjust, so you'll need 200+, really.  But if you can get it past there, that's 450 mana per resist wasted.<br>
