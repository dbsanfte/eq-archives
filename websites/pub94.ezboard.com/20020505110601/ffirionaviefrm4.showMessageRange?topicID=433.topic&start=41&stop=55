<br>
I had just made level 8, and was so darn thrilled to have enough money to buy one whole level 8 spell AND the rest of my level 4s. I had to try them out! Plus, I can use the practice.<br>
<br>
So, I carefully mem up a couple of spells, go stand over between the elfy postal wench and the two clockwork merchants in downtown Ak'Anon so I am out of the way, target myself for safety, and start casting.<br>
<br>
*cast minor shielding* - All is well!<br>
*cast true north* - Hey, look! The wall! *turn back around*<br>
*cast summon food* - Yum.<br>
*cast fire flux (a new level 4!)* - A point of Evocation! Yay! OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! And look... here I am back outside. And the guards are giving me that condescending look and snickering.<br>
<br>
Apparently I was too close to the merchants and the bard and they didn't take kindly to my spell practice. I guess I should read that &quot;point blank damage shield&quot; description a bit more carefully next time.<br>

The members of my party were being cut down one by one... I managed to pop out in the slaver caves, and got sneak hide up before they agroed, then snuck through and moved towards the zone.  I noticed I didn't get the evade message though... so I figured Dvinn hadn't noticed me!  The last of my group died, yet I leasurly walked toward the zone... and shouted &quot;I LIVE!&quot;  I was so happy.  Then I saw Dvinn and a number of orcish buddies of his, perhaps 8 total by now, bolting from the zone line towards me.  Ouch.  Needless to say, I didn't survive that.<br>

   Welll, this was on an old server, where I played a magician.<br>
<br>
   I was travelling with this bard in Cobalt Scar to Siren's<br>
Grove.    We were late for a raid, and headed into the tunnel<br>
where the Siren's are...<br>
<br>
   Invis dropped right near the tunnel entrance, and I was<br>
charmed almost immediately.    The bard stopped, not<br>
knowing what had happened, and I welllllll <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  nuked him.<br>
And being he was stunned, confused about what was <br>
happening, got nuked again before he made it to zone....<br>
He died.<br>
<br>
   Charm drops on me shortly thereafter, and I manage to<br>
zone into SG with very little damage.     It was kinda tragic<br>
for him, but I couldn't help from laughing my a$$ off.    I was<br>
totally not in control of what had happened, but he died so<br>
quickly and was taken so much by suprise.<br>
<br>
   Anyways, the only other runner up I have was the Cleric<br>
who modrod'd him self to death on a group CR...<br>

Stuck around, got intimidated in the desert of Ro, so I decided to head back and try out Crushbone. Was very conscientious on the way TO Freeport, hit the soulbinders in FP and Kaladim, but on the way back, I forgot. <br>

I was also very conscientious to pick up all the Kelethin bard mail on the way back. So I went directly to the bard guild hall, turned in the mail... <br>

I'm in the habit of hitting forage every time it refreshes. Forage is, stupidly, next to KICK on my hotbuttons. I meant to forage in the bard hall, and instead kicked a bard in the ass. <br>

<br>
I was heavy into trade skills on that server too.  I had just fashioned some new armor and wanted to advertise a bit.  I planned to go afk for a while.  Instead of logging out I went afk while sitting on a post on top of a balcony overhanging a common walkway in East Cabilis.  I figured people would con me as they walked by and might ask where they could get some armor like mine.  I left the computer...<br>
<br>
I returned about 30 minutes later just in time to see myself die.  How you ask?  I was killed by a Froglok Slave!  <br>
<br>
Apparently some noob was fighting the frogs near the Toilmaster there in town.  The noob died but the frog was still mad.  It noticed me sitting on the post and decided to attack.<br>
<br>
I scrolled back and saw he had missed me over 100 times before he finally hit me for 2 points of damage.  When something hits you you are moved just a bit.  His single hit was enough to bump me off of my perch.  Since I was sitting just over the water I fell in.<br>
<br>
I returned to my computer just in time to hear my last gulp of water and was staring right into the face of the Froglok Slave.  He hit me one time through the whole thing.<br>
<br>
I am probably the only lvl 40 SHM to ever manage to get killed by a lvl 1 mob.   &lt;sigh&gt;<br>

I'm sure somewhere, someone has done something similar to this, but far as I know I'm the only one to do it quite this crazy..  On occasions where a fear raid has wiped out on north wall and no clerics made camp-out, rather than waste time on a lengthy CR I'll do this:<br>
Get Spirit of Scale, full hp buffs, and invis.  Zone in, and then I'll side strafe in a circular pattern up and down the west half of fear until all of the mobs are on me in hot pursuit.   On one pass I'll swing by camp and get target on a cleric corpse. Once there are no more rovers on the north end, I'll go as far south as possible, wait for them to catch up (so I can get lead time), and then head north on a final pass, get into minimum range to cast rez on the cleric I had targetted, and then run as far toward the northwest corner as possible before the hellhorde catches up to me.  Needless to say, the ensuing death is quick and decisive. <p><P><SELECT NAME="D1">
