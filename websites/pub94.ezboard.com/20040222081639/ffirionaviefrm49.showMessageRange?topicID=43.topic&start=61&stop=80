Yeah, it's not possible for someone to have levelled a toon on another server and traded toons or such to get here with their friends.

<br>
If someone buys your friend's car and avoids paying tax on the purchase by declaring it as a &quot;gift&quot;, do you feel uncomfortable driving when you see it on the road with someone else behind the wheel?  When someone who sits next to you at the soccer game sells his/her season tickets to someone one else, do you feel uncomfortable when you get to the game and see the other person sitting there?  If I were to let someone use my credit card, would you feel uncomfortable using a credit card issued by the same company?<br>
<br>
All of the above mentioned things are against &quot;the rules&quot; and all of them are fairly common occurances, yet I rarely see anyone besides authorities getting up-in-arms about any of them.  Selling a car without paying tax (in the US) is a violation of the law, selling tickets to a sporting event can be called &quot;scalping&quot; which is against the law in alot of states, and using someone's account at any kind of business is technically identity theft (federal offense). <br>
<br>
In what way does knowing a character was ebayed/given/traded/sold make you uncomfortable playing the game?  If you're grouped with one, and they suck, you leave the group!  Who really cares?  <br>
<br>
I think it's time we got off the ebay high horse, it happens.  It's going to keep happening.  Getting &quot;uncomfortable&quot; about it ruins who's gameplay?  Nobody's but yours.  *shrug*  If you want to self-impose stress into your virtual life, be my guest, but it sure seems that your behaviour is as rediculous as the people you're pointing a finger at.<br>

I think it odd that people would see the trading of a piece of art (RL time and talent are used here) for in-game plat as something to be encouraged while discouraging the trade of money (RL time and talent are used here) for in game plat.<br>
<br>
Stavenham V, you are simply looking at this from two directions at once and confusing them.  It is not in question that the sale of plat is contrary to the EULA.  What is in question is the difference in purchasing it for RL money (the result of work) or goods/services (the result of work/work itself).<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of this goes, I judge people by how they act at the time that I meet them.  I get my first impression of them and try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I try to forgive wrongs as quickly as I can and move on with my life.  I do not actively condone the breaking of rules, but I also won't hold it against anyone should I discover that they did so.  <br>
<br>
What matters most to me in this game is the &quot;now.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The reason we all come to Norrath is to have fun.  We enjoy what we do.  Some of us find the hunt the most enjoyable aspect.  Some of us are social magnets and spend the time making friends.  Some of us are after continual challenge.  Some of us enjoy the accomplishment of defeating the next creature.  Some of us just want to be the most powerful people around.  And some of us just want to be wealthy.<br>
<br>
There are so many aspects to this game to enjoy that it caters to a great variety of people.  Some don't want to spend a year to get a character up to level 60 with all of his skills maxxed, a GM in a tradeskill or two, an epic, and nice equipment.  <br>
<br>
Is it anti-roleplay to do so?  No.  I've run many high level D&amp;D campaigns where everyone started at level 25 so we could experience something new.  The players just had to make up a story for how they got up to where they were for background.  It has nothing to do with role-play.  There are many valid role-play ways you can explain the transferral of a character from one player to another.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, Sony is too concerned with making money to enforce that aspect of the EULA.  The agreement is with Sony and the individual players.  The agreement is not with the individual players and each and every one of us.  Our complaints here on this subject do no good.  Sony does not read this board and make their legal decisions based upon our complaints.<br>
<br>
I suggest we all live and let live...or better said, play and let play.  Remember that we are all here in Norrath to enjoy ourselves.  We all enjoy different things.  The GMs enforce what rules they see as important, so those who KS, ninja loot, and train intentionally are punished, while those who are seeking enjoyment from the game in a non-destructive manner are allowed to play as they wish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teiraa>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/38/38498/folders/25939/182645blueheart5.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Innoruuk also needs love</span><br>  Posts: 462<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/2/03 3:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebay Guilds (the post that will give you fuckers a clue)</span><hr size=1> Seems you got my point wrong.

<br>
You want a high level toon with some gear and a reputation and all that without dealing with the low level drudgery? Ebay till you can’t ebay no more.<br>
<br>
You want phat lewts and plat with minimal effort? Ebay, baby, ebay.<br>
<br>
You want to prove you have phat class skills that you learned with your 60+ toon on alternate_server_01 and feel that levelling a new character is a waste of your time? 4 letters - ybea, figure it out.<br>
<br>
You want the fastrack easiest path? I’m sure by now you have it figured out.<br>
<br>
You want to play the game and earn the respect of a goodly sized chunk of this server? Eb.... oh no wait, thats gonna cost you something other than cash. Effort, I believe, is the only currency that can buy that.<br>
<br>
Now to be fair, I suppose after the toon is bought alot of effort could raise that char’s rep a bit, but don’t ever expect those that knew the “real” so-and-so to ever fully accept the “evil-ebay-cloned-so-and-so.” And further more, expect every dollar you spend on ebay loot and plat to drop some folks opinions of you a notch or two. On the positive side, there is a growing number of folks that won’t care, but that’s largely because folks don’t like pointing at mirrors.<br>
<br>
And as far as arguing about this goes?<br>

Do you ebayers really think the anti-ebay horde (AEH), myself included, is going to have a change of heart? If so, allow me to strip you of your innocence. No. We want you beaten with wiffle ball bats until you pee yourselves and promise to never do it again.<br>
<br>
Are any one of you going to have an epiphany and delete all your toons and lewt bought with RL green? Of course not and any one of the AEH that is holding his or her breath waiting for that to happen might want to find a nice soft spot to land so when s/he passes out, it won’t hurt too much. You may pelt us with wiffle balls until we awake if said scenario occurs.<br>
<br>
So lets just get together, play some wiffle ball (Team Ebay versus the AEH winning team gets lifetime supply of absolutely nothing) and put this topic to rest as this argument is really going nowhere, and will only continue to do so. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/JCOLE1/pnimages/talastiusportraitsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Ticket touts are great if you really wanted to see that concert but it was sold out. You shell out a fortune, voluntarily, and get your ticket. Everybody's happy.<br>
<br>
Until you realise that the reason the concert was sold out was because half the tickets were bought by touts.<br>
<br>
[this is a very loose metaphor, but:<br>
<br>
1) Ebayed gear diminishes the success of those who have worked for their stuff. <br>
2) Ebayed characters take up spaces in guilds, which others may have been aiming for but no one can level faster than the ebay team. <br>
3) People who have no qualms about making RL money from ebaying probably have no qualms about, say, buying all the high end gear / tradeskill components in the bazaar, thus giving themselves a monopoly, then doubling their prices. <br>
4) Ebayed people are often very skilled, yet ebaying increases anonymity, and it is only through lack of anonymity that we are able to &quot;police&quot; our server i.e. person X is a griefer... or did they ebay? Or did they just pretend to ebay in order to clear their rep?<br>
5+) &amp;c there are probably a billion and one other little reasons which I didn't think of on the spur of the moment<br>
<br>
In short, ebay used responsibly by nice people is fine. But unfortunately it is also used by some rather more unsavoury types who use it for their own, exploitative ends.]<br>

There is a reason it's in the same breath as the anything that sucks too much bandwith clause. It's there to give the recourse if somebody comes along and tries to make a buisness out of it. Too many folks doing this and it just sucks resources away from 'real' customers. So they have to discourage it to some degree. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~mcjohnson/images/EQ/sig52.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

They are in my guild...skilled as hell and actually help me and many others in the guild enjoy content included in EQ that we may have otherwise not seen. They conduct themselves in a manner in which I can respect. They don't Grief others that I have seen. They spend their time helping this guild do things. They rarely ever come here,that is true. I can see some of your points here in these threads. Ancient Darkness is a guild that I am glad showed up on FV. I and my wife were looking for a guild that fit our playtimes and play styles. We had 2 choices....A full raiding guild or a family guild. We are somewhere in the middle of that and there really wasn't a lot of opportunity for us.<br>
<br>
Demented came along and I spoke to one of the would be officers the night he landed here. Hell I thought he was my old friend come back from the grave so to speak. We spoke for a bit and he told me what they planned. I sat and watched for a little while to see if what he said was true. I asked around and asked some people that guilded with them and heard nothing but good things.<br>
<br>
A few days later we joined. To be honest with you...it was the best move I ever made. My wife and I have never been happier in a guild. Sure we have some folks that came from another server and are residing in other people toons. You know what though? I miss my old friend Groggle....he was a great guy. The new Groggle....he I consider a very good friend of mine. So on one hand I lost a friend when Grog quit playing. On the other hand I gained another good friend. I must also say that all of the people that made the trip over from their former servers and now inhabit someone else's toon in AD have become some great friends of mine. These folks are decent people and skilled at what they do. To be honest with you...I wouldn't trade them. They brought my wife and I something we were missing on FV. To those of you .....you know who you are, Thanks.<br>
<br>
Ebay doesn't hurt everyone. It has helped some of us in ways that weren't available at the time. I am sorry for you...those that are unhappy by this taking place. I wish there was a way to make things better for you but, My guild just wouldn't be the same without these people in it. I invite you to speak to them one on one sometime...see who they really are if you give a damn.Your choice....or you can continue your hatred of them for what they did. <br>
<br>
Life is what you make of it...even here in EQ.<br>
<br>
As people say....Opinions are like asses.....you know the rest. This was and is mine.<br>

It hurts because one night I reviewed my friends list and found that half had e-bayed. Maybe if there wasn't an e-bay they would still be here. They wouldn't play as much, but at least they would still be around to chat with, hang out, have fun. As myself, and Yethuy, and Xethux look around a huge amount of the people we grew up with, so to speak, are no longer playing. No all of them did not e-bay, but e-baying sure didn't help us out any. When I look at my friends list and realize that only six of them I knew before level 30, and every single one of them is now in F&amp;F (or applying), except Cora (hugs to the Goblin), this is where E-bay hurts. It hurts in the heart and soul department. Some have come back lately, and some play alts, and no, I wouldn't tell you who they are for all the phat lewt in the world, because they are my friends. <br>

<br>
Do you think the game is so shitty that you refuse to play it from start to finish like everyone else? Why bother playing at all? If you have so much contempt for the &quot;early game&quot;, why bother playing at all?<br>
<br>
Is this game REALLY so hard that you can't do a frikkin thing on your own?<br>
<br>
Are your social lives so empty that you'd spend extra RL cash to some stranger for a damned video game?<br>
<br>
Ooh! Whoopie do, &quot;Ebay guild&quot;, you all got the power up and won!<br>
Too bad you cut a shitload of corners to get there!<br>
This is on par with sticking your hand in the bank in a game of Monopoly, while the others sit, watch, and continue playing with you.<br>
<br>
Where do you get the balls bragging about your accomplishments, when you completely cheated to get to the end game?<br>
<br>
Everyone who defends someone buying plat, characters, equipment with real money...you're defending someone who cheated.<br>
<br>
There is NO argument against that. No valid point to be made.<br>
It's cheating.<br>
Pathetic cheating.<br>
Proud of yourself, Ebayer?<br>
You cheated!<br>
This really isn't any better than someone who begs.<br>
You all hate the beggars, don't you?<br>
They didn't do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>shit</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to earn anything.<br>

<br>
the first time its all very exciting, wow you finally made 50, WOOT 60!! Thank god 65....theres a great sense of accomplishment in that.<br>
<br>
the 10th or 11th character you do it with it starts to wear REALLY thin.<br>
<br>
By the time you have played several characters up to 50 you will have a few high level friends that can quite easily help you get a character up to level 50 in under 20 hours of gameplay.<br>
<br>
And thus you have a choice, ask 2 or 3 of your friends to help PL you up to the high end, or spend a bit of pocketchange to save them the trouble.<br>
<br>
I mean the arguments saying &quot;ewww how pathetic is it spending $ on a video game&quot; are a bit stupid. Firstly the $ involved in doing this are lunch money for some people (yes we arent all teenagers playing this). Secondly you are here spending time reading a messageboard about a game that you pay $ to play.... thats hardly a stereotipically cool way to spend your time.<br>
