In his heart, the high elven cleric felt slightly sick at the sight of it, but he pushed those thoughts aside as the next wave of creatures were brought in by the pullers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assist me now on a Thifling Sprite!&quot; yelled the &quot;main tank&quot;, a brash young shadow knight of dark elven stock. With well-practised cohesion, the invading army brought its wrath down upon the latest servant of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Zarros had come to Growth, for promises of the power the items garnered from its inhabitants, and the rationalization that Tunare was all of nature, not some thing that could actually fall before mere mortals. He knew, and could feel in his soul, that these actions were earning him the hatred not only of the residents of the Plane of Growth, but also with his home temple.<br>
<br>
Suddenly his faithstone felt unnaturally heavy in his backpack.<br>
<br>
Hours passed, and the carnage continued. All matter of riches and wealth were pulled from the fallen beasts and servants, all enriching the guild that Zarros had joined some scant seasons ago, although now well advanced past his 60th season, they came considerably slower than when he was still young. With every death, he felt a coldness within his soul, which he pushed aside as naught but his imagination.<br>
<br>
Finally, the spotters announced that Growth was cleared, that Tunare was alone and waiting for us. The guild moved forward, ready to strike. <br>
<br>
Tunare stood, watching them, with naught but a summoned bear spirit next to her, awaiting the inevitable. She had not invested much power in this avatar, merely enough to have a presence near to where her children could come and visit, for she was often busy on realms of existance incomprehensible to even the most powerful mortals.<br>
<br>
The guild surged forward, and the battle was joined. Almost as if she wished to die, the fight was unnaturally short. Towards the end of the battle, the cry went out &quot;You will not evade me Zarros!&quot; and suddenly the elf found himself standing before the form of enraged avatar. As the avatar prepared to strike the traitorous elf, a final onslaught from the guild layed it low, but also left Zarros drenched in Tunare's blood.<br>
<br>
Cheers rose up from the guild, and the loot marshal sauntered forward to inspect the remains. Immediately the formerly disciplined force broke down into excited talk about what &quot;phat lewts&quot; had dropped, and who would be eligable for them. <br>
<br>
While this was happening, Zarros started feeling extremely dizzy. He started staggering a bit, and found it difficult to see, or even think clearly. Voices trailed into muffled and indistinct noise, and he thought he felt hands helping him down. The spinning sensation became extreme, and suddenly that &quot;imaginary&quot; coldness became very real. His last conscious memory was of hearing two voices. <br>
<br>
The first was that of an angry woman. &quot;He has betrayed me! I will have nothing to do with him, and shall not allow his soul to be reincarnated anywhere on any of the shards the Nameless has made!&quot;<br>
<br>
The second was masculine, but venomous, almost dripping with hate. &quot;Then he is mine, I claim his soul since it has rejected you, and you it!.&quot;<br>
<br>
The female voice replied &quot;Very well, let him live forever knowing what he has lost, and forever outside the bounds of my realm!&quot;<br>
<br>
The next thing Zarros experienced other than formless, soundless, sensationless blackness was a searing pain. He felt as if he were being remade from the very foundations of his body and soul. He felt the great power invested in him by Tunare, and honed through many seasons of adventuring, torn forcibly from his body. Furthermore, even the potential to serve as a cleric was burned from his soul, cauterized forever.<br>
<br>
He screamed, or thought he did. A soundless scream of infinite agony, across endless blackness.<br>
<br>
**You shall be Xarros now my child. Serve me well, or return to this oblivion!**<br>
<br>
Slowly, Xarros became aware of a hardness under him, almost at the same time he became aware of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; again. In the distance he could here voices. He started opening his eyes, and saw a grey stonework ceiling above him, breathing revealed the air to have a very stale tang to it, he recognized it as the tang of dungeon air.<br>
<br>
Sitting up, he could feel the residual effects of his torture, muscles ached for it. Looking around he could see bustling activity, and dark elves everywhere!<br>
<br>
Where in Tunare's name was he?<br>
<br>
A male dark elf bent down and helped him up. &quot;Xarros, are you ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wh-where am I?&quot; he asked, looking around in fear, sensing the incredible power of many of the teir'dal around him relative to his weakened form.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Hall of the Dead you twit! Now quick, before the guildmaster decides to make you a diplomatic envoy to Felwithe, give him your training note!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm in Neriak.&quot; it wasn't a question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course you moron, where else would you be? Now hurry!&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost as if his body were no longer under his control, Xarros found himself walking towards the leader of the Shadow Knights of Neriak. As he numbly handed in his note, he found his hatred stirring.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was just an avatar, a fragile thing, I didn't really betray Tunare and yet she reacts in this way, turning me over to Innoruuk to be remade?&quot; he thought. Then, with a rising anger and hate, &quot;Very well then Tunare, if thats how you want it, then thats how it will be! I shall be the one to build a bridge from Tunaria to Faydwer on the bodies of your 'children'&quot; he sneered to himself. &quot;You want me as your enemy, that I've so wronged you, then I shall temper my hatred, and the world will tremble before it! I have been damned, but I shall not be damned alone!&quot;  <p>--------------<br>

<br>
The air was thick with the scent of incense, which was ironically the thing Xarros was having the hardest time getting used to.  Apparently the teir'dal loved the various scents to the point of the air being barely breathable.  For a moment, he felt a pang of loss for Felwithe, and its clean and open air.  His entire existance as a dark elf had so far been confined to the dank caves of Neriak.<br>
<br>
That pang, was quickly followed by searing hate.  It was Tunare that left his soul for Innoruuk.  It was his &quot;mother&quot; that had cast him out for naught but a mistake, for a simple mortal error in believing that her avatar wasn't actually hers, but was a mockery of her.  She could have forgiven, she could have warned, she did neither.<br>
<br>
The hypocrisy of it, she was no better than Innoruuk in terms of her real disdain for the elves.  At least Innoruuk was honest about it.<br>
<br>
Ulraz S`Lon spat at him &quot;So you are the next pathetic maggot I have the displeasure of training to be a useful Shadowknight of the Lodge of the Dead. First you must get yourself outfitted in a suit of armor, those rags you wear can not even contain the stench of your miserable hide and will do no good protecting it from the edge of an enemies blade. &quot;<br>
<br>
Xarros nodded, then dared to speak, &quot;Where shall I find this armor?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulraz S`Lon spoke &quot;Seek Krivn S'Tai in the Commoner quarter of Neriak and give him this request parchment. Krivn S'Tai has been paid in advance by the Lodge of the Dead for the requested service. Simply give him the request parchment and he will instruct you further.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulraz continued quietly, so that only Xarros could here it, &quot;Do not make light of this chance...I argued that we should put your head on a pike for your origins, and I would gladly do so should you fail.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xarros paled under his blue skin, did they know his origins?<br>
<br>
&quot;No commoner such as yourself should have been allowed in here as a servant, let alone a knight in training.&quot; The venom in his voice was unmistakable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rest assured, sir, that I will take every opportunity to make sure you *fully* appreciate my devotion to Innoruuk&quot; Xarros spoke back, his voice dry with sarcasm.  He had learned quickly, that wishing Innoruuk's blessings and appreciation upon others was both blessing and curse among the teir'dal.<br>
<br>
The distinction was not lost on Ulraz.  &quot;Perhaps you will, but you have much to prove before your words are anything other than just that.  Now begone filth, before your presence gives me excuse to indulge myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a curt bow, Xarros spun on his heels and left.  He stopped by the communal barracks he and the other squires shared, and retrieved his meager belonging.  Stepping outside of the Hall, he wandered down the long passageway that connected the cavern it was in to the rest of the Third Gate of Neriak.  <br>
<br>
Where he saw the ghouls that guarded the entry, and the festering corpse of some half elf, long since stripped of its gear and valuables.  He stopped and regarded the ghouls, who in turn seemed to regard him warmly, sensing the bond Innoruuk had placed on his soul, and securing his right to walk freely.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder if he was here for the same reason I was so long ago?&quot;  Xarros' experience in Neriak as a koad'dal priest was restricted to an assault into the edges of the Third Gate to secure a necessary component for another koada'dal, a paladin, to complete his quest for his holy sword.  He futily wished he had paid more attention to the maps of this place compiled from various spy reports. <p>--------------<br>
