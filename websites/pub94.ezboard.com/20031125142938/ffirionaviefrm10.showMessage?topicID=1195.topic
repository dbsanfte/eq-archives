<br>
HE  WAS SLOWLY walking through a corridor decorated with thick tapestries and big paintings of warscenes when all of a sudden someone jumped from behind a corner. It turned out to be Argo, his best friend. Argo was a 16 year old boy and they had been best friends for as long as he could remember. They both lived in the Kings castle in the city of Sarlon. Brynna was the son of the castles arrow fletcher and for some years now he worked for his father. Like his father, Brynna had short pitchblack hair but in appearance took after his mother who had been a servant in the castle but died ten years ago. As for Argo, he was the son of the castle blacksmith. Argo was a brown haired boy who also had been working for his father these last few years. Because working in a smithy was a much more physical job then fletching arrows Argo soon became a strong and well muscled young man while Brynna remained more graceful and slender build, but still had strong arms from shooting the bow. <br>
<br>
“Ha, defend yourself!” cried Argo as he raised his wooden sword. “Prepare to die!”, was the reply as he quickly lifted his own  sword. They began to fight, each trying to hit the other. At first glance you would think that Argo was the better of the two boys, because he was half a head bigger and a lot stronger. But looks could be deceiving. While Argo was bigger and stronger, Brynna was faster and more agile. Therefor he could evade most of Argo’s swings and launch some quick trusts himself. While playing their favourite game they didn’t notice they were being watched…<br>
<br>
From a short distance a man was watching the two boys. They didn’t see the man because they were completely lost in their fight. These two could be of use thought the man. Lets see if I am right. “You two!” the man shouted, watching as the startled boys turned to look who had spoken and started to ask what the problem was. But when they saw the man they fell silent and their faces began to turn red. The man studied the boys intensely for a moment, seeing that they were getting more nervous by the minute.  “You know who I am?”, he the man. “Yes Sir”, said Brynna, “you are the Arms-Master”. “So, it appears that the two of you want to learn the art of the sword, eh?”.  “Yes Sir”, they both said. It had been their dream to become a swordmaster. The castle guards where famous throughout all the lands for there skills in combat. “Well, then your wish might come true, but it can also turn out to be not quit what you hoped for. I am looking for new recruits to expand the castle guard and I think the two of you will do just fine.” Smiled the Arms-Master enigmatically.<br>
<br>
Brynna and Argo were staring at him with open mouths. They looked at each other for a moment, thinking the same. They were going to be swordsmen!. “Well, you wanna join or not?”. “Yes Sir!”, they almost shouted. “Good, then come to the guards practice square right after the midday meal”, and with that the Arms-Master turned and walked away leaving them speechless.<br>
<br>
For some time after the Arms-Master was gone they talked about becoming castle guards. After the excitement wore off a bit they realised that there was a problem, Brynna’s father. Argo’s parents always thought that Argo should pursue his dreams, so there was no problem there. Brynna’s father always said that being a guard got you killed. Be a fletcher or some other steady job he always said. Be sure of your future. Well, that was exactly what Brynna wanted, not being sure of what the next day would bring. The excitement of travelling the lands, meet strange people and see cities. So, when they realised the problem they went to see Brynna’s father in his fletcher shop in the main courtyard. As they entered the little shop his father looked up from his work. “What is it?”. “The Arms-Master just asked us to become castle guards dad”. “What!!, no way your becoming a soldier!”. “But dad, I really want to, Argo’s mom and dad don’t mind him joining and besides, its been my dream to become a castle guard dad, please let me join them, please!”. “hmm, let me think a moment, well…I suppose I’d better start looking for a new apprentice then…”. It took a moment before Brynna realised what his father had said. “You’ll let me join?!, thanks dad!!!”.  He rushed over to his father to give him a big hug. “yeah, if you really want it then there is nothing for me to do then to support your decision. Well, at least you can beat them at shooting the bow”, smiled his father. This was no exaggeration since his dad was the best man in the surrounding country with the bow and had been teaching Brynna since he was a little boy. Now, Brynna was almost as good as his father with the bow. In range of 250 meters he could hit almost everything. <br>
<br>
After getting permission Brynna and Argo were restless till supper. They ate as fast as they could so that they would be on time in the practice yard. There was nobody there as they arrived so they sat on some crates in a corner of the yard. After a few minutes the Arms-Master walked into the yard. He saw the boys but said nothing. He walked over to a door behind which was the weapons room. He took out a bunch of keys to open the door with. He disappeared inside for a few minutes. When he came back out he carried two quarterstaffs with padding on both sides against injuries.<br>
