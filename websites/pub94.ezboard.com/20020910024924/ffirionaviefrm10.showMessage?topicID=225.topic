<br>
&quot;It is a complete as there is nothing to find!&quot;  Tobon spoke sharply.<br>
<br>
I looked around the room.  We were the only ones save for the clockwork librarians.  &quot;You really can't expect for me to believe that my parents were merchants.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The truth is what you should believe.  Your parents were merchants who, regrettably, died and orphaned you at a young age.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stared at him in silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;See, this is why you are not as advanced as you could be.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;You are always too busy worrying about matters that are unimportant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lineage is not unimportant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not what I meant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what did you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, I'm sorry you had to grow up alone without any family, but why this sudden need to find out about them?&quot;<br>
<br>
I looked down at the table before I said a word.  &quot;I have met many these past few months and even joined a guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
As if to a question Tobon said.  &quot;Tinkers Pride.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  They...they kind of remind me of the family I never had.  When I originally came to you for any information on my parents you told me they had been merchants and sent me o Larkon who gave me the maps left by them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember.  We felt they would aid you in your journeys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And they have, but why would a merchant go to Mistmoor or Guk?  Why would there be information on the creatures and notes on their fighting techniques?&quot;<br>
<br>
I had him.  I knew I did but I dared not smile.  Not even a glimmeer or one.  The best thing now was to feel him out.  Wait for the next lie.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot;  he said, &quot;obviously your father had some trade routes through there or at the very least sold the information to would be adventurers.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could tell by the look on him face, in his eyes, that it was a lie.  Standing I leanded over the table and whispered.  &quot;I don't know why or what the Eldrich Collecitive is hiding from me, but  I will find out.  If not by you then by some other means.  How afraid are all of you of what I may stumble upon?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sit down!&quot;  He hissed looking around for eavesdroppers.  &quot;Okay, I will tell you and what I tell you is not to be repeated to anyone.  Understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I understand.&quot;  I said leaning forward.  &quot;I will not tell anyone what you tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have one known relative still alive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What!  Who?&quot;  I spoke astonished.<br>
<br>
He hesitated.  I could tell he was seriously thinking against telling me.  &quot;You...you have an uncle.  Your father's brother.  His name is Freddie Dooger...&quot;<br>

I had cast invis upon myself and crept through Steamfont past the dragon bones toward were he was rumored to reside.  One question pounded in my brain.  How do you confront the insane?   I didn't know and still didn't when I saw him.<br>
<br>
Feddie Dooger sat beside a fire warming his hands and humming a tune I remembred but could not place.  I know now which side of the family I get my poor musical ability.  He then began to fix his dinner of rat kabobs.<br>
<br>
I didn't know what to say or do so I did what I thought best...being straigtforward.  &quot;I've come for answers.&quot;<br>
<br>
With one swift motion he was on the other side of the campfire dagger in hand.  &quot;Who is there?&quot;  He said.  &quot;Who thinks they are tough?&quot;  Feddie's eyes darted back and forth and then soflty he spoke again almost in a whisper.  &quot;Who speaks on the wind?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't come to fight.  I came to talk.&quot;  I tried to sound brave.  I knew it didn't work.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not fight?&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;Then you will die.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you don't understand.  I...I am told I am your nephew.&quot;<br>
<br>
His face became puzzled as he straightened.  &quot;Jaroo?&quot;<br>
<br>
My heart sank.  I guess until that moment I thought it had been a lie and then I did something potectially stupid. I dropped my invisibility spell.  &quot;Yes, it's me uncle.&quot;<br>
<br>
He crouched were he stood and dropped his dagger.  &quot;Well bless my...&quot;  As he cut himself short he looked away, chuckled, and looked back at me through th fire grinning evilly.  It scared me, but not as much as his next words.  &quot;Hoped this day would come.  Meldrath may take you still.  Don't know...  You hav been killing Minotaurs.  Though not in a while.  I would know.&quot;  Feddie seemed to be talking to himself as he pointed to his eye.  &quot;I have been watching you.  Kept an eye on you I have!  Come and join me by the fire.  Let me get a better look at you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly I advanced and sat across from him.  &quot;What do you mean 'kept an eye on me'?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, yes.  Yes, I have.  Since you were a young one.  A young gnome.  Since they took you away from me.&quot;  His face turned into a scowl.  &quot;Since the Eldritch Collective came and took you away!  They did you know.  Before I got a chance to hand you to Meldrath.  Oh, he was not pleased.  Not pleased at all.<br>
<br>
He had a plan for you.&quot;  Feddie pointed at me, singed his finger in the flames, and stuck it in his mouth.  &quot;Did you know that?  A plan.  Don't know what it was though...&quot;  His voice trailed off, as he seemed to lose himself in thought.<br>
<br>
They idea of being raised by Minotaurs was hard to believe.  What kind of gnome would I have become?  We sat in silence for a while before I spoke.  &quot;What can you tell me of my parents?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Parents?  They are dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that, but what can you tell me about them?  What were they like?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you brave?&quot;  He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Am...I...well...&quot;  The question surprised me.  &quot;I suppose I am at times though fearful at others.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My brother, Tovar, was a very brave warrior.  Fierce in battle.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;Your mother, well, she was a wizard like yourself.&quot;  He sighed.  &quot;Kae was fearful of her own power.  Too fearful of what might happen.  It became their undoing at the end.  Her fears that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grew depressed but I had to know more. &quot;But what happened?  Please, tell me.  I need to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
He put his hands to his head as if to keep his head together.  A single tear ran down his cheek.  &quot;Meldrath sent me and a few others.  Me?  I?  Yes, I and a few others to collect you.  We did too.  Yes, yes, we did take you from them.  From their house by Elizerian Lake.  You did know right?  Oh, no matter really.  It has fallen and destroyed now.   I saw to that.  I could not bear the thought of...&quot;  Another tear rolled down his face.  &quot;Your mother would not cast any spells on whoever held you.  Not even root.  She was afraid you would be harmed.  When I left with you they were supposed to...to...  They were supposed to teleport away.  They should have teleported away.  I found out later that they had fallen.  My poor dear brother.&quot;  He sobbed.  &quot;My poor dear brother died because of my treachery!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And still you do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;  He stopped crying.  &quot;Of course. They would have died in vain then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But that makes no sense!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sense?  Of course it makes sense.&quot;  He said drying his eyes.  &quot;It is the Eldritch Collective that killed them.  Meldrath will tell you when you meet him.  They are the true evil ones in Ak'Anon.  It will be restored to its former glory.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Former glory?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why yes.  Surely they have not been able to destroy all evidence.  Look around and you will see.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well there are glowing arcane markings near where King Ak'Anon resides.  I always thought they looked a bit evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;King Ak'Anon?&quot;  Feddie spat in disgust.  &quot;A clockwork construct more like!  The Eldritch Collective saw to that and you know what he was?  Well you go find out if I lie to you or not.  You go find out if King Ak'Anon was a ncromancer or not when he was flesh and blood.  If Meldrath is really his brother.  Go!  Get away from me now!  I need my sleep and have done enough talking for tonight.&quot;  Feddie curled up in a ball by the fire.  He looked like a baby in need of his mother.<br>
<br>
As I left I heard him mumble repetitively and stopped to hear him better.  He said.  &quot;Tell m if the madness of Meldrath is real.  Tell me if the madness of Meldrath is real.  Tell me if the madness of Meldrath is real...&quot;<br>

Make it quick I'm busy.&quot;  Following his words the door quietly opened and Jaroo stepped thru the archway.  &quot;Ah, Mr. Dooger!  How nice to see you.  Back again from your travels are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo looked away clearly troubled.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it lad?&quot;  Tobon stood from his chair.  &quot;What is wrong?  Did something happen?&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly shaking his head Jaroo spoke in a barely audible whisper.  &quot;Not yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tobo's eyes grew wide.  &quot;What is that suppose to mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what to do...except give up.&quot;  He sat down in an empty chair and looked in his mentor's eyes but found he could not.  &quot;I've tried to be a good wizard.  I've tried to make you proud of me but it seems that I'm jut not...not suited for this life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you stop it!&quot;  Jaroo dropped his staff.  It hit the ground beside him making a loud noise.  &quot;These past few months I've been searching...for something.  I thought it would end when I found out about my family but it didn't.  It only made it worse.  I need a break from everything but it seems that no matter where I go what I do it is all the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what?&quot;  said Tabon.  &quot;You just going to hang up your staff, retire, and live the rest of your days in Ak'Anon?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm leaving.  I don't know when I will return.&quot;  Jaroo sighed deeply as if a burden had somehow been lifted.  &quot;I figure I would take some time and try to find who I really am.  Maybe live with the gnomes in Katta and learn their ways for a while.  Maybe...maybe get lost along the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you think that will help?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly, I really don't know at this point.&quot;  Jaroo looked up at him.  His eyes marked with tears.<br>
<br>
Tobon put a hand on the young gnomes shoulder.  &quot;You will be sorely missed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo was silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;What of your guild?  What of you friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They'll be alright.  I have to believe that.  There is an event that they are holding in a couple of day.  It will be the last time I see them before I go.&quot;  He stood, moved to the door, and stopped.  &quot;I wll never forget them.  I still remember the day I met Karizma at the mills, Sabbik at the bank when he gave me food and drink.  Zapoo fighting bandits in West Karana.  Halt, well, I also met her at the mills.&quot;  He smiled.  &quot;I remember all if not most of them.  Even giving Flippus his first bow over at crushbone.&quot;  Jaroo disappeared thru the doorway.<br>
<br>
Tobon watched as the door shut behind Jaroo.  It was a long while that he stood there stunned before he spoke.  &quot;Farewell my friend.  Safe journey to you.&quot;<br>

The little gnome received his shard and then sat down to memorize his needed spells.  The spells he used when traveling but not fighting.<br>
<br>
A few minutes passed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jaroo?&quot;  He heard his name and stood.  Karizma, one of his dearest freinds, ran up to him.  &quot;Jaroo, I'm glad I found you before you left.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grinned.  &quot;Wanting to see me off?&quot;<br>
<br>
She bonked him on the head.  &quot;Of course.  Sabbik told me you were taking the long way.  No self-ports just using your feet to get wherever your going.  If you would have told me I would have come here with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked away, smiled, and then looked back at her.  &quot;Well, I thought the party was enough.  I know my leaving is sudden and the party wasn't meant to be a going away thing, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you would have rather have said your goodbyes and leave without it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not at first.&quot;  He said.  &quot;I think I realized just how much I am going to miss all of you.  I almost decided not too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not that simple.&quot;  He said shaking his head.  &quot;There are a lot of things to work out.  Things I need some time away to figure out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Karizma sighed.  &quot;I'm not going to tell you I understand your reasons, but I trust you enough to know what you are doing.  I mean.  We practically grew up together.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he smiled.  &quot;Remember that time we deciced to hunt elementals?  It was around the time we met.  One started coming for us when we relized that they can only be hurt by magic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Karizma laughed, &quot;Didn't we run to the guards at the mills because of that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, we stayed and won.  We had the help of that enchanter we were friends with at the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yeah!&quot;  Remembered Karizma.  &quot;What was her name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ziskina.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What ever happened to her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know.&quot;  Jaroo shruged.  &quot;She just disappeared one day.&quot;<br>
<br>
They grew quit.  Karizma saw a pixie trickster fly by.  She stared at it as it disappeared into the forest.  &quot;Won't be long until the spires become active.&quot;  She spoke in an almost distant gloomy voice.<br>
<br>
Jaroo nodded following her gaze.  &quot;I should tell you something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What i it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Um,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;I was over near Ogguk one day and...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eww, why were you there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wrote on the side of their city wall:  Good time.  Mixie.  Gnome.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't!&quot;  She gasped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Jaroo laughed.  &quot;Then I went to Grobb and wrote:  For a Trollish good time.  Mixie the Gnome.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Nexue Scion chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't!  Oh, Jaroo, you know what will happen now.&quot;  Karizma laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm hoping they will find her so she won't bother you anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm laughing but if we get over run with Ogres and Troll saying:  Me want good time.  Me want good time. It' going to turn out real bad.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo contemplated.  &quot;Oh...um...I guess I should have thought  of that.&quot;<br>
<br>
They broke out into laughter.<br>
<br>
The Nexus Scion announced that the spires were about to become active.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; Karizma yelled.  &quot;It's too soon!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo stood and moved to the center of the spires.  &quot;Thank your brother Sabbik for telling you where I was.&quot;  He said as light surrounded him.  &quot;Don't forgt me, Kar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know I won't.&quot;  She waved with tears in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've been like a sister to me.  Alot of the Tinks have been like siblings.&quot;  He grinned one last time at her and vanished.<br>
<br>
Running to where he had stood she looked up as the blue spell energy shot up toward Luclin.  &quot;I'll never forget you Jaroo and I will always miss you.&quot;<br>

<br>
A Final Farewell?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Flippus lay on his sleeping bag staring up into the night sky. OtherWorld events had kept him from Jaroo's Farewell party and a hollow feeling began to grow in his gut. &quot;Bert? Do you think he knows that I'll miss him?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bertoxxulous sat a few feet away near the fire. He had assumed the form of a giant plague rat and was toasting a marshmellow over the flames. &quot;I must say Flippus, this emotion of &quot;missing him&quot; is quite unbecoming of a Servant of the Plaguebringer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flippus sighed. &quot;I know, but I didn't get to say Goodbye.&quot; The more Flippus thought about it, the sadder he felt. He could feel the tears start to build up. &quot;I really wish I could have been there. We could've drank a Gnomish Spirit together, he would have been so proud of me, even though I can't make them consistently yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Bertoxxulous began, &quot;you will see him again.&quot; trying to make the Gnome feel better.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe, but it won't be the same. You won't remember this, because I was still working for Brell at the time, but Jaroo and I used to hunt goblins and mermaids together. I have pictures of that at home.&quot; Flippus closed his eyes briefly as he recalled jumping off the boat and swimming behind Jaroo to the island in the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
Flippus quickly opened his eyes as a surge of magic rippled throughout the Steamfont. A flash of blue light shot into the night sky, streaking towards Luclin. Flippus watched it climb higher and higher and knew in his heart that it was Jaroo on his final journey. When the blue light finally disappeared against the pale surface of the moon, Flippus turned away from the fire and began to sob.<br>
<br>
Bertoxxulous watched the crying Gnome for a moment. He had a mind to scold him, tell him that practitioners of the Dark Arts didn't cry, but for some reason thought better of it. Maybe it was the marshmellows. <br>

Many had died and it was a miracle that he now lived.  Sure, he was injured, but that did not sway Twyll from his current dilemma.  They had told him to run.  Run to the city of Ak'Anon to warn the gnomes of what he had heard leaving them to fight.<br>
<br>
His limp if not the bloody gash in his arm was proof of his injuries, but the elf had to move on.  If he fell he knew he would not be able to stand again. Tired, the heat of the Steamfont did not help and he longed for the coolness of his forest home in Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
Whether illusion or not a small shape ahead of him appeared and as it moved closer he hoped and prayed it did not mean him harm.  To his relief it belonged to a gnome.  Twyll felt a smile form across his face and in his poor ability to speak gnomish he spoke in a rasp, &quot;Help.  Help me, please.&quot;  It proved too much for him as he fell to the ground unconscious.<br>
<br>
_________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Groggy Twyll slowly woke his arm numb not from pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, your finally awake I see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking he saw the gnome sitting beside him.  The little man seemed to keep a careful eye about them with nothing but a dagger in hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;I...I must.  Must get to Ak'Anon.&quot;  The elf said weakly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh?  You must rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  I may not make it.  Deliver a message for me.  At least to the guards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I may.&quot;  Said the gnome.  &quot;What is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The words were hard to speak at first.  The numbing in his arm seemed to be slowly spreading to other parts of his body.  Twyll was afraid he would die before he finished but that made him that much more determined to persist.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were at the Minotaur caves.  I had been elected to go in as scout.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What were you doing there?&quot;  The gnome asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please.  Please don't interrupt.  I may not finish.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome was silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had made it quit a ways in.  They seemed distracted.  It was easy to sneak past them.  I heard yelling ahead of me. My group had told me to not go too far.  I had to see.  Found Meldrath.  Yelling at Feddie.  Something about letting his nephew go away.  That they needed him back.  To help with fight.  To take over Ak'Anon soon.  He...he said.&quot;  Twyll coughed, spit up blood, and caught his breath before continuing.  &quot;The Asylum of the Mad.  Meldrath said it was time for it again.  That exile be over.  That...&quot;  His cough was worse this time.  Even thru the numbing it hurt his chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;There, there.&quot;  Said the gnome standing over him.  &quot;Let my poison run it's course.&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf gave a desperate look at the other as a coldness washed over him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, that's right.  Some of us believe in Meldrath and want him for our king.  The Asylum was never truly done away with.  It was only believed by the Eldritch Collective that it was.  For now die and know your last words were for nothing.  Jaroo will be found and brought back to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Twyll's eyes closed for the final time he heard nothing but laughter.<br>

Not a bored sigh but a sigh of calm.  He had half a bag of fish so far and at this point it seemed second nature to him.  He smiled at a passing thought of him memories of Norrath, frowned at another, then burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well there you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking up he saw Triblix Tikbok looking over the railing down at him.  Jaroo grinned.  &quot;Heya.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been looking all over Katta for you and find you here?  Should have known you were fishing.  Your always fishing.&quot;  Smiled the gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;It relaxes me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?  I would think I would be bored.  Well, takes all kinds I suppose. How you getting out of there anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
Laughing, Jaroo remembered an earlier visit before he decided to stay here.  He had become curiouse and jumped over the edge.  After swimming all over the area he found only one way out.  &quot;Gate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I guess it's safer then The Twilight Sea up ahead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Humm...maybe tomorrow.&quot;  Jaroo chuckled casting his line back into the water.<br>
<br>
Triblix gave him a wry grin.  &quot;Well before you go off doing anything else.  Come see me when you have a moment.  It can wait so finish what your doing.  There is no rush.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, I'll be there when I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
He saw Triblix disappear with only his fading footsteps sounding in the distance.  He sighed again, pulled in the line, and cast it back out.  Jaroo's mind wandered again.  He did not see the ripples over the water.  His scream was heard when the water broke and a shape jumped out and grabbed him.<br>
<br>
Triblix ran back and looked over the side in time to see a fishing pole slowly sliding into the watery depths a bag half full of fish beside it.<br>

He saw Manik Compolten with two guards at one of the doors and out of breath spoke hurriedly.  &quot;Where is he?  Let me see him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Manik nodded.  &quot;He doesn't seem to be doing very well.&quot;  Opening the door he followed the other in.<br>
<br>
Tobon saw a makeshift bed no doubt tinkered hurriedly with Jaroo laying on it unconscious or asleep, he couldn't tell which.  Digetha Chogaller looked up from beside the bed at Tobon with a sad look apparent on her face.  She stood and approached him.<br>
<br>
&quot;There doesn't seem to be much I can do.&quot;  She said.  &quot;My spells don't seem to be doing much good.  I've done the best I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tobon took a few steps toward the bed.  &quot;What happened?  Where was he found?&quot;<br>
<br>
Manik hesitated before speaking.  &quot;At the Minotaur cave. A group of my warriors were hunting there and saw him stumbling out.  They said he didn't look injured but he did seem sick.  They also said that they had to fight off a few of the Minotaurs to get to him.  Before slaying one of the slavers if was found out that Jaroo was escaping.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Escaping?&quot;  Tobon felt the word slip from his mouth.  &quot;But he was gone.  For over a month now.&quot;  He turned.  &quot;I don't...&quot;<br>
<br>
A cry of pain came from the bed.  Jaroo tensed up and shook.<br>
<br>
Digetha ran to him and cast a spell of healing.  &quot;He's been like this every so often.  It gets more infrequent so I think it is passing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo mumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's he saying?  Manik asked.<br>
<br>
Digetha leaned over him to hear him better.  Hearing one word a cold shiver ran past her.  &quot;He's saying 'Meldrath'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear lord.&quot; breathed Tobon.<br>
<br>
Manik gave a disappointed look at him.  &quot;You should never have told him about his parents.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I doubt that had anything to do with it.&quot; snapped Tobon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you would have at least told hi...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop it both of you!&quot;  Digetha yelled cutting Manik off. &quot;He'll be waking soon and hearing an argument will not help.  Go outside if you must.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm awake.&quot;  Jaroo sat up weak, looked over at them, and grinned.  &quot;Heya Tobon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tobon smiled back.  &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Weak though I can feel my strength returning.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you remember?  Tell us what happened.&quot;  Manik butted in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, would you let him have a moments peace?&quot;  Tobon snapped.<br>
<br>
&quot;What&quot; said Manik confused.<br>
<br>
Jaroo chuckled.  &quot;It's okay.  I'll tell you.  Meldrath had me kidnapped from Katta Castellum.  He wants me alongside my uncle Feddie to fight beside him against Ak'Anon.  Said that he would take steps to ensure that would happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you escape then?&quot; inquired Manik.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know.  The Minotaurs seemed to not be watching me too carefully, but when I ran they chased after me.  I'm not even sure what steps he was talking about.  Mostly it's a blur.  Like my mind won't remember.&quot;<br>
<br>
Manik looked thoughtful at the young gnome.<br>
<br>
&quot;What matters is that your safe.&quot;  Tobon smiled.  &quot;Will you be staying now that your back or leaving again?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jaroo's face became clearly marked with anger.  &quot;I don't see any way I can leave.  He will just come after me again.  Meldrath has been the bane of my family for my entire life.  He has been responsible for taking everything away from me.  I even thought at one point I would be able to save my uncle, but no, as long as Meldrath is around I cannot have any peace.  I was happy in Katta.  It was nice and it was relaxing and I will go back there, but not before I take down Meldrath.  I will do anything for that to happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
He jumped out of bed and headed to the door.  Manik stopped him.  &quot;Will you be continuing your wizard training?  If not you may do well under my tutelage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not a wizard any longer.&quot;  Jaroo said looking him dead in the eye.  &quot;Nor will I be a warrior.  What I do need is to fight with the ability to cast.&quot;  Continuing out the door he finished with.  &quot;Thanks for the offer though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well at least he's back.&quot;  Tobon said meekly breaking the silence that came over them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you need to go and see Iony, Tobon.  She told me she may know what has afflicted him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not over yet, Digetha?  I'll go right now.  Besides, it would be good to see Jaroo when he joins the church.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll join you.  We have some things to discus.&quot; said Manik not hearing Tobon's sigh as he followed him out the door.<br>

Tobon looked at her troubled.  &quot;How could I not?  You say you know what has afflicted my former pupil?&quot;<br>
<br>
She flashed a smile whick faded as soon as it appeared.  &quot;Yes.  I did not know what to make of his illness at first but then I remembered I had seen something similar years ago.&quot; she hesitated before beginning again.  &quot;Tell me.  Do you remember whn Feddie Dooger was exiled from our city?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why yes.  Yes I do, but what does...&quot;  Tobon paused.<br>
<br>
Manik looked at him and immediately felt a wave of trouble come over him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe that your young friend has been afflicted with the madness of Meldrath.  It was caught in time so as to not have a firm hold on him like it does his uncle, but we were not able to get rid of it all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean by 'firm hold'?&quot;  Manik blurted out.<br>
<br>
&quot;The madness seems to need a catalyst to fester.  It will spread like a disease until it consumes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tobon closed his eyes tightly and whispered.  &quot;No.  He...  Has he been here?&quot;  Tobon looked up at her realizing that he expected to see Jaroo.<br>
<br>
Iony gave a small sign of confusion.  &quot;No.  He has not.  Why do you ask?&quot;<br>

<br>
It took him awhile to pick his way past the skeletons and obsolete models but he finally found him.  Garret Zethog looked at him with a sneer.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm here to join.  I want you to teach me your ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Garret laughed at him.  &quot;You're a wizard aren't you?  Go away and bother me no longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  I am not wizard any longer.  I don't want that life anymore.  What I want...  What I need is revenge on my tormentors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly interested Garret squinted his eyes at him.  &quot;Oh?  and what 'tormentors' are these?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Meldrath.  I have a personal vendetta against him.  I wish for you to show me the way of killing him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Garret laughed again.  &quot;And make a dark night out of a wizard?  Heheh  Sounds like a bit of a challenge I'd say.  Okay, I'll teach ya, but expect a hard life.  We are not liked nor are we trusted.  I won't even trust you unil you prove yourself to me.&quot;<br>

Jaroo looked at him coldly.  His own eyes seemed to pierce the surrounding gloom with hatred.  &quot;Fine by me.  When do we start?&quot;<br>

I hated the pain but my blow was much more severe and managed to dodge the next attack.  It had been a close battle but its defeat was almost assured.  I was thankful that no plague rats were joined in this battle, but getting one in the mines would be near difficult.<br>
<br>
The skeleton finally fell.<br>
<br>
Looking over at Garret I saw a smile.  &quot;Very well done.  Not the best, but well done just the same.  You've come a long way in your training.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't answer him, but knew he was correct.  I had come a long way and had risen in the shadow knight ranks pretty good for someone who had been a wizard with little or no training in melee fighting.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm surprised you're still around actually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's that suppose to mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Garret laughed. &quot;I don't mean I'm surprised your still training.  I mean that I am surprised that you're still around this area.  Usually, gnomes with your training have journeyed away by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking away I breathed heavily.  &quot;I have my reasons and until then I won't leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To take on Meldrath you may need to obtain some more power than what this place can offer.  Your weapon and spells may not be enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do you suggest I do?  How do I know he won't come after me agian?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fearful are we?&quot;  Garret chuckled.  &quot;Go to Qeynos.  Visit where I trained.  Journey and explore.  You did it as a wizard and so what if your not liked or merely tolerated in most places now.  This place can't teach you everything you know.  You must go at some point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if I am fearful?&quot;  I hated to admit it but in a way I was.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are fearful then it is best to face your fears.  You're a shadow knight now.  Stop playing the coward and start acting like one!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your right, Garret.&quot;  I said looking at my Minotaur axe.  &quot;And I know just what fear to confront first.&quot;<br>
______________________________________________<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw your wizard leave.  How goes his training?&quot;  Eonis Mournunder said in a half sarcastic voice.<br>
<br>
Garret looked at the gnome and smiled.  &quot;It may amuse me, but not very good.  I doubt he will make it.  In fact I just told him to go and see the world.&quot;  He laughed.  &quot;I doubt he will survive to return.&quot;<br>

I stepped closer and griped my axe tight.  &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking at my white knuckles and my weapon Feddie's face grew angry.  &quot;What have you done?  That's a Minotaur axe!&quot;<br>
<br>
Giving him a grin I spoke slowly so he could completely understand.  &quot;I have been killing Minotaur's of course.  Now, I have come for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
His face turned to fright.  &quot;Me...  Why me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not?  Meldrath put a plan in motion to capture me twice.  Once a baby and once just recently.  The Minotaur's are his allies as are you.  Ya told me yerself that my parents were not ment to die but they did.  I will have my revenge on all of you.  You think you are spared because you are my uncle?  I don't care if you have been driven mad by Meldrath because you know what?

<br>
&quot;You... you don't understand!  I could have been your father.&quot; He pleaded cowering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't lie to me!&quot;   I said swinging my axe toward him.  He dodged and stood with dagger in hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't defeat me nephew.&quot;  Feddie said the fear in his voice clearly gone.<br>
<br>
I laughed at him.  If he didn't know already then he knew now that I have changed.  I was no longer the weak wizard who could barely survive a fight.  I was much more now and I was not about to be tricked by his words.<br>
<br>
We were evenly matched it seemed.  If not for my spell life tap  would'nt have survived, but in the end he fell. I didn't kill him. Maybe I should have but I had another plan.  Garret had been right.  I needed to face my fears and it was time to face another.<br>
<br>
Grabbing Feddie by the shoulder I shook him from unconsciousness.  His eyes slowly opened.  &quot;Now listen carefully 'uncle'.  I have a message that I want you to deliver to Meldrath.  You tell him that I am leaving this area for a while but when the time is right I will be coming for him.  Not today and certainly not tomorrow but soon and when that day comes one of us will die.  Either way or whatever happens I will be at peace o I don't care either way.  You understand this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Feddie slowly nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good, because I would hate to have to come back here and pin a letter saying the same thing to your corpse.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took his dagger and spit on him before leaving.  I felt much better.<br>
<br>

<br>
You have been a very good friend to me.  If not I may not have left this letter for you.  I regret that I can not give you any more information than what is contained here within and hope you that you do not devulge too much for fear that it could endanger myself and my family.  Yes, my family and that is why upon reading this letter Tobon will destroy it so as not to be read by others.<br>
<br>
My parents are alive!  I discovered this recently when confronted by Tobon and Manik who have been worried about my path toward the dark.  I was shocked, to say the least, to find out that my mother was 'stolen' away from my uncle by my father.  The thing was that uncle Feddie was not allied with Meldrath at the time but my father was. The two brothers fought over my mother and in the end Feddie had his mind twisted by Meldrath and my father had joined the Gemchoppers before quitting to marry my mother and settle down.<br>
<br>
I don't want to talk to much on this but it was they that saved me from Meldrath's clutches and handed me over to the Eldritch Collective before faking their deaths.  They left me behind because fleeing with a baby would be near impossible.<br>
<br>
So now I have a clue to their whereabouts and I will follow it until either it leads to them or not.  I do this incognito.  I do this in secret.  If Meldrath were to find out I fear he would come after all three of us.  If this were to happen it would tarnish a potential happy reunion.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about me.  The madness that is inside of me has subsided and been easier to control.  I know now that it feeds on my anger.  You may see me again yet, though probably not for a long time if I find them.  Send my best to your brother Sabbik and to all of those in Tinkers Pride as well as the Pirates.  Just don't tell them anything about the contents of this letter except that I'm away again.<br>
<br>
Your friend,<br>
<br>
Jaroo<br>
<br>
P.S. Thank Manik for telling you to see Tobon. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujaroodooger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaroo Dooger</A> at: 5/31/02 4:24:56 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=225.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=225.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=225.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=225.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=225.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=225.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
