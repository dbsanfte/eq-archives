We have all, at least those who have played a buffer/porter, had those tells.  They are frustrating.  The wife played a 58 druid on another server and got tells from people she didnt know for ports in other zones.  I would sit back and laugh.  She helped some and told others how that was completely inconsiderate of her RL time.  The ability to port/buff etc takes time.  Mana.  If people get the freebies good for them.  If they dont hey, it shouldnt be expected.  Scratchy and Eley our slave buffs everyone they can when they can when we are running through zones.  I do my small part in gifting/RPing some tasks/quests for lower characters to enhance the environment and make new friends.  The cool thing is that those people we have helped have levelled and are reciprocating with groups and quests etc.  <br><br>Karl is a good guy and Im sure he does more than his share.  Just hit the wall with anonymous beggers it sounds like.  No worries Karl, it doesnt end....lol.

I know that I would help my friends as much as possible.  <br><br>here is the question:<br><br>It's easy to turn down totaly strangers.  Like many of you have said, /ignore is just a few key stroks, but how do you tell your friends that you're busy?<br><br>Take my last night experience for example:<br><br>I setted a goal to hear that sweet ding sound last night, and I had approximatly three hours to achieve that last night before I had to log.  I logged on, happily ported my skinny elven ass (as Ichi often refered) to Skyfire, and headed towards Burning woods.  I found the hornets, setted myself up with buffs, and I was ready to kick some hornet's behind. <br><br>A tell came through with the following line &quot;hey, how you doing, buddy?  where are you?&quot;.  I told him that I was killing hornets and be right with him for a second.  He asked me to port him from WC to NK.  At this time, I was a bit miffed.  Surly he knew that I was in the middle of something (the phrase &quot;i'm killing hornets, be right with you&quot; should be a good hint), yet he still asked for my help.  It wasn't too bad, I just got started and it was only a &quot;few&quot; minute wasted of my limited 3 hours, so I gated to WC and ported him.<br><br>Then I ported, once again, my skinny elven hide back to SS and proceed with the same ritual once again.  By now it was already 40 min into the game, and I had only killed 4 hornets and went on a free port ride.  I got ready once again, got hornets in my line of sight, and boom! another tell came in.  &quot;whatcha doing, buddy?&quot;  I winced and hesitating to reply, but I could not bring myself to ignore the tell.  &quot;not much, just killing hornets&quot; I said.  Surly, another port request came in.  This time I just said &quot;er.. I'm rather busy right now.  Can we talk about this afterwards?&quot;.  I finished killing the hornets and med up.  Then I got a tell from the same person &quot;hey, are you coming or not?  We are waiting here whenever you're ready!&quot;  I was baffled by that tell because I did not remember saying &quot;sure, I'll port you when I'm done here&quot;.  But since I lacked the strength to correct him, I gated out and ported them.  No biggie.. ..just another few minute gone.  <br><br>Third time I came back to BW, it was already 1 hr 30 min into the game.  I've killed 8 hornets, got 2 bubs of blue, and still need 5 bubs to hit my next lvl.  I said to myself &quot;damn it...the next person that tells me that druids have it good with soloing and that we level much much faster than in group, I'll kill him!!&quot;.  As those thoughts wondered through my mind, another tell came in.  &quot;hey, you wanna go kill hill giants?&quot;  My mouth dropped open and replied &quot;hey, you forgot?  Hill giants are green to me now&quot;.  Now the reply i got was just absolutely sensational - &quot;I know, but it's safer if you're here.&quot;    .....<br><br>after that, I prompted typed /camp desktop, go make myself a cup of hot tea, popped in the Final Fantasy X into PS 2, and enjoy some quiet man v.s computer encounters - at least in FF X, i don't get port/buff/PL request every 30 min or so.<br><br>oh, I never hit my goal that night either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/20/02 3:19:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /rude people who sends tell for free buff/port/sow/PLing</span><hr size=1> Ya, it is hard with guildies and friends.

After repeating ourselves many times I was able to figure out what he needed and find the guy. He was hidden right by the zone line and he was a big ol' Ogre, green to me,  who desperately needed to be Camoflauged to get himself through Rivervale. No biggie, I SoWed him and Camo'd him and he made it through safely far as I know (I didn't have See Invis on at the time) and I got no further tells from him for any help).<br><br>Now I had no problem whatsoever in doing this for a stranger, even an evil, I won't get into Narie's personal beliefs about good and evil, but suffice to say, she is willing to help both out, as long as they don't try and convert her either way :P<br>But afterward, it did make me wonder how in the world this Ogre knew who I was and knew I was a Druid. I can't possibly imagine him seeing me first because he would've ran smack into guards if he'd have moved much further in.<br><br>Aelfwine and I have discussed this, since it happens to him too and it coud be one of two things. First, alot of people read these boards that don't post, and probably remember names and classes of people that post here. There are plenty of people on these boards I've never met in game but do know what their class is just by seeing their name. The second thing is reputation, this is a small server and just as people that are jerks get a reputation, people that are friendly and helpful get a reputation as being so as well.  Word gets around. I've never had a request made of me that bothered me, even SoW requests have always been polite and I tend to do drive-by SoWs and buffs same as Kimaya. <br><br>I think this may be why it's becoming such a problem for the original poster, he has often gone out of his way for people, when he has time, and his reputation of doing that has kinda come to bite him just a bit. Sad really, that a helpful person is getting pestered so much for doing good deeds.But going out of your way to help others when you have the time or it is an emergency, for some people means you are available 24/7. So far, I've been really lucky and have not had the problems he has.<br>Of course I'm not at group porting level yet, but to be honest, as much as I look forward to be able to drag Aelf around with me when I travel, I am kind of wary of it as well since I know so many other Druids that have had major problems in having this ability.  <p>Narie<br>The Bumbling Half Elf Druid <br>Now Debuting in her 26th season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/20/02 3:36:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /rude people who sends tell for free buff/port/sow/PLing</span><hr size=1> Borm wouldnt duel me /sigh....no fun for the ichi!!

Your time in leaving a camp(which you cant bind at now), going to where ever they are.

They can just as easily make it back to a nexxus portal and get there themselves.<br><br>No that isnt to say if you arent involved it would save them time but if you are busy, they are presumptious to assume that the crisis that they put themselves in takes precident over your game time.  <br><br>All-in-all if I ask and they say im busy I say cool.  ie rez.
